rome enrico palombara niccolo vicenze both papal legates prologue the young man stood on the steps adjusting his eyes to the shadows the torchlight flickering over the waters surface made the aisles of the great underground cistern look like some halfdrowned cathedral only the tops of the columns were visible holding up the vaulted ceiling there was no sound but the whispering of damp air and the faint echo of dripping somewhere out of sight bessarion was standing on the stone platform a few feet below him near the waters edge he did not look afraid in fact his handsome head with its wavy black hair showed the calm almost otherworldly repose of an icon was his belief really so allconsuming please god there was a way to avoid this even now the young man was cold his heart was pounding in his chest and his hands were stiff he had rehearsed all the arguments but still he was not ready he never would be but there was no more time tomorrow it would be too late he took another step down bessarion turned fear narrowing his features for an instant then the ease again as he recognized the intruder what is it he said a little sharply i need to speak to you he walked down the steps until he was on the level by the water a couple of yards from bessarion hands clammy he was trembling he would have given everything he possessed to avoid this what about bessarion said impatiently everything is in place what else is there to discuss we cant do it he said simply afraid in the wavering light bessarions expression was unreadable but the confidence in his voice was absolute did his faith his certainty of himself never falter its not about fear the young man answered hot blood overcomes that but it wont make us right if we are wrong but were not wrong bessarion said urgently one swift violence to save an age of slow decay into barbarism of the mind and the corruption of our faith weve been over all that im not talking about moral wrong i understand sacrificing the one to save the many he nearly laughed then choked on his own breath could bessarion understand the impossible irony of that i mean wrong in judgment he hated saying this michael is the right man you are not we need his skill to survive his cunning his ability to deal to manipulate to turn our enemies against each other bessarion was stunned even in these changing shadows it was clear in every line of his face and the angle of his head and shoulders you traitor it was a snarl of disbelief what about the church bessarion demanded would you also betray god this was as bad as he had feared bessarion saw nothing of his own incompetence to lead why had he not seen it sooner himself his hopes had blinded him and now he had no choice left his voice shook we wont save the church if the city falls but if we do what we plan to tomorrow then it will judas bessarion said bitterly he swung out wildly but stumbled when he met no resistance it was terrible like killing himself except that the alternative was unimaginably worse and there was no time to think shuddering his stomach sick he did it lunging at bessarion as hard as he could there was a splash as he hit the water then a cry of surprise the young man went in after him while bessarion was still dazed he found his head and grasped the thick curling hair with both hands twisting it and throwing all his weight to submerge him and hold him down under the cold clear water bessarion struggled trying to fight upward with nothing to stand on against a man leaner and stronger than himself and just as willing to sacrifice everything he had for a belief at last the splashing ceased silence washed in from the shadows beyond the aisles and the water became still again he crouched on the stones sick and cold but he was not yet finished he forced himself to stand aching as if he had been beaten he climbed back up the steps his face wet with tears one anna zarides stood on the stone pier and gazed across the dark waters of the bosphorus toward the lighthouse of constantinople its fires lit the sky with a great beacon outlined against the paling march stars it was beautiful but she was waiting for the dawn to show her the citys rooftops and one by one all the marvelous palaces churches and towers she knew must be there the wind was chill off the waves whose crests were only barely visible she heard the sound of them sucking and hissing on the pebbles far away on the promontory the first rays of daylight caught a massive dome a hundred two hundred feet high it glowed a dull red as if with its own inner fire it had to be the hagia sophia the greatest church in the world not only the most beautiful but the heart and soul of the christian faith anna stared at it as the light strengthened other rooftops grew clearer a jumble of angles towers and domes to the left of the hagia sophia she saw four tall slender columns like needles against the horizon she knew what they were monuments to some of the greatest emperors of the past the imperial palaces must be there too and the hippodrome but all she could see were shadows white gleams of marble here and there more trees and the endless roofs of a city larger than rome or alexandria jerusalem or athens she saw the narrow stretch of the bosphorus clearly now already growing busy with ships with an effort she made out the vast battlements of the shoreline and something of the harbors below them crowded with indistinguishable hulls and masts all riding the safe calm within the breakwaters the sun was rising the sky a pale luminescent arch shot with fire to the north the curved inlet of the golden horn was molten bronze between its banksa beautiful spring morning the first ferry of the day was making its way toward them worried once again how she would appear to strangers anna walked over to the edge of the pier and stared down at the still water in the shelter of the stone she saw her own reflection steady gray eyes strong but vulnerable face high cheekbones and soft mouth her bright hair was jaw length not dressed and ornamented like a womans and with no veil to hide it the ferry a light wooden boat big enough to carry half a dozen passengers was less than a hundred yards away now the oarsman was fighting the stiff breeze and the perverse currents treacherous here at the narrows where europe met asia she took a deep breath feeling the bandages tight around her chest and the slight padding at her waist that concealed her womans shape in spite of all her practice it still felt awkward she shivered pulling her cloak closer no leo said from behind her whats wrong she turned to look at him he was tall slendershouldered and roundfaced with hairless cheeks his brow was furrowed with anxiety the gesture the eunuch replied gently dont give in to the cold like a woman she jerked away furious with herself for making such a stupid mistake she was endangering them all are you still sure simonis asked her voice brittle its not too late toto change your mind ill get it right anna said firmly you cant afford mistakes anastasius leo deliberately used the name anna had chosen to take you would be punished for masquerading as a maneven a eunuch then i mustnt get caught she said simply she had known it would be difficult but at least one woman had succeeded in the past her name was marina and she had entered a monastery as a eunuch no one had known differently until after her death anna nearly asked leo if he wished to go back but it would be insulting and he did not deserve that anyway she needed to observe and mimic him the ferry reached the dock and the oarsman stood up with the peculiar grace of one accustomed to the sea young and handsome he threw a rope around the stanchion then stepped up onto the boards of the dockside smiling about to smile back anna remembered not to only just in time she let go of her cloak allowing the wind to chill her and the boatman passed by her to offer his hand to simonis who was older plumper and obviously a woman anna followed taking her seat in the ferry leo came last loading their few boxes which held her precious medicines herbs and instruments the oarsman took his place again and they moved out into the current anna did not look behind she had left everything that was familiar and she had no idea when she would see it again but it was only the task ahead that mattered they were far out into the current now rising sheer from the waterline like a cliff was the wreckage of the seawalls breached by the latin crusaders who had looted and burned the city seventy years ago and driven its people into exile she looked at it now soaring up as vast as if it had been built by nature rather than man and wondered how anyone could have dared to attack it never mind succeeded she held on to the gunwale and twisted in her seat to look left and right at the magnitude of the city it seemed to cover every rock face inlet and hillside the rooftops were so close they gave the illusion you could walk from one to another the oarsman was smiling amused at her wonder she felt herself coloring at her naivet√© and turned away they were now close enough to the city that she could see the broken stones the thready outlines of weeds and the darker scars of fire she was startled how raw it looked even though eleven years had passed since when michael palaeologus had led the people of constantinople back home from the provinces where they had been driven now anna too was here for the first time in her life and for all the wrong reasons the oarsman strained against the wash that rocked them hard as a trireme went past bound for the open sea it was highsided three tiers of oars dipping and rising water running bright from their blades beyond it were two other boats almost round men busy furling their sails scrambling to lash them fast enough so they could let down anchor in exactly the right place she wondered if they had come from the black sea and what they had brought to sell or trade in the shelter of the breakwaters the sea was calm someone somewhere laughed and the sound carried across the water above the slap of the waves and the cry of the gulls the ferryman guided their way to the quayside and bumped gently against the stones she paid him four copper folleis meeting his eyes for no more than a moment then rose and stepped ashore leaving him to assist simonis they must hire transport for the boxes then find an inn to offer them food and shelter until she could look for a house to rent and set up her practice she would have no help here no recommendations as she would have had from her fathers good name at home in nicea the ancient magnificent capital of bithynia across the bosphorus to the southeast it was only a days ride away yet constantinople was a new world for her apart from leo and simonis she was alone their loyalty was absolute even knowing the truth they had come with her she started along the worn stones of the quayside making a path between bales of wool carpets raw silk piles of crockery slabs of marble exotic woods and smaller bags that gave off the odors of exotic spices heavy in the air were also the less pleasant smells of fish hides human sweat and animal dung twice she turned around to make certain leo and simonis were both still with her she had grown up knowing that constantinople was the center of the world the crossroads of europe and asia and she was proud of it but now the babel of alien voices in among the byzantines native greek the teeming anonymous busyness of it overwhelmed her a barechested man with gleaming skin and a sack across his shoulders weighing him down bumped into her and muttered something before staggering on a tinker laden with pan and kettles laughed loudly and spat on the ground a turbaned muslim in a black silk robe walked by without a sound anna stepped off the uneven cobbles and crossed the street leo and simonis close behind the buildings on the landward side were four or five stories high and the alleys between them narrower than she had expected the smells of salt and stale wine were heavy and unpleasant and the noise even here made speaking difficult she led the way up the hill a little farther from the wharfside there were shops to left and right and living quarters above apparent from the laundry hanging from windows a hundred yards inland it was quieter they passed a bakery and the smell of fresh bread made her suddenly think of home they were still climbing upward and her arms ached from carrying her medical supplies leo must be even more exhausted because he had the heavier boxes and simonis carried a bag of clothes she stopped and let her case drop for a moment we must find somewhere for tonight at least to leave our belongings and we need to eat it is more than five hours since breakfast six simonis observed ive never seen so many people in my life do you want me to carry that leo asked but his face looked tired and he already had far more weight than either simonis or anna in answer simonis picked up her bag again and started forward a hundred yards farther they found an excellent inn that served food it had good mattresses stuffed with goose down and was furnished with linen sheets each room had a basin large enough for bathing and a latrine with a tile drain it was eight folleis each per night not including meals that was expensive but anna doubted others would be much cheaper she dreaded going out in case she made another mistake another womanish gesture expression or even lack of reaction in some way one error would be enough to make people look harder and perhaps see the differences between her and a real eunuch they ate a lunch of fresh gray mullet and wheat bread at a tavern and asked a few discreet questions about cheaper lodgings oh inland a fellow diner told them cheerfully he was a little grayhaired man in a worn tunic that came no farther than his knees his legs bound with cloth to keep him warm but leaving him unencumbered for work farther west you go cheaper they are you strangers here there was no point in denying it from nicea anna told him im from sestos myself the man gave them a gaptoothed grin but everyone comes here sooner or later anna thanked him and the following day they hired a donkey to carry their cases and moved to a cheaper inn close to the western edge of the city by the land walls not far from the gate of charisius that night she lay in her bed listening to the unfamiliar sounds of the city around her this was constantinople the heart of byzantium she had heard stories of it all her life from her parents and her grandparents but now that she was here it was so strange too big for the imagination to grasp but she would accomplish nothing by remaining in her lodgings survival demanded that in the morning she go out and begin the search for a house from which she could establish her practice in spite of her tiredness sleep did not come easily and her dreams were crowded with strange faces and the fear of being lost she knew from her fathers stories that constantinople was surrounded by water on three sides and that the main street named mese was y shaped the two arms met at the amastrianon forum and continued east toward the sea all the great buildings she had heard him speak of were along this stretch the hagia sophia the forum of constantine the hippodrome the old imperial palaces and of course shops with exquisite artifacts silks spices and gems they set out in the morning walking briskly the air was fresh food shops were open and at practically every corner bakeries were crowded with people but they had no time to indulge themselves they were still in the web of narrow streets that threaded the whole city from the calm water of the golden horn in the north to the sea of marmara in the south several times they had to stand aside to let donkey carts pass piled high with goods for market mostly fruit and vegetables they reached the wide stretch of mese street just as a camel swayed past them highheaded sourfaced and a man hurried behind it bent double under the weight of a bale of cotton the thoroughfare teemed with people in among the native greeks she saw turbaned muslims bulgars with closecropped heads darkskinned egyptians blueeyed scandinavians and highcheeked mongols anna wondered if they felt as strange here as she did as awed by the size the vitality the jumble of vibrant colors in the clothes on the shop awningspurples and scarlets blues and golds half shades of aquamarine wine red and rose pink wherever she looked she had no idea where to start she needed to make inquiries and learn something about the different residential areas where she might find a house we need a map leo said with a frown the city is far too big to know where we are without one we need to be in a good residential district simonis added probably thinking about the home they had left in nicea but she had willed to come almost as much as anna herself justinian had always been her favorite even though he and anna were twins simonis had grieved when he left nicea to come to constantinople when anna had received that last desperate letter about his exile simonis had thought of nothing but rescuing him at any cost it was leo who had had the cooler head and wanted a plan first and who had cared so much for annas safety as well it took them several more minutes to find a shop selling manuscripts and they inquired oh yes the shopkeeper said immediately short and wiry with white hair and a quick smile he opened a drawer behind him and pulled out several scrolls of paper he unrolled one of them and showed anna the drawing see fourteen districts he pointed to the loosely triangular shape drawn in black ink this is mese street going this way he showed them on the map theres the wall of constantine and west of that again the wall of theodosius all except district thirteen across the golden horn to the north thats called galata but you dont want to live there thats for foreigners he rolled it up and passed it to her that will be two solidi she was taken aback and more than a little suspicious that he knew she was a stranger and was taking advantage still she passed over the money they walked the length of mese street trying not to stare around them like the provincials they were row after row of merchants stalls lined the street they were shaded by canopies of every color imaginable tied tightly to wooden posts to anchor them against the wind even so they snapped loudly in every gust as if they were alive and struggling to get free in district one there were spice merchants and perfumers the air was redolent with their wares and anna found herself drawing in her breath deeply to savor them she had neither time nor money to waste but she could not help gazing at them lingering a moment to admire their beauty no other yellow had the depth of saffron no brown the multitoned richness of nutmeg she knew the medical values of all of them even the rarest but at home in nicea she had had to order them specially and pay extra for their freight here they were laid out as if they were commonplace theres plenty of money in this district simonis observed with a hint of disapproval more important theyll have their own physician already leo replied now they were among the perfumers shops and there were rather more women than in the other areas many of them clearly wealthy as custom required they wore tunics and dalmaticas from the neck almost to the ground and their hair was concealed by headdress and veil one woman walked past them smiling and anna noticed that she had darkened her brows very delicately and perhaps her lashes certainly there was red clay on her lips to make them look so vivid anna heard her laughter as she met a friend and together they tried one perfume after another their embroidered and brocaded silks stirred in the breeze like flower petals she envied their lightheartedness she would have to find more ordinary women and male patients too or she would never learn why justinian had been a favorite with the emperors court one day and an exile the next fortunate to have his life what had happened what must anna do to gain justice for him the following day by mutual agreement they left the mese and its immediate surroundings and searched farther into the side streets in little shops and in the residential districts north of center almost under the giant arches of the aqueduct of valens catching occasional glimpses of the light on the water of the golden horn beyond they were on a narrow street barely wide enough for two donkeys to pass each other when they came to a flight of steps up to the left thinking the height might give them a better sense of their bearings they began to climb the passage turned one way then the other anna nearly stumbled over the rubble on the steps without any warning the path ended abruptly and they were in a small courtyard anna was stunned by what lay around her all the walls were damaged some by holes where pieces had fallen out others by the black stains of fire the broken mosaic floor was scattered with stones and chips of tile and the doorways were choked with weeds the single tower left standing was pitted and dark with the grime of smoke she heard simonis stifle a sob and leo stood silent his face pale suddenly the terrible invasion of was real as if it had been only a few years ago not more than half a century other things they had seen made sense now the streets where houses were still derelict weedstrewn and rotting the occasional broken wharves she had seen from above the poverty in what had seemed to her first superficial look to be the richest city in the world the people had been back for over a decade but the wounds of conquest and exile were still raw underneath anna turned away imagined terror gripping her and making her body cold even in the sharp spring sunlight sheltered here from the wind where it should have been hot by the end of the week they had found a house in a comfortable residential area on a slope to the north of mese street between the two great walls from several of the windows anna could see the light on the golden horn a glimpse of blue between the rooftops that gave her a moments wild illusion of endlessness almost as if she could fly it was a small house but in good repair the tiled floors were beautiful and she particularly liked the courtyard with its simple mosaic and the vines that climbed onto the roof simonis was satisfied with the kitchen although she made a few disparaging remarks about its size but anna could see by the way she poked into every corner and touched the furniture with its marble surfaces the deep basin and the heavy table that she liked it there was a small room for storage of grains and vegetables racks and drawers for spices and like all the rest of the better parts of the city access to plenty of clean water even if it was a little salty there were enough rooms to have a bedroom each a dining room an entrance hall for patients to wait in and a room for consulting there was also another room with a heavy door to which leo could attach a lock and where anna could keep herbs ointments unguents and tinctures and of course her surgical blades needles and silks in here she placed the wooden cabinet with its dozens of drawers into which she put the herbs she had each one labeled and including one whole leaf or root so one could not be mistaken for another but in spite of the discreet notice she put at the front of the house stating her profession patients would not come to her she must go out and seek them let people know of her presence and her skills so it was at midday that she stood on the step of a tavern in the hard sunlight and the wind she pushed open the door and went inside she walked through the crowd and saw a table with one empty chair the rest were filled with men eating and talking excitedly at least one was a eunuch taller longarmed softfaced his voice too high with the strange altered tone of his gender may i take this seat she asked it was the eunuch who replied inviting her in perhaps he was pleased to have another of his kind a waiter came and offered her food cut pieces of roast pork wrapped in wheat bread and she accepted thank you she said i have just moved in the house with the blue door straight up the hill my name is anastasius zarides i am a physician one of the men shrugged and introduced himself ill remember if i am ill he said goodnaturedly if you stitch up wounds you might stay around therell be business for you when weve finished arguing she was uncertain how to reply not sure if he was joking or not she had heard raised voices from the doorway as she came in i have needle and silk she offered one of the others laughed youll need more than that if were invaded how are you at raising the dead ive never had the nerve to try she replied as casually as she could isnt that more of a job for a priest they all laughed but she heard a hard bitter sound of fear in it and realized the power of the undercurrents she had barely listened to before in her own urgency to find a house and begin a practice what kind of a priest one of the men said harshly orthodox or roman eh which side are you on im orthodox she said quietly answering because she felt compelled to say something silence would be deceit then you better pray harder he told her god knows well need it have some wine physician anna held out her glass and found her hand was shaking quickly she put the glass on the table thank you when the glass was full she held it up forcing herself to smile heres to your good health except for perhaps a slight skin rash or the occasional hives im good at that for a small sum they laughed again and lifted their glasses two anna called upon her neighbors one by one introducing herself and her profession several of them already had physicians they chose to consult but she had expected that she told them that she specialized in complaints of the skin especially burns and of the lungs then left without pressing the issue she also shopped for various household items of as good a quality as she could afford buying them from smaller shops within two or three streets of her house here she also introduced herself and told them of her own skills for the favor of recommending their wares they were willing to recommend her to their customers in the second week she gained only two consultations and they were for ailments so slight as to require only a simple potion to ease itching and heat after the busy practice she had inherited from her father in nicea it seemed so small she had to struggle to keep up her spirits in front of leo and simonis the third week was better she was called to an accident in the street in which an elderly man had been knocked over and his legs badly scraped the boy who came for her described the damage vividly enough that she knew what lotions and ointments to take with her and herbs for shock and pain within half an hour the old man felt markedly better and by the following day he was speaking her praises word spread in the succeeding days the number of patients tripled now she could no longer put it off she must begin to search for information the obvious place to begin was with bishop constantine through whose help justinian had sent his last letter he had written of the bishop many times previously telling her of his loyalty to the orthodox faith his courage in the cause of resistance against rome and his personal kindness to justinian then a stranger in the city justinian had also mentioned that constantine was a eunuch and that was what made anna nervous now she stood in her medicine room amid the familiar odors of nutmeg musk cloves and camphor and her hands were clenched every mannerism every gesture must be right even the slightest deviation would raise constantines suspicion and invite closer scrutiny more errors would be seen she might even be perceived to be mocking him she found leo in the kitchen where simonis was setting the midday meal on the table wheat bread fresh cheese greens and lettuce dressed with squill vinegar as prescribed for april all months had rules for what should be eaten and what should not and simonis was well versed in them leo turned as she came in and put down the tools he was using to mend the hinge of the cupboard she had realized since they moved in just how many skills he had in every practical work it is time i went to see bishop constantine she said quietly but before i do i need one more lesson please as a woman she could have practiced medicine only on female patients and would have been able to learn very little about justinians life here all the myriad small things he had not told her in spite of their many letters but as a eunuch she could go anywhere another consideration of less importance but still heavy in her mind was that she did not want the pressure to marry again she was a widow and even though she could sometimes think of eustathius without rage or pain it would be impossible to take another husband you try too hard to be like a man leo said there are many kinds of eunuchs depending on the time of castration and the degree some of us castrated late are nearly men but with your slender build and soft skin and voice you are pretending to be one castrated in childhood you must get it exactly right or you will draw attention to yourself she watched him as he moved about the room he was tall and slight a little stooping as the years caught up with him but surprisingly strong his thin hands could break wood she could not even bend he walked with a peculiar grace neither male nor female she must copy that gait the way you bend leo was saying to her like this he demonstrated moving easily not like that he bent a trifle sideways like a woman she immediately saw the difference and cursed her own carelessness and your hands you dont use them enough when you are speaking look like this he gestured eloquently his fingers graceful and yet oddly not feminine she copied experimentally simonis was watching her dark once handsome face creased with anxiety was she also afraid she must see the differences between anna and leo the faults your food will spoil she said dryly her call for them to eat the meal she had prepared so carefully afterward anna rose and went to put on her outdoor robe it was chilly and raining slightly but it was less than a mile to the bishops house just the other side of the wall of constantine near the church of the holy apostles walking quickly along the streets she was aware of the occasional glimpse of light gleaming on the water below an elderly servant let her in he informed her gravely that bishop constantine was presently occupied but he was expecting her and would receive her as soon as he was free the servants face was bland smooth and beardless he regarded her completely without interest she waited in a great room with a mosaictiled floor and ochercolored walls two magnificent icons were almost luminous in the somber light one was of the virgin mary all in blues and golds inside a jeweled frame the other of christ pantocrator in warm ochers and browns and dark burnt umber a slight movement caught her eye and she turned from the icons quiet intense beauty and looked through the archway to a brighter room and beyond it an inside court the large palerobed figure of the bishop stood in the reflected sun there was a smile on his face as he extended his hand to the woman who knelt before him her dark cloak pooling on the floor around her her hair caught up in an elaborate coil her lips touched his fingers almost covering the gold ring with its jewel for a moment the scene was like an icon itself an image of forgiveness stamped on eternity the peace of it gripped anna with a shaft of pain she ached to kneel and seek absolution also to feel the weight lift and free her let her draw the sweet air into her lungs but that was impossible the woman rose and the vision splintered and fell apart she was annas age and her face was wet with tears of relief constantine made the sign of the cross and said something that was inaudible from this distance the woman turned and went out by another doorway anna moved forward it was time for the first important lie if she could pass this test a thousand more lay ahead constantine welcomed her smiling anastasius zarides your grace she said deferentially physician lately come from nicea welcome to constantinople he replied warmly his voice was deeper than that of most eunuchs as if he had been castrated well after puberty his face was smooth and beardless his strong jaw becoming a trifle jowly his light brown eyes were sharp how may i be of help to you he was courteous but as yet without interest she had the lie well practiced a distant kinsman of mine justinian lascaris wrote to me that you had been of great help to him in a time of difficulty she began then i did not hear from him again and there are disturbing rumors of some tragedy but i do not dare to pursue them in case i bring him further trouble she shivered in spite of the warmth in the room he was looking at her face and the way she stood her hands loosely at her sides as a woman would stand deferentially she raised her hands in front of her and then did not know what to do with them and let them fall again how much did the bishop know about justinian that his parents were dead that he was a widower she must be careful his sister is anxious that at least was true constantines large face was grave and he nodded slowly i am afraid i have not good news for her he replied justinian is alive but in exile in the desert beyond jerusalem she contrived to look shocked but why what has he done to warrant such a punishment constantine compressed his lips he was accused of complicity in the murder of bessarion comnenos it was a crime that shocked the city bessarion was not only of noble birth but regarded by many as something of a saint justinian was fortunate not to be executed annas mouth was dry and she found it hard to draw breath the comneni had been emperors for generations before the lascaris and now the palaeologi that was the difficulty with which you helped him she said as if it were a deduction but why would justinian be accomplice to such a thing constantine considered for a moment are you aware of the emperors intention to send envoys to mediate with the pope in little more than a years time he asked unable to conceal the edge from his voice that betrayed his emotions they clearly lay harsh and close to the surface like a womans feelings as a eunuchs were said to be i have heard whispers here and there she answered i hoped that it was not true it is true he rasped his body stiff his pale strong hands halfraised the emperor is prepared to capitulate on everything in order to save us from the crusaders whatever the blasphemy involved she was aware that in spite of his passion constantine was watching her intently the blessed virgin will save us if we trust in her she replied as she has done in the past constantines fine eyebrows rose are you so new to the city you have not seen the stains of the crusaders fires seventy years ago anna swallowed her mind made up if our faith then had been unblemished i am mistaken she replied i would rather die faithful than live having betrayed my god to rome you are a man of conviction constantine said a slow sweet smile lighting his face she returned to her first question why would justinian assist anyone to kill bessarion comnenos he did not of course constantine replied regretfully justinian was a fine man and as much against the union with rome as bessarion was there were other suggestions the truth of which i dont know what suggestions she remembered her deference just in time and lowered her eyes if you can tell me who is justinian suspected of helping and what happened to him constantine lifted his hands higher it was an elegant gesture and yet disturbing in its lack of masculinity she was sharply aware that he was not a man but not a woman either yet still a passionate and highly intelligent being he was what she was pretending to be antoninus kyriakis his voice cut across her thoughts he was executed he and justinian were close friends and you saved justinian her voice was hoarse no more than a whisper he nodded slowly allowing his hands to fall i did the sentence was exile in the desert she smiled at him the warmth of her gratitude burning through thank you your grace you give me great heart for the struggle to keep faith he smiled back and made the sign of the cross she went out into the street in a turmoil of emotions fear gratitude dread of what she might find in the future and in them all a powerful awareness of constantine strong generous firm in a clean and absolute faith of course justinian had not murdered this bessarion comnenos although there were marked physical differences between them in coloring and balance of features justinian was her twin brother anna knew him as well as she knew herself he had written to her in the last desperate moments before being taken into exile and told her that bishop constantine had helped him but not why or in what way now her whole purpose was to prove his innocence she quickened her pace up the incline of the cobbled street three after anastasius zarides had left constantine remained standing in the ochercolored room this physician was interesting and could very possibly prove an ally in the upcoming battle to defend the orthodox faith from the ambitions of rome he was intelligent subtle and clearly well educated with its uncouth ideas and love of violence rome could offer nothing to someone like that if he had a eunuchs patience suppleness of mind and instinctive understanding of emotion then the brashness of the latins would be as revolting to him as it was to constantine himself but the questions he had asked were troubling constantine had assumed that with antoninuss execution and justinians exile the matter of bessarions murder was closed he walked back and forth across the colored floor justinian had mentioned no close kinsmen but then one did not often speak of cousins or those even further removed if constantine were not careful the questions could become awkward but it should be easy enough to deal with them no one else knew constantines part or why he had helped or asked for mercy and justinian was safely in judea where he could say nothing anastasius zarides might be useful if in fact he was a skilled physician having come was from nicea a city known for its learning he would have had even better opportunity to mix with jews and arabs and perhaps acquire a little of their medical knowledge constantine disliked admitting it even to himself but such people were sometimes more skilled than the physicians who adhered strictly to christian teaching that all illness was a result of sin if anastasius had greater skills sooner or later he would gain more patients when people are ill they are frightened when they fear they are dying sometimes they tell secrets they would otherwise keep he spent the rest of the afternoon on church business seeing priests and petitioners for one sort of grace or another guidance or a leniency an ordinance performed a permission granted as soon as the last one was gone his mind returned to the eunuch from nicea and the murder of bessarion there were precautions to take in case the young man pursued his questions about justinian elsewhere constantine had imagined that there was no danger left but he needed to be certain after donning his outdoor cloak over his silk tunic and brocaded and jeweled dalmatica he went into the street he walked quickly up the slight incline raising his eyes to the massive twotiered aqueduct of valens that towered up ahead of him it had stood there for over six hundred years bringing millions of gallons of clean water to the people of this region of the city it pleased him just to look at it its great limestone blocks were held in place by the genius of its engineering rather than mortar it seemed indestructible and timeless like the church itself held upright by truth and the laws of god bringing the water of life to its faithful members he turned left into a quieter street and went on upward wrapping his cloak more tightly around himself he was going to see helena comnena bessarions widow just in case anastasius zarides should think to do the same she could be the weak link among those left it had stopped raining but the air was damp and by the time he reached her house he was spattered with mud and his legs ached he was getting to an age and a weight when hills were no longer a pleasure he was shown through the large austere entrance hall and on into an exquisitely tiled anteroom while the servant went to inform his mistress of the bishops arrival from the distance he heard the murmur of voices then a womans rich laughter not a servantit sounded too free for that it had to be helena herself someone else must be here it would be interesting to know who the servant returned conducted him along a passage to another door announced him and then stood back on the way in constantine was passed by a woman servant leaving carrying a magnificent perfume bottle it was bluegreen glass with gold around the rim set with pearlsperhaps a gift from the caller who had made helena laugh helena herself stood in the center of the floor she was beautiful in an unusual way quite small and shortwaisted the curves of her bosom and hips were enhanced by the way her tunic was clasped at the shoulder and tied with its girdle she wore few ornaments in her dark luxurious hair and no jewelry since she was still officially mourning her husband she had remarkably high cheekbones and a delicate nose and mouth under her winged eyebrows her eyes brimmed with tears she came forward to meet him with somber dignity how kind of you to come your grace it is a strange and lonely time for me i can only imagine how desolate you must be he replied gently he knew exactly what she had felt for bessarion and far more of the details of what had happened to him than she had any idea but none of that would ever be acknowledged between them if there is any comfort i can offer you you have but to ask he continued bessarion was a good man and loyal to the true faith it is a double blow that he should be betrayed by those he trusted she raised her eyes to his i still can hardly believe it she said huskily i keep hoping that something will arise to prove that neither of them was really guilty i cannot believe it was justinian not on purpose there is some mistake what could that be he asked because he needed to know what she might say to others she gave a tiny delicate shrug i have not even thought so far it was the answer he wanted other people may ask he said quite casually helena lifted her head her lips parted as she drew in her breath the fear was there in her eyes only long enough for him to be certain of it then she masked it perhaps i am fortunate in not knowing anything there was no lift of question in her voice and try as he might he could not read her face yes he agreed smoothly i will be comforted knowing that you are quite safe from that added distress in your time of mourning there was understanding bright in her eyes and then it was gone again replaced by the calm almost blank stare you are so kind to have called your grace remember me in your prayers always my child he promised raising his hand piously you will never be far from my thoughts he felt certain that helena was not foolish enough to speak too freely to the nicean eunuch should anastasius call and seek further knowledge from her but as constantine went out into the brightening sun and the slight wind off the sea he was equally sure that she knew more than he had supposed and that she would be willing to use it for her own ends who had made helena laugh so freely and given her the exquisite perfume bottle constantine wished he knew four anna went out of her way to speak to neighbors prepared to waste time in conversation about the weather politics religion anything they wanted to discuss cant stand here any longer one man said finally it was paulus a local shopkeeper my feet are so sore i can hardly get them in my shoes perhaps i can help anna offered just let me sit down he said grimacing im a physician perhaps i can offer a more permanent solution with his face reflecting disbelief paulus followed her walking gingerly along the uneven stones until they covered the fifty yards to her house once inside she examined his swollen feet and ankles the flesh was red and obviously painful to the touch she filled a bowl full of cold water and put an astringent herb in it paulus winced as he put in his feet then she saw his muscles slowly relax and the sense of ease come into his face it was more the chill than anything else taking the burning out of his skin what he really needed was to change his diet but she knew she must be diplomatic about telling him so she suggested he might care for rice boiled with seasoning and should abstain from all fruit except apples if he could find some that had been stored and were fit to eat at this time of year and plenty of spring water she added it must be spring not lake river well water or rain water he said with disbelief yes the right water is very good for you come back any time you wish to and i will bathe your feet in herbs again would you like some herbs to take with you paulus accepted them gratefully and paid from the purse he carried with him she watched him hobble away and knew he would return paulus recommended her to others she continued to visit the shops within a mile or so of her house always speaking to the shopkeeper and to other customers as the opportunity arose she did not know how far to indulge her own tastes as a woman she had loved the feel of silk next to her skin the soft way it slid through her fingers and pooled on the floor as if it were liquid now she held up a length letting it slither through her hands watching the colors change as first the warp caught the light then the weft blue turned to peacock and to green red turned to magenta and purple her favorite was a peach burning into flame in the past she had worn silks to complement the tawny chestnut of her hair perhaps she could still wear them vanity was not specifically feminine nor was the love of beauty the next time she had a new patient and earned more than two solidi she would come back and buy this one she stepped out into the brisk wind blowing up from the shore walking along the narrow street she moved aside for a cart to pass the cool touch of silk had brought back the past with a rush she measured her steps carefully on the incline the street was one of the many still unmended after the return from exile there were broken walls and windowless houses still dark from the fires the desolation made her own loneliness overwhelming she knew why justinian had come to constantinople and had been helpless to stop him but what passions and entanglements had he become involved in that led him to being blamed for murder that was what she needed to know could it have been love unlike her he had been happy in his marriage a small part of anna had envied him that but now she had to swallow the hard choking grief that all but closed her throat she would give anything she possessed if she could get that happy life back for him all she had had was medical skill and it had not been enough to save justinians wife catalina the fever had struck and two weeks later she was dead anna mourned because she had loved catalina too but for justinian it was as if his wife had taken the light from him with her when she departed anna had watched him and ached for his pain but all the old closeness of heart and mind they shared was insufficient to touch his loss with healing she had seen him change as if he were slowly bleeding to death he looked for reasons and answers in the intellect as if he dared not touch the heart he combed the doctrine of the church and god eluded him then two years ago on the anniversary of catalinas death he had announced that he was going to constantinople unable to reach his pain anna had stood by and let him leave he had written frequently telling her of everything but himself then had come the last terrible letter scrawled in haste as he was leaving in exile and after that only silence it was the beginning of june and she had been in the city two and a half months when basil first came to her as a patient he was tall and lean with an ascetic face now pinched with anxiety as he stood in her waiting room he introduced himself quietly and said that he had come on pauluss recommendation she invited him into the consulting room and inquired after his health watching him carefully his body was curiously stiff when he spoke and she concluded that his pain was more severe than he was admitting she invited him to sit and he declined preferring to remain standing she concluded that his pain was in the lower stomach and groin where such a change in position would increase it after asking his permission she touched his skin which was hot and very dry then tested his pulse it was regular but not strong i recommend that you abstain from milk and cheese for several weeks at least she suggested drink as much spring water as you are able to take its all right to flavor it with juice or wine if you prefer she saw the disappointment in his face and i will give you a tincture for the pain where do you live his eyes opened in surprise you can come back every day the dose must be exact too little will do no good and too much will kill you i have only a small amount in supply but i will find more he smiled can you cure me it is a stone in your bladder she told him if it passes it will hurt but then it will be over thank you for your honesty he said quietly i will take the tincture and come back every day she gave him a tiny portion of her precious theban opium sometimes she mixed it with other herbs such as henbane hellebore aconite mandragora or even lettuce seed but she did not wish him to fall into unconsciousness so she kept it pure basil returned regularly and if she had no other patients he often remained for a little while and they talked he was an intelligent man of obvious education and she found him interesting and likable but beyond that anna hoped to learn something from him she broached the subject at the beginning of the second week of his treatment oh yes i knew bessarion comnenos he said with a slight shrug he cared very much about this proposed union with the church of rome like everyone else he hated the thought of the pope taking precedence over the patriarch here in constantinople apart from the insult and our loss of selfgovernance it is so impractical any appeal for permission advice or relief would take six weeks to get to the vatican however long it required for the matter to reach the popes attention and then another six weeks to get back by that time it could be too late of course she agreed and there is the question of money we can ill afford to send our tithes and offerings to rome he groaned so sharply that for a moment she was afraid his pain was physical he smiled with apology we are in our own city again but we balance on the brink of economic ruin we need to rebuild but we cannot afford to half our trade has gone to the arabs and now that venice has robbed us blind of our holy relics the pilgrims scarcely bother with us anymore they sat in the kitchen she had made an herbal infusion of mint and camomile and they were sipping it because it was still hot added to which he went on there is the major issue of the filioque clause which is the real sticking point rome teaches that the holy spirit proceeds from both the father and the son making them both equally god we believe passionately that there is only one god the father and to say otherwise is blasphemy we cannot condone that and bessarion was against it she asked although it was barely a question why would anyone think justinian had killed him it made no sense he had always been orthodox profoundly basil agreed bessarion was a great man he loved the city and its life he knew that union with rome would pollute the true faith and eventually destroy everything we care about what was he going to do about it she said tentatively if he had lived basil shrugged slightly im not sure that i know he spoke well but he did little enough it was always tomorrow and as you know tomorrow did not come for him i heard he was murdered she found it difficult to say the words basil looked down at the table and his bony hands holding the cup of mint infusion yes by antoninus kyriakis he was executed for it and justinian lascaris too she prompted was there a trial he looked up of course justinian was sent into exile the emperor himself presided it appears justinian helped antoninus dispose of the body so it might look like an accident actually i imagine they thought it would never be found she swallowed how did he do that how can a body not be found at sea bessarions body was discovered tangled in the ropes and nets of justinians boat but that could have been without his knowledge she protested perhaps antoninus didnt have a boat and simply took one they were close friends basil replied quietly antoninus would not have implicated a man he knew so well when there were any number of other boats he could have taken it made no sense to anna was justinian a man to leave evidence like that condemning himself she knew the answer she would never have made such a mistake and neither would he are they even sure antoninus was guilty why would he kill bessarion basil shook his head i have no idea perhaps they quarreled he fell overboard and panicked it can be difficult trying to help someone who is thrashing around they become as much a danger to others as they are to themselves anna had a vision of justinian losing his temper striking more forcefully than he had intended he was strong bessarion could have overbalanced he would flail around in the water and be pulled down gasping crying out drowning had justinian panicked not unless he had changed beyond all recognition from the man she had known he had never been a coward and if he had intended to kill bessarion then he would not have cut the ropes he would have stayed all night and found the body then tied weights to it and rowed far out in the bosphorus and let it sink forever she felt a sudden sense of release it was the first tangible evidence to grasp she had facts and even if she could not use them yet they showed her brothers innocence irrefutably to her it sounds like an accident she pointed out its possible basil conceded perhaps if it had been anyone else they would have taken it as such why not for bessarion basil made a slight gesture of distaste bessarions wife helena is very beautiful justinian was a handsome man and while he was religious he was also imaginative articulate and had a dry and sharp sense of humor he was a widower and therefore free to follow his inclinations where they led him i see anna was a widow and held a hollow pain of loss inside her too but it was different eustathiuss death had been both a guilt and a release he had been of good family wealthy a soldier of courage and skill his lack of imagination bored her and eventually made her find him repugnant and he had been brutal she still felt nausea rise inside her at the memory the emptiness within seemed as if it would fill her until it burst through her skin she was incomplete maybe as much as the eunuch she pretended to be you think that justinian cared for helena she asked incredulously is that what people are saying no basil shook his head not really i should think a quarrel that got out of hand is more likely after he had gone she examined her herb and general medicine store she needed more opium theban was the best but it was imported from egypt and not easily obtained she might have to settle for second quality she also needed more black hyoscyamus mandragora juice of climbing ivy she was low in such ordinary herbs as nutmeg camphor attar of roses and a few other of the common remedies the following morning she set out to find a jewish herbalist whose name she had heard recommended like all jews he lived across the golden horn in district thirteen galata she took as much money as she could afford to spend and set out for the shore since having basil as a patient she was much better off than previously it was hot already even this early in the day it was not a long walk and she enjoyed the sound and bustle as people unloaded donkeys from the days trade there was a pleasant smell of baking in the air and the salt breath up from the water at the harbor she waited until there was a taxi going across to galata that she could share and fifteen minutes later she was on the northern shore here it was even more rundown than the main city houses were in need of repair windows were paned haphazardly with whatever was to hand the shabbiness of poverty touched every street corner and she saw people in unembroidered cloaks and tunics and of course few horses jews were not allowed to ride them after a few inquiries she found the small discreet shop of avram shachar on the street of the apothecaries she knocked on the door it was opened by a boy of about thirteen slender and dark his features semitic rather than greek yes he said politely caution edging his voice her fair skin chestnut hair and gray eyes would tell him she was unlikely to be of his own people her robes and beardless face could belong only to a eunuch i am a physician she replied my name is anastasius zarides i came from nicea and i need a supplier of herbs of wider origin than usual avram shachars name was given me the boy opened the door wider and called out for his father a man appeared from the back of the shop he was perhaps fifty his hair streaked with gray his face dominated by dark heavylidded eyes and a powerful nose i am avram shachar how can i help you anna mentioned the herbs she was short of adding also ambergris and myrrh shachars eyes lit with interest unusual needs for a christian doctor he observed with humor he did not say that christians were not allowed to seek treatment from jewish physicians except with the special dispensation that was frequently granted to the rich and the princes of the church but his eyes said that he knew it she smiled back she liked his face and the sharp yet delicate odors of the herbs brought back memories of her fathers rooms suddenly she was achingly lonely for the past come in shachar invited mistaking her silence as reluctance she followed him as he led the way to the back of the house and into a small room opening onto a garden cupboards and chests of carved wood lined three walls and a worn wooden table stood in the center with brass scales and weights and a mortar and pestle there were pieces of egyptian paper and oiled silk in piles and longhandled spoons of silver bone and ceramic set neatly beside glass vials from nicea shachar repeated curiously and you come to practice in constantinople be careful my friend the rules are different here i know she answered i use themshe indicated the cupboards and drawersonly when necessary to heal ive learned all my saints days appropriate to every illness and every season or day of the week she looked at him searching his face for disbelief she knew too much anatomy and far too much of arabic and jewish medicine to believe as christian doctors did that disease was due solely to sin or that penitence would cure it but it was not something the wise said aloud there was a flicker of understanding in shachars eyes but the dark subtle amusement did not reach his lips i can sell you most of what you need he said what i do not have perhaps abd alqadir can supply that would be excellent do you have theban opium he pursed his lips that is one for abd alqadir do you need it urgently yes i have a patient i am treating and i have little left do you know a good surgeon if the stone does not pass naturally i do he replied but give it time it is not good to use the knife if it can be avoided he worked as he spoke weighing measuring packing things up for her to take everything carefully labeled when he was finished she took the parcel and paid him what he asked he studied her face for a few moments before making his decision now let us see if abd alqadir can help you with the theban opium if not i have some that is less good but still perfectly adequate come obediently she followed looking forward to meeting the arab physician and wondering if perhaps he was the surgeon shachar would recommend for basil how would her very greek patient accept that perhaps it would not be necessary five zoe chrysaphes stood at the window of her favorite room and stared across the rooftops of the city to where the sunlight streamed onto the golden horn till the water was like molten metal her hands caressed the stones in front of her still warm in the last glow of the day constantinople was spread out below her like a jeweled mosaic the ancient magnificence of the aqueduct of valens was behind her its arches sweeping in from the north like a titan from the roman past an age when constantinople was the eastern pillar of an empire that ruled the world the acropolis far to the right was far more greek and therefore more comfortable to her her language her culture although its great days had been before she was born the elderly woman still felt a pride in the thought of it she could see the tops of the trees that hid the ruins of the bukoleon palace where her father had taken her as a child she tried to bring back those bright memories but they were too far away and slipped out of her grasp the radiance of the setting sun momentarily hid the squalor of the unmended walls covering their scars with a veil of gold but zoe never forgot the pain of the enemy invasion of ignorant and careless feet trampling what had once been beautiful she looked at the city now and saw it as exquisite and defiled but still throbbing with a passion to taste every last drop of life and drain it to the lees the light was kind to her she was past seventy but the skin was smooth over her cheekbones her golden eyes were shadowed and hooded under her winged brows her mouth had always been too wide but the curve of it was full the luster of her hair was less than it had been and closer to brown than chestnutthere was only so much that herbs and dyes could dobut it was still beautiful she stared a few moments longer at the glittering skyline of galata as the torches were lit the east was fading rapidly and the harbor was masked in purple the spires and domes were sharper against the enamel blue of the sky in thought she communed with the heart of the city that part of it that was more than palaces or shrines more even than the hagia sophia or the light on the sea the soul of constantinople was alive and that was what she had seen raped by the latins when she was a small child as the sun slid behind the low clouds and the air grew suddenly cold she turned away at last she stepped back into the room and its dazzling torchlight she could smell the tar burning see the faint shimmer of the flames in the draft between two of the finest tapestries in dark reds purples and umber there was a gold crucifix more than a foots length from top to bottom she walked over and stood in front of it staring at the christ in agony it was exquisitely wrought every fold of his loincloth the sinews of his limbs his face hollowed by pain all were perfect gently she reached up eased it off its hook and held it in her hands she did not need to look at it knowing as she did every line and shadow of the images on each of the four arms her fingers felt them now going over them softly like faces of those she loved except that it was hate that moved zoe the envisioning over and over again of revenge exquisite slow and complete on the top above the christ was the family emblem of the vatatzes who had ruled byzantium in the past it was green with a doubleheaded eagle in gold above each head a silver star they had betrayed constantinople when the crusaders had come fleeing the invaded city and taking with them priceless icons not to save them from the latins but to sell for money they had run like cowards thieving from the holy sanctuaries as they went abandoning to fire and the sword what they could not carry on the right arm was the emblem of the doukas family also rulers until more recently their arms were blue with an imperial crown a twoheaded eagle with a silver sword in each claw they were traitors as well plunderers of those already robbed homeless and helpless they would know in time what it was to starve on the left arm was the emblem of the kantakouzenos an imperial family older still their arms were red with the doubleheaded eagle in gold they had been greedy blasphemous without honor or shame to the third and fourth generation they would pay constantinople did not forgive the violation of her body or her soul on the main trunk against which hung the figure of christ was the emblem of the worst of them all the dandolo of venice their coat of arms was just a simple lozenge horizontally halved white above red below it was doge enrico dandolo over ninety years old and blind as a stone who had stood in the prow of the leading ship of the venetian fleet impatient to invade despoil and then burn the queen of cities when no one else had had the courage to be the first ashore he had leapt down onto the sand sightless and alone and charged forward the dandolo family would pay for that as long as the scorch marks of ruin scarred the stones of constantinople she heard a sound behind her a clearing of the throat it was thomais her black serving woman with her closecropped head and beautiful fluid grace what is it zoe asked without taking her eyes off the cross miss helena has come to see you my lady thomais replied shall i ask her to wait zoe carefully replaced the cross on the wall and stepped back to regard it over the years since her return from exile she had put it back up there hundreds of times always perfectly straight walk slowly zoe replied fetch her a glass of wine then bring her here thomais disappeared to obey zoe wanted to keep helena waiting her daughter should not simply walk in at a whim and expect zoe to be available helena was zoes only child and she had molded her carefully from the cradle but no matter what she achieved helena would never outwit or outwill her mother several minutes later helena entered quietly smoothly her eyes were angry her respect was in her words not in the tone of her voice as was obligatory she still wore mourning for her murdered husband and she looked with some resentment at zoes ambercolored tunic its flowing lines accentuated by the height that zoe had and she did not good evening mother she said stiffly i hope you are well very thank you zoe replied with a slight smile of amusement not warmth you look pale but then mourning is designed to do that it is appropriate that a new widow should look as if she has been weeping whether she has or not helena ignored the remark bishop constantine came to see me naturally zoe responded sitting down with easy grace considering bessarions status it is his duty he would be remiss if he didnt and other people would notice did he say something interesting helena turned away so zoe did not see her face he was probing as if he wondered how much i knew of bessarions death she looked back at zoe for a moment with blazing clarity and what i might say she added fool it was almost a whisper but zoe caught the edge of fear in it constantine has no choice but to be against union with rome she said sharply hes a eunuch with rome in charge he would be nothing stay loyal to the orthodox church and everything else will be forgiven you helenas eyes widened thats cynical its realistic zoe pointed out and practical we are byzantine never forget it her voice was savage we are the heart and the brain of christianity and of light and thought and wisdomof civilization itself if we lose our identity we have given away our purpose in living i know that helena replied the question is does he what does he really want zoe looked at her with contempt power of course hes a eunuch helena spat the word the days are gone when a eunuch could be everything except emperor is he so stupid he doesnt know that yet in times of enough need we will turn to anyone we think can save us zoe said quietly you would be wise not to forget that constantine is clever and he needs to be loved dont underestimate him helena he has your weakness for admiration but he is braver than you are and you can flatter even a eunuch if you use your brains as well as your body in fact it would be a wise idea if you were to use your brains rather than your body where all men are concerned for the time being again the color surged up helenas cheeks said with all the wisdom and rectitude of a woman too old to do anything else she sneered she smoothed her hands over her slim waist and flat stomach lifting her shoulders again very slightly to offer an even more voluptuous curve the taunt stung zoe there were places in her jaw and her neck she hated to see in the glass the tops of her arms and her thighs no longer had the firmness they used to even a few years ago use your beauty while you can she replied youve nothing else and as short as you are when your waist thickens youll be square and your breasts will sit on your belly helena snatched up a length of silk tapestry from the chair and swung it as a lash striking out at zoe the end of it caught one of the tall bronze torch brackets and toppled it over and burning pitch spilled on the floor instantly zoes tunic was on fire she felt the heat of it scorch up her legs the pain was intense she was suffocating in smoke her lungs were bursting yet the shrill sounds deafening her were her own screams she was hurled back into the far past the crucible of all she had become she was engulfed by the flaring red light in the darkness the noise of walls collapsing crashing stone on stone the roar of flames everywhere terror confusion throat and chest seared in the heat helena was there flinging water at her shouting something her voice highpitched with panic but zoe was beyond thought she was a tiny child clinging to her mothers hand running falling dragged up and on stumbling over the broken walls bodies slashed and burned blood on the pavement she could smell the stench of human flesh on fire she fell again bruised aching she climbed to her feet and her mother was gone then she saw her one of the crusaders had yanked her mother up off the ground and thrown her against a wall he slashed at her robe and her tunic with his sword then leaned against her jerking violently zoe knew now what he had been doing she could feel it as if it were her own body violated when he finished he had cut her mothers throat and let her slide gushing blood onto the stones zoes father found them both too late zoe was sitting on the ground as motionless as if she too were dead everything after that was pain and loss they were always in unfamiliar places aching with hunger and the terrible emptiness of being dispossessed and a horror inside her head that zoe could never lose and after horror came the hate prick her anywhere and she bled rage helena was close to her wrapping her in something the light of flames was gone but the burning was still there agonizing zoes legs and thighs were throbbing with pain she could make out words helenas voice sharp and strained with fear youre safe youre safe thomais has gone for a physician theres a good one just moved here good for burns for skin youll be all right zoe wanted to swear at her curse her for the stupid vicious thing she had done wreak a revenge on her that would be so terrible she would want to die to escape it but her throat was too tight and she could not speak the pain robbed her of breath zoe lost all awareness of time the past was there again over and over her mothers face her mothers bleeding body the smell of burning then at last someone else was there talking to her a womans voice she was unwrapping the cloths helena had put around the burns it hurt appallingly it felt as if her skin were still on fire she bit her lips till she tasted blood to stop herself from screaming damn helena damn her damn her damn her the woman was touching her again with something cold the burning eased she opened her eyes and saw the womans face except it was not a woman it was a eunuch he had soft hairless skin and his features were womanish but there was a strength in them and his gestures the certainty with which he moved his hands were masculine it hurts but its not deep he told her calmly treat it properly and itll heal ill give you ointment which will take the heat out of it it was not the pain now that troubled zoe but the thought of scarring she was terrified of disfigurement she made a gasping sound but her mouth would not form the words her back arched as she struggled do something helena shouted at the physician shes in pain the eunuch did not turn to helena but looked steadily at zoes eyes as if trying to read the terror in her his own eyes were a curious gray he was goodlooking in an effeminate way good bones nice teeth pity they hadnt left him whole zoe tried to speak again if she could make some sensible contact with him she might drive away the panic that was welling up inside her do something you fool helena snarled at the eunuch cant you see shes in agony what are you just kneeling there for dont you know anything the eunuch continued to ignore her he seemed to be studying zoes face get out helena ordered well get someone else bring me a goblet of light wine with two spoonfuls of honey in it the eunuch told her dissolve the honey well helena hesitated please get it quickly he urged helena spun on her heel and left the eunuch busied himself putting more ointment on the burns then binding them with cloths but lightly he was right it took the heat away and gradually the fearful pain subsided helena returned with the wine the physician took it and eased zoe up gently until she was sitting and could hold the wine in her own hands to begin with her throat felt raw but each mouthful was easier and by the time she had drunk half of it she could speak thank you she said a little huskily how bad will the scarring be if you are lucky keep the wounds clean and the ointment on them maybe there will be none at all he replied burning always scarred zoe knew that shed seen other people burned liar she said between her teeth her body was stiff again resisting his arms around her i saw the crusaders sack the city when i was a child she told him ive seen fire burning before ive smelled the stench of human flesh roasting and seen bodies you wouldnt recognize as having once been human there was pity in the eunuchs eyes as he looked at her but zoe was not sure whether pity was what she wanted how bad zoe hissed at him again as i told you he replied calmly if you look after the wounds properly and use the ointment there will be no scarring you must take care of them the burns are not deep that is why they hurt so much deep ones dont but often they dont heal either i suppose if you come back in a day or two youll want paying twice zoe snapped the physician smiled as though it amused him of course does that trouble you zoe leaned back a little suddenly she was desperately tired and the pain had eased so much she could almost put it from her mind not in the slightest my servant will attend to you she closed her eyes it was dismissal zoe did not remember much of the next few hours and when she awoke in her own bed it was the middle of the following day helena stood beside her mother looking down and the light through the window was clear and harsh on her face her daughters skin was blemishless but the sun picked out the hardening line of her lips and the faintest slackening of the flesh under her chin helenas brow was puckered with anxiety she smoothed away all sign of it as soon as she realized zoe was awake zoe looked at her coldly let her be afraid deliberately zoe closed her eyes again shutting her daughter out the balance of power between them was changed helena had caused her both pain and terror and the terror was worse neither of them would forget that the burning in her legs was no more than discomfort now the eunuch was good if he was right and there was no scarring she would reward him well it could also be profitable to cultivate his acquaintance and his gratitude by finding him other patients physicians found themselves in places others did not they saw people at their most vulnerable they learned their weaknesses their fears just as this one had learned zoes he might also learn their strengths strength was a good place to attack because no one expected it people did not realize that their strengths if nurtured praised carried to excess could also become their undoing she was intensely aware that she could have been crippled by the burning even killed if she waited any longer to begin her revenge it could be too late something else might happen to her or there was always that other unwelcome possibilityher enemies might die naturally in their own beds and she would be robbed of the victory she had waited so long only that the full flavor might be realized before her foes had returned from exile and gained power and wealth in the new empire there would have been no point if they had nothing to lose no riches to hold on to vengeance would have no sweetness she breathed out slowly and smiled it was time to begin six anna left the house of zoe chrysaphes with a soaring sense of achievement at last she had been able to use her hardwon skills in the treatment of serious burns which without the ointment from colchis would have left lifelong scars her father had brought back the recipe from his travels in the black sea and the home of the legendary medea from whose name and science the very word medicine had sprung healing zoe could bring more patients if she was fortunate among them those who had known bessarion and therefore justinian antoninus and whoever was really responsible for the murder as she walked home in the warm night air she thought of the house she had just left zoe was an extraordinary woman even when she was injured terrified and in pain the intensity of feeling in her charged the air with the kind of tension before a great storm that makes the skin tingle what had caused the fire in that gorgeous room with its wroughtiron torch stands and its rich tapestries something deliberate was that why helena was afraid anna quickened her pace her mind exploring every possible use she could make of this opportunity as a eunuch she was invisible like a servant she could overhear piece together make sense of odd threads of information she returned to see zoe every day for the first week the calls were brief simply enough to ensure that the healing was continuing as expected it was obvious from the texture of her skin and the rich color of her hair that zoe herself was skilled in the use of herbs and unguents of course anna never mentioned it it would have been tactless however on the fourth occasion she found helena visiting her mother and she had no such qualms anna was sitting on the edge of zoes bed when helena observed that smells disgusting she wrinkled her nose at the sharp odor of the unguent anna was using at least most of your other oils and creams are pleasant if a little heavy zoes eyes narrowed to agatehard slits you should learn their use and the value of perfume beauty begins as a gift but you are rapidly approaching the age when it begins to become an art followed by the age when it is a miracle helena snapped zoes golden eyes widened difficult for someone with no soul to conceive of miracles maybe i will by the time i need them zoe looked her up and down youve left it late she whispered helena smiled a slow secret satisfaction oozing through it not as late as you think it was my intention that you should think you knew everythingbut you didnt you still dont zoe hid her surprise almost instantly but anna saw it if you mean about bessarions death zoe answered then of course i knew it the poisonings and the knifing in the street they had your hand all over themthey failed misconceived and stupid she sat up a little pushing anna aside her attention fully upon her daughter who did you think would take his place you fool justinian demetrios thats itdemetrios i suppose i have eirene to thank for that it was a conclusion not a question she sank back against the pillows the pain showing in her face again and helena walked out anna tried to keep her concentration on the slowly healing skin but the thoughts raced in her mind there had been other attempts on bessarions life by whom apparently zoe thought by helena why who was demetrios who was eirene now she had something concrete to seek she finished the bandages willing herself to keep her fingers steady it was not difficult to make the initial inquiries eirene was a woman of great note ugly clever of ancient imperial family both by birth as a doukas and by marriage as a vatatzes gossip had it that she was responsible for the steady increase of her husbands fortune even though he had not yet returned from exile for most of which he had been in alexandria she had one sondemetrios there the information stopped and as yet anna dared not press it any further the connections she was looking for now were more sinister perhaps dangerous by august zoes burns were almost entirely healed and her patronage was bringing other patients to anna some of these were wealthy merchants dealers in furs and spices silver gems and silks they were happy to pay two or three solidi for the best herbs and even more for personal attention on demand anna told simonis to buy lamb or kid even though they were recommended only for the first half of the month they had been frugal ever since they had arrived in march now it was time for a celebration she should serve it hot with honeyvinegar and perhaps some fresh gourd you know what vegetables to eat in august anna added and yellow plums ill get some rose wine simonis had the last word anna went back to the local silk shop and picked up the length she had admired before she let the soft cool fabric slide through her fingers almost like liquid and watched as the light fell on it turning it slowly the sheen was first amber then apricot then fire changing as it moved like a living thing people said that of eunuchs that the essence of them was elusive never the same twice it was meant as condemnationthat they were unreliable she saw it only that they were different as they were viewed because they needed to be to survive and that they were human full of hungers fears and dreams like everyone else and had the same ability to be hurt she bought a length of the silk sufficient to make a dalmatica for herself and accepted the shop owners offer to have it cut and stitched and delivered to her home she thanked him and left smiling even in the heat of the road outside and the dust of too many rainless days then she went south toward mese street and looked at the shops there she bought new linen tunics for both leo and simonis and a new outdoor cloak for each of them requesting that they be delivered she had attended the nearest church every sunday except when a patient required her urgent presence but now she felt like taking a water taxi the considerable distance to the great cathedral of the hagia sophia it stood out on the promontory at the farthest end of mese street between the acropolis and the hippodrome it was a calm evening the air still close and warm even on the water as the sun sank lower in the west color spilled across the golden horn making it look like a sheet of silk it was its brilliant reflection at sunrise that had given it its name the water taxi put ashore at dusk and she climbed the steep streets up from the harbor as the lamps and torches were lit she approached the hagia sophia now black against the fading sky with a sense of awe and excitement for a thousand years it had stood on this spot the largest church in christendom it had been completely destroyed by fire in the great dome had collapsed in brought down by an earthquake and been replaced almost immediately by the dome that now soared huge and dark against the sky of course she had seen it many times from the outside the building itself was over feet in either direction the stucco was of a reddish color and in the rising or setting sun it glowed with such warmth that mariners approaching the city could see it from afar she went in through the bronze doors and then stopped in amazement the vast interior was bathed in light from countless candles it was like being in the heart of a jewel the porphyry marble columns were deep red her father had told her they were originally from the egyptian temple in heliopolis ancient beautiful and priceless the polychrome marble in the walls was cool green and white from greece or italy the white of it was inlaid with ivory and pearls and there were gold icons from the ancient temples of ephesus it far surpassed every description she had heard the impression of light was everywhere as if the whole structure floated in the air needing no physical support the arches were inlaid with mosaics of staggering beauty somber blues grays and browns against backgrounds of countless tiny squares of gold pictures of saints and angels mary with the child christ prophets and martyrs from all the ages her eyes were dragged away from them only by the beginning of the mass and the voices rising in unison and then in harmony moved by the sacred solemnity of it uplifted by a surge of her own faith and an ache to belong she went toward the steps to the upper level head bent she was carried forward by the others around her this was the familiar ritual and the creed that had nourished her all her life she had walked up to the womens section of her own church in nicea as a little girl with her mother while justinian and her father went with the men to the main body of the hall she reached the top and stood with the others staring down into the heart of the church as in profound reverence the priests performed the blessing and the taking of the sacrament of christs body and blood given to redeem mankind the ritual was byzantine to the heart solemn and subtle ancient as the trust between man and god the sermon was about the faith of gideon leading the armies of the children of israel against a force that seemed overwhelming again and again god commanded gideon to reduce his meager army until it seemed absurd even to attempt a battle the priest pointed out that this was so that when they won as they would do they would know that it was god who had made it possible they would be victorious but also both humble and grateful they would know upon whom to rely in all future paths first obey and nothing is impossible no matter what appearances suggest was he speaking of the threat to the church posed by the union with rome or an invasion by crusading forces again if the union was refused and the latins returned violent and bloody as before after the last notes of the singing faded away she turned to leave and then the horror dawned on her unthinking she had followed the other women up to the womens section she had utterly forgotten she was supposed to be a eunuch what on earth could she do how could she escape now the sweat broke out on her body drenching her and leaving her cold everyone knew that the balconies of the upper floor were for women she was agonized with shame the women were streaming past her eyes downcast heads veiled unlike hers none of them looked back up to where she stood clinging to the banister swaying a little as dizziness overwhelmed her she must find an excuse but what nothing could account for coming up here an old woman stopped beside her her skin pale her face withered dear heaven was she going to demand an explanation she looked ashen was she going to faint and draw the attention of the entire crowd the old woman swayed and gave a hacking cough a spot of blood stained her lips the answer came like a shaft of light anna put her arm around the woman and eased her down to sit on the steps im a physician she said gently ill help you ill see you home a younger woman turned and saw them she quickly came back up a step im a physician anna said quickly i saw her looking ill and i came up to help her ill take her home she assisted the old woman to her feet arm around her again supporting most of her weight come she encouraged direct me where to go the younger woman smiled and made way for them nodding approval nevertheless afterward anna arrived home trembling with relief simonis looked at her anxiously knowing there was something wrong but anna was too ashamed of her stupidity to tell her what it was have you found anything further simonis asked holding out a goblet of wine and placing a dish of bread and chives in front of anna no anna said quietly not yet simonis said nothing but her look was eloquent they were not here risking their lives a hundred miles from home so anna could gain a new medical practice in simoniss opinion there was nothing wrong with the one anna had had in nicea their only reason for leaving it and the places and friends they had known all their lives was to rescue justinian my tunics are very good simonis said quietly thank you you must be getting new patients rich ones anna could see the disapproval in her stiff shoulders and the way she pretended to be concentrating on grinding the mustard seeds to make the sauce for the flatfish she would cook tomorrow rich is incidental she told her they knew justinian and the other people around bessarion i am learning about his friends and perhaps bessarions enemies simonis looked up quickly her eyes bright she smiled briefly it was as far as she dared go in case her belief invited bad luck and the prize slipped away good she nodded i see you dont like the city much do you anna said softly i know you miss the people you knew at home so do i its necessary simonis replied weve got to find the truth of what happened and get justinian back you just keep trying ill make new friends now go to bed its late seven in early october zoe sent a messenger to anna requesting that she attend her immediately zoe drew her like a flame that was dangerous unpredictable at times destructive but above all a blazing light and anna was in urgent need of more information when she arrived zoe received her at once which was in itself a compliment today she was dressed in a wine red tunic with a lighter red dalmatica over it clasped at the shoulder with an enormous goldandamber jewel more gold and amber hung on her ears and around her neck and was echoed at the embroidered hems of her garments with her topaz eyes and deep bronze hair zoe was breathtaking ah anastasius she said eagerly walking toward anna smiling how is your business i hear good reports of you from my friends it was a courteous question and asked with enthusiasm it was also a reminder that most of annas best patientsthe ones with money who paid on time and recommended her furtherhad come because of zoe good and getting better all the time anna answered i thank you for your recommendations i am happy they have been useful zoe waved one elegant hand sharpnailed and decorated with rings indicating the table with a jug of wine several goblets and a green glass bowl of almonds thank you anna said as if accepting but she made no move toward it she was too tense with expectation as to what zoe wanted she looked in good health even if some of it was achieved with her own salves and potions and a great deal of willpower how can i be of service anna asked she had learned not to compliment women as if she were a whole man or to commiserate as if she were another woman zoe smiled amused quick to the point anastasius have i drawn you away from another patient she was probing seeing how anastasius would walk the razors edge between flattery and truth keeping his own dignity maintaining the respect for his skill yet also being available to do whatever zoe wished he could not yet afford to refuse and they both knew it zoe was not a patient in this instance yet it would be absurdly arrogant for anastasius ever to imagine they were social acquaintances he was a eunuch from the provinces who earned his own living zoe was of an aristocratic family and not just a native of the city but almost an embodiment of its soul anna measured her words smiling a little is this not business zoes golden eyes flashed with laughter of course it is a friend a young woman named euphrosane dalassena she has a disease of the skin and it is somewhat embarrassing to her you seem to be skilled in such things i have told her you will come anna swallowed the sting of arrogance at being so taken for granted even so zoe saw the flicker and knew what it meant it pleased her if you tell me where i may find her i shall call anna answered zoe nodded slowly satisfied and named the house and the street urgently if you please study her carefully consider her mind as well as her body it is of concern to me how she progresses do you understand i shall be happy to tell you that she is doing well or not so well she replied i dont care about her skin zoe snapped you can take care of that i have no doubt she is recently widowed i am interested in her state of mind the strength of her character anna hesitated on the brink of further restrictions on what she felt free to say then decided it would be pointless it would anger zoe for no reason she would decide how much to tell her later ill go straight away she said graciously zoe smiled thank you euphrosane dalassena was in her late twenties but at first she seemed younger her features were excellent and she should have been lovely but there was a certain insipidity about her and anna wondered if it were due to illness she lay on a couch her light brown hair unadorned her skin a little waxy anna had been shown in by a serving woman who remained in the unimaginatively ornamented room standing by the doorway anna introduced herself and asked all the usual questions about symptoms then she examined the painful rash that spread across euphrosanes back and lower abdomen she seemed to have a slight temperature and was clearly both embarrassed and distressed by her condition her eyes never left annas face always waiting for the verdict trying to interpret every expression finally she could bear it no longer i go to confession every other day and i know of no sin of which i have not repented she exclaimed ive fasted and prayed but nothing comes to my mind please help me god does not punish you for what you cant help anna said quickly then immediately wondered at her daring that was her own conviction but was it the doctrine of the church she felt the blood burn up her face euphrosanes logic was perfect then i must be able to help it she said plaintively what havent i done i have prayed to saint george who is the patron saint of skin diseases but he is patron saint of a lot of things so i have also prayed to saint anthony the abbot just in case i should be more specific i attend mass every day i go to confession i give alms to the poor and offerings to the church where have i fallen so far short that this has happened to me i dont understand she lay back on the couch anna drew in her breath to say that it was nothing to do with sin of any kind omission or commission but realized that that might be viewed as heresy euphrosane was still watching her the sweat dampening her skin and making her hair lank anna must answer or lose euphrosanes faith in her could it be that your sin lies in not trusting gods love enough she said shocked at her own words i will give you medicine to take and ointment to have your maid put on the blisters each time you do so pray and believe that god loves you personally how could he euphrosane said wretchedly my husband died young before he had achieved half the things he could have and i did not even bear a child now i am afflicted with an illness so ugly no other man will want me how could god love me i am doing something terribly wrong and i dont even know what it is yes you are anna said vehemently how dare you dismiss yourself as useless or ugly god does not need you to get everything right because nobody is going to do that but he does expect you to try and to trust him euphrosane stared at her in wonder i understand she said the confusion gone i shall repent immediately and use the medicine as well anna warned he gave us herbs and oils and intelligence to understand their purpose dont throw his gift back at him that would be ingratitude which is also a very serious sin indeed and it would make the whole exercise pointless but she could not tell her that i will i will euphrosane promised a week later euphrosane was completely healed which made anna wonder if perhaps much of her fever had been due to fear of an imagined guilt she went to report to zoe as asked and this time she had to wait nearly half an hour before being admitted she knew the moment she saw zoes face that she was already aware of euphrosanes recovery quite probably she also knew how much anna had been paid but she could not afford to let her irritation show she thanked zoe again for the referral what did you think of her zoe asked casually today she wore dark blue and gold with her warm hair and eyes the effect was superb there were times when anna longed with almost physical pain to dress as a woman again herself and to ornament her hair then she could face zoe on an even footing she forced herself to remember justinian somewhere in the sterility of the judean desert possibly even wearing sackcloth and the reason she was here posing as a eunuch did he imagine she had forgotten him zoe was waiting her expression impatient is your opinion of euphrosane so bad you cannot answer me honestly you owe me that anastasius gullible anna replied a sweet young woman painfully honest but easily persuaded obedient too fearful not to be zoes golden eyes opened wide so you bite she said with amusement be careful you cannot afford to nip the wrong person the sweat broke out on annas skin but she did not look away she knew never to let zoe sense weakness you asked for the truth should i tell you less never zoe replied her eyes bright as faceted gems or if you lie then do it so well that i never find out anna smiled i doubt i could do that interesting that you are wise enough to say so zoe replied softly almost a purr there is something i would like you to do for me if a merchant named cosmas kantakouzenos should ask your opinion of euphrosanes character as he might would you be as candid with him tell him she is honest guileless and obedient of course anna replied i would be grateful if you would tell me more about bessarion comnenos it was a bold question and she had not had time to think of any explanation for her interest but zoe had not given any reason why she wished euphrosane recommended to cosmas zoe walked over to the window and stared out at the complex pattern of rooftops i suppose you mean his death she said dryly bessarions life was uninteresting he married my daughter but he was a bore pious and chilly and he was killed for that anna said with disbelief zoe turned around slowly her eyes sweeping up and down anna from her womans face in the guise of a eunuch naked of a masculine beard and unsoftened by the lushness of feminine curls and ornaments zoes eyes traveled down her body bound at the chest padded out from shoulder to hip to hide the natural curve anna knew what she looked like she had worked hard on her appearance yet at times like these in the presence of a woman who was beautiful even now she hated it her hair no longer than to her shoulders actually became her face it was less stiff than the highly dressed styles women wore but still she missed the combs and ornaments she had once had more than that she missed the color for her brows the powder to even out the tones of the skin the artificial color to make her lips less pale a servants footsteps passed audibly across the floor in the next room deliberately anna forced herself to remember zoes terror when she had been burned the nakedness of the pain in her it reduced her to a human being in need zoe saw some change in her but did not comprehend it she gave the slightest shrug of one shoulder it was not an isolated incident she remarked a year before his death he was attacked in the street we never learned if it was an attempt at robbery or one of his own bodyguards perhaps seizing a chance to stab him in the scuffle but making a mess of it he was cut only once but it was quite deep why would one of his own bodyguards do that anna asked i have no idea zoe answered then saw instantly from annas face that that was an error zoe would always know and she would never admit ignorance now to cover the disadvantage zoe would attack it was before you came she said why does it concern you i need to know friends and enemies anna answered her bessarions death still seems to be of interest to many people of course zoe said tartly he was of one of the old imperial families and led the cause against union with rome many people placed their hopes in him and now in whom anna askedtoo quickly there was a flash of humor in zoes eyes and you imagine this was a bid for sainthood or that bessarion is some kind of martyr anna blushed angry with herself for opening the way for such a remark i want to know the allegiances for my own safety very wise zoe said softly with a flicker of appreciation an inner light of laughter and if you succeed you will be cleverer than anyone else in byzantium eight when anastasius was gone zoe remained alone in the room standing at the window she never tired of the view up that shining strip of water had sailed jason and his argonauts in search of the golden fleece he had found medea and betrayed her her revenge had been terrible zoe could well understand she was nearly ready to exact her own revenge on the kantakouzenos cosmas was zoes age it was his father andreas who had told the crusaders where the vial was with the blood of christ in it in order to save himself dead now he was beyond zoes reach let god burn him in hell but cosmas was alive and well and now here again in constantinople prospering he had much to lose she watched him as she would watch a fruit ripening read to be plucked her eyes moved to the golden bowl on the table it was full of apricots like liquid amber touched with the red of the sun she picked one up and bit into it crushing its flesh between her teeth and letting the juice run over her lips onto her chin euphrosanes grandfather georgios doukas had helped steal icons from the hagia sophia the mother church of byzantium he had even helped them take the holy shroud of christ itself its loss to the orthodox faith could never be forgiven now the coarse irreverent fingers of the latins would hold it zoes whole body shuddered at the thought as if she herself had been touched intimately by something foul it was a stroke of good fortune that euphrosane had fallen ill with a disease of the skin that her own physician could not heal it had enabled zoe to send the eunuch physician to her and he in turn would get cosmas to trust her she took another apricot this one was less ripe than the first a little like anastasius he had surprised her with his sharpness in judging euphrosane not that he was wrong of course she simply had expected him to be more mealymouthed in expressing it but liking him could not be allowed to get in the way of zoes plans for revenge if anastasius was useful that was all that mattered and he had one weakness she should not forgethe forgave some of the patients she had recommended had treated him badly but he did not seem to bear a grudge he had had opportunity to take advantage of them in return and he had not taken it zoe did not think it was cowardice there would have been no danger to himselfindeed no price to pay of any sort that was stupid with no fear there would be no respect she would have known better she would have to protect anastasius as long as he was useful all scores must be evened she turned back and faced the room and the great gold crucifix on the wall she would help the physician in his quest for information about bessarion but she knew it had nothing to do with understanding alliances in constantinople then why was he asking about it naturally she could not tell him even a whisper of the truth could she say that helena had been bored witless by bessarion and that he had probably never been interested in hernot as a man should be interested in a woman she relaxed and threw back her head smiling in a rare moment of selfmockery she had tried to seduce bessarion herself once just to see if there was any fire in his loins or his soul there wasnt he was willing eventually but it wasnt worth the trouble no wonder helenas eyes were wandering far cleverer to seduce antoninus and then use him to dispose of bessarion and so get rid of both of themif that was what had happened that was worthy of a daughter of zoes she had been slow to learn but apparently she had succeeded well enough in the end pity helena had compromised justinian too he was a real man too much for helena if she had caused that zoe would not forgive her for it she walked slowly across the room to the doorway swinging her arm out a fraction to make the silk of her robe flutter and shine in the light the sheen changed color from russet to gold and back again deceiving the eye firing the imagination a week later the emperor sent for her there was a man worth lying with the memory was still a good one even all these years after not the best gregory vatatzes would always be that but zoe forced him out of her mind there was pain in every thought of him as well as pleasure michael wanted something or he would not have sent for her she dressed carefully gorgeous in a bronze and black silk tunic that clung to her a high necklace would conceal the aging of her skin under her jaw her hands were soft she knew exactly what ingredients to use in unguents to keep them pale and the knuckles from swelling she wore topaz set in gold none of it was to seduce him their relationship was beyond that now he wanted her skill her cunning not her flesh since the return of the empire from exile in nicea and scattered cities to the north along the coast of the black sea michael had made his residence in the blachernae palace on the other side of the city from the old imperial palace the blachernae overlooked the golden horn as did her own house and it was not more than a mile and a half away she could walk it easily accompanied by sabas her most loyal servant she did not hurry it was unseemly she had time to notice the weeds where paving stones were missing the broken windows in a church never replaced even the blachernae palace itself was scarred some of the magnificent arches of its upper windows shattered threatening to topple over and smash on the steps below the imperial varangian guard did not question her they knew better than to ask who she was no doubt they had been told to expect her she swept past them with just a slight inclination of her head she remembered the old days before the latins came when she was a tiny child and her father had taken her to the old imperial palace high up on the headland overlooking the city and the sea alexios v had been emperor of byzantium which to her was the world that was just before the terrible days of the invasion she waited in a huge room with high windows that let the light fill the space and magnify the perfect proportions the walls were inlaid with pink marble and the floor with porphyry the torch brackets were high slender and decorated in gold her surroundings pleased her profoundly and she was happy to gaze at them until she was sent for she was conducted by a tall eunuch with a soft face tired eyes and an irritating manner of waving his hands he led her through the halls and galleries into the emperors private rooms there were some conversations that should not be overheard by anyone even the everpresent varangian guard would stand at a distance out of earshot many of them were yellowhaired blueeyed from godknewwhat remote lands this private room was totally restored the walls repainted with exquisite murals of pastoral scenes at harvesttime the tall bronze candle stands were ornate and gleaming the few statues left undamaged she made the usual obeisance she was twentyfive years older than michael and a woman but he was emperor and equal of the apostles he did not rise to greet her but remained seated his knees a little apart covered by the woven brocaded silk of his dalmatica and the scarlet of the tunic underneath he was a handsome man with his heavy black hair and beard fine eyes and slightly ruddy complexion he had good hands zoe remembered the touch of them with pleasure even now they were surprisingly sensitive for a man who had been a brilliant soldier in his prime and still knew more of military strategy than most generals in battle he had led his army rather than followed it he was busy now reorganizing the army and the navy and overseeing the repair of the city walls he was above all a practical man what he wanted of zoe would also be practical come forward zoe he commanded we are alone there is no need for pretense his voice was soft and deep as a mans should be she stepped closer to him but slowly she would never presume and so give him the chance to rebuff her let him do the asking the requesting there is a matter in which you may be of assistance he said watching her intently his eyes searching her face she was never sure how far he could read her he was byzantine to the core nothing of the imagination passed him by he was subtle devious and brave but at the moment he had a heavy burden to carry and a broken and obstinate people to lead they were blind to the realities of the new threat because they dared not look at it clearly since bessarions death zoe was beginning to see the political situation differently there was a betrayal still being planned somewhere and when zoe found it out she would punish whoever was responsible even if it was helena she wished she could have spoken to justinian before he went into exile but constantine had accomplished his rescue so smoothly and so quickly that that had not been possible now she needed to know what michael wanted of her whatever i can do she murmured respectfully there are certain people whose services you use he measured his words with care i would prefer not to be seen to use them but they have skills i need i wish for information later it may be more than that sicily she breathed out the word it was really more of an acknowledgment than a question he nodded assent she waited a new bargain must be made and that was good she would deal with anyone if it was for byzantiums sake but she would not do it cheaply the sicilian she employed was a weasel of a man a double spy but she had caught his one mistake and kept the proof of it where all his cunning would never find it he was dangerous and she must handle him with care as one did a serpent she knew why michael could not afford to have any connection with him even through his own spies nothing escaped the eunuchs closest to him or the house servants and palace guards the priests forever coming and going he needed someone like zoe who was just as clever as he was but who could afford to be ruthless in ways he dared not there were too many pretenders to the throne wouldbe usurpers plots and counterplots michael was only too bitterly aware of it always watching over his shoulder he leaned forward less than a yard from her now i need this man of yours he said quietly not to strike yet but in a while and i need someone else in rome also a second voice i can find someone she promised what do you wish to know he smiled he had no intention of telling her someone close to the pope he said and to the king of the two sicilies someone with courage hope flared inside her that after all he meant to fight perhaps michael would even assassinate the pope after all the pope was the enemy of byzantium and this was war he read her instantly not that kind of courage zoe those days are past popes can be replaced easily enough there was anger in his eyes and something that might have been fear the king of the two sicilies is the real danger and the pope is the only one who can hold him back if we are to survive we must compromise you cannot compromise the faith she retorted temper burned the skin under his heavy beard she saw the flush across his cheekbones he leaned even closer to her we need skill zoe not bravado we must use one against the other in the way we always have but i will not lose constantinople again to pay for anything on earth ill bow the knee to rome or let them think i do but the crusaders will not break one stone of my city nor tax the smallest coin of tribute from my people his black eyes bored into hers sicily may starve and may even turn to bite the hand that robs it and if it does so much the better for us until then i will trade in words and symbols with the pope or the devil or king charles of anjou and the two sicilies if i have to are you with me or against me i am with you she said softly aware now of a subtle and disturbing irony i will defend byzantium against anyone within or without are you with me he looked straight back at her unblinking oh yes zoe chrysaphes you may trust me to choose what i see and what i dont i have my spies by the neck i shall see they do as you wish she promised smiling also and stepping back her mind was busy already sicily rising against their king there was a thought nine zoe did as michael had requested then she turned her mind to revenge she had not forgotten the bitter lesson of her own brush with death there was no time to wait the eunuch anastasius was exactly the tool she needed he had intelligence and the kind of honesty to his profession that made people trust him she was quite aware that he did not trust her and there was also this hunger in him to know about bessarions death one day zoe would take time to find out exactly why that was in the meantime there was a delicate balance of irony in using him to trick and ruin cosmas kantakouzenos whose familys greed had robbed byzantium of some of its greatest art zoe was dressed in a tunic the color of dark wine in shadow and an even darker dalmatica burgundy warp shot with a black weft which caught the warmth of reds in the firelight as she passed through the glow of the torches she crossed herself and stepped out into the night sabas following behind her for safety in the shadows of twilight and for their return in the dark she stood for a moment in the street reciting the ave maria to herself hands folded then she started to walk again she drew a deep breath into her lungs this was her vengeance at last by tomorrow the first of those whose emblems were on the back of her crucifix would be dead she left sabas outside as the servant showed her in to cosmass house even the entrance hall was magnificent especially the marble bust of a roman senator on a plinth his elderly face lined with the emotion and experience of a lifetime blue venetian glasses stood on a table the light making them look like jewels an egyptian alabaster dog with huge ears took pride of place on a carved wooden table when she was shown into his room cosmas was sitting in a wide chair staring at an inlaid table on which stood a jug of sicilian wine which was now more than halfempty beside it was a dish of dates and honeyed fruits he was a short man with a curved nose and heavylidded eyes redrimmed in shadowed sockets i dont owe you anything he said sourly so i assume you have come to see what you can plunder she wanted to do more than gloat she needed a quarrel one that could be escalated into violence you are a wretched judge of character she replied still standing he did not rise i have not come to make financial profit out of you i will buy icons to give to the church so all may worship them there and be blessed i will pay you a fair price his shoulders straightened and his head lifted a little but i will see them first she added with a slight smile of course wine with pleasure she had no intention of drinking anything in his house but she wanted the glass a pity to break itit was exquisite he rose stiffly knees creaking and fetched another glass from a cupboard he poured it halffull for her and set it within her reach let us talk money the icons are on the wall in there he indicated an archway leading to a dimly lit room beyond she accepted the invitation and walked through then she stopped her heart pounding there were still half a dozen icons left images of st peter and st paul of christ one icon of the virgin was in gold leaf and greenandazure enamel and blue so dark as to be almost black she was somberfaced with a tenderness that held the viewer in amazement others had jewels encrusted on the clothes of the figures or were inlaid with ivory there was such beauty in them that momentarily she forgot why she was here or why the hatred scorched inside her there was a sound behind her and she froze very slowly she turned he was there in the doorway fat and soft full of good living and the savor of profit i would rather destroy them than be robbed he said between his teeth i know you zoe chrysaphes you do nothing without a reason why are you really here the icons are beautiful she said as if that were a reply worth a great deal of money his merchants heart was in his face then let us haggle she said unable to keep the contempt out of her voice as she brushed past him accidentally touching the protrusion of his belly as he stood in the middle of the archway let us argue how many byzants the face of mary is worth it is an icon he said with a sneer the creation of mans hands made of wood and paint and of gold leaf cosmas never forget the gold leaf or the gems she responded he frowned at her do you want to buy one of them or not he snapped how many pieces of silver cosmas for the mother of god forty seems an appropriate number she took a small purse of silver solidi out of her robe and placed the coins on the table temper flared up his face it is an icon you stupid woman an artists work no more it is not christ i sell blasphemy she shrieked at him her fury only in part pretense she lunged for one of the glasses her hand sweeping high making clear her intention to smash it and use it as a weapon he darted forward first and seized it dashing off the lovely golden rim of it and leaving jagged ends bristling from the stem he held it out like a dagger his eyes wide flickering with fear his lips parted she hesitated she had borne pain before and she hated it bodys ecstasy and agony were equally deep for her right on the cliff edge of the unbearable but this was revengewhat she had lived for over the long arid years she pushed forward again using the end of her cloak to dull some of the cutting edge when he struck her he jerked upward at her with the ragged stem impelled by fear she felt the glass cut and she twisted away and grasped it with the other hand screaming out intending the servants to hear her afterward she would need their testimony he must be the aggressor only one glass broken she merely defending herself he was caught by surprise he had expected her to fall backward bleeding instead she pressed on up to him turning the stem against him with her weight and her other hand over his the broken edge caught him a thin slashing cut then she drew back allowing surprise into her face as servants came rushing into the room its nothing cosmas said angrily shouting at them but still looking at her his face was red his eyes blazing zoe turned toward the two men and the woman forcing herself to sound apologetic this was what they must remember i dropped a glass and it broke she said with a charming smile rueful just a little ashamed we reached for it at the same moment and and bumped into each other i am afraid we both grasped for the glass and have cut ourselves on its shards perhaps you would bring water and bandages they hesitated do it cosmas yelled at them clutching the wound where the blood was already staining his robe i have a tincture to ease pain zoe said helpfully reaching inside her tunic for the fold of oiled silk with the antidote in it no he refused instantly i will use my own there was a slight sneer in his voice as if he had seen her trick and sidestepped it as you please she emptied the powder into her mouth and took a sip of the wine from his glass still whole on the table whats that he demanded a powder against the pain she replied holding up her bleeding arm do you want some no there was derision in his eyes the servants returned and carefully washed the wounds of both of them i have a salve zoe reached with her other hand for the porcelain jar of ointment with its painted chrysanthemums she put a little on her wound it was mildly soothing but she relaxed her body as if it had brought great ease she held out the open jar to cosmas her face was composed as close to indifferent as she could make it master one of the servants offered oh do it cosmos told him impatiently now that the servants were returned being seen to be afraid demeaned him the servant obeyed using it liberally both wounds were bound and the servants fetched more wine more glasses and a blue porcelain dish of sweet honey cakes within fifteen minutes cosmos began to sweat profusely and have some difficulty in getting his breath the glass slipped from his hand and spilled wine onto the floor rolling away with a hollow sound he put his hand to his throat as though to loosen a tight garment but there was nothing there he began to shake uncontrollably zoe stood up apoplexy she said looking down at him then she turned and walked unhurriedly to the door and called the servants he is taking a fit you had better send for a physician she told them when she had seen them leave their faces white with panic she went back to where cosmas was collapsed halffallen to the floor he should live for another hour at least but the poison was working rapidly cosmos gasped and seemed to recover a little although she found it revolting to touch his fat body she bent and helped him ease his position to one where he was better able to breathe she might have to explain it afterward if she had not you did this to me he gasped curling his lips in a snarl you are going to steal my icons thief she bent even closer to him the fear draining out of her and vanishing your father stole them from mine she hissed in his ear i want them back in the churches so pilgrims will come here and make byzantium rich and safe again you your family and your blood are the thieves and yes i did this to you know it and taste it cosmas believe it murderer he spat back at her but it was no more than a sigh she went into the room with the icons after lifting the one of the virgin off the wall she wrapped it in the folds of her cloak she smiled and walked on to the door where the servants were waiting to let her out revenge was perfect richer than laughter sweeter than honey more lasting than the scent of jasmine in the air ten on the last day of april in the following year enrico palombara was standing in the central courtyard of his villa a mile beyond the vatican walls the sunlight had the limpid clarity one sees only in spring the arid heat of summer was still far away the walls were ochercolored and the new leaves of the vines made a lacework of green against them the sound of falling water was a constant music he could hear the chattering of birds in the eaves as they worked he loved their ceaseless industry as if they could not imagine failure they did not pray as men did so the answering silence would not frighten them he turned and went inside it was time for him to walk to the vatican and present himself to the pope he had been sent for and he must make certain he was there well in time he did not know the reason gregory x wished to speak to him but he profoundly hoped that it would be the chance of office againand not merely as secretary or assistant to some cardinal or other he increased his pace along the street his long bishops robes swirling he nodded to people he knew exchanging a greeting here and there but his mind was on the meeting ahead perhaps he would be sent as a papal legate to one of the great courts of europe such as aragon castile portugal or above all the holy roman empire any such position would offer vast opportunities out of which could be carved a superb career possibly even elevation to the papal throne itself one day urban iv had been a papal legate before his election five minutes later palombara walked across the square up the wide shallow steps of the vatican palace and into the shade under the huge arches he reported his presence and was conducted to the popes private apartments still fifteen minutes before the appointed time as he expected he was kept waiting he did not feel free to pace back and forth over the smooth marble floor as he would have liked then suddenly he was summoned and the next moment he was in the popes chamber a formal room still but brighter and more comfortable sunlight streamed in through the window making it seem airy he had no time to look at the murals but they were in softer colors muted pinks and golds he knelt to kiss the ring of tebaldo visconti now gregory x your holiness he murmured how are you enrico gregory asked let us walk in the inner courtyard for a while there is much to discuss palombara rose to his feet noticeably taller and leaner than the rather rotund figure of the pope he looked down into the popes face with its large dark eyes and magnificent nose long heavy and straight as your holiness pleases he said obediently gregory had been pope for two and a half years already this was the first time he had spoken with palombara alone he led the way out through the wide doors into the inner courtyard where they were observed but not overheard we have much work to do enrico gregory said quietly we live in a dangerous age but one of great opportunity we have enemies all around us we cannot afford dissension within he glanced at palombara sharply palombara murmured a reply to show his attention the germans have chosen a new king rudolph of hapsburg whom i shall crown holy roman emperor in due time he has renounced all claims to our territories and to sicily gregory continued now palombara understood gregory was clearing all threats one by one toward some further great plan they crossed into a brief open space and palombara shaded his eyes against the sunlight so he could read gregorys expression the power of islam is increasing gregory continued his voice growing sharper they hold much of the holy land all arabia south and east egypt and north africa and up into the south of spain their trade is expanding their science and their arts thrive their mathematics their medicine lead the way in thought their ships sail the eastern mediterranean and there is nothing to stop them palombara felt a chill in the air in spite of the brilliance of the sun gregory stopped if they move north toward nicea and they well could then there is nothing to stop them taking constantinople and the whole of the old byzantine empire piece by piece after that then they will be at the very gates of europe disunited we will not stand we must not permit it to happen palombara said simply although the answer was anything but simple the twohundredyearold schism between rome and byzantium was deep and had resisted all previous attempts at reconciliation they were now not only doctrinally apart on many issues most intractably the issue of the holy spirit proceeding from the father and the son or the father only they were also culturally different in a hundred patterns beliefs and observances these distinctions had become a matter of human pride and identity the emperor michael palaeologus has consented to send delegates to the council i have called in lyons this june gregory continued i wish you to come also enrico listen carefully to everything that you hear i need to know my friends and my enemies palombara felt a surge of excitement healing the schism would be the greatest single achievement for christianity within the last two centuries rome would control all the land and command the obedience of every soul from the atlantic to the black sea how can i serve this cause palombara surprised himself with how honestly he meant it you have a fine mind enrico gregory said smoothly the harsh lines of his face softening you have great skills a nice balance between caution and strength you understand necessity thank you holy father do not thank me it is not flattery gregory said a trifle tartly i am merely reminding you of the qualities you possess which will be needed i wish you to go to byzantium as legate of the holy see with special duties to end this quarrel which divides the christian church a smile curved gregorys wide lips i perceive you have grasped the vision i knew you would i know you better than you imagine enrico i have great faith in your skill as always of course you will be accompanied by another legate i have chosen bishop vicenze his abilities will be the right complement for yours there was a flicker of amusement in his eyes almost too slight to be seen yet for an instant it was unmistakable yes holy father palombara knew niccolo vicenze and disliked him profoundly he was singleminded unimaginative and dedicated to the point of obsession he was also completely without humor even his pleasure was ritualistic as if he must follow a precise order or lose his control over it we will balance each other holy father he said aloud it was his first lie of the encounter if he were pope he too would have sent niccolo vicenze as far away as possible gregory permitted himself a wide generous smile oh i know that enrico i know that i will look forward to seeing you in lyons i think perhaps you will enjoy it palombara inclined his head yes holy father in june palombara was in the central french city of lyons it was hot dry and dusty underfoot he had watched and listened all week as the pope had commanded and he had heard a score of opinions most with little presentiment of the danger from the east and south that gregory perceived so sharply the promised delegates from the emperor of byzantium were not here yet no one knew why now he walked up a flight of shallow steps to the thoroughfare above ahead of him was a cardinal in purple his robes vivid in the june sun lyons was a beautiful city dignified and imaginative built upon two rivers this month the men and women in the streets and byways were used to the sight of princes of the church and they took no more notice than a polite bow or curtsy and moved on about the business of their lives palombara turned hearing a disturbance in the street ahead movement men stepping aside there was a flowing of color purples and reds and whites and flashes of gold like wind in a field of poppies king james l of aragon came out of one of the great palace entrances surrounded by courtiers everyone made way for him he was totally unlike the bold and arrogant charles of anjou king of the two sicilies which in effect meant all italy from naples southward charles was as unsaintly as possible yet it could be he who would lead the crusade that the pope so badly wanted it was an interesting contrast in the holy and practical one that palombara was contemplating with some indecision that evening he attended the mass in the cathedral of saint jean work on the building had begun nearly a century ago and was still far from finished even so it looked magnificent severe and elegantly romanesque the sweet perfume of incense filled his head and it all swelled in a complex rhythm carrying him along toward that exquisite moment when the sacrament of bread and wine would become the body and blood of christ and in some mystical way they would be united cleansed of sin and renewed in spirit was there such a thing as communication with god did these men around him experience it or was it just the music and the incense the hunger to believe creating the longedfor illusion or was it the lies and the doubts palombara allowed to poison his soul that rendered his ears deaf to the voices of angels memory returned with a jolt of sensual pleasure and emotional guilt as a young priest he had counseled a woman whose husband was distant and humorless not unlike vicenze palombara had been gentle with her and made her laugh she had fallen in love with him he saw it happening and enjoyed it she was warm and lovely he had lain with her even as he stood here in this cathedral while some cardinal offered up the mass the incense in his nose and throat was gone for a moment and he could smell the fragrance of her hair feel the warmth of her flesh and see her smile she became with child palombaras child and they had agreed to let her husband believe it was his was that wrong wise or not it was a cowards lie palombara had confessed to his bishop chosen his penance and received absolution better for the church and so the welfare of the people if it was never known but was penance enough there was no peace inside him no sense of having been forgiven standing here with the music the color and light the rapt faces of men whose minds could be as far from god as his own he had a sense of not having tasted the fullness of life and the beginning of a terrible fear came to him that maybe there was no more than this maybe real hell was the fact that there was no heaven the embassy of michael palaeologus finally arrived in lyons on june they had been delayed by bad weather at sea and were too late for much of the discussion they presented a letter from the emperor signed by fifty archbishops and five hundred bishops or synods their good faith could not be denied it seemed victory for rome had come easily on june gregory celebrated the mass in the cathedral of st jean again the epistle gospel and creed were sung both in latin and in greek on july the emperors letter was read aloud and the byzantine ambassadors promised fidelity to the latin church and abjured all the propositions it denied gregory held the world in his hands it was all accomplished unworthy bishops had been deposed certain mendicant orders suppressed and the orders of st francis and st dominic warmly approved the cardinals would no longer be able to dither and delay the election of a new pope rudolph of hapsburg was recognized as the future monarch of the holy roman empire in spite of the death of thomas aquinas on his way to lyons and of st bonaventure in lyons itself gregorys cup of triumph ran over palombara felt as if there was nothing left for him to do still gregory wished both palombara and vicenze to return briefly to rome and then prepare to sail to constantinople if they met with the same weather the byzantine envoys had this could take as long as six weeks they would not arrive until october but they had something priceless to deliver an embassy of hope for the unity of the christian world it was august and miserably hot in rome when palombara returning from lyons walked across the familiar square toward the great arches in front of the vatican palace the enormous building stretching left and right to either side windows glinting in the sun as always people came and went the wide steps were dotted with the colors of pale robes purple hats and capes touches of scarlet this was to be palombaras last audience before departing again he already knew their purpose was to make sure that the emperor michael palaeologus kept all the great promises he had written to the pope that there was indeed substance behind the words it might become necessary to warn michael of the cost to his own people should they fail the balance of power was delicate another crusade led by charles of anjou might not be far away men and ships would sail for constantinople by the thousand armed for war the citys survival depended upon them coming in peace as brothers in christ not as invading conquerors of an alien faith as they had been at the beginning of the century killing and burning destroying the last bastion against islam palombara looked forward to the challenge of it and the adventure it would stretch his intelligence test his judgment and if he was successful considerably advance his career and he also looked forward to being immersed in a new culture the great buildings were still left the hagia sophia at least and the libraries the markets with all the spices silks and artifacts of the east he would enjoy a different lifestyle more of the arab and the jewish thought and of course more of the greek than was easy to find here in rome but he would miss what he was leaving behind rome was the city of the caesars the heart of the greatest empire the world had ever seen even st paul had been proud to claim its citizenship but palombara was also an intruder here a tuscan not a roman and he missed the beauty of his own land he loved the long view of rolling hills so many of them forested he missed the light on them at dawn the color of sunset and shadow the silence of the olive groves he smiled as he walked toward the wide steps he was halfway up when he realized that one of the men standing waiting was niccolo vicenze his pale zealous eyes studying palombara he looked at vicenzes dour face with its pale brows and felt a chill of warning vicenze smiled with his lips his eyes unchanging as he moved into palombaras path i have our instructions from the holy father he said with no inflection in his voice except a slight lift it almost hid his satisfaction but no doubt you would like the holy fathers blessing upon you also before we leave in one sentence he had made palombara redundant an escort there simply because one was customary how considerate of you palombara replied as if vicenze had been a servant who had obliged him beyond his duty vicenze looked momentarily confused their natures were so utterly disparate that they could have used the same words to convey opposite meanings it will be a great achievement to bring byzantium back into the true church vicenze added let us hope we can accomplish it palombara observed dryly then saw the gleam in vicenzes pale eyes and wished he had not been so candid there were seldom meanings behind meaning with vicenze only the obsession for control and conformity it was a strangely inhuman trait of character was it holiness the dedication of a saintly man or the madness of one who had not too much love of god so much as too little of mankind since he last saw him he had forgotten how much he disliked vicenze we will be equal to the task we will not cease until we are vicenze said slowly giving each word weight perhaps he had a sense of humor after all palombara stood in the sun and watched vicenze walk down the steps and into the square with a slight swagger papers in his hand then he turned and went up past the guard and into the coolness of the shadowed hall eleven by september anna had discovered more information about both antoninus and justinian himself but what she had found all seemed superficial and she could see in it no meaning or connection with the murder of bessarion there seemed nothing the three men all had in common except a dislike for the proposed union with rome from all accounts bessarion had been not only seriousminded but extremely sober of nature and spoke often and with great passion about the doctrine and history of the orthodox church while respected even admired he allowed no intimacy she felt an unwilling flicker of sympathy for helena like bessarion justinian was a member of an imperial family but much further from the center of it unlike bessarion he had no inherited wealth his importing business was necessary for his survival and he appeared to have succeeded with it although with his exile all his property had been forfeited the merchants of the city and ships captains in the harbors all still knew his name they were shocked that he had stooped to murder bessarion they had not only trusted justinian they had liked him it was hard for anna to listen and control her sense of loss the bitter loneliness inside her was so vast it threatened to tear through her skin antoninus had been a soldier it was far more difficult for her to learn more of him the few soldiers she treated spoke well of him but he had been their senior in rank and all they knew was repute and hearsay he was strict and he was unquestionably brave he enjoyed wine and a good jokenot the sort of man bessarion would have liked but justinian would it made no sense no pattern she sought the only person she trustedbishop constantine he had helped justinian even at risk to his own safety he welcomed her into a smaller room in his house than the warm ocher one with the marvelous icons this had cooler earth tones and looked down at a courtyard the murals were pastoral with muted colors the floor was greentiled and there was a table set for dining and two chairs beside it at his insistence she sat in one of them to leave sufficient space for him to walk gently back and forth deep in thought you ask about bessarion he said absentmindedly smoothing his fingers over the embroidered silk of his dalmatica he was a good man but perhaps lacking the fire to stir mens souls he weighed he measured he judged how can a man be at once so passionate of mind and so indecisive was he a coward she asked quietly a look of sadness came across constantines face it was several moments before he spoke again i presumed he was simply cautious he crossed himself god forgive them all they wished for so much and all to save the true church from the dominion of rome and the pollution of the faith that will bring she echoed his sign of the cross she wanted more than anything else to lay the burden of her own guilt at gods feet and seek his absolution she remembered her dead husband eustathius with a coldness that still struck the quarrel the isolation the blood and then the neverending grief she would never carry another child she was fortunate to have healed without crippling she ached to tell constantine to spread all her guilt before him and be cleansed whatever penance was necessary but the confession of her imposture would rob her of any chance to help justinian there was no punishment fixed for such an offense it would fall under other laws but it would be harsh no one liked to be made a fool of her thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door a young priest came in whitefaced and struggling to control his emotion what is it constantine said are you ill anastasius is a physician he gestured briefly to include anna the priest waved a thin hand i am well enough no physician can heal what ails us all the envoys are back from lyons it was a complete capitulation they gave up everything appeals to the pope money the filioque clause tears glistened in his eyes constantine stared at the priest his face white with horror then slowly the blood suffused his skin cowards he snarled between his teeth what did they bring back with themthirty pieces of silver safety from the crusading armies when they pass this way on their path to jerusalem the priest said wretchedly his voice quavering anna knew this was a higher reward than perhaps this young priest understood with a chill passing through her she remembered zoe chrysaphes and the terror that so clearly still haunted her when she felt the flame sear her skin seventy years afterward constantine was watching her they have no faith he snapped his lips drawn back in contempt do you know what happened when we were besieged by barbarians but kept our faith with the holy virgin and carried her image in our hearts and before our eyes do you yes annas father had told her the story many times his eyes wistful half smiling constantine was waiting standing with his arms spread out his pale robes splendid in the light he looked enormous intimidating the barbarian armies stood before the city anna recounted obediently we were vastly outnumbered their leader rode forward on his horse a huge heavy man savage as an animal the emperor went out to meet him carrying the icon of the virgin mary before him the barbarian leader was struck dead on the spot and his army fled not one of our men was injured and not a stone of the city broken such perfect faith still gave her a strange bubble of excitement inside as if a warmth had broken open within her she did not know if the year or the details were exact but she believed the spirit of it you knew it constantine said triumphantly and also when we were besieged by the avars in we carried the icon of the blessed virgin along the halls and the siege was raised he turned to the priest his face glowing then why is it that the envoys of our emperor who styles himself equal of the apostles do not how can he even bargain with the devil let alone yield to him its not the barbarians who will defeat us this time its our own doubt his hands clenched we are not conquered by the hordes of charles of anjou or even the liars and hucksters of rome but betrayed by our own princes who have lost their faith in christ and the holy virgin he swung around to anna you understand dont you she saw a desperate loneliness in his eyes michael does not speak for the people he said in little more than a whisper if we believe enough well be strong we may persuade them to trust in god emotion thickened his voice help me anastasius be strong help me keep the faith we have nurtured and guarded for a thousand years the passions churned inside her conflicting faith and guilt love of the beautiful and loathing of the darkness within herself the memories of hate constantine was quick sensitive as if he could taste annas turmoil even without understanding it be strong he urged his voice now gentle you have a great work in your hands god will help you if only you believe she was startled how i have no calling of course you have he answered you are a healer you are the left hand of the priest the mender of the body the comforter of pain the silencer of fears speak truth to those to whom you minister the word of god can heal all ills protect from the darkness withoutbut even more from that within i will she whispered we can turn the tide we will look to god not to rome constantine smiled he lifted his large white hand in the sign of the cross behind him the thin young priest echoed it wed know what to do about it if justinian were here simonis said grimly as anna later stood in the warm herbscented kitchen telling her the news its a disgrace a blasphemy simonis took a deep breath and turned away from the table to face anna what else have you learned about this bessarion weve been here almost a year and a half and his real murderer is still free someone must know as soon as the words were out of her mouth her face pinched with guilt she resumed her work slicing onions and mixing them with aromatic leaves if im clumsy i could make it worse anna tried to explain as you said whoever really killed bessarion is still here simonis froze her body stiffening are you in danger i dont think so anna replied but you are right i should look more closely at money bessarion was very wealthy but i cant find even a whisper that he came by it at anyone elses cost he doesnt seem to have cared very much he was all about faith and power simonis added perhaps you should look at that i will although i cant see that it has anything to do with justinian or antoninus twelve palombara and vicenze were held up by bad weather as the year waned and did not reach constantinople until november but their first formal duty would be to witness the signing by the emperor and the bishops of the orthodox church of the agreement reached at the council of lyons this was to take place on january of the following year after that they would continue as papal legates to byzantium it was the job of each to report to his holiness upon the other which made the whole exercise a juggling act of lies evasions and power as envoys of the pope it was expected that they would live well neither humility nor abstinence was expected of them and their choice of house immediately made even more obvious the differences in their characters this is magnificent vicenze said approvingly of a great house not far from the blachernae palace which would be made available to them at a reasonable price no one calling here will mistake our mission or whom we represent he stood in the middle of the tessellated floor and surveyed the exquisitely painted walls the arched ceiling with its perfect proportions and the ornate pillars palombara looked at it with distaste its expensive he agreed but its vulgar i think its new would you prefer some nice aretino castle perhaps familiar and comfortable vicenze said sarcastically all little stones and sharp angles i would like something a little less brash palombara replied trying to keep the coldness out of his voice vicenze was from florence which had been engaged in a bitter artistic and political rivalry with arezzo for years he knew that was what lay behind the remark vicenze regarded him sourly this will impress people and it is convenient we can walk to most of the places we shall need to go it is near the palace the emperor lives in now palombara turned around slowly his eyes stopping at the heavily crowned pillars they will think we are barbarians its money without taste vicenzes long bony face was bleak with incomprehension and a growing impatience he considered preoccupation with the arts to be effete a digression from the work of god it doesnt matter whether they like us or not only whether they believe what we say palombara settled to the conflict with a sense of satisfaction the man was obedient without imagination and dogged as an animal following a scent in fact there was something faintly canine in the way he sniffed vicenze sought nothing but a sterile obedient power for himself it is ugly palombara insisted with harshness in his voice the other house to the north has grace of proportion and quite sufficient room for us and we can see the golden horn from the windows to what purpose vicenze asked his face completely innocent we are here to learn not to teach palombara said as if explaining to someone slow of wit we wish people to feel comfortable when we speak with them and let down their guard we need to know them know your enemy vicenze said with a slight smile as if the answer had satisfied him he conceded to palombaras choice of a more modest house our brothers in christ palombara retorted temporarily alienated he added dryly the humor there only to please himself palombara set out to explore the city which in spite of the winter weather brisk winds off the water and occasional rain he found fascinating it was not particularly cold and he was perfectly comfortable to walk a roman bishops dress was not remarkable here in streets where so many nations and faiths passed one another every day after a long day of studious walking he was exhausted and his feet were blistered but he understood the broad layout of the city the following day he was stiff to vicenzes sarcastic pleasure but the day after ignoring blisters he wandered in his own neighborhood the weather was fine with bright sun and little wind the streets were narrow old and bustling not unlike the roman ones he was accustomed to he bought lunch from a peddler and ate it while watching two old men playing chess the board was set out on a table barely large enough to hold it the carved wooden pieces were worn from use and darkened with the natural oils of the hands that had held them one old man had a lean face a white beard and black eyes almost hidden in the wrinkles of his skin the other was bearded also but nearly bald they played with total dedication oblivious to the world around them other people passed by children shouted across the street donkey carts rumbled over the stones a peddler asked them if they wished for anything and was not heard palombara watched their faces and saw the intense pleasure in them an almost fierce joy at the intricacy of the mental battle he waited for a full hour until it was finished the thin man won and ordered the best wine in the house and fresh bread goat cheese and dried fruit so they could both celebrate which they did with as great a delight as they had in playing he returned earlier the next day and watched the game from the beginning this time the other man won but there was just the same celebration at the end suddenly he was overwhelmed by the arrogance of coming here to tell old men like these what they should believe he stood up and walked away into the wind and sun too disturbed in mind to think clearly yet the ideas raced in his head one day in early january having forced himself to work with vicenze on the coming signing of the agreement palombara escaped to a public restaurant he sat deliberately close to another table where two middleaged men were involved in a fierce debate on the byzantines favorite subjectreligion one of the men observed palombara listening and immediately drew him in asking his opinion yes the other added eagerly what do you think palombara considered for several seconds before plunging in with a quote from saint thomas aquinas the brilliant theologian who had died on his way to the council of lyons ah the first man said quickly doctor angelicus very good do you agree that his choosing to stop his own greatest work the summa theologica was right palombara was taken aback he hesitated good the man said with a brilliant smile you dont know that is the beginning of wisdom didnt he say that all he had written was as straw compared with what he had seen in a vision albertus magnus who knew him well said that his works would fill the world his friend argued he swung around to palombara he was italian may god rest his soul did you know him palombara remembered meeting him once a large man corpulent darkskinned and immensely courteous one could not help but like him yes he answered and described the occasion and what had been said the second man seized on it as if he had found a treasure and both attacked the ideas with intense enjoyment then they immediately moved on to discuss francis of assisi and his refusal to be ordained was that good or bad arrogance or humility palombara was delighted the freeflowing urgency of it was like the wind off an ocean erratic undisciplined dangerous but sweeping in from an endless horizon it was not until he was joined unexpectedly by vicenze that suddenly he realized how far he had strayed from the accepted doctrine having overheard some of the conversation vicenze interrupted in a tone barely civil saying that he had urgent news and palombara was to come immediately since it was merely an acquaintance fallen into by chance palombara had no excuse to finish the discussion he pardoned himself reluctantly and walked out into the street with vicenze angry and frustrated startled by his sense of loss what is this news he asked coldly he resented not only the interruption but the highhanded manner in which vicenze had made it and now his tightlipped expression of disapproval we have been summoned to present ourselves to the emperor vicenze replied i have been arranging this while you have been philosophizing with atheists try to remember you serve the pope i would like to think i serve god palombara said quietly i would like to think you do too vicenze retaliated but i doubt it palombara changed the subject why does the emperor wish to see us if i knew what he wanted i would have told you vicenze snapped palombara didnt think so but it was not worth an argument their audience with emperor michael palaeologus was held in the blachernae palace to palombara who had learned a little of its history the glories of the past seemed to haunt the air like bright ghosts lost in the grayer present all the walls he passed had once been without blemish inlaid with porphyry and alabaster hung with icons every niche had had its statue or its bronze some of the greatest works of art in the world had stood here marbles of phidias and praxiteles from the classical age before christ he had seen the smoke stains of the crusader invasion in the city and was ashamed of it here he saw the scars of poverty also the tapestries unmended the mosaics with broken pieces columns and pilasters chipped for all their pretense in serving god what barbarians of the heart the crusaders were there were many kinds of unbelief they were conducted into the presence of the emperor in a magnificent hall with huge windows overlooking the golden horn the view of the city far below was a vast panorama of roofs and towers spires masts of ships in the harbor and clustered houses on the far shore the hall itself was marblefloored with porphyry columns that held up a ceiling ornately decorated with mosaic arches that flickered here and there with gold but all that was only a fleeting impression as palombara walked toward the emperor he was startled by the inner vitality of the man he was dark with thick hair and a full beard his clothes were silk heavily embroidered and jeweled as one would expect he wore not only the customary tunic and dalmatica but also a sort of collar that ended with something like a priests breastplate at the front this was crusted with gems and ringed around the edges with pearls and gold thread he wore it as if he were accustomed to it and it were of no importance palombara remembered with a jolt that michael was considered to be equal of the apostles he was a brilliant soldier who had led his people through battle and exile and back to their own city he had regained his empire by his own hand they would be foolish to underestimate him the emperor gave palombara and vicenze all the appropriate formal greetings and invited them to be seated the protocol for the signing of the agreement had already been arranged there did not seem to be anything further to discuss but if there were it would be done with less senior officials the princes and prelates of the orthodox church are aware of the choices facing us and the necessities driving us michael said quietly glancing from one to the other however the cost to us is high and not all are willing to pay we are here to be of any assistance we may majesty vicenze felt compelled to fill the silence i know a faint smile played on michaels lips and you bishop palombara he asked softly do you also offer your assistance to our cause or does bishop vicenze speak for both of you palombara felt the blood burn up his face he must not give michael leverage so quickly the emperors black eyes reflected his laughter he nodded good then we wish for the same result but for different reasons and perhaps in different waysi for the safety of my people and perhaps for the survival of my city you for your ambition you do not want to return to rome emptyhanded you will get no cardinals hat not for failure palombara winced michael was rather too much of a realist but life had given him little chance to be anything else the emperor chose union under rome as the only chance for survival not for any meeting of beliefs he was letting them know that in case they cherished any notions that they could reach him with a religious conversion he was orthodox to the bone but he meant to survive i understand majesty palombara answered we are faced with hard choices we pick the best of them vicenze bowed so slightly it was barely discernible we will do what is right majesty we understand that haste would be unfortunate michael looked at him dubiously very unfortunate he agreed vicenze drew in his breath sharply palombara froze dreading the clumsiness of what vicenze might say and yet a tiny part of him wishing for his downfall michael waited there would be little to recommend failure in any way palombara said quietly as a matter of pride he wanted michael to see him quite separately from vicenze indeed michael nodded then he looked beyond them and signaled for someone to come forward he was obeyed by a person of curious stature walking with an oddly graceful gate his face was large and beardless and when he spoke with the emperors permission his voice was as soft as a womans and yet not feminine michael introduced him as bishop constantine they acknowledged each other formally and with some discomfort constantine turned to michael majesty he said emphatically the patriarch cyril choniates should also be consulted his approval would be of great service toward persuading the people to accept unity with rome perhaps you have not been advised of the depth of feeling there is he phrased it as a question but the emotion in his voice made it into a warning palombara found him an uncomfortable presence because of his indeterminate masculinity but the strange person also seemed to be laboring to hide some passion he was afraid to show yet it was so powerful that it broke through in the ridiculous gestures of his pale heavy hands and now and then in a loss of control in his voice michaels face darkened cyril choniates is no longer in office constantine was not deflected the monks are likely to be the most difficult section of the church to convince that we should forfeit our ancient ways and submit to rome majesty he stated cyril could help with that michael stared at him the expression in his face changing from certainty to doubt you puzzle me constantine he said at last first you are against union now you are addressing me how best to smooth the path for it you seem to change like water in the wind suddenly palombara had an acutely awkward awareness as if someone had taken a blindfold from his eyes how could he have been so slow to see bishop constantine was one of the eunuchs of the court of byzantium palombara found himself looking away and was aware of a heat in his cheeks and a disturbing consciousness of his own wholeness he had associated passion and strength with masculinity and effeminacy with change weakness lack of decision or courage it seemed michael felt the same the sea is made of water majesty constantine said softly staring at michael without lowering his glance christ walked upon the lake of gennesareth but we would be wise to treat it with greater caution and respect or else lacking faith as peter did we may drown without a divine hand reaching to save us the silence prickled in the great room michael drew in his breath slowly then let it out again he studied the bishops face for a long time constantine did not waver vicenze drew in his breath to speak and palombara poked him sharply with his elbow he heard vicenze gasp i have no confidence that cyril choniates will see the necessity of union michael said at last he is an idealist and i am guardian of the practical practicality is the art of what will work majesty constantine replied i know you are too good a son of the church to suggest that faith in god does not work palombara barely hid a smile but no one was looking at him if i decide to seek cyrils help michael said carefully his eyes unwavering i know you will be the man to send to him constantine until then i look to you to persuade your flock to keep faith both in god and in your emperor constantine bowed but there was little obeisance in it a few moments later palombara and vicenze were permitted to leave that eunuch could prove a nuisance vicenze said in italian as the varangian guard accompanied them on their way out into the air where there was a breathtaking view of the city beneath them he gave a little shiver and his lip curled with distaste if we cannot convert people like thathe carefully avoided using the term manthen we will have to think of a way of subverting their power at the height of their power eunuchs ran the whole court and much of the government palombara informed vicenze with perverse satisfaction they were bishops generals in the army ministers of government and law mathematicians philosophers and physicians well rome will put an end to that vicenze said with savage satisfaction we are not come a day too late and he marched forward leaving palombara to catch up with him thirteen palombara busied himself learning more about how the emperor might strengthen his position in the eyes of his people if they truly regarded him as equal of the apostles then they might believe he guided them righteously in their religious choice as he had in their military and governmental ones he went to the great cathedral of the hagia sophia but it was not to worship and certainly not to partake in the orthodox mass he wished to experience the differences between the greek and the roman the service was more emotionally moving than he had expected there was a passionate solemnity to it in this ancient cathedral with its mosaics its icons and its pillars the goldsurfaced niches surrounding the marvelous sombereyed figures of saints the madonna and christ himself in the dim light they glowed with an almost animate presence and in spite of himself he found his intellectual appreciation overtaken by awe for the genius and the beauty of it the vast dome seemed almost to float above its high circle of windows as if there were no support for it of brick or stone he had heard the legend that the building of it was beyond human ability and that the dome itself had been miraculously suspended from heaven by a golden chain held by angels until the pillars could be secured the tale had amused him at the time but here in this glory it did not seem impossible he was on the outer steps when he saw a little apart from the crowd a woman of more than average height she had an extraordinary face she was at least sixty possibly more but she stood with a perfect even arrogant posture she had high cheekbones a mouth too wide too sensuous and heavylidded golden eyes she was looking at him singling him out he felt both flattered and uncomfortable as she approached him you are the papal legate from rome her voice was strong and seen closer up her face was full of a vitality that demanded his attention and his interest i am he agreed enrico palombara she gave a slight shrug it was almost a voluptuous gesture zoe chrysaphes she answered have you come to see the home of the holy wisdom before you attempt to destroy it does its beauty touch your soul or only your eyes nothing in her invited pity she was an aspect of byzantium he had not seen beforeperhaps the ancient spirit that had survived the barbarians when rome had fallen passionate dangerous and intensely greek the energy in her fascinated him as a flame draws a night insect what is perceived only by the eyes does not necessarily have meaning he replied she smiled instantly aware of the subtle flattery implied and amused by it this could be the beginning of a long duel if she really cared about the orthodox faith and keeping it from roman contamination she arched her fine brows how could i know we have nothing meaningless the laughter in her was almost expressed he waited have you no fear that perhaps you are wrong to demand our submission she asked at length does it not waken you in the night when you are alone and the darkness around you is full of thoughts good and evil then do you not wonder if it is the devil who speaks to you and not god he was startled it was not what he had expected her to say she was staring at him searching his eyes then she laughed a fullthroated rich sound of pulsing life ah i see you dont hear anyones voice at alldo youonly silence eternal silence that is romes secretthere is no one there except yourselves he looked at the intelligence and the victory in her face she had seen the emptiness inside him he stood still facing her while the departing people swirled around them he could sense her pain like the touch of fire he could even empathize with her but in the end the union was going to happen with or without zoe chrysaphess agreement all this unique glory of the eye the ear and above all the mind could be destroyed by the ignorant if the crusader armies stormed through here yet again knowing her might give him an advantage it would be wise not to let vicenze know about in the weeks that followed palombara pursued his interest in zoe chrysaphes discreetly listening for her name rather than raising it himself collecting many facts about her once powerful family her only child helena who had married into the ancient imperial house of comnenos had been recently widowed by murder it was rumored that zoe had been mistress to many men possibly michael palaeologus himself palombara was inclined to believe it even now there was a sensuality about her a savagery and a life force that made other women seem tame for a moment he regretted that he was a papal legate abroad where he dared not slip the traces vicenze was always watching and anyway zoe would not entertain lovers simply for the pleasure of it physical passion with her would have been a good battle one worth the fighting win or lose it would always have been of the mind as well even if rarely of the heart it was up to him to bring about the next encounter which he did by hunting along mese street for an unusual gift for her he wanted something individual that would earn her curiosity then he could visit her ostensibly to seek her advice he knew enough about her now to make that credible he was shown into her magnificent room which overlooked the city and the bosphorus beyond it was like stepping back into the old city before the sack its glory fading only a little its pride still secure there were tapestries on the walls rich and dark their colors were subdued by the centuries but not worn dim only muted in places where the light had softened their tones the floor was marble smoothed by the passage of generations of feet the ceiling in places was inlaid with gold on one wall hung a gold cross nearly two feet long the figure on it so exquisitely crafted that it seemed about to twist in a last agony zoe wore a tunic of amber color under a darker more vibrant dalmatica and it was fastened with a gold pin set with garnets she looked amused as if she had known he would come but perhaps not so soon there was another person present about zoes height but dressed in a plain tunic and dark blue dalmatica he stood nearer the corner of the room occupied with packing away powders into little boxes palombara could smell the rich aroma of them some sort of crushed herbs zoe ignored the other person so palombara did also i found a small gift i hope will interest you he said holding out what he had brought wrapped in red silk it fitted neatly into the palm of his lean outstretched hand she looked at it her golden eyes curious as yet unimpressed why she asked because from you i can learn more of the soul of byzantium than from anyone else he replied with total honesty and i wish to have that knowledge rather than my fellow legate vicenze he allowed himself to smile a flash of amusement lighting her expression she then opened the silk and took out a piece of amber the size of a small birds egg inside it a spider was caught perfectly immortalized in the moment before victory the fly a hairbreadth beyond its reach she did not hide her fascination with it or her pleasure anastasius she said turning to the person with the herbs come see what the papal legate from rome has brought me palombara saw that it was another eunuch smaller in stature and younger than bishop constantine but with the same smooth hairless face andwhen he spokethe same unbroken voice disturbing he remarked looking at it closely very clever you think so zoe asked him anastasius smiled a graphic picture of the instant and of eternity he replied you think the prize is in your grasp and it eludes you forever that moment is frozen and a thousand years later you are still poised and emptyhanded he looked across at palombara who was struck by the intelligence and the courage in his eyes they were cool and gray utterly unlike zoes although the rest of his coloring was almost the same and he too had high cheekbones and a sensuous mouth it disturbed palombara that anastasius had seen so much in the amber more than he had himself zoe was watching is that what you mean to say to me enrico palombara she asked she refused to call him your grace because he was a bishop of rome not of byzantium i wished it to give you pleasure and interest he answered speaking to her not the eunuch it will say whatever you read into it speaking of mortality zoe went on if you should fall ill while you are in constantinople i can recommend anastasius he is an excellent physician and he will cure your illness without preaching to you of your sins a trifle jewish but very effective i know my sins already and find it tedious being told of them again dont you especially when i am not feeling well that depends upon whether they are being envied or despised palombara said lightly he saw a flicker of laughter in the eunuchs face but it was gone again almost before he was certain of it zoe saw it also explain yourself she ordered anastasius anastasius shrugged it was a gesture oddly feminine yet he seemed not to have the volatile emotionalism of constantine i think that contempt is the cloak that envy wears he replied to zoe smiling as he said it what should we feel for sin palombara asked quickly before zoe could speak anger anastasius looked at him steadily with an oddly unnerving stare not unless one is afraid of it he said do you suppose god is afraid of sin palombaras reply was instant that would be ridiculous but we are not god at least we in rome do not think we are he added anastasiuss smile broadened we in byzantium do not think you are either he agreed palombara laughed in spite of himself but it was out of embarrassment as well as humor he did not know what to make of anastasius one moment he seemed lucid intellectual like a man and the next joltingly feminine palombara found himself wrongfooted too often he thought of one of the silks he had seen in the markets hold it up one way and the light picked up the blue then turn it and it was green the character of eunuchs was like the sheen on the silkfluid unpredictable a third gender male and female yet neither zoe turned the amber over in her hand this is worthy of a favor she said to palombara her eyes bright what is it you want she flashed a glance at the eunuch palombara saw irritation in it and perhaps a momentary contempt but then a woman of passion and sensuality like zoe would never forget that anastasius was not a whole man what did it feel like to be denied that most basic of appetites to be hungry is to be alive palombara wondered if there was anything anastasius wanted with that intensity burning in his eyes he told her what he had come for knowledge of course zoe blinked knowledge of whom he glanced at anastasius zoe smiled looking anastasius up and down as if measuring whether he was worthy of dismissing or like a servant too unimportant to matter anastasius took the decision himself the herbs are on the table he told zoe if they please you i will bring more if not then i shall suggest something else he turned to palombara your grace i hope your stay in constantinople will be interesting he bowed to zoe and walked away picking up his bag of herbs as he left he moved stiffly as if he had to be careful to keep his balance or maybe his dignity palombara wondered if perhaps he had pain of some acutely private nature a wound never entirely healed how could a man endure such a thingsuch an indignity a mutilationwithout a bitterness of soul he was sufficiently effeminate perhaps they had removed not only his testicles but everything what an incomprehensible mixture of beauty wisdom and barbarity eunuchs were rome should fear them more than it did he turned back to zoe prepared to listen to all she would say of her city and regard it all with interest and skepticism fourteen constantine stood in his favorite room of the house his hand caressing the smooth marble of the statue its head was buried in thought its naked limbs perfect he passed his hand over it again moving his fingers as if he could knead it and feel muscle and nerve in the stone shoulders his own body was so tightly knotted that he ached michael had reenacted the signing affirming it for all constantinople to see and to satisfy rome and constantine had been helpless to prevent it it would be a mark of subservience a signal to the world and above all to god that the people of byzantium had forsaken their faith those who had trusted the leadership of the church would be destroyed by the very men sworn to save their souls how infinitely shortsighted selling today to purchase tomorrows safety what about their salvation in eternity was that not more important than any earthly thing but he had known what to do and he had done it as he thought of it the sweat broke out on his body even here in this cool room the byzantime people had a right to fight for life and that he had done he had lit the fire in their hearts and it had exploded into a riot in the streets scores and then hundreds pouring into the squares and marketplaces crying out against the union with rome and everything alien and forced of course constantine had contrived to look as if he were doing all in his power to stop them to sympathize and yet try to stem the violence to plead for order and respect while leading them on what difference was there between a gesture of blessing and one of encouragement it lay in the angle of the hand the inflection of a voice carefully raised not quite loudly enough to be heard above the din it had been marvelous superb they had come in their thousands filling the streets until they choked the byways he could still hear their voices as he stood here in his quiet room there the blood had pounded in his veins his heart racing sweat of heat and danger running off his skin as the noise carried him along constantine constantine in the name of god and the holy virgin constantine for the faith he had smiled at them stepping back a pace or two as if to decline in modesty but they had shouted the louder constantine lead us to victory for the holy virgins sake he had lifted his hands in blessing and gradually they had calmed the shouting ceased they stood in the square and in the streets beyond silent waiting for him to tell them what to do have faith gods power is greater than that of any man he had told them we know what is truth and what is false what is of christ and what of the devil go home fast and pray be loyal to the church and god will be loyal to you god would save them from rome only if their faith were perfect and it was constantines mission to do everything heavenly possible to see that it was a few days later michael retaliated the vacant throne of the patriarch of byzantium was given not to the eunuch constantine but to a whole man john beccus the servant who brought constantine the news was whitefaced as if he carried word of death he stood in front of constantine eyes lowered his breath loud in the room constantine wanted to scream at the man but that would expose his pain like his own nakedness incomplete marred by circumstance outside his mastery he had been doubly castrated robbed of the office that was rightfully his by virtue faith and the will to fight john beccus was for the union with rome a coward and a traitor to his church go constantines voice was rasping from a throat raw with pain the servant stared at him and then fled when his footsteps had ceased to sound on the stones constantine let out a howl of fury and humiliation hatred was like fire in his soul he could have torn john beccus apart if he had laid hands on him at this moment a whole man an insult to constantines existence as if organs made the soul a man was his passions of the heart his dreams the things he longed for the fears he had overcome the wholeness of his sacrifice not of his body was a man better because he could put his seed into a woman beasts of the field could do that was a man holier because he had that power and abstained from using it constantine could take a knife and slice beccuss testicles see the blood flow as it had from his own body as a boy see the agony the terror of bleeding to death then watch him clutch at what was left of his manhood with a horror at his loss that would never leave him as long as he existed they would be equal then see who could lead the church and save it from rome but it was only a dream like other images in the night he could not do it his power was in the love and the belief of the people they must never see his hatred it was weakness it was sin could the holy virgin read his heart his face burned scarlet with shame slowly he knelt tears wet on his face beccus was wrong he was a liar a time server a seeker after favor and office and his own power how could a good man pretend to approve that constantine asked himself whether he was a good man he could make himself be and he must he rose to his feet to begin now today there was no time to waste he would show john beccus he would show them all the people loved him his faith his mercy his humility and courage his will to fight in the uncounted days that followed he worked until exhaustion overcame him taking no thought or care for his own needs he answered every call he could walking miles from one house to another to hear confessions of the dying and give them absolution families wept with gratitude for such peace of heart he left with aching legs and blistered feet but soaring spirits in the certainty that he was loved and for his sake an ever increasing number of people would remain loyal to the true church he celebrated the mass so often he felt sometimes as if he were doing it in his sleep the words reciting themselves but the eager faces were all the reward he wanted the humble grateful hearts when he lay down exhausted it was often on the floor of wherever he was when night came and he thought nothing of it he rose at daybreak and ate what the wretched could spare him it was very late one night when he was listening to the confession of a bullchested man something of a local leader and a bully that he began to feel ill i beat him the man said quietly his eyes meeting constantines uncertainly clouded with fear i broke some of his bones did he constantine began and then found he could not draw his breath his heart was beating so loudly he thought the man kneeling before him must hear it also he was dizzy he tried to speak again but he could hear nothing but a roaring in his ears and the moment after he was plunging into oblivion for all he knew death itself he awoke in his own house his head pounding his stomach sick and cramped with pain his servant manuel stood beside the bed let me send for a physician he begged we have prayed but it is not enough no constantine said quickly but even his voice was weak his stomach knotted again and he was afraid he was going to be sick he tried to get up to relieve himself urgently but the pain doubled him over he called for manuel to help him twenty minutes later drenched in sweat and so weak that he could not stand without help he collapsed on the bed and allowed manuel to pull the covers over him now suddenly he was cold but at least he could lie still manual asked again for permission to send for a physician and again constantine refused sleep would cure him constantine lay still his belly quiet but the fear gripped his heart like an iron clamp twisting inside him he dared not lie down in the dark when the light spiraled away from him his skin slick with sweat again and yet his limbs ice cold manuel his voice was shrill almost hysterical manuel appeared candle in his hand his face tight with fear get anastasius for me constantine conceded at last tell him it is urgent the pain shot through his belly again but first assist me he must relieve himself again quickly he must have help he also thought he was about to be sick anastasius was another eunuch and would not pity his mutilation or be repelled by it he had had a whole physician once and seen the prurient revulsion in the mans eyes never again hed rather die anastasius would have only understanding he too was lost uncertain carrying a burden somewhere inside him that was too heavy constantine had seen it in his face in unguarded moments one day he would learn what it was yes send for anastasius quickly fifteen anna could see from the servants manner and the high pitch of his voice that he was seriously alarmed but quite apart from that she knew that constantine a proud and private man would not have sent for her were the matter not grave how does the illness show itself she asked where is the pain i dont know please come i want to know what to bring with me anna explained it would be far better than having to return for it oh now the man understood in his abdomen he does not eat or drink relieves himself often and yet the pain does not go he shifted his weight from one foot to the other impatiently as quickly as she could she packed in a small case all the herbs she thought mostly likely to help she also took a few eastern herbs from shachar and from alqadir whose names she would not tell constantine she informed simonis where she was going then followed the man out into the street and down the hill as rapidly as she could walk she was ushered straight into the bedchamber where constantine was lying his night tunic tangled and soaked with sweat and his skin a pasty gray im sorry you feel so ill she said quietly when did it begin she was startled to see the fear in his sunken eyes naked and out of control last night he answered i was listening to confession and suddenly the room went black she touched his brow with her hand it was cool and clammy she could smell the sharp stale odor of sweat and sour body waste she found his pulse it was strong but racing do you have pain now she asked not now she judged that to be only a halftruth when did you last eat he looked puzzled if you dont remember it was too long ago she studied his arm where it lay across his chest she must never let him know she had seen the terror in him he would not forgive her that she must examine him intimately alsoat least his belly to see if it was swollen or perhaps if his bowel was obstructed he might never forgive her that either if his castration was untidya bad mutilation she had heard that they varied a great deal some eunuchs had had all organs removed and needed to insert a tube to pass water she hesitated she was taking a terrible risk it was an intrusion from which there was no return yet her medical duty to him forbade that she withhold any treatment she believed could help she had no choice gently she took the skin of his arm between her thumb and finger it was slack loose on the underlying flesh bring me water she told the servant still waiting at the door and get the juice of pomegranates preferably not quite ripe if you have them bring it to me in a jug one jugful will do to start with she handed the servant the honey and spikenard and told him the proportions to add constantines body was drained of fluids have you vomited she asked him he winced yes only once she knew from the feel of his skin and his sunken eyes that he had lost far too much fluid from his body perhaps it was unintentional she told him but you have starved yourself and drunk too little i was working with the poor he answered weakly his eyes avoided hers but she did not think it was because he was lying she suspected that he loathed the intrusion of anyone seeing him like this what is wrong with me he asked is it a sin unto death she was stunned the fear was deep and raw in him indecently exposed how could she answer him with honesty that was true both to medicine and to faith it is not only guilt which afflicts she said gently anger can also and sometimes grief you have spent too much of your strength in ministering to others and have neglected yourself and yes perhaps that is a sin god gave you your body to use in his service not to illtreat it that is an ungrateful thing to do maybe you need to repent of that he stared at her grasping at what she had said turning it over and weighing it gradually some of the fear eased away as if miraculously she had not said what he dreaded his hand gripping the sheet loosed a little she smiled take better thought for yourself in future you cannot serve either god or man in this state he breathed in deeply and let out a sigh you must drink she told him i have brought herbs which will cleanse and strengthen you you must eat but with care bread that has been well kneaded hens eggs lightly boiled not goose or duck eggs you may eat lightly boiled meat of partridge or francolin or young kid not older animals a little stewed apple with honey would be good but avoid nuts then when you are ready in two or three days take a little fish gray mullet is good mostly you must drink water with juice mixed in have your servant wash you and bring you clean linen have him help you so you do not fall you are weak i shall give him a list of what other food to buy she saw in his face that he wished to ask more afraid it would be questions she could not answer without causing him confusion or distress she gave him no time bidding him goodbye and promising to return soon early the following morning she went to check his progress he looked gaunt in the full daylight his cheeks sunken his skin colorless papery oddly like a very large old woman his pale hands on the bedcover seemed enormous his arms fleshy she was moved with a wave of intense pity for him but was careful that he should not see it in her eyes the people are praying for you she told him philippos maria and angelos stopped me when they heard i had called on you they are very concerned he smiled the light returning to his eyes really did he fear she was saying it to please him yes some even fast and keep vigil they love you and i think also they are very afraid of facing the future without you tell them i need their support anastasius thank them for me i will she promised embarrassed by his need for so much reassurance when he was better would he remember this and hate her for having seen too much the following day manuel once again opened the door to anna his eyes went immediately to the basket she was carrying strengthening foods prepared by simonis for the ailing bishop food for the bishop she explained how is he much better manuel replied the pain is less but he is still very weak indeed it will take time but he will recover she passed him the soup with instructions to heat it and left the bread on the table she went through to constantines bedroom knocking on the door and waiting for his answer before she went in while he was sitting up in bed he still looked holloweyed and pale a whole man would have been stubblechinned by now but constantines face looked curiously soft how are you she asked improved he replied but she could see he was tired she felt his brow then his pulse then gently pinched the skin on his forearm again he was still clammy and his flesh slack but his pulse was steadier she made a few more inquiries about his pain by which time manuel arrived with the soup and bread she sat beside constantine steadying his hand as he ate gently helping him steeling herself to ask the questions please eat she encouraged we need you to be strong i do not wish to be governed by rome it will destroy a great deal of what i believe to be true and of infinite value it is a tragedy that bessarion comnenos was murdered she hesitated do you think that could have been prompted by rome his eyes widened and his hand stopped with the spoon in the air the thought had not occurred to him she could see him searching for the answer he wanted to give i had not considered it he admitted finally perhaps i should have would it not have served their interest she pressed bessarion was passionately against union he was of imperial blood might he have led a resurgence of faith among the people that would have made union impossible he was still staring at her the last of the soup temporarily forgotten have you heard anyone say so he asked his voice low and with a sudden sharp note of fear in it if i were of the roman faith perhaps hoping to assist the union myself either for religious reasons or ambition i would not want a leader such as bessarion alive and well she said urgently a curious look passed over constantines face a mixture of surprise and wariness she plunged on might justinian lascaris have been in the pay of rome do you suppose never he said instantly then he stopped as if he had committed himself too quickly at least he is the last man i would have thought it of she could not let this opportunity slip by what other reason do you think justinian could have had for killing bessarion did he hate him was there a rivalry between them or money no he said quickly pushing aside the tray that held his food there was no rivalry or hate at least on justinians part and no money justinian was a wealthy man and prospering more each year every reason i know of says he would wish bessarion alive he was profoundly against the union and supported bessarion in his work against it at times i thought he did the more work of the two against the union of course constantine shook his head i cannot believe justinian would work for rome he was an honorable man of more courage and decisiveness than bessarion i think that is why i spoke for him to the emperor in plea that the sentence be commuted to exile it was certainly his boat that was used to dispose of the body but it might have been without his knowledge antoninus confessed but he did not implicate justinian what do you think was the truth she could not leave it now she touched on the subject ugliest in her mind could it not have been personal to do with helena i do not believe justinian had any feelings for helena most certainly not of that kind she is beautiful anna pointed out constantine looked slightly surprised i suppose so there is no modesty in her no humility true anna conceded but those are not always qualities that men look for constantine shifted a little in the bed as if he were uncomfortable justinian told me that helena had once made it very clear that she wished him to lie with her and he had refused he told me that he still loved his wife who had died not long before and he could not yet think of another woman least of all helena constantine smoothed his hands over the rumpled sheet he showed me a painting of his wife very small only a couple of inches square so that he could carry it with him she looked very beautiful to me a gentle face intelligent her name was catalina the way justinian said it made me believe everything he said anna took the tray from the side of the bed and rose to put them on a table at the far side of the room it gave her a chance to compose herself his words the story of justinian and catalinas portrait brought their presence so sharply to her mind that the loss was almost like a physical pain she put down the tray and turned back to constantine then he would have wanted bessarion alive wouldnt he she asked both to lead the struggle against the union and to excuse him from having to justify his refusal of helena that is another reason i pleaded for his exile constantine said sadly then who did help kill bessarion could we not prove it and have justinian freed she saw the surprise in his face would it not be our holy duty she amended quickly added to which of course he could return and continue in the struggle against rome i dont know who helped kill bessarion he said spreading his hands in a gesture of helplessness if i did dont you think i would already have told the emperor his tone had changed she was convinced he was lying but it was impossible to challenge him she should retreat now before she antagonized him or aroused his suspicion as to why she should care so much i suppose it was some other friend of antoninus she said as lightly as she could why did he kill him anyway i dont know that either constantine sighed again she was certain he was lying im glad you liked the soup she said with a slight smile thank you he smiled back now i think i will go to sleep for a while sixteen giuliano dandolo stood on the steps of the landing stage and watched the water of the canal rippling in the torchlight he smiled in spite of the faint sense of unrest he felt one moment the wavelets were crested with glittering ribbons of light the next they were shadowed and as dense as if he could walk out over them and they would bear his weight everything was shifting beautiful and uncertain like venice itself his thoughts were disturbed by the sharper slap of water on the steps and as he moved forward he saw the outline of a small swiftly moving barge there were armed men standing on the sides and it slid smoothly to the mooring post and stopped the torches blazed up and the slender heavily robed figure of doge lorenzo tiepolo rose and in an easy movement stepped ashore he was in his later years his sons had all risen to eminence and many suggested it was purely by their fathers favor but then people always said such things tiepolo walked forward across the marble as the torchlight wavered in the rising breeze he was smiling his small heavylidded eyes bright and his hair silver like a halo good evening giuliano he said warmly did i keep you waiting it was a rhetorical question he was ruler of venice everyone waited for him he had known giuliano since he had been brought here as a small child nearly thirty years ago as he had known and loved giulianos father also still one did not take liberties a spring evening on the canal can hardly be thought of as waiting excellency giuliano replied falling into step with the doge but just behind him always the courtier tiepolo murmured as they crossed the piazza in front of the ornate ducal palace perhaps it is a good thing we have sufficient enemies he led the way inside through the great doors the guard before and behind him silent and watchful the day we have no enemies it will mean we have nothing for any man to envy giuliano replied a trifle dryly they took off their outdoor cloaks and walked along the highceilinged hall with its painted walls their feet loud on the inlaid floor tiepolos smile widened and no teeth to bite with he added he turned right into a high anteroom and then into his own chambers with their frescoed walls and heavy chandeliers the sandalwood table held dishes of dried dates and apricots and a selection of nuts the torches glimmered throwing warm light over the tessellated floor sit he waved his arm in the general direction of the carved chairs around the huge fireplace where a fire burned to warm the still chilly march air the great portrait of his father doge jacopo tiepolo hung above it wine he offered the red is from fiesole very good without waiting for an answer he took two of the glass tumblers and filled them then passed one to giuliano giuliano accepted it thanking him tiepolo had been his friend and patron since his own fathers death but he knew he had not been summoned simply for the pleasure of conversation that happened quite often but it was late at night for casual talk of art or food boat races beautiful women or far more entertainingly scandalous onesand of course of the sea tonight the doge was serious his narrow face with its long nose had a pensive expression and he moved uneasily as if paying more heed to the thoughts occupying his mind than to his actions giuliano waited tiepolo looked at the light through the wine in his glass but did not yet drink charles of anjou still cherishes his dreams of uniting the five ancient patriarchies of rome antioch jerusalem alexandria and byzantium again his look was bleak all under his own sovereignty of course then he would be count of anjou senator of rome king of naples and sicily and albania king of jerusalem lord of the patriarchates and of course uncle to the king of france such power in any one man would make me uneasy but in him it is a danger not only to venice but to the whole world his success would threaten our interests right along the east coast of the adriatic michael palaeologus has signed the agreement of unity with rome but my information tells me he will have considerably more difficulty in taking his people with him than the pope may imagine and we all know that the holy father is a passionate crusader he smiled bleakly he is reputed to have sworn the skill of his right hand that he will never forget jerusalem we would be wise to remember that giuliano waited which means he will aid charles at least in that tiepolo added then he would have rome on his side and jerusalem and antioch in his hands giuliano spoke at last would charles attack byzantium even though the emperor has signed the agreement of union and submitted to the pope surely he would then be attacking an equally christian city and the holy father could not countenance that tiepolo lifted one shoulder very slightly that might depend whether the people of byzantium especially the city of constantinople will honor the union giuliano thought about it aware of the doges eyes probing watching every flicker and shadow of his expression if charles of anjou took all five of the old patriarchies including constantinople astride the bosphorus he would hold the gateway to the black sea and everything beyond it trebizond samarkand and the old silk road to the east if he also gained control of alexandria and thus the nile and so egypt he would be the most powerful man in europe the trade of the world would pass through his hands popes came and went and the election of them would be his decision we have a dilemma tiepolo continued there are many elements to charless possible success our building ships for his crusade is only one of them and if we do not then genoa will we have to consider the profit and loss of our naval yards and of course our bankers and merchants and those who supply the knights foot soldiers and pilgrims we want them to pass through venice as they have always done it is a very considerable revenue giuliano sipped his wine and reached across to take half a dozen almonds there are other factors far less certain tiepolo continued michael palaeologus is a clever man he could not have retaken constantinople were he not he will have the same information we have or more he said the last with a rueful amusement in his eyes at last he also took a handful of nuts he will know what charles of anjou plans and he will know what rome intends to do to assist him he went on he will take all measures he can to prevent their success his eyes were steady on giulianos dark handsome face watching his reaction yes excellency giuliano answered but michael has a small navy and his army is already fully occupied elsewhere he said it with little pity he did not want to think of constantinople his father was venetian to the bone a junior son of the great dandolo family but his mother had been byzantine and he never willingly brought her back to his mind what sane man looks for pain so he will use guile tiepolo concluded in his place wouldnt you michael has just regained his capital city one of the great jewels of the world he will fight to the death before he gives it up again giuliano could remember his mother only as a sort of warmth a sweet smell and the touch of soft skin and then afterward an emptiness that nothing since had ever filled he had been about three when she had gone as bereaved as if she had died only she hadnt she had simply left him and his father choosing to stay in byzantium rather than be with them if constantinople were sacked again burned and looted by latin crusaders robbed of its treasures its palaces left charred and in ruins it would be a kind of justice but the thought gave him no pleasure the savage satisfaction was more pain than joy charles of anjous success would alter the fate of europe and of both the catholic church and the orthodox it might also quell the rising power of islam and redeem the holy land tiepolo leaned forward a little i dont know what michael palaeologus will do but i know what i would do in his place men can lead nations only so far charles of anjou is a frenchman king of naples by chance and ambition not birth the same is true of sicily if rumor is correct they have no love for him giuliano had heard the same whispers michael will use it he asked wouldnt you tiepolo said softly yes go to naples and see what manner of fleet charles plans how many ships what size when he plans to sail talk bargains and prices with him we will need even more good hardwood than usual if we are to build his fleet but also see what the people think tiepolo lowered his voice what do they say when they are hungry afraid when they have drunk too much and tongues are unguarded look for troublemakers see what strength they have and what weaknesses then go to sicily and do the same look for the poverty the discontent the love and hate beneath the surface giuliano should have realized what tiepolo wanted of him he was the ideal man for the job a skilled sailor who could command his own ship the son of a merchant father who knew the trade of the whole mediterranean and above all a man who had inherited the blood and the name of one of the greatest of all venetian families even if not their wealth it was his greatgrandfather doge enrico dandolo who had led the crusade that had taken constantinople in and when venice was cheated of its just payment for the ships and supplies he had brought the greatest of its treasures home in recompense tiepolo was smiling openly now the wineglass glinting in his hand and from sicily go to constantinople he went on see if they are repairing their defenses but more than that stay in the venetian quarter down by the golden horn see how strong it is how prosperous if charles attacks in venetian ships judge what they will do where are their loyalties their interests they are venetian and by now part byzantine how deep are their roots i need to know giuliano i give you no more than four months i cannot afford longer of course giuliano agreed good tiepolo nodded i will see that you have all you need money a good ship cargo to give you excuse and reason and men who will obey you and to whom you can trust your trade while you are ashore you will leave the day after tomorrow now drink your wine its excellent he lifted his own glass higher as if to demonstrate and put it to his lips in the evening of the following day giuliano met his closest friend pietro contarini and they dined together giuliano savored the tastes of wine and food as if he might be hungry for months to come they laughed over old jokes and sang songs they had known for years they had grown up together learned the same lessons discovered the pleasures of wine and women and the misfortunes as well they had fallen in love for the first time in the same month each confiding to the other the doubts and the pains the triumphs and then the agony of rejection when they had discovered that it was the same girl they had fought like wild dogs until first blood was drawn giulianos then instantly friendship was more important and they had ended laughing at themselves no woman had come between them since pietro had married several years ago and had a son of whom he was immensely proud and then two daughters however domestic responsibility had not dulled his eye for a pretty woman or robbed him of his joy in adventure now they sat in the tavern facing the long sweep of the grand canal amid the laughter and clink of glasses the smells of wine and salt water food and leather and smoke from cooling fires heres to adventure pietro raised his glass of rather good red wine to which giuliano had treated them both in honor of the occasion they touched glasses and drank heres to venice and everything venetian giuliano added may her glory never grow dim he emptied his glass what time is it do you think no idea why going to say goodbye to lucrezia giuliano replied wont see her for a while will you miss her pietro asked curiously not much giuliano said pietro had been nagging him to marry for some time even the thought of it made him feel trapped lucrezia was fun warm and generous at least physicallybut she was also cloying at times the thought of committing himself to her was like locking a door that trapped him inside he put his empty glass on the table and stood up he would enjoy being with lucrezia he had bought a gold filigree necklace to take her as a gift he had chosen it with care and he knew she would love it he would miss her her quiet laughter the softness of her touch but it still would not be hard to leave in the morning giuliano found naples a frightening and disturbingly beautiful place full of unexpected impressions the city had a vitality that excited him as if the people tasted both the joy and the tragedy of life with a wholehearted intensity greater than that of others it had been founded by the greeks hence its nameneapolis new cityand the narrow streets followed a pattern like a grid which the greeks had formed many of them were well over a thousand years old steep and shadowed by high houses giuliano listened to the laughter and the quarrels the haggling over olives and fruit and fish the splashing of fountains and the rattle of wheels he smelled cooking and clogged drains the perfume of bright trailing vines and flowers and human and animal waste he watched women scrubbing laundry by the fountains gossiping with one another laughing scolding their children their loyalty was to life not to any king italian or french the sun was bright and hotter than he was accustomed to he was familiar with light on water but the burning blue of the bay of naples stretching to the horizon had a brilliance to it that dazzled his eyes yet he was drawn again and again to stand and stare at it but always intruding into his mind was the ominous presence of mount vesuvius looming behind the city to the south now and then sending a breath of smoke up gently into the glittering peace of the sky looking at it giuliano could see so easily how it could drive people mad with the hunger for life the craving that would make you seize everything gorging on every taste in case tomorrow was too late he was in a deeply contemplative mood when finally he approached the palace and was invited into the presence of the frenchman who ruled as king giuliano knew of his considerable military successes particularly in the war with genoa barely over and his victories in the east that had made him king of albania as well as of the two sicilies he expected a warrior a man a little drunk with the triumph of his own violence and he thought all franks were unsophisticated compared with any latin never mind a venetian who had so much of the delicate subtlety of byzantium as well as his native love of beauty giuliano found a large barrelchested man in his late forties oliveskinned darkeyed his powerful face dominated by an enormous nose his dress was quite modest nothing marked him out from those around him except the restless energy of his manner and the confidence that burned through even in the moments when he stood in repose when he was commanded to speak giuliano introduced himself as a sailor familiar with most of the ports of the eastern mediterranean and currently an emissary of the doge of venice charles welcomed him and invited him to sit at the table which was richly set with food and drink it seemed like an order so giuliano obeyed but instead of eating charles paced back and forth in vigorous strides firing questions at him dandolo you said yes sire a great name a great name indeed and you know the east cyprus rhodes crete acre do you know acre giuliano briefly described these places to him charles surely knew them already presumably he was comparing one account with another only occasionally did he pick up a leg of roast fowl and a piece of bread or fruit and bite into it and he took little wine now and again he gave orders and there seemed to be scribes taking them down in notes all over the place as if he required three copies of everything giuliano was impressed that he seemed able to think of so many things at once his grasp of politics in europe was encyclopedic and he knew much of north africa and the holy land and beyond as far as the mongol empire giuliano found himself dazzled and had to struggle to keep up quickly coming to the decision that to admit his limitations would be not only more courteous but wiser in the presence of one who would take only moments to realize the relative ignorance of somebody who was younger and less experienced should he ask about ships for a coming crusade it was what tiepolo had sent him for it would need a great fleet giuliano observed charles laughed a rich sound of amusement always the venetian of course it will much money and many pilgrims are you going to offer me a bargain giuliano leaned back a little and smiled we could bargain much timber would be needed far more than usual all our shipyards would be engaged possibly day and night in a holy cause charles pointed out conquest or profit giuliano asked charles roared with laughter and slapped him on the shoulder a blow that jarred his teeth i could like you dandolo he said heartily well talk numbers and money in a little while have another glass of wine three hours later giuliano left with his mind whirling walking back through the halls hardly less ornate than the doges palace in venice although the courtiers were less sophisticated even coarse in their habits by comparison some said charles was stern but fair others that he taxed his subjects into penury almost to starvation and that he had neither love for nor interest in the people of italy yet for ambitions sake he chose to have his court so often here in naples passionately intensely almost madly alive and placed like a jewel on the side of a sleeping dragon whose smoke even now scarred the horizon charles too was a force of nature that might destroy those who took him too lightly guiliano must learn a great deal more study listen watch and take intense care as to exactly what he reported back to the doge he went down the steps into the blinding sunlight and the heat from the stones embraced him when charles moved his court from naples south to messina on the island of sicily giuliano followed after him a week later as in naples he watched and listened the talk was of the reconquest of outremer as the old kingdom of christian palestine was known just the beginning one sailor said cheerfully drinking down half a pint of wine and water with gusto more than time we took the war back to the muslims theyre all over the place and spreading time we got our own back another said savagely he was a big man with a red beard fifteen years ago they killed a hundred and fifty teutonic knights at durbe then all the people in osel apostatized and slaughtered every christian in their territory at least they stopped the mongols going into egypt giuliano volunteered interested to see their answer to that better the muslims fight them than we have to let the mongols soften them up for us the first man rejoined then well finish them im not choosy whos on my side he guffawed with laughter clearly a small man with a pointed beard put in the redhaired man slammed his tankard on the tabletop and what the hell is that supposed to mean he challenged his face flushing with anger it is supposed to mean that if you had ever seen an army of mongol horsemen youd be damn glad to have the muslims between you and them the other rejoined and the byzantines giuliano asked hoping to provoke an informative reply the small man shrugged between us and islam why not giuliano urged isnt it better they fight islam than we have to the man with the red beard shifted in his seat king charles will take them when we pass that way just like before plenty of treasure there for the picking we cant do that giuliano told him theyve agreed to union with rome which makes them fellow believers in the one faith with us taking them by force would be a sin unpardonable by the pope redbeard grinned the kingll take care of that never you worry hes writing to rome even now asking the pope to excommunicate the emperor which will take all protection from him then we can do as we like giuliano sat stunned the room melting into a blur of sound senseless around him two days later giuliano set out for constantinople the voyage east was calm and swifter than he had expected lasting only eighteen days like most other ships theirs hugged the shore all the way often unloading cargo and taking on more it was to be a profitable journey in money as well as information however as they sailed up the sea of marmara in the early may morning the marestail clouds high and fragile the wind painting brushstrokes on the sea he admitted to himself that no matter how long it took or however he steeled himself he would never be ready to see the homeland of the mother who had given him birth and yet loved him so little that she had been willing to abandon him he had looked at women with their children passing him in the street they might be tired worried heartbroken for a hundred reasons but they never took their eyes from their children every step was watched a hand was ever ready to support or to chastise but it was always there they might scold the child slap it in temper but let anyone else threaten it and they would learn what anger really was at midday he stood on the deck of the ship heart pounding as they slid across the smooth shining water of the bosphorus and the great city grew closer and more detailed his sailors eye was drawn to the lighthouse it was magnificent visible to approaching mariners at night from miles away the harbor was crowded scores of fishing boats and ferries and cargo carriers scudding about the huge hulls of the triremes hailing from the atlantic to the black sea and across that narrow channel of water europe met asia this was the crossroads of the world captain there was no more time for selfindulgence he must turn his attention to making harbor seeing the ship safely anchored and the cargo unloaded before turning over command to his first officer they had already agreed that the ship would return for him at the beginning of july it was the following day before he stepped ashore with his chest packeda few clothes and books sufficient to last him for nearly two months the doge had given him a generous allowance it was an alien feeling to stand on the cobbles of the street half byzantine he should have embraced this as a homecoming yet all he felt was rejection he came as a spy he turned and looked back at the harbor teeming with ships he might know the men on some of them even have sailed with them faced the same storms and hardships the same excitement the light on the water had the same strange luminous quality that it had in venice the sky the familiar softness he spent three nights in lodgings and the intervening days walking around the city gaining a feel for its nature its customs its geography even the food the jokes and the taste of the air he sat in a restaurant having an excellent meal of savory goat meat with garlic and vegetables then a glass of wine that he thought not nearly as good as venetian he watched the people in the street overhearing snatches of conversation much of which he did not understand he studied faces and listened to the tones of voice the greek he spoke and of course the genoese he heard disturbingly often he understood snatches from the arabs and persians whose dress was so easy to distinguish the albanians bulgars and highcheeked mongols were alien and he was reminded with a tingle of discomfort just how far east he was and how close to the lands of the great khan or the muslims the redbearded man had spoken of in messina he would find a venetian family down by the shore of the golden horn he wondered idly where his mother had lived she had been born during the exile perhaps in nicea or farther north then he was furious with himself for allowing in the pain that always came with thoughts of her he couldnt stop himself he closed his eyes hard against the sunlight and the busyness of the street but nothing shut out the inner vision of his father grayhaired his face lined with sorrow the locket open in his hand showing the tiny painting of a young woman with dark eyes and laughing face how could she laugh and leave them giuliano had never once heard him speak ill of her he had died still loving her he lurched to his feet the wine would choke him now he left it and strode out into the street this was an alien city full of people he would never be foolish enough to trust know your enemy learn from them understand them but never ever be seduced by their art their skill or their beauty just judge whose side they would be on when it mattered the venetian quarter was just a few streets and they made no great show of their origins no one had forgotten whose fleet had brought the invaders who had burned the city and stolen the holy relics he found a family with the old proud name of mocenigo and immediately liked the man andrea he had an ascetic face bordering on plain until he smiled then he was almost beautiful and it was not until he moved that giuliano noticed he had a slight limp his wife teresa was shy but offered to make giuliano welcome and his five children seemed happily unaware that he was a stranger they asked him numerous questions as to where he was from and why he was here until their parents told them that interest was friendly but to be inquisitive was rude they apologized and stood in a row eyes downcast you have not been the least bit rude giuliano said quickly in italian one day when we have time i will tell you about some of the other places i have been to and what they were like and if you will you can tell me about constantinople this is the first time i have been here that settled the issue immediately this was the house in which he would lodge he accepted with pleasure i am venetian mocenigo explained with a smile but i have chosen to make my life here because my wife is byzantine and i find a certain freedom of the mind in the orthodox faith his tone was halfapologetic because he assumed giuliano would be of the roman church but his eyes were unflinching he would not choose an argument but if one arose he would be ready to defend his belief giuliano held out his hand then perhaps i shall learn something deeper of byzantium than the merchants will tell me mocenigo clasped it and the bargain was made the financial agreement was far outweighed in importance by the promise of the future it was natural that they should ask giuliano his business and he was prepared with an answer my family have been merchants for a long time he said easily that at least was true if he intended the term to include all those descended from the great doge enrico dandolo ive come to see more directly what is bought and sold here and what more we could do to increase our trade there must be needs unmet new opportunities he wanted the freedom to ask as many questions as possible without raising suspicion the new union with the church of rome should make many things simpler mocenigo shrugged and pulled his face into an expression of doubt the paper is signed but thats a long way from a reality yet giuliano managed to look slightly surprised you think the agreement may not be kept surely byzantium wants peace constantinople in particular cannot afford war again and if they are not of one faith with rome war is what it will be in fact even if they dont call it that probably mocenigos voice was soft and sad most sane people dont want war but wars still happen the only way you change peoples religion is by convincing them of something better not by threatening to destroy them if they refuse giuliano stared at him is that how they see it dont you mocenigo countered giuliano realized that mocenigo identified with constantinople not with rome do you think other venetians here feel the same he asked then instantly he wondered if it was too soon to have been so blunt mocenigo shook his head i cant answer for others none of us knows yet what obedience to rome will mean apart from months of delay before we get answers to appeals and money paid out of the country in tithes instead of it staying here where we desperately need it will our churches still be cared for mended filled with beauty will our priests still be paid well and left their consciences and their dignity well there cannot be a crusade before or at the soonest giuliano reasoned aloud by then we may have reached a more sensible understanding earned a little latitude perhaps mocenigo smileda sudden radiance in his face i love a man with hope he said shaking his head but find out all you can about trade by all means theres profit to be made even in a short time see what others think many believe the holy virgin will protect us giuliano thanked him and let the subject fall for the time being but the easy way in which mocenigo a venetian had said us when referring to constantinople remained in his mind it suggested a sense of belonging that he could neither dismiss nor forget in the following days he explored the shops along mese street and the spice market with its rich aromatic perfumes and bright colors he talked to the venetians in the quarter listened to the jokes and the arguments at home in venice most quarrels were about trade here they were about religion faith versus pragmatism conciliation versus loyalty sometimes he joined in more with questions than opinions it was not until his third week that he went farther up the hills and into the old back streets where he found the dark stains of fire on the stones and every now and then rubble and weeds where there had been peoples homes at the turn of the century and for the first time in his life he was ashamed of being venetian one house in particular caught his attention as he stood in a brief shower of rain the water running down his face and plastering his hair to his head he stared at the faded paint of a mural showing a woman with a child in her arms his mother would not have been born when the city was broken and burned but she might have looked like that young and slender in a byzantine tunic with a child close to her proud gentle smiling out at the world seventeen from the emperor simonis said her eyes wide as she stood in the doorway of the herb room they want you to go with them immediately he is ill i expect someone is ill anna replied following after simonis toward the outer room a servant perhaps simonis snorted with impatience and pushed open the door for anna to go in simonis was right it was michael himself who wished to consult anna almost lost for words she gathered up her case of herbs and ointments and accompanied the servants out along the street and up toward the blachernae palace inside she was met by a court official and together they were escorted by two of the varangian guard the emperors personal troops they led her through the magnificent crumbling aisles and galleries to his private apartments he was apparently suffering from some complaint of the skin that was causing him severe discomfort it must have been zoe who had spoken of her in such a way that the emperor would call her what would she want in return without any doubt at all it would be a large favor and probably dangerous yet it would never have been possible for anna not to accept one did not refuse the emperor she would have liked to failing to cure him might be the end of her career at least among the wealthy and influential zoe would certainly not favor her again she would be fortunate if that were all the revenge she took for such an embarrassment to her own reputation and not every ailment was curable even with the jewish and arabic medicine anna used let alone christian even though the great days of the court eunuchs were past and the emperor no longer spoke to or listened to the world solely through them there were still many here she would have to deceive them with her imposture she had tried so hard to mimic leo that she was losing her own identity pretending to dislike apricots when she loved them to like sweet pastries full of honey when they made her gag she had had to spit out a hazelnut because it revolted her after she had seen him take one and copied without thinking she was using his phrases adopting his voice and she despised herself for it she did it because it was safe nothing of her old female self must be left to betray her how great a fool was she making of herself now hurrying along the vast gallery behind a somberrobed official and the huge varangian guardsmen hoping to practice the medicine her father had taught heron the emperor no lessbecause she thought she could rescue justinian her father would have understood and even approved her aims but would he question her sanity in trying to put it into practice what would he think of her if he knew the truth of what she owed justinian he had died before she had found the courage to confess to him the official had stopped and there was another man in front of anna he was tall and broadshouldered but with the smooth face of a eunuch the long arms and slightly odd grace of movement she could not judge his age except that he was certainly older than her the skin of a eunuch was like that of a woman softer more prone to fine lines and a eunuchs hair seldom receded as a whole mans often did when he spoke his voice was lowpitched and his diction beautiful i am nicephoras he introduced himself i will conduct you to the emperor is there anything you need that we may bring to you water incense sweet oils she met his eyes for an instant then looked down she must not forget that this eunuch was one of the most senior courtiers in byzantium water would be helpful and whatever sweet oils the emperor most favors she replied nicephoras gave the order to a servant waiting in a farther doorway almost out of sight then he dismissed the official who had brought anna and the guards and he himself led the way forward outside the emperors room he stopped anna felt as if he must see through her disguise and was about to tell her so she wondered for a hideous moment if they might actually search her before allowing her into michaels presence then she had an appalling thought as to where his skin rash might be and after she looked at it she would never be forgiven for the intimacy it even came to her in a wild instant to confess now before it was beyond recall the sweat broke out on her skin and the blood beat so loudly in her ears that it almost deafened her nicephoras was speaking and she had not heard him he realized it he is in some pain he repeated patiently do not ask him anything unless it is necessary for you to know it and address him formally at all times do not stare thank him if you wish but do not embarrass him are you ready she would never be ready but it was too late to run away she must have courage whatever lay ahead it would not be as terrible as turning back yes i am her voice came out as a squeak this was ridiculous suddenly she wanted to giggle it welled up inside her like hysteria and she had to pretend to sneeze to hide it nicephoras must think she was a simpleton nicephoras led the way into the bedchamber it was huge and unlike the official room this was barely refurnished even after more than eleven years michael lay on the bed with a loose tunic on the upper part of his body and linen bedding over his thighs up to the waist he looked flushed his face and neck mottled red his mane of black hair threaded with gray was damp and bedraggled majesty the physician anastasius zarides nicephoras said distinctly but keeping his voice lowered he gestured for anna to approach the emperor she obeyed as confidently as she could the more afraid you were the more important it was to carry yourself with courage her father had told her that over and over majesty may i be of service she asked michael looked her up and down curiously the jews dont have eunuchs yet zoe chrysaphes said you know jewish medicine the room swam in her vision heat burning up her cheeks majesty i am byzantine from nicea but i have learned as much as i could of all forms of medicine she almost added from my father and realized just in time that that might be a fatal error she bit her tongue hoping the pain would remind her of her lapse born in nicea he asked no majesty thessalonica his eyes widened fractionally so was i if i wanted a priest id send for one i have hundreds at my beck and call all of them more than willing to tell me my sins he smiled bleakly and winced and give me due penance im sure he pulled his tunic apart at the neck showing the red blistered weals across his chest what is wrong with me she saw the anxiety in his eyes and the sweat beading his brow she studied the rash memorizing the pattern of it the frequency of the blisters and the degree to which they were raised please cover yourself again in case you get chilled she requested may i touch your brow to gauge your fever do it he responded she did so and was unhappy with how hot he seemed does the rash burn dont they all he said tersely no majesty sometimes they only itch sometimes they ache others are very painful like lots of little stings does your head ache have you any difficulty in breathing does your throat hurt she wanted to ask him also if his belly hurt if he had vomited or suffered diarrhea or constipation but how could she ask an emperor such things perhaps she could ask nicephoras later he answered all her questions mostly in the affirmative she asked for permission to withdraw and spoke privately with nicephoras what is it he asked her with deep concern is he poisoned she realized with a jolt of horror how realistic was that suspicion she had never considered what it must be like to live forever in the shadow of envy and hate such that you never know which of your servants or even your family might wish you dead passionately enough to connive at bringing it about i dont know yet she said aloud to nicephoras wash gently wherever the rash has come make sure the water is clean i will prepare medicines and unguents to relieve the pain she took a bold step timidity would cause even greater fear then i will learn what it is and prepare an antidote she said a hideous thought flashed through her mind that it could be zoe herself who might have poisoned him she was highly skilled in beauty preparations her own superbly preserved appearance was testimony to that possibly she knew poison just as well nicephoras she called as he moved away he turned waiting for her to speak his dark eyes anxious use new oils ones that you have purchased yourself she warned nothing that is a gift from anyone at all purify the water give him nothing to eat that you have not prepared and has not already been tasted i will he promised and then added wryly and for my own safety i will have a companion watch my every move and we will both touch and taste everything his features were powerful though they had no beauty except for his mouth but when he smiled even ruefully as now it lit his entire face anna realized with a shiver one small shadow of what she had stepped into when she returned to the palace the following day she saw nicephoras first he looked anxious and he made no pretense at conversation he is no worse he said immediately they were alone but he still finds eating painful and the rash has not subsided is it poison there is accidental poison as well as intentional she prevaricated some foods spoil or are poisonous if unripe or if they are touched by things unclean one may cut an apricot with a knife one side of which has been smeared with poison the other not eat one half i see he interrupted i must be more careful he caught her flash of understanding for my own sake he added with an ironic curl of his lip do you fear anyone in particular she asked there are factions all over the city he replied mostly those who feel passionately against the union with rome or who are exploiting those who do youve seen the riots yourself she felt the sweat prickle her skin acutely conscious of constantines part in the unrest and now her knowledge of it yes and of course there are always those who have their own ambitions to the throne he added his voice lower our history is full of usurpation and overthrow and there are those who harbor desires of revenge for what they see as past wrongs past wrongs she swallowed hard this was getting painfully close to justinian and if she was honest to herself you mean personal enmity she said softly there are those who feel that john lascaris should have remained emperor regardless of his youth inexperience and profoundly contemplative nature his face creased with pain for that old terrible mutilation there was a man in the city until recentlyjustinian lascaris he said quietly presumably a kinsman he came to the palace several times the emperor spoke with him out of our hearing and i dont know what about but he was involved in the murder of bessarion comnenos and he is now exiled in palestine could he have returned and done this her voice shook and she did not know what to do to control her hands she pushed them half under her robes twisting the cloth no the idea brought a flicker of bleak humor to his eyes he is locked in a monastery in sinai he will never leave it why did he collude in killing bessarion comnenos she had to ask in spite of the danger to herself and her fear of the answer i dont know he admitted bessarion was one of many who hated the union with rome and he was gathering a considerable following and was this justinian lascaris for union with rome then surely that could not be no nicephoras smiled with a surprising softness he was profoundly against it justinians arguments were less theological but more telling than bessarions then it couldnt have been a religious disagreement she said grasping at straws of hope no the enmity if it was such seems to have been born of his friendship with antoninus who appears to have been the one actually to have killed bessarion why would he was he not a soldier a very practical man she felt she must explain herself i have treated men soldiers who knew him he looked at her directly there was a suggestion that antoninus and bessarions wife were lovers helena comnena shes very beautiful do you think so he seemed interested even puzzled i find her empty like a painting whose colors are flat there is no passion in her and little ability to know the pain of high dreams one cannot grasp did antoninus see that in her why else would he kill bessarion i dont know nicephoras admitted i keep coming back to the union with rome and his passion against it his attempt to stir up the people to resist which leads me nowhere because both justinian and antoninus were against it also she sensed a complexity of emotions in him and wondered what nicephorass own feelings were about the union does bessarion still have followers alive she dragged his attention back to the present issue not just admirers but people who would continue his cause justinian and antoninus are gone he replied with an edge of sadness i think the others have drifted back to their own concerns other loyalties bessarion was a dreamer like bishop constantine imagining byzantium can be saved by faith rather than diplomacy we have never relied on great armies or navies we have always pitted our enemies against each other and stood apart from their battles ourselves but that takes skill willingness to compromise and above all the nerve to hold on and wait a rare kind of courage she conceded while thinking of constantines passionate belief in the virgins power to protect them if they kept the orthodox faith constantines way of defending the city was surely what god wanted the emperors was the intellectual way of man trusting to himself and the arm of fleshor more accurately of cunning she wondered what justinian had really believed rather than what it was politic to say a servant had come to call them and she followed nicephoras into the emperors presence michael was still a little feverish but the rash was definitely improved and no longer spreading this time she had brought leaves to make an infusiona different sort that would reduce fever and painand also more ointment of frankincense mastic and elder bark mixed with oil and white of egg two days after that when she came again the emperor was up and dressed he had sent for her to thank her for her skill and to pay her handsomely she did not allow him to see the intensity of her relief was i poisoned anastasius zarides michael asked his black eyes searching her face she had expected the question no majesty his arched eyebrows rose even higher then i have sinned but you did not tell me she had expected that also i am not a priest majesty he considered a moment nicephoras says you have intelligence and that you are honest is he wrong then i hope not she made her voice as pious as she could and avoided his eyes do i sin in seeking union with rome and you have not the courage or the faith to tell me he persisted this question she had not foreseen there was laughter in his eyes and impatience she had only seconds to think i believe in medicine majesty i do not know enough about faith it did not save us in but i dont know why not perhaps we had not enough he suggested looking her up and down slowly as if he might read her answer in the way she stood or the hands knotted together in front of her is lack of faith a sin or is it an affliction to know whether to have faith or not one has to understand what it is that god has promised she replied searching her mind frantically to have faith that god will give you something merely because you want it is foolish will he not protect his true church because he wants it he responded or does it depend upon us observing every detail and then standing against rome he was playing with her nothing she said would change his mind but it might decide her fate perhaps he would know if she was lying about her beliefs to please him and then he would not believe her medical opinions as honest either i think our blind trust dissolved in blood and ashes seventy years ago she said maybe god expects us to find a way to use both our intelligence and our faith this time we will never all be just or all be wise the strong must defend the weak he appeared satisfied and changed the subject so how did you cure me anastasius zarides i wish to know with herbs to reduce the fever and the pain majesty ointment to heal the rash and care to make sure you were not infected by spoiled food or cloth or oils that were not clean your other servants would take care you were not deliberately poisoned you have tasters i advised them to be careful of all knives spoons and dishes for themselves also and prayer most profoundly majesty but i did not need to tell them that for my health and your survival no doubt this time there was quite open laughter in his face on the way home she still wondered if he had been poisoned and if zoe had had anything to do with it to be subject to rome might feel like rape to her had she convinced herself that this time blind passionate faith would save them suddenly anna was aware of the depth of her own doubt and perhaps the weight of sin that might have caused it were the differences between one church and another of any importance to god or were they only matters of philosophy rituals of men adapted to suit one culture or another she wished she could have asked justinian what he believed now what it was he had learned in constantinople that he had been willing to fight for to prevent union with rome and survival against the next crusade the loneliness of mind without him was all but crippling eighteen anna had been in the city over two years she now knew exactly what justinian had been charged with and what the evidence seemed to have been his trial had been secret and had been held before the emperor himself michael was the last resort to justice in all cases so it was not unusual particularly since both the victim and one of the accused were of once imperial families she had also learned far more about antoninus but nothing of it suggested a man prone to violence on the contrary he sounded most likable he was brave and fair as a soldier and reputedly even liked music people said he and justinian were good companions and it was easy to believe it bessarion on the other hand was admirable but seemed a solitary man while gifted with crowds he was not at ease with his equals and perhaps a bit obsessive in his views the more she knew of it the less sense it made what possible bond could link bessarion the religious leader to antoninus the soldier and good comrade justinian the merchant and believer zoe the wounded and passionate lover of byzantium helena her shallow daughter the lightweight esaias glabas whose name turned up every so often eirene vatatzes clever but reputedly ugly and constantine the powerful vulnerable eunuch bishop it had to be more than religion that was shared to a greater or lesser degree by the entire nation there was no one she dared speak to about it apart from leo and simonis simonis had been there since both anna and justinian had studied medicine under their fathers tutelage she had no children of her own and when their mother had been ill as she was increasingly often it was simonis who had looked after them then had come annas first practice with real patients always carefully supervised every movement watched every calculation checked encouraged or corrected that was when it had happened in her eagerness anna had misread a label and prescribed too strong a dosage of opiates for pain she had left immediately afterward on an errand that took several hours her father had been called to a serious accident and it was justinian who had discovered the mistake he had had sufficient knowledge to realize what had happened and also to understand the treatment he had prepared it then raced to the home of the patient where he had found him already feeling dizzy and lethargic justinian had forced the patient to take a strong emetic and then after he had vomited a laxative to get rid of the rest of the opiate he took on himself the blame for the error to save both his fathers practice and annas future justinian had placated the irate and wretched patient by promising to give up all medical studies himself and the man had accepted and agreed to remain silent as long as justinian kept his word he had kept it he had turned instead to trade at which he had proved both gifted and successful but it was not medicine her brother had never once chided anna for her error or its cost to him nor had he spoken of it in front of their father justinian had said his decision to leave study and turn to business was simply a personal choice to his mind anna was the better physician their mother was bitterly disappointed but their father had said nothing shame still burned inside anna like acid she had begged justinian to tell the truth and allow her to carry her own guilt but he had warned her that the patient was sworn to silence only on the conditions now agreed if she now went to him it would ruin her career without restoring his and it might also bring their father down a second story now would seem devious at best at worst doubly incompetent shed known that was true and for her fathers sake she had said nothing she never knew how much he had known or guessed of the truth her mistake had cost justinian his life in medicine he had earned the right to ask almost anything of her yet beyond her marriage to eustathiuswhich he had believed at the time to be for her happiness and securityhe had sought nothing anything she could do now to clear his name and effect his release was little enough and she had no shadow of hesitation nineteen anna was aware of the dangers of asking about religious contention in a climate already riven with differences and a sense of impending danger yet the answer as to who had killed bessarion was not going to fall into her hands without her actively seeking it what did constantine know that seemed the best place to begin he was in his room by the courtyard with the summer sun bright on the water and the stones beyond the arches and the shadows cool inside he looked almost fully recovered from his illness what can i do for you anastasius he asked i have been thinking how you wear yourself out in helping the poor and those in trouble of heart or conscience she began he smiled his shoulders easing as if he had expected something more critical from her my medical practice is sufficiently established to provide for the needs of my household she continued i would like to offer some of my time to caring for those who cannot pay with your guidance as to who is the most in need she hesitated only a moment perhaps you would like me with you so i could act both wisely and without delay his eyes widened and his face filled with pleasure that is a truly noble desire and i accept we will begin straightawaytomorrow i was discouraged uncertain what next to do for the best but god has answered my prayers in you anastasius surprised and pleased by the vehemence of his response she found herself smiling what ailments will we be most likely to find so i can bring the best herbs hunger and fear he replied ruefully but we will also find diseases of the lungs and of the stomach and no doubt of the skin from poverty insect infestations and dirt bring what you can ill be here she promised she went with constantine at least two days in every week they traveled the poorer areas down by the docksides the back streets narrow and cramped there were so many sick especially during the summer heat when there was little rain to clear the gutters and flies swarmed everywhere it was a difficult course to steer between the spiritual ailments and the bodily ones it was even more so with constantine so close and the certainty that all she said to a patient could be repeated back to him often a patient would say to her ive repented why arent i getting better you are she would reply but you must also take the medicine it will help then she tried to bring back to her memory all the appropriate saints to pray to for the specific illness and realized in doing so that she did not believe it at all but they did and that was what mattered pray to st anthony the abbot she would add and put on the ointment or whatever was right for the problem gradually she let slip from her mind the part constantine had played in the riots he loved the people and he was tireless in ministering to them he had a purity of thought and a strength of faith that eased away the fear that crippled so many always he comforted them god will never abandon you but you must have faith be loyal to the church do the best you can always she too felt the need for someone who knew more than she did and whose certainty healed her own gnawing doubts how could she deny it to anyone else at the end of one particularly long day tired and hungry she was glad to accept the invitation to return to his home and eat with him the meal was simple bread and oil fish and a little wine but with the poverty she had seen in the last weeks abundance would have been close to obscene she sat opposite constantine at the table in the quiet summer evening it was late and the torches were all that lit the night throwing warm yellow radiance onto the walls catching the flash of a gold icon the fish was finished and the plates removed only bread oil and wine were left along with an elegant ceramic bowl of figs she looked across at him the lines in his smooth face were deep with tiredness his shoulders slumped under the weight of other peoples pain he became aware of her glance and looked up smiling something troubles you anastasius he asked she ached to tell him and be rid of the burden of guilt that sometimes weighed so heavily that she was not sure she could ever stand upright beneath it and of course she could say nothing he was watching her now his eyes searching yes i am troubled she said at last crumbling bread absentmindedly in her fingers but then i imagine many people are i was called to treat the emperor a short time ago he looked up startled and then a darkness came into his face but he did not interrupt her i could not help becoming more aware of some of his views she continued of course i didnt discuss such things with him i think he is committed to union with rome whatever the cost because he believes there will be another invasion if we remain separate she gazed at constantine steadily you know better than he does the poverty we have how much worse will it be if there is another crusade and it comes through here again his heavy hand on the table clenched until it formed a fist knuckles white look about you he said urgently what is beautiful precious and honest in our lives what keeps us from the sins of greed and cruelty of the violence that despoils what is good tell me anastasius what is it our knowledge of god she said immediately our need for the light we have seen and can never wholly forget we have to believe that it exists and that if life is lived well in the end we can become part of it his body eased and he let out his breath slowly exactly a smile ironed the weariness from his face faith i tried to tell the emperor that only two days ago i said to him that the people of byzantium will not accept any pollution of who we are and what we have believed since the first days of christianity accepting rome tells god that we will sacrifice our beliefs when it is expedient to us he saw the understanding in her face and perhaps something of the peace that he had brought her the emperor agreed with me of course he went on he said that charles of anjou is planning another crusade even now and that we have no defense we will be slaughtered our city burned and those of our people who survive will be exiled perhaps this time forever she stared into his face his eyes god can save us if it is his will she said softly god has always saved his people but only when we are faithful he leaned across the table toward her we cannot put our trust in the arm of flesh deny our loyalties and then when we are losing turn back to god and expect him to rescue us what should we do she asked quickly she must not let him deviate too far in the conversation bessarion comnenos was passionately against the union and for the sanctity of the church as we know it i have heard so many people praise him and say what a great man he was what did he plan she tried to make it sound almost casual constantine stiffened suddenly the room was so silent she could hear a servants feet on the tiles in the outer corridor at last he sighed he looked down at the dishes on the table when he spoke i fear bessarion was something of a dreamer his plans may not have been as practical as people thought anna was startled was she at last close to the truth she kept her expression deliberately innocent what did they think he spoke a great deal about the holy virgin protecting us constantine began oh yes she said quickly i heard that he told the story many times of the emperor riding out of the city when they were besieged by barbarians long ago he carried an icon of the virgin with him and when the barbarian leader saw it he fell dead on the spot and all the besiegers fled constantine smiled do you think the emperor michael would do that again she asked do you think it would stop the venetians or the latins from invading us from the sea they may be barbarians of the soul she added wryly but they are sophisticated in the mind no constantine said reluctantly i cannot imagine michael palaeologus doing that she admitted and bessarion was neither emperor nor patriarch was bessarion looking to be patriarch he was not even ordained or was he was that his secret she could not let the chance slip away if bessarion was no more than a dreamer why would anyone bother to kill him this time his answer was instant i dont know she had half expected that but looking at his smooth face the anxiety easing away from it now she did not entirely believe him there was something he felt unable to tell her possibly something justinian had told him in the bonds of the confessional she tried another approach they tried to kill him several timesbefore they succeeded she said gravely someone must have felt he was a very serious threat to them or to some principle they valued above even safety or morality constantine did not disagree but neither did he interrupt her she leaned a little farther across the table no one could care for the church more than you do nor i believe could anyone serve it so wholeheartedly and with such honor that all the people of constantinople must be aware of it your courage has never deserted you thank you he said modestly but his intense pleasure was almost like a physical warmth radiating from him she lowered her voice i fear for you if someone would murder bessarion who was so much less effective than you are might they not attempt to kill you also his head jerked up eyes wide do you think so who would murder a bishop for preaching the word of god she looked down at the table then up at him again quickly if the emperor thought bessarion was going to make union with rome more difficult and so endanger the city might not he himself have had bessarion killed twice constantine started to speak and then stopped again had he really not thought of it or was it that he knew it was not true because he knew what was that is what i was afraid of she nodded as if it were confirmed please be very careful you are our best leader our only honest hope what will we do if you are killed there would be despair and it might end in the sort of violence that would be not only the ruin of the city and any chance of unity within ourselves but think of what it would do to the souls of those involved who would be so stained by sin they would die without absolution because who would there be to offer it to them he was still staring at her appalled at what she had said i must continue he said his body was shaking his face suffused with color the emperor and all who advise him the new patriarch have forgotten the culture we have inherited the ancient learning that disciplines the mind and the soul they would sacrifice all of it for physical survival under the dominion of rome with its superstitions its gaudy saints and its easy answers their creed is violence and opportunism the selling of indulgences for more and more money they are the barbarians of the heart he looked at her as if at this moment it were almost a physical need within him that she understand it made her uncomfortable embarrassed by the intimacy of it she could think of nothing to say that was even remotely adequate his voice was thin with pain when he spoke again anastasius tell me what use is it to survive if we are no longer ourselves but something dirtier and infinitely smaller what is our generation worth if we betray all that our forebears loved and died for nothing she said simply but be careful someone murdered bessarion for leading the cause against rome and made it look as if justinian were to blame and you say he felt equally strongly she leaned forward again if that was not the reason then what was he drew in a deep breath and let it out in a sigh you are right there is no other then please take care she said again we have powerful enemies we need powerful people on our side he nodded slowly as if it were she who had pointed it out the rich and the noble of the old families the people others will listen to before its too late anna felt her stomach tighten and her hands grow slick with the sweat of fear zoe chrysaphes could be such a person he said thoughtfully she has much influence she is close to the comneni as well as to the emperor she would do things for byzantium that many others would not he nodded his head slightly the shadow of a smile on his lips if i make her see that an act has the virgins blessing then she will do it and there is also theodosia skleros and all her family they have great wealth and they are all devout she most of all i have but to preach and she will obey his eyes were bright and he leaned closer toward her you are right anastasius there is great hope if we have the courage and the faith to seize it thank you you give me heart anna felt the first stab of doubt fine as a needle could holiness use such shadowed means and remain pure the torches burned in their stands and there was no wind no sound outside but suddenly she was colder anna was still troubled with doubts and aware of the tensions in the city she had warned constantine of the personal dangers to him because she needed to raise the subject of bessarions murder but some of her fear for him was real and she also knew that by asking questions she drew attention to herself there was no question of stopping her inquiry but she took more care about walking alone even though to everyone else she appeared to be a eunuch and there was nothing lacking of propriety in going wherever she chose but when called out late after dark which happened only rarely at this time of year with the short summer nights she took leo with her with all she had used in her own practice and the extra needed for assisting the poor she was running short of herbs it was time she replenished her supply she walked down the hill to the dockside in the warm light the sun still well above the hills to the west the breeze blowing and smelling a little salt she had to wait only twenty minutes listening to the shouts and laughter of fishermen before a water taxi came and she shared it with a couple of other passengers going across the golden horn to galata she relaxed in the taxi the slight rocking of the boat and the steady slap of the water were soothing and the other passengers seemed to feel the same they smiled but did not disturb the evening with unnecessary conversation avram shachar welcomed her as always taking her into the back room with its shelves and cupboards full of supplies she made her purchases and then was happy to accept his invitation to stay and dine with his family they ate well then the two of them sat in the small garden late into the evening discussing some of the physicians of the past especially maimonides the great jewish physician and philosopher who had died in egypt the same year the crusaders had stormed constantinople he is something of a hero to me shachar said he also wrote a guide to the entire mishnah in arabic he was born in spain you know not arabia she asked no no his name was really moses ben maimon but he had to flee when the muslim overlord almohades gave people no choice except to convert to islam or be put to death anna shivered theyre to the south and to the west of us and they seem to be getting more powerful all the time shachar made a gesture of dismissal there is enough evil and pain to fight today dont look for tomorrows now tell me about your medicine it was with pleasure and some surprise that she realized he was interested in her growing practice she found herself answering his questions about her treatment of michael although she was discreet enough to say only that she was afraid for him because of the anger among the people regarding the union with rome that is something of an honor for you to attend him he said gravely but he looked more anxious than happy it was zoe chrysaphess recommendation that earned it she assured him ah zoe chrysaphes he leaned forward tell her nothing you do not have to while i know her only by repute i cannot afford to be ignorant of where the power lies i am a jew in a christian city you would do well to be careful also my friend do not assume that everything is as it seems why did he warn her surely she had been discreet enough with her inquiries im byzantine and orthodox christian she said aloud and a eunuch he added softly a question in his eyes who uses jewish herbs and practices medicine on both men and women and who asks a lot of questions he touched her arm where her robe covered it very lightly barely enough for her to feel and not on her skin just as he would if she were a woman then he withdrew it and sat back she felt the horror surge through her and bring the sweat out on her body somewhere she had made mistakes perhaps many who else knew she was a woman seeing her fear and understanding it he shook his head fractionally still smiling no one he said gently but you cannot hide everything especially from an herbalist his nostrils flared slightly i have a keener sense of smell than most men i had sisters and i have a wife she knew with a rage of embarrassment what he was referring to it was her time of the month in spite of her injuries it still came and with it of course the warm intimate odor of blood she thought she had masked it i will give you herbs which will keep you safe from others suspicion and perhaps ease the pain a little he offered she could only nod in spite of his kindness she felt humiliated and deeply afraid twenty when anna next visited constantine his servant conducted her into the room with the icons apparently unaware that constantine himself was in the next room deep in conversation with someone anna walked to the farther end hoping to be out of earshot because whatever it concerned confession or simply the arrangement of some ceremony it was being said in the belief that it was private but as constantine and the man walked slowly from the courtyard closer to the archway into the room she could actually see the other man whom she knew because she had once treated his mother his name was manuel synopoulos almost thirty he was a rather brisk confident young man of unusually plain appearance but the family possessed great wealth and he could at times be charming now he pulled out of his dalmatica a soft leather pouch fat with coins and passed it to constantine for the feeding of the poor he said quietly constantines reply was gentle but there was a high sharp note of excitement underneath it thank you you are a good man and will be a noble addition to the church a great warrior in the cause of christ a captain synopoulos said and as he turned he smiled anna wouldnt admit to herself what had happened it could not be that constantine had just sold an office in the church in return for money even though he gave it all to the poor and more besides just as synopoulos had directed manuel synopoulos was no more a worthy priest a man of god than any young man who studied nothing bought his way out of his mistakes and took his pleasures where he wished and as his right his family would be grateful and as long as the greek church stayed independent of rome a high office would bring in even more wealth but far above money was the pride and the respect when constantine did come to her he looked elated his face a little flushed i have just received a new donation to the poor we are gathering strength anastasius men are repenting of their sins confessing and putting the past away they will not join rome but will fight beside us for the truth she forced an answering smile good he heard the effort in her voice is something wrong no she lied then knew he would not believe her it is simply that there is so far to go we are gaining allies all the time now the synopoulos are with us and the skleros have always been she wanted to ask at what cost but she was not yet ready to challenge him i came about another matter a patient i am concerned for and she addressed the cause of her visit he listened patiently but it was clear to anna that his mind was still in the exhilaration of his achievement anna found zoe in her bedroom lying on the great bed its tightly laced sheepfleece mattress was covered with further goosedown ones and then clean embroidered linen it was so soft zoe had sunk into the depths in great comfort still she was tired and badtempered her lungs were congested and she complained that it kept her from sleeping she blamed helena for having brought the affliction into the house then she is ill too anna said i am sorry shall i take some herbs to her also or does she prefer a a more traditional physician it was a delicate way of asking if she would accept medicine rather than a priests treatment by prayer and confession zoe laughed harshly dont mince words around me anastasius she snapped sitting up a little farther against the pillows helena is a coward she will confess to anything trivial and take the herbs if she likes them well enough which i think you already know perfectly well isnt that what you do for most peoplecomfort their guilty consciences with the doctrine they expect and then give them the medicine that actually treats the illness it gave anna a chill to realize zoe saw through her so easily she struggled for an answer some people are more honest others less she equivocated well helena is less zoe said coldly anyway why do you care about her i called you she didnt is it because shes bessarions widow youve been unusually curious about him from the beginning lies would never work with zoe yes i have anna said boldly from what i have heard he was fervently against the union with rome and he was murdered for it i care very strongly that we do not lose ourselves and all that we believe to what is in effect a conquest by deception this seems to be surrender i would rather be conquered still fighting zoe propped herself up on her elbows well well such spirit you would have been disappointed in bessarion i promise you her voice was laced with disgust he had less manhood than you have god help you then why bother to murder him anna asked or was it to replace him with someone better zoe stopped remaining motionless on one elbow even though it must have been uncomfortable such as whom she asked anna took the plunge antoninus she said or justinian lascaris some people are saying he was man enough for it did he not have the courage she was trying to sound casual although her body was stiff and her hands rigid she had said it to begin with merely as a spur to make zoe deny it and perhaps give away more now the idea danced wildly in her mind as a possibility you think i know that was a demand and the edge of zoes voice was razorsharp anna held her gaze i would be very surprised if you didnt zoe leaned back against her pillows her rich bright hair fanning out of course i do bessarion was a fool he trusted all sorts of people and look where it got him esaias glabas is charming but a player of games a manipulator only a fool needs to be loved although it is pleasant of course and usefulbut it is not necessary antoninus was loyal a good right hand yes justinian was the only one with the brains and the steel in his bones to do it pity bessarion was such a damn fool to drop his amulet in the cisterns god knows what he was doing there anyway i wish i did in the cisterns anna repeated playing for time i thought bessarion was supposed to have died at sea did someone steal the amulet zoe shrugged who knows it wasnt found until several days later so perhaps the thief put it there an amulet anna asked what was it like oh it was bessarions zoe assured her very orthodox but unimaginative rather a graceless thing really justinian had one far better and he wore it all the time still had it when they took him away really anna could not control the wavering in her voice what was his like zoe stared at her st peter walking on the waves and christ holding out his hands to him she answered and for a moment there was emotion in her voice as well a mixture of pain and wonder anna knew it it was the one catalina had given him it was a joke between them gentle and very deep a reference to the ultimate faith the weakness it mastered the love it extended so justinian still wore it she must not cry in front of zoe but tears choked her throat justinian was dining with friends half a mile away zoe explained i presume that is why they suspected him of complicity that and the fact that it was the nets from his boat that bessarion was found caught in and drowned bessarions amulet could have got into the cisterns at any time anna argued when was it stolen zoe settled a little more against her pillows the night he was killed she replied he wore it that day not only helena said so but his servants as well she might lie but they have not the sense to do so consistently not all of them justinian i thought anna stopped not knowing what to say she was betraying herself none of it was what she had wanted to hear what what was this justinian like she did not wish to know but she could no longer avoid asking she remembered him as he had been how they had shared so much in thought and passion almost mirror images justinian zoe rolled the name over on her tongue sometimes he made me laugh he could be abrupt and singleminded but he wasnt weak her wide mouth tightened i hate weakness never trust a weak person anastasius man or womanor eunuch never trust someone who needs to be approved of when things get hard theyll go with the winner whatever they stand for and dont trust someone who needs to be praised theyll buy approval regardless of the price she lifted one long slender finger above all dont trust someone who has no belief bigger than the comfort of not being alone hell sell his soul for what looks like love whatever it really is in the torchlight her face was hard and full of pain as if she had stared at the first great disillusion so whom do i trust anna asked forcing the same harsh humor into her own voice zoe looked at her taking in every line of her face her eyes her mouth her hairless cheeks and soft throat trust your enemies if you know who they are at least theyll be predictable and dont look at me like that im not your enemyor your friend and you will never predict me because ill do whatever i need to of god or of the devil to get what i want anna believed her but she did not say so zoe saw it in her face and laughed twentyone anna put away the herbs into her case said a few last words of advice to the patient then excused herself thank you nicephoras said sincerely as she came out into the hallway he had obviously been waiting for her will meletios recover the concern was apparent in the slight strain in his voice he was sending for her more and more often lately oh yes she said confidently praying she was right his fevers broken just get him to drink and then start him eating again soon perhaps tomorrow nicephoras was clearly relieved she had found him to be both compassionate and highly intelligent she had become increasingly aware of a loneliness in him to share the excitement of his knowledge he not only collected works of art especially from antiquity but even more he loved the treasures of the mind and hungered to share them they walked together from the anteroom to one of the great galleries he guided her a little to the left have you met john beccus the new patriarch no she was interested and knew that it showed in her voice this was the calling that constantine had wanted even though he was obliged to hide it he is with the emperor now if you wait a short while i shall introduce you nicephoras offered thank you she accepted quickly they fell into conversation about art moving into history and the events that had inspired certain styles and from that into philosophy and religion she found his views more liberal than she had expected teasing her mind with new and broader ideas i have just been reading some works by an englishman named roger bacon he said with intense enthusiasm i have never discovered a mind like his he writes of mathematics optics alchemy and the manufacture of a fine black powder which can explodehe jerked his hands apart to demonstratewith great force when it is ignited the thought is exciting and terrifying it could be used for immense good and perhaps even greater evil he looked at annas face to judge her appreciation of what he had said the sheer intellectual excitement of it he is an englishman anna repeated did he discover this stuff or invent it i dont know why then he understood he is a franciscan not a crusader he said quickly he has many practical ideas such as how lenses could be ground and then assembled into a machine so that the tiniest objects could appear enormous and you could see them quite clearly his voice lifted again with the love of pure knowledge and other lenses so that objects miles distant could seem to be only yards away consider what that could do for the traveler especially at sea he is either one of the greatest geniuses in the world or he lives in an ecstasy of madness she looked down hating what she was thinking perhaps he is a genius and can see all these things but is he wise the two are not the same i have no idea nicephoras answered gently what is it you are afraid of would it be bad to see things in the distance more clearly he writes of being able to fix some of these lenses in a contraption so you could wear them on your nose and those who cannot now see would be able to read his voice rose with his excitement and he studies also the size position and paths of celestial bodies he has worked out great theories on the movement of water and how it could be used in machines to lift and carry things and to create an engine that transforms steam into power which could drive ships across the sea regardless of the wind or the oar imagine it can we make these things that explode she asked softly machines that create steam to drive ships across the sea without the wind in the sails or men at the oars she could not rid herself of the fear of such things the power it would give the nation that possessed them i expect so he frowned slightly as if at the first touch of a chill then we need not be prisoners of the wind she looked up at him the kings and princes of england come on crusade dont they it was a statement everyone knew of richard known as the lionheart and of course more recently prince edward you think they will use these things in war nicephoras was pale now his excitement bled away leaving horror like an open wound would you trust them not to bacon is a scientist an inventor a discoverer of the miracles of god in the universe he shook his head he is not a man of war his religion is one of wonder the conquest of ignorance not of lands and perhaps he thinks all other men are the same she said dryly an edge of sarcasm in her tone i dont do you he was about to respond again when the door opened and john beccus emerged from the emperors presence he was imposing a gaunt and hatchetfaced man he wore his magnificent robes with elegance the silk tunic under a heavy sweeping dalmatica but far more than his mere physical presence there was a power of emotion in him that commanded attention after acknowledging anna he looked at nicephoras there will be a great deal to do he said almost by way of an order we must have no more disturbances like that last miserable affair constantine seems incapable of controlling his adherents personally i have doubts about his own loyalties he frowned we must either persuade him or silence him the union must be carried through you understand that independence is no longer a luxury we can afford we must pay a certain price in order to avoid having to pay everything is that not obvious enough the survival of both church and state are tied to the issue he chopped his largeknuckled hand savagely in the air his rings gleaming if charles of anjou invadesand make no mistake if we are separate from rome he willthen it will be the end of byzantium our people will be decimated exiled to who knows where and without our churches our city our culture how will the faith survive i know that your grace nicephoras answered gravely his face pale either we yield something now or everything later i have spoken to bishop constantine but he believes that faith is our best shield and i cannot shake him from that a shadow crossed beccuss high face and a flash of arrogance fortunately the emperor sees the stakes even more clearly than i do he replied and he will save every jot he can whether some of our more naive religious orders can see that or not he made an almost cursory sign of the cross and swept away in a swirl of jewelencrusted robes the light flickering on him as if it were fire walking away from the palace and back down the hill toward her own house the wind in her face anna thought hard about the passions and the issues she had heard both from nicephoras and from the new patriarch there was ruthlessness in john beccus she had not expected yet she realized that without it he would be useless maybe she had been too emotional and simplistic in her judgment constantine might need to be just as devious to succeed just as willing to use all the weapons he could reach and what of this englishman who could see for miles drive ships without wind or oar and perhaps worst of all create a powder that exploded whose hands might that fall into charles of anjou if nicephoras knew of it who else did now murder did not seem so unlikely to get rid of both bessarion and justinian by murdering one and contriving that the other should be blamed for it antoninus might be incidental not an intended victim at all she shivered as she realized how much more likely it was that whoever had done this one person or several had actually intended justinian to be the one executed when she knew just a little more she must find a way to ask nicephoras about the trial of justinian and antoninus as one of the most intimate advisers of the emperor he had to know there was no office of prosecutor the emperor himself was regarded as living law and his word was final as to both verdict and punishment michael had chosen to execute one man and yet only exile the other the punishment of justinian and antoninus not only would get rid of them from the scene but would also frighten and confuse any other conspirators against union leaving only constantine and the leaderless masses who were against every disturbance and change who was the real killer a betrayer among them an infiltrator or intruder even an agent provocateur on michaels behalf it would be understandable the emperor was embattled on all sides surrounded by ambition bigotry religious fanaticism yet he alone was responsible to make the final decisions for his peoples survival not only in the world but perhaps in heaven also twentytwo anna continued to watch and listen but the answer was always the same she needed to know more about the people surrounding bessarion in the last years of his life perhaps the women he had known might reveal more to her she would certainly understand them better naturally she did not say this to zoe when she visited her to offer her some new and interesting herbs but she did ask her help in widening her practice her reward came a week later when zoe asked her to call again this time she was shown into a different room from the one in which she was usually received this was more formal and beautiful in a traditional way there was nothing here that seemed to reveal zoes character as if in this part of the house she received people whom she wished to keep at arms length helena was there exquisitely dressed in dark wine red set with jewels her hair was ornamented and gleamed like black silk clearly she was no longer in mourning she watched anna with an interest devoid of kindness there was another older woman present of commanding demeanor as different from zoe as possible she was barely of average height and uniquely ugly her expensively embroidered blue green dalmatica could not disguise her wide bony almost masculine shoulders or her lack of bosom her broad nose was too strong for her face her light eyes were brilliant with intelligence and her mouth was delicate but without sensuality zoe introduced her as eirene vatatzes and only then when she smiled did she momentarily possess an illusion of loveliness then it was gone with her was a tall young man his long dark face was not quite handsome but held a promise of considerable power to come perhaps in ten years time when he was in his late forties he was a startling contrast to eirene and anna was surprised when he was introduced as her son demetrios they spoke politely of trivial matters until finally zoe mentioned that she had been badly burned in an accident she told how anna had healed her holding out her arm to display the unblemished skin for eirenes appreciation she also looked at helena with a flash of amusement that was very easy for anna to read from then on the conversation was less comfortable helena was sharp walking across the room with an exaggeratedly graceful movement as if to display her youth in front of the two older women she did not even glance at demetrios but she might as well have stared at him it was for his attention she clearly did not care in the least what anna thought of her she passed by her as if she barely existed suddenly anna found the muted blues of her own tunic and the necessity of her eunuch mannerisms more than usually imprisoning she felt as if she stood on the edge of the room like a cipher while the exchanges spoken and unspoken passed in front of her did all eunuchs feel like this did a woman as unlovely as eirene vatatzes feel a little of the same thing she saw zoe looking at her with bright clever eyes too much understanding the conversation turned to religion as sooner or later every conversation in byzantium did helena had no particular faith which was clear from her manner as much as her words she was beautiful physically very immediate but there was no soul in her anna could see that but was it invisible to a man she listened to them averting her eyes slightly so as not to be noticed very tedious zoe said with a shrug but it all comes to money in the end she was looking at eirene helena looked from her mother to eirene and back again with bessarion it was the faith pure and simple she contradicted eirenes face flickered with impatience but she kept it in check to organize a faith and keep it alive you need a church and to keep a church you need money my dear the words were gentle even affectionate but there was a condescension in them of the highly intelligent to the intellectually shallow and to defend a city we need both faith and armaments since the venetians stole our relics we have far fewer pilgrims even since our return in and most of the silk trade has gone to arabia egypt and venice trade may be tedious to you and perhaps to many of those who buy the artifacts the games and the fabrics perhaps you find blood messy it smells ugly it soils the linen it attracts fliesbut try living without it helena wrinkled her nose in slight revulsion at the simile but she did not dare argue amusement flashed in zoes eyes eirene understands finances better than most men do she observed not entirely with kindness in fact i have sometimes wondered if theodorus doukas really runs the treasury or if it is you most discreetly of course eirene smiled a faint flush in her sallow cheeks anna had the sudden thought that there was much truth in zoes remark and the fact that she perceived it was not entirely displeasing to eirene conspicuously helena said nothing anna became aware that zoe was watching her half smiling do we bore you with our talk of doctrine and politics zoe asked her perhaps we should ask demetrios for some tales of his varangian guard colorful men from all sorts of barbarous places lands where the sun shines at midnight in the summer and it is dark all winter long one or two of them demetrios agreed others are from kiev or bulgaria or the principalities of the danube or the rhine zoe shrugged you see anna felt herself blushing she had not been listening i was thinking she lied realizing how much i still have to learn of politics well if youve learned that i suppose you have achieved something helena said waspishly zoe did not hide her laughter but there was a crackle of ice in her voice when she turned to helena your tongue is sharper than your mind my dear she said softly anastasius knows how to dissemble and mask his intelligence with humility you would do well to learn the same trick it is not always wise to appear clever she blinked even if you were eirene smiled then instantly looked away and the moment after anna found her bright clear eyes fixed steadily on her curious and interested helena was talking again looking at demetrios antoninus might have loved her because he alone could find the tenderness in her anna had no idea what they might have shared helena might suffer alone now not daring to let anyone else see least of all her mother or this other clever ugly woman who carried such hurt in her face anna looked across to where helena was standing with demetrios she was smiling and he appeared selfconscious he is beginning to look like his father zoe observed glancing sideways at eirene then back at demetrios have you heard from gregory lately she continued yes eirene said tersely anna saw that she stiffened her body becoming more angular just in the way she stood zoe seemed amused is he still in alexandria i see no reason for him to remain there now or does he believe we are going to be decimated by the latins again i never knew him to care a jot about the intricacies of religion really eirene said with raised eyebrows her brilliant eyes ice cold but then perhaps you did not know him nearly as well as you imagined the color was brighter in zoes cheeks perhaps not she agreed we had some wonderful conversations but i cannot recall that they were ever about religion she smiled hardly the circumstances conducive to matters of the spirit eirene agreed she turned to look at demetrios again yes he does look like his father she said a pity you did not have a son by any of your lovers zoes face tightened as if she had been slapped i would not advise allowing demetrios to admire helena too much she said softly in little more than a whisper it could be unfortunate eirene lost the last trace of blood from beneath her skin she stared at zoe then turned with a freezing look to anna it is agreeable to make your acquaintance anastasius but i shall not be availing myself of your services i do not put potions on my face in a desperate attempt to cling to youth and fortunately my health is excellent as is my conscience should it not be i have my own physician to consult a christian one i have heard that you use jewish remedies on occasion i prefer not to i am sure you will understand especially in these strange and disloyal times without waiting for anna to reply eirene nodded briefly to zoe and took her leave demetrios following after her helena looked at her mother appeared to consider picking a quarrel over the issue and decided better of it so much for your further clientele she said to anna i dont know what you were hoping for but mother seems to have made it impossible she smiled brightly you will have to seek your business elsewhere anna excused herself also and left there had been no possible retaliation she could afford to make dearly as she would have liked to she spent a long evening turning over and over in her mind what bound these people together who seemed to have so little in common anna could not believe it was faith but it could perhaps be hatred of rome the following morning was sunday and she walked alone to the hagia sophia to attend the mass she wanted to be where neither simonis nor leo could see her or question her mood perhaps the glory of the building and the power of the familiar words would comfort her remind her of the certainties that mattered on the steps almost in the shadow of the dome she nearly bumped into zoe it was impossible to avoid her without being both rude and slightly absurd ah anastasius zoe said blandly how are you i apologize for eirenes odd manners she is a woman of peculiar moods perhaps you could treat her for it she would benefit greatly she fell into step beside anna as they moved toward the tarsus doors as would all those around her she added once they entered the building it was as if anna had ceased to exist zoe was as wrapped in the intensity of her thoughts as she was in the dark folds of her robe zoe stepped to one side at the tomb of doge enrico dandolo a look of scalding hate filled her face her eyes narrowed and her lips curled into a snarl her body clenched and she spat violently onto the cursed name then chin high she moved away without looking to left or right she went straight to one of the outer colonnades of arches and found an icon of the virgin she stood before it with her head bowed anna was a little to the left of her and saw her face eyes closed mouth soft and lips slightly parted as though she breathed in the essence of a holy place anna believed she prayed quite genuinely several times repeating the same words over and over anna looked at the madonna holding her child the calm joy radiating from her face more than from the gold of the mosaic creators art there was something purely human in it a power of the spirit to which she had been a witness anna felt it like an ache within herself for something forever lost a grief for what could not be and she felt guilt because she herself had given it away not in generosity or sacrifice but in fury and in a revulsion so savage that she had allowed it to possess her was there forgiveness for that she left tears spilling hot on her face all but choking her as she passed the tomb of enrico dandolo on the way out she saw a man there a cloth in his hand carefully wiping away the spittle where zoe and others had vented their hatred he stopped and looked up at her his dark eyes finding hers recognizing the pain but puzzled another woman walked past and disregarding him spat on the tomb he turned back to it and began patiently cleaning it again anna stood and watched his hands were beautiful strong and slender working as if nothing had happened she regarded his face knowing he was unaware of her set on his task there was power in the line of his bones vulnerability in his mouth she would like to think he could laugh quickly easily if the wit was good but there was nothing of ease in him now only an intense loneliness anna felt it also an ache inside her almost beyond bearing because outwardly she was neither man nor woman only a solitary person loved perhaps only by godbut not yet forgiven by him twentythree giuliano dandolo walked out into the light almost unaware of the heat of the sun on the stones or the glare this was only the second time he had been inside the hagia sophia around the base of the vast central dome was a ring of high windows and the light poured in making the whole interior like the heart of some great jewel burning with its own fire he was used to the veneration of the virgin mary but this was a different kind of femininity holy wisdom as a woman was a strange concept to him surely wisdom was unwavering light anything but feminine then he had seen the tomb of enrico dandolo soiled with spittle and stood in front of it confused by loyalty and shame both tearing at him in the same moment since coming here he had learned far more about the looting of the city on the last crusade it was the doge enrico dandolo who had been personally responsible for taking the four great bronze horses that now adorned st marks cathedral in venice he also had taken first choice among the holiest of the relics stolen including the vial of christs blood one of the nails from the cross the goldencased cross that constantine the great had carried into battle with him and much more besides yet enrico had been his greatgrandfather he was part of giulianos history good or bad as he had stood by the tomb another person had walked past and spat on the plaque inlaid on the floor this time giuliano had come determined to clean it even if only for a few moments until the next violation the person who had watched him today had awoken a different feeling in him he had seen eunuchs before but they still made him uncomfortable he had recognized without question what he was it was nothing of the mans gender that disturbed him it was the pain in his eyes and in the lines of his mouth for a moment giuliano a complete stranger had looked inside him at a raw and terrible wound why did giuliano clean the plaque over the tomb he had never known his greatgrandfather there were no memories no personal stories it was only because the name on it was dandolo it was someone to whom he could belong a tie to the past that had nothing to do with the byzantine mother who had not wanted him he left the church and walked rapidly as if following a known path yet he had no distinct idea except to climb upward to where he could look out over the sea always he went toward light on the water and the limitless horizon as if in looking at it he might free his mind what had he expected to find when he came here to constantinople at last a city alien to him too eastern too decadent so he could hate it and return to venice having exorcised it from his heart that was it so he could think of his mother with indifference and recognize nothing of her in himself he came to a small place a side turning off the path just large enough for two or three people to stand and stare at the shifting patterns of current and wind as the tide swept through the narrows between europe and asia it looked like the brushstrokes of an artist except that it moved it was a living thing as though it had a pulse the air was a breath on his skin warm and clean a little salt the city below him was like venice and yet so unlike the architecture was lighter in venice yet there were echoes in it of this there was the same teeming vitality and trade always trade the eye for a bargain the weighing of value buying and selling and there was the same knowledge of the sea in all its moods subtle dangerous beautiful boundless with chance and possibility yet the similarities were superficial he did not belong here no one really knew him except in brief friendship such as andrea mocenigo who had allowed him to become so much a part of his family but that was kindness they would have done the same for anyone being a stranger in constantinople gave giuliano a freedom to grow to change if he wished to to embrace new ideas no matter how wild or foolish belonging was safety but it was also constriction not belonging was boundless as if his feet knew no weight and his horizons were endless but he had no roots either and at unexpected moments there was a loneliness that was almost unbearable he could not clear from his mind the passion and grief on the face of the eunuch who had watched him in the hagia sophia there was a tenderness in it that haunted him he must finish collecting and assessing his information for the doge and return home when finally his first officer returned giuliano was ready to leave he had all the information he needed at least he thought so although even as he said goodbye to mocenigo and his family and carried his chest out to the waiting cart a doubt stirred in him that again he was escaping did the feeling of completion come from his finishing his task here for the doge or was it that he had satisfied his own thirst for knowledgeand rejected byzantium he put it from his mind he was returning home the voyage was swift and by midaugust he stood on the deck gazing at the skyline of the city that seemed to float on the face of the lagoon byzantium was a bright memory like the colors of a mosaic in someone elses ceiling touched with gold but too far away to see clearly only an impression remained on his mind in a multitude of facets tiny and beautifuland beyond his reach it was in rome pope gregory x arranged a oneyearlong truce between emperor michael palaeologus of byzantium and charles of anjou king of the two sicilies anna never learned how much the papal legate in constantinople had had to do with that twentyfour giuliano docked in the outer harbor intending to make his way to his own home just off the grand canal first he would wash and change his clothes rest a little then eat a good meal in one of the caf√©ssomething different from shipboard fare after that he would report to the doge he would probably have to wait some time for an audience however he had barely stepped beyond the dock when he overheard hushed voices speculating as to who the next doge would be is the doge ill he demanded pulling at the mans shoulder to gain his attention the man turned regarding his travelstained seamans britches with pity just landed he asked yes friend it is feared he will not last long if you have news for him youd better give it now giuliano thanked him and with a hollow sense of loss gnawing at him made his way as quickly as he could to the doges palace received by somber servants he was told in a quiet voice to wait until he was called he paced back and forth from sunlight to shadow under the long windows his feet whispering on the marble the sound of muted voices beyond the door finally he was called in and told by a grimfaced elderly man in black doublet and stockings that he must be brief the doges bedroom had the stale sharp smell of illness and the watchful gloom of those who have urgent tasks to perform but want to seem as if they have all the time in the world tiepolo lay propped against pillows his cheeks sunken his eyes hollow giuliano he said hoarsely come tell me about charles of anjou and the sicilians will they rise do you think how is byzantium what of the venetians there whose side will they be on if there is another invasion tell me the truth good or bad giuliano smiled at him and put his hand over the old mans frail fingers where they rested on the sheet i wasnt going to lie he said so quietly that he hoped the others in the room would not hear him this last conversation between them should have the dignity of not being overheard so it could include all that either of them wished to say well tiepolo asked as briefly as he could giuliano told him his opinion of charles of anjou and the differences he could see between his rule in naples and that in sicily and the corresponding reactions of the subject peoples good tiepolo smiled faintly so you think sicily could be made to rise against him if the circumstances were right certainly they hate him but that will be a long way from rebellion possibly tiepolos voice was weak now tell me about constantinople i loved it and hated it giuliano answered remembering the soaring thoughts the turmoil of ideas the drowning pain of rejection of course tiepolo said with a faint smile what did you love giuliano the freedom of ideas he replied the sense of being at the crossroads of east and west the adventure of the mind tiepolo nodded and you loved the parts that were like venice and hated them because of your mother his eyes were gentle in spite of his own pain giuliano picked up the thread of his mission none of them want war he said urgently not the byzantines and not the venetians thereor the genoese or the jews or the muslims theyll never hold off a crusader army but i fear that most will fight to protect their own and die with it tiepolo sighed never trust the pope giuliano not this pope or any other they have no love for venice not as you and i do there are turbulent times ahead charles of anjou wants to be king of jerusalem and he will bathe the holy land in blood to do it his blueveined hand tightened on the sheet venice must keep its freedom never forget that never give it up to anyone emperor or pope we stand alone his voice sank a little lower and giuliano had to lean forward to hear him promise me that there was no choice the hand on the sheet was cold when he placed his own over it the pull of byzantium was strong the world was full of danger enticement and promise but this man had nurtured him after his own father had died a man who forsook his debts was worth nothing venice was the cradle of his heart of course i promise giuliano answered tiepolo smiled for an instant then the light faded from his eyes and he did not blink again giuliano felt a prickling in his throat and a tightness inside him so he could barely breathe it was like his fathers death repeated the beginning of a new loneliness that would go on forever he slipped his hand off the old mans and stood up slowly turning to face the shadowed room the physician looked at him and understood giuliano found his throat too tight to speak and he refused to embarrass himself he nodded his thanks and walked past them outside into the cool marblefloored anteroom and then into the hall tiepolos funeral was a magnificent occasion too profound for the clatter of words to intrude on the day was misty and suffocatingly hot with a fine summer rain drifting like streamers of silk as the blackribboned barge moved slowly and almost soundlessly along the grand canal seeming already a ghost ship the way was lined with people either on balconies above the water or in small boats tucked in well to the sides to allow the procession and the mourners to pass on their way from the doges palace through the city then back again as far as the rialto bridge then through the smaller canals more directly to the cathedral of saint mark almost where they began giuliano came in the first boat behind it not in the prowhe was not familybut toward the stern he stood watching the high facades of the buildings and the pale raindappled light on the water blurring the images he was intensely alone in spite of pietro only a few yards away in the death of a leader was the passing of an age and they were both indissolubly bound in something unique and as deep as blood or bone they moved through silver bars of weak sunlight that struck the canals face into luminescence and made the barge ahead momentarily stark oars shining then the shadows closed over again and colors faded there was no sound but the swirl and dip of water a week later he sat over wine again with pietro they had spent the day out in the lagoon talking remembering watching the sunset colors touch the facades of the palaces opposite making them seem to float on the face of the water insubstantial as a dream now they were sitting wetfooted a little cold in one of their favorite taverns off a small canal five hundred yards from the church of san zamipolo giuliano stared moodily into his glass he liked red wine and this one was good he was quite aware that he was drinking too much the heat clung like damp cloth and his thirst was never quenched i imagine they are choosing the inquisori to go through all his acts and pass judgment he said angrily they always do pietro responded taking more wine himself theyll have to find something to complain about or people will say they arent doing their jobs you cant win what could he do wrong for gods sake giuliano demanded angrily they kept him under surveillance all the time he couldnt open dispatches from foreign powers without them peering over his shoulder and reading behind him pietro laughed its human nature venetians will always be pulling someone apart be glad he wasnt a pope he grinned suddenly they dug one of them up and hanged the poor sod ambrosius the second i think twice buried him then a flood in the river uncovered the grave and washed him away or something of the sort all after a proper trial of course didnt matter the accused was a corpse god rest his soul pietro put his empty glass on the table do you want to go down to the canal near the arsenal tomorrow night i know a great caf√© where the wine is excellent and the women are young rounded in all the right places and smoothskinned you make them sound like something to eat giuliano said but the idea appealed to him easy pleasure music a little anonymous kindness with no obligation no one to hurt or be hurt by and pietro was good company kind and funny and he never complained yes he agreed why not the process for electing a new doge was vastly complicated it had been instituted by tiepolo himself in the year of his accession it was intended to reduce the power of the great families who had led the city from the reign of the first doge five hundred years before giuliano wondered if tiepolo had had the dandolo in mind specifically in the end when all the due process had been filled to the letter a new doge was duly elected he was jacopo contarini an octogenarian cousin of pietros a week later he sent for giuliano he was uncomfortable going to the doges palace and finding someone else in tiepolos place the halls and corridors were just the same the marble columns the pattern of sunlight streaming through the windows onto the floor even the servants had not changed except for a few of the most personal it was probably right that the sense of continuity be so powerful but it made him painfully aware that venice was so much larger than the individual men who were its life come in dandolo contarini said formally still unused to his office although he may well have coveted it most of his life my lord giuliano replied bowing and waiting until he was told to relax this was not tiepolo to this new doge he meant nothing you have recently returned from constantinople contarini said with interest tell me what you learned i know doge tiepolo sent you god rest him what is your judgment of the emperor michael and of the king of the two sicilies the emperor michael is a clever and subtle man giuliano answered a strong soldier but without the navy he needs to defend from a sea attack the city is recovering slowly they are still poor and it will be a long time before trade brings in the kind of wealth they need to rebuild the sea defenses sufficiently to withstand another assault and the king of the two sicilies contarini pressed giuliano remembered charles of anjou with sharp clarity and told the doge how as king he lacked the loyalty of his people contarini nodded indeed and did doge tiepolo tell you his reasons for seeking this information a crusade by charles would require a vast fleet and either we or the genoese will build it if the crusade should succeed the spoils will be enormous not as rich as in because there are not so many treasures left but still well worth the taking we should make a contract now and secure the wood we will need it will be far beyond our usual purchase contarini smiled tell me did tiepolo assume that a contract made with charles of anjou would be kept it would be to his advantage to do so charles would not wish to make an enemy of venice until after he has conquered byzantium jerusalem and possibly antioch and we have long memories for an injury giuliano answered the smile reached contarinis eyes very good and your time in constantinople to consider the mood and the loyalties of the venetians and genoese there excellency there are many of them mostly in the harbor areas contarini nodded and would they be with us or against us those who are now married to byzantines might find their loyalties torn and there are surprisingly many to be expected contarini nodded in time i will send you to look again to keep me informed first i would like you to go to france and secure wood for us you will need to make careful bargains we do not wish to be committed and then learn that the crusade is delayed or worse canceled the situation is lightly balanced his smile lost its warmth i need you to be very precise dandolo do you understand me yes excellency he did understand but oddly the sense of excitement had died away it was a good task necessary it could not be given to a man whose skill or whose loyalty was not absolute yet it was also impersonal there was none of the fire he had shared with tiepolo giuliano took his leave and went out into the sun in the piazza the light off the water was as clean and bright as always but it was cold twentyfive palombara and vicenze arrived back in rome in january they had been at sea for nineteen days and were both glad to make landfall at last even though they knew that it was a race to report to the pope which of course they would do separately neither knowing what the other would say two days later when the messenger finally came to conduct palombara to the popes presence they walked together along the street and across the windy square robes swirling palombara tried to think of anything he could ask the man that would tell him if vicenze had already been or not but every question sounded ridiculously transparent he ended by walking the entire distance in silence his holiness gregory x looked tired even in the quiet sunlight of his room and the magnificence of his robes he had an irritating cough which he tried to mask after the usual ritual of greeting he went straight to the subject as if short of time or perhaps he had already seen vicenze and this was merely a courtesy to palombara and of no more meaning than that you have done well enrico he said gravely we did not expect that such a great undertaking as the unity of all christendom could be achieved without difficulty and some loss of life among the most obdurate palombara knew instantly that vicenze had already been here and reported a greater success than in fact they had had he had a sudden acute sense that the man opposite him was weighed down beyond his ability to bear there were heavy shadows in his face was that repetitive cough more than a cold come with the beginning of winter there are too many people whose reputation and all the honor or power they have lies in their allegiance to the orthodox church palombara replied one cannot claim divine guidance and then change ones mind he wished to smile at the irony of it but he saw no glimpse of humor in gregorys eyes only indecision and a coming darkness it frightened him because it was one more piece of evidence that even the pope did not have that bright certainty of god that surely came with true sanctity palombara saw only a tired man searching for the best of many resolutions none of them complete the resistance is mostly among the monks palombara continued and high clergy whose offices will no longer exist once the center of power has moved here to rome and there are the eunuchs there is no place for them in the roman church they have much to lose and as they see it nothing to gain gregory frowned can they cause us trouble palace servants churchmen without he shrugged slightly and coughed again without temptation of the flesh and therefore without the possibility of true holiness is it not better for all that their species die out intellectually palombara agreed with him the mutilation repelled him and if he thought about it in detail it frightened him yet when he had said the word eunuch he had been thinking of nicephoras the wisest and most cultured man he had encountered at michaels court and of anastasius who was even more effeminate there was nothing manly about him at all anastasiuss intelligence and even more the fire of his emotions had caught palombara in a way he could not dismiss in spite of his loss of manhood the healer had a passion for life that palombara had never felt he both pitied and envied him and the contradiction of it was disturbing it is an offense a denial holy father he agreed and yet they have merit even if their abstinence is enforced i doubt it is of their own choosing in most cases so there can be no blame gregorys expression hardened in the pale winter sun slanting in through the windows if a child is not baptized it is not the childs choosing enrico yet it is still lost to paradise be careful when you make such sweeping statements you tread on delicate ground where doctrine is concerned we do not question the judgments of god palombara felt a chill it was not the warning or the chastisement it was far deeper than that it was the denial of passion of certainty of knowing everything was perfectly and brilliantly true beautiful to the mind and the soul as the things of god should be did he know an unbaptized child was lost to paradise he knew that was taught but was it by god or was it by man in order to enlarge the flock and therefore the power of the church ultimately their own dominion how did gregory and the church conceive of god were they creating him in their own image essentially shallow seeking more and more praise obedience purchased by fear of damnation was man seeking anything beyond himself not curtailed by the boundaries of his own imagination who dared beyond that crashing alone into the bright silent world of what infinite light or just a white void palombara knew now in this beautiful winterpale room in the vatican that in his soul he believed that gregory had no more idea than he had simply no desire or compulsion to ask i apologize holy father he said contritely sorry for having disheartened an old man whose life hung upon his certainties i spoke hastily because i gained respect for the wisdom of some of the eunuchs at the emperors court and i would exclude no one from the saving grace of truth i fear we have much work yet to do in byzantium before we win any loyalty deeper than the fear of our physical violence toward them if they fail fear can be the beginning of wisdom gregory pointed out he looked up suddenly and met palombaras eyes he saw the skepticism in them and possibly something of the darkness inside palombara nodded in acquiescence but i have other plans to discuss gregory said with sudden vigor the momentum is building for a new crusade without the bloodshed of the past i have decided to write to the emperor michael inviting him to meet us in brindisi next year i will be able to speak to him make better judgments of his strength and his sincerity and perhaps allay some of his fears he waited for palombaras reaction admirable holy father he said with as much enthusiasm as he could put into his voice it will stiffen his resolve and perhaps you will be able to suggest to him ways in which he can deal with his bishops of the old faith and still retain their loyalty he will be grateful to you as will the byzantine people more important than that of course it is the right thing to do gregory smiled quite clearly pleased with the response i am glad you see it so clearly enrico i fear not everyone will palombara wondered instantly if vicenze had argued that would have been daring of him or more likely simply highly insensitive had he seen gregorys failing health and already changed his allegiance perhaps vicenze had information palombara did not otherwise it would be out of character he never took risks others will understand in time holy father palombara said despising the hypocrisy in himself yes indeed gregory pursed his lips but we have much to do to prepare he leaned forward a little we need all italy with us enrico there is much money to raise and of course men horses armor machines of war and food and ships i have legates in all the capitals of europe and venice will come because there is so much profit in it for them as there always has been naples and the south will have no choice because charles of anjou will see to it it is the cities of tuscany umbria and the regno that concern me in spite of his desire to be impervious to the fires of ambition palombara felt a flutter of excitement inside himself yes holy father begin with florence gregory said it is rich there is a stirring of life and thought there that will reward us well if we nurture it they are loyal to us then i want you to seek out what support we have in arezzo that will be harder i know their loyalties are to the holy roman emperor but you have proved your mettle in byzantium he smiled bleakly i know what you have told me of michael palaeologus enrico and i am not as blind as your tact imagines i know what you have not told me by virtue of your silences go and report back to me by the middle of january yes holy father palombara said with an enthusiasm he could not conceal yes i will on the last night before leaving florence palombara dined with his old friend alighiero de belincione and lapa the woman he had lived with since the death of his wife they had two small children francesco and gaetana and alighieros son dante from his previous marriage as always they made palombara feel welcome gave him excellent food and afterward sat around the fire and brought him uptodate on all the latest news and gossip they were fascinated by palombaras experiences in constantinople lapa wished to hear all about the court of michael particularly the fashions and the food alighiero was more interested in the spices and silks in the market and the artifacts to be purchased from the fabled cities farther east along the old silk road they were discussing the life of those who traveled it when a boy came into the room tentatively at first knowing he was interrupting he was about ten years old slender almost thin the bones of his shoulders were visible even through his winter jerkin but it was his face that held palombaras attention he was pale and his features were already losing the softness of the child and his eyes burned with a passion that seemed almost to consume him lapa looked at him with anxiety dante you missed supper let me get you something now she half rose to her feet alighiero put out his hand to restrain her hell eat when hes hungry dont worry so much she brushed him away he needs to eat every day dante let me present you to bishop palombara from rome then ill make you something alighiero sat back again probably in deference to palombara rather than have a disagreement in front of him which would have been embarrassing welcome to florence your grace the boy said politely palombara looked into his eyes and saw in them an emotion so powerful that it seemed to light him from within and palombara had a sudden conviction that he himself scarcely impinged upon the boys world he wanted to make some mark on this extraordinary child thank you dante he replied i have already been given the hospitality of friends and there is no greater gift of welcome than that now dante looked at him then he smiled for an instant palombara was real to him it was there in his eyes come lapa said standing i will make you something to eat i have a little of your favorite caramel she led the way out of the room and with a brief glance at palombara the boy followed her obediently i apologize for him alighiero said with a smile to cover his embarrassment ten years old and he believes he has seen heaven in a girls face portinaris daughter bice beatrice he barely saw her it was last year and he still cant get over it his eyes were puzzled he lives in another world i dont know what to do with him he shrugged slightly i suppose it will pass but at the moment poor lapas worrying about him he picked up the jug of wine have some more palombara accepted and they spent the rest of the evening in agreeable conversation for once palombara was able to indulge in friendship and forget about the moral ambiguities of the crusade when he left to ride to arezzo the following morning he could not rid his mind of the solemn passionate face of the boy who was convinced he had seen the face of the girl he would love all his life the fire had consumed the boy had lit him from within ahead of him were both heaven and hell but never the corrosion of doubt or the yawning wasteland of indifference yes palombara envied the boy and whether he dared to grasp at it or not he needed to know that heaven existed palombara rode through the winter rain feeling it on his face smelling the wet earth the tangle of fallen leaves rotted beneath the trees it was a clean living odor the day would be short and dark night crowding in from the east closing the colors across the sky into hot reds on the horizon tomorrow he would be back in rome palombara sought out old friends in arezzo and put to them the same questions he had to others in florence by january in the new year of he was back in rome to report to gregory he was crossing the square toward the broad steps up to the vatican palace aware of a certain hush in the gray winter air like a presage of rain it was late afternoon and it looked as if darkness were going to come early he saw a cardinal he was acquainted with walking toward him with a heavy tread his face pinched good evening your eminence palombara said courteously the cardinal stopped shaking his head from side to side too soon he said sadly too soon we dont need change at the moment palombara was seized with a presentiment of loss the holy father just today the cardinal replied looking palombara up and down seeing the marks of travel on his clothes youre too late palombara should not have been surprised gregory had looked exhausted both in body and in spirit when he had last seen him palombara was touched with a grief greater than his disappointment at his own loss of office or the confusion of the future everything plunged into uncertainty again there was an emptiness where he had had a friend a mentor someone whose judgments he understood thank you he said quietly i did not know he crossed himself may he rest in peace it rained all day and he stayed at home supposedly writing a report on his work in tuscany to give to the new pope should he want it actually he paced the floor deep in thought turning over all the decisions he would have to make there was everything to win or lose he had been in high office several years now and earned both friends and enemies most important perhaps he had earned favors and chief among his many enemies was niccolo vicenze over the next few weeks if he was to retain any power he would need more than skill he would need luck he should have been better prepared for gregorys death the signs of it had been there in the hollows around his eyes the constant cough the pain and weariness in him palombara stopped at the window and stared out at the rain the new crusade had been a passion with gregory but what about his successor he was surprised how much constantinople dominated his thoughts would the new pope care about the eastern church try to bridge the differences between them and treat them with respect as fellow christians would he begin a real healing of the schism during the following days tension mounted speculation was rampant but for the most part concealed by the decencies of mourning and of gregorys burial in arezzo above all of course was expediency no one wished to wear his ambition naked people said one thing and meant another palombara listened and considered which faction he should be seen to back this was much on his mind when a neapolitan priest named masari fell into step with him crossing the square toward the vatican palace in the feeble light of the january sun only a week after gregorys death a dangerous time masari observed conversationally avoiding the puddles with his exquisite boots palombara smiled you fear the cardinals will choose other than by the will of god he said with only the barest suggestion of humor in his voice he knew masari but not well enough to trust him i fear that without a little help they may be fallible like all men masari replied an answering gleam in his eyes it is a fine thing to be pope and great power is destructive of all manner of qualities regrettably sometimes most of all of wisdom but far from ending with it palombara said dryly give me the benefit of your knowledge brother what in your opinion would wisdom dictate masari appeared to consider intelligence rather than passion he replied at length as they continued up a flight of steps it was starting to rain harder a gift for diplomacy rather than a tangle of family connections he went on it is most awkward to owe ones relations for the favor of their support debts have a way of requiring payment at most inconvenient times palombara was amused and interested in spite of himself he felt the quickening of his pulse but how is one to gain any level of support without obligation probably of several kinds cardinals do not cast their ballots without a reason he did not say unless they are bought but masari knew the sense behind his words regrettably not masari bent forward shielding his dark face from a spout of water off a high roof guttering but there are many sorts of reasons one of the best might be the belief that the new pope whoever he is would succeed in unifying the whole christian faith while not yielding any holy doctrine to the false teaching of the greek church that would surely be most displeasing to god i do not know the mind of god palombara said acerbically of course masari agreed only the holy father himself knows that beyond doubt we must pray and hope and seek after wisdom palombara had a fleeting memory of standing in the hagia sophia and the beginning of his understanding of how much subtler a thing the wisdom of byzantium was than that of rome for a start it incorporated the feminine element gentler more elusive harder to define perhaps it was also more open to variance and alteration more nurturing to the infinite spirit of humanity i hope we dont have to wait until we find it he said aloud or we might not elect a new pope in our lifetime you jest your grace masari said softly his black eyes steady on palombaras face for a moment then moving swiftly away again but i think perhaps you understand wisdom more than most men again the stab of surprise jolted palombara and the racing of his heart masari was testing him even courting him i value it more than wealth or favors he answered with total solemnity but i think it does not come cheaply little that is good comes cheaply your grace masari agreed we look toward a pope who is uniquely fitted to be leader of the christian world we palombara kept walking but now unmindful of the wind the puddles gathering in the stones or the passersby such men as his majesty of the two sicilies and lord of anjou masari answered but of more import to this issue of course he is also senator of rome palombara knew precisely what he meantsomeone with a powerful influence over who would become pope the implication and the offer were both plain temptation roared through his mind like a great wind scattering everything else already a serious chance to become pope he was young for it not yet fifty but there had been far younger in john xii had been eighteen ordained made bishop and crowned pope all in a day so it was said his reign had been short and disastrous masari was waiting watching not only for the words but for all the unspoken patterns and betrayals in his face palombara said what he believed was probably true but also what he knew charles would want to hear i doubt christendom will be wholly united by anything except conquest of the old orthodox patriarchies he said hearing his own voice as if it were someone elses i have recently returned from constantinople and the resistance there and in the surrounding countryside especially is still strong a man who has given his career to one faith does not easily sacrifice his identity if he loses that what else has he his life masari suggested but there was no seriousness in his voice only satisfaction and a passing regret as for the inevitable that is the stuff martyrs are made of palombara retorted a trifle sharply the triple crown was closer to his grasp than it had ever been perhaps than he had ever seriously believed possible but what would he have to pay for such a favor from charles of anjou and whoever else was in his debt if he hesitated now charles would never back him a man fit to be pope did not need time to weigh his courage did he have that clarity of mind so that he would understand the voice of god telling him how to lead the world or what was true and what was false did he have the fire of soul that could bear it did such a thing even exist he thought again of the strange effeminate eunuch anastasius and his plea for gentleness and the humility to learn to crush the appetite for exclusivity and to tolerate the different you hesitate masari observed the withdrawal was already in his voice palombara was angry with himself for his equivocation his cowardice a year ago he would have accepted and considered the cost even the morality afterward no palombara denied it i have not the stomach to rule a rome that starts another war with byzantium we will lose more than we gain is that what god tells you masari asked with a smile it is what my common sense tells me palombara answered him god speaks only to the pope masari shrugged and with a little salute turned and walked away the decision came remarkably quickly it was eleven days later january a dark windy day when palombaras servant came running across the courtyard his feet splashing in the puddles he barely knocked on the carved wooden door before entering the study his face flushed with exertion they have chosen pierre de tarentaise cardinal bishop of ostia he said breathlessly he has taken the name of innocent the fifth your grace palombara was stunned his immediate thought was that charles of anjou had supported him all along and palombara had been ridiculous to imagine that masari had been offering him anything except a chance to declare his loyalties he was a pawn no more thank you filippo palombara said absently i am obliged you came so hastily filippo withdrew palombara sat at his desk his body frozen his mind whirling pierre de tarentaise palombara knew him at least to speak to they had both been at the council of lyons tarentaise had actually read the sermon then another thought came to him apparently he was taking the name of innocent v it was innocent iii who had been pope when enrico dandolo had set off on the crusade whose soldiers had sacked and burned constantinople in choosing the name of innocent was a statement of intent as such choices always were palombara must think carefully indeed where his own path lay he entered the familiar highwindowed rooms his heart pounding with anticipation already hardening himself against failure as though bracing himself would make the pain less it was only now that he realized how keenly he wanted to return to constantinople he longed for the complexity of the east and to be part of the struggle he had seen begin there he wanted to persuade at least some of those clerics to bend and save what was good of their belief so it was not lost to the wider faith he wanted to explore their different concept of wisdom it intrigued him promising a more rounded explanation of thought less didactic and in the end more tolerant he was finally ushered into the holy fathers presence and entered with all the appropriate humility innocent was already over fifty a fair mildfaced man nearly bald and now dressed in the magnificent regalia of his new office palombara knelt and kissed his ring making the usual formal protestations of his loyalty then on innocents invitation he rose to his feet again i am familiar with your opinions on byzantium and the greek church in general innocent began your work has been excellent thank you holy father palombara said humbly his holiness pope gregory informed me that he had sent you to tuscany to see what support you could raise for the crusade innocent continued it will take time of course possibly five or six years success cannot be hurried palombara agreed wondering what innocent really meant he looked at his calm face completely unreadable he could see nothing changed in him except his clothes and the confidence in his manner a kind of benign glow but every now and again he glanced around the room as if to make certain he was really here there are matters of reform within our own numbers innocent said that we cannot pursue for the time being that was a flat contradiction of gregorys view and he had felt strongly about it certain that it was gods will had he been wrong or was innocent not listening to the whisper of the spirit now the void was there again at palombaras feet the fear that there was no revelation at all simply human ambition and chaos fed by the desperate need for meaning i have been giving both thought and prayer to the situation in byzantium innocent continued it seems to me that you have a feeling for the people i have come to know them far better than at first palombara answered what he took to be a question he felt the need to justify himself and not allow the implication of disloyalty however slight to go uncorrected i do not think they will be easily persuaded from their beliefs especially those who have placed themselves in a position from which there is no retreat innocent pursed his lips it is a pity we ever allowed it to become such we should have begun negotiations long ago but whenever it is done as you say it will not be without loss no war for the cause of the mother church was ever fought without casualties he shook his head fractionally give me your report on your findings in tuscany then i wish you to go to other cities here in italy and encourage their support he smiled perhaps in time to naples even to palermo we shall see palombara felt a sudden coldness seize him did innocent know that masari had approached him and that he had been tempted even if only for a moment there would be an exquisite irony in sending palombara to the court of charles of anjou to raise support for a new crusade yes holy father he said keeping his voice level with an effort i shall give you the report on tuscany tomorrow then leave for whatever city you judge best thank you enrico innocent said mildly perhaps you could begin with urbino and then perhaps ferrara palombara accepted and looked into innocents face with a new awareness of his power and a certain foreboding would it be possible to mount a crusade that would not ravage constantinople again was his new mission a beginning of undoing all that his last had sought to achieve any certainty of faith eluded him twentysix but palombaras calling was shortlived innocent died in the middle of the year after just five months in office after a short conclave ottobono fieschi had been chosen and taken the title of adrian v then incredibly after only five weeks this pope too was dead he had not even had time to be consecrated it was lunacy how could it be attributed to god or was it gods way of telling them that they had chosen the wrong man it was descending into farce didnt anyone hear the voice of divine prompting or was it as palombara had always feared in the darkness of his own soul that there was no divine voice if god had indeed made the world then he had long since lost interest in its selfdestructive indulgences its frail dreams and its incessant pointless quarreling man was simply too busy looking after himself either to have noticed or to have understood it was hot outside the smoldering heat of midsummer in rome and now the cardinals from all corners of europe would have to come back to begin again some of them might not even be home yet from the last conclave what absurdity palombara walked slowly around the house he had once loved so much he looked at the beautiful paintings he had collected over the years and saw the skill of the brushstrokes the mastery of balance and line but the fire in the artists soul failed to warm him he would go to charles of anjou himself not wasting time and words with someone like masari he would see if his interest was still alive in the possibility of backing palombara for the throne he would decide before he got there exactly what he would offer the king of naples and what he would not thirteen days later he was in charless presence in his huge villa on the outskirts of rome he was a man of immense physical power barrelchested pulsing with energy like the fires of a forge he seemed unable to stand still moving from one place to another in the room from one pile of papers of his compulsive triplicate of orders to a scribe making notes then on to another on a table were his own pen and ink where he corrected what he considered mistakes his broad brow was sheened with sweat and his heavy face highcolored well he inquired what have you come to see me for your grace there was amusement in his face and a penetrating intelligence palombara was sharply aware that he could not manipulate this man and only a fool would try as a senator of rome you will have a powerful vote to cast on the papal conclave sire he replied one vote charles observed dryly i think more than that my lord palombara answered him many men care what your judgment might be for their ambition it was not a question but an answer of course but also for the future of christendom palombara pointed out more hangs in the balance now than perhaps at any time since the days of saint peter he smiled not hesitating and possibly hanging over it all can we unite byzantium with us in any sense that has value not a source of constant strife byzantium charles repeated the word rolling it on his tongue indeed the silence prickled in the room youve been legate to constantinople charles observed continuing again to walk around the room his leatherclad feet slapping on the marble floor he passed from shadow into the sunlight falling from the high windows and back into shadow again you told the holy father the byzantines would not yield to rome he swung around in time to catch the surprise in palombaras face before he could mask it is that tide of resistance strong enough to last shall we say another three years or so palombara understood immediately that might depend upon the terms on which rome insisted sire charles breathed out softly as i assumed and if you were pope what sorts of conditions would you feel could not be abandoned even to secure such a prize as the submission of the orthodox church and the uniting of christendom palombara knew exactly what he meant we are speaking of political unity he said carefully but his tone was light as if it were well understood between them unity of intent was never a possibility obedience perhaps but not belief charles waited smiling slowly i see no virtue in facilitating such a union if it means giving away any of the tenets of faith that have kept the loyalties we have elsewhere palombara answered it was a nicely sanctimonious speech but he knew charles would understand it charles needed a pope who would delay any act of unity by making demands to which he knew byzantium would not yield who better to judge that precisely than palombara who had argued the case with michael your understanding matches my own charles relaxed and moved away walking easily the tension drained out of him i can see how it might very well be gods will to have a pope with such perception of the true nature of people rather than some ideal which does not conform to reality i shall use such influence as i have to that end thank you for sparing me your time and your knowledge your grace his smile broadened we shall be able to be of service to each otherand to the holy mother church of course palombara excused himself and walked out through the shadow of the arches and into the blistering sun even the cypresses like motionless flames in the still air looked tired there was no wind to stir them at all it was absurd to suppose that popes kept dying because they were not enacting the will of god yet palombara could not rid his mind of the thought it kept dancing at the edge of his grasp all the time a single reason that made sense of all of it he let his imagination roam tasting ideas soaking them in as a cat basks in the sun the conclave was divided into two great factions the procharles of anjou frenchmen and the anticharles italians they cast the first ballot and palombara was deliriously on the crest of the wave only two votes short of being elected his outstretched fingers all but touched the crown on september the final vote was cast palombara waited he had hardly slept for days lying awake his mind in a turmoil of hope and selfmockery he had even stood before the glass and imagined himself in the robes of office looked at his strong slender hand and seen the papal ring on it now he waited like everyone else too tense to remain seated too tired to pace more than a few moments he lost count of time he was hungry and even more he was thirsty but he could not bring himself to leave then at last it was over a fat cardinal in billowing robes the sweat streaming down his face announced that christendom had a pope again palombaras heart nearly deafened him the seventyoneyearold portuguese philosopher theologian and doctor of medicine peter juliani rebolo was elected as john xxi palombara was furious with himself for not having expected it how could he have been such a fool he stood in the beautiful hall with a fixed smile on his face as if there were no leaden weight of disappointment crushing inside him as if he did not hurt intolerably he smiled at men he hated connivers and time servers he had courted only hours before was this portuguese philosopher and exdoctor really gods choice for the throne of saint peter the people around him were cheering voices too loud filled with false joy some like his own strident with disappointment and fear for their own positions everyone knew who had leaned which way openly for or against no one knew what deals had been done bargains made prices offered or taken in secret within days he was sent for by yet another new holy father and once again he walked across the square and up the shallow steps through the great arches inside he walked the familiar ornate passageways to the papal apartments he knelt and kissed the popes ring and repeated his faith and loyalty his mind racing as to why he had been sent for what miserable task would he be given to remove him from rome to where his ambition could be nicely cooled where could he do no harm probably somewhere in northern europe where he would freeze all summer as well as all winter john was smiling when palombara looked up my predecessor god rest his soul in peace wasted your talents in chasing support for the crusade here in italy he said smoothly as did the good innocent palombara waited for the blow john sighed you have both skill and experience regarding the schism between ourselves and the greek orthodox church i have studied your letters on the subject you would best serve god and the cause of christendom if you were to return to constantinople as legate to byzantium with a special responsibility to continue in the work of healing the differences between us and our brethren palombara drew in his breath slowly and let it out in silence the sunlight in the room was so bright it hurt his eyes it is of the greatest importance john said gravely his words chosen with care and only slightly accented with his native portuguese you must work with all prayer and diligence to this end he smiled we need byzantium not only to give lip service to its union with rome we need it to be real we need to see the obedience and be able to prove it to the world the days when we can afford leniency are past do you understand enrico palombara studied the new popes face was john xxi under his bland exterior far subtler than anyone had guessed and willing to use whatever tool was to hand turning its blade to suit his own purposes was this new office given in order to have palombara safely out of rome and in constantinople which he knew and loved as much as he loved anything to whom did he owe this debt someone would seek to collect whatever favor he had given but who yes holy father he accepted i will do all i can to serve god and the church john nodded again still smiling twentyseven in the year after the death of gregory x anna had little chance to pursue any further information about justinian or his disillusionment with bessarion or even the courage or strength of the church there was little rain in the spring and the summers heat came early disease started in the poorer quarters where there was insufficient water rapidly the outbreak spread and the situation spiraled out of control the stench of sickness filled the air clogging mouth and nose what can you do constantine said desperately as he stood in his beautiful arcade gazing at anna his pained eyes were hollow with exhaustion redrimmed his face pasty gray i have done all i know but it is so little they need your help there was no possible answer but to make arrangements for someone else to see her regular patients and for leo to turn away new ones until this fever and flux were past if afterward she had to begin again and build up a new practice it was the price that must be paid she could not walk away from constantine and deeper and more lasting than that she could not leave the sick without help when she told leo he shook his head but he did not argue it was simonis who did and what about your brother she said her face tight eyes angry while youre tending to the poor night and day running yourself into the ground risking your own health whos going to work to save him he waits in the desert wherever he is for another summer if we could ask him wouldnt he say that i should help the sick anna asked of course he would simonis snapped her voice sharp with frustration that doesnt mean its what you should do anna worked night and day she slept only in snatches here and there as exhaustion overtook her she ate bread and drank a little sour wine cleaner than water she had no time to think of anything but how to get more herbs more ointments more food there was no money without the generosity of shachar and alqadir all real help would have ceased constantine worked also she saw him only as he called on her because he knew of someone in need so desperate that he was willing to interrupt whatever she was doing or even to waken her when she slept sometimes they ate together or merely spent the last hours of a dreadful day in wordless comfort each knowing that the other had had experiences equally harsh and also ending in death then as the year waned at last the infection ebbed the dead were buried and the business of ordinary life slowly took over again twentyeight as was inevitable pope john xxi also became bitterly aware of the reality in byzantium with regard to the faith he was not inclined to be as lenient as his predecessors he sent letters to constantinople demanding a public and unqualified acceptance of the filioque clause about the nature of god of christ and of the holy spirit the roman doctrine of purgatory the seven sacraments as held by rome and papal primacy over all other princes of the church with the right of appeal to the holy see and submission of all churches to rome all michaels appeals for the greek church to retain its ancient rites as before the schism were refused palombara was present at the great ceremony in april when this new document was signed by emperor michael his son andronicus and the new bishops whom he had created because the established bishops would not yield their faith or their old allegiances of course in that sense it was a farce michael knew it and so did the new bishops their calling existed only on the condition of their abject and public surrender palombara also knew it and he watched the splendor of the ritual with no sense of victory he stood in the magnificent hall and wondered how many of these men in their silks and gems felt any passion at all and if they did what it was was such a prize of any worth indeed was it a service to god or to any kind of morality what was the difference between the whisper of the holy spirit the hysteria born of the need for god to exist and the terror and isolation of seeking him alone was the darkness too big to look at or had they seen some light in it that he had not he turned slightly sideways to watch vicenze a couple of feet away he stood upright his eyes bright his face totally unmoving he reminded palombara of nothing so much as a soldier at a victory parade how was michael going to control his people after this was he realist enough to have some plan or was he shortsighted and utterly lost as well all shorn lambs struggling alone through the same gale not seeing one another if only the monk cyril choniates would sign then his followers would it would be a giant step toward pacifying the opposition perhaps it could be brought about but palombara must do it not vicenze at all costs not vicenze he smiled at himself and at his own weakness for victory but the main document was already signed what he needed was an addendum at first he saw it as a setback that cyril choniates was apparently quite seriously ill then he thought of anastasius the eunuch physician a few inquiries elicited the information that he was willing to treat anyone who needed his skills christian arab or jew he would not rant on about sin or foolish talk of penitence but would treat the illness whether provoked by the mind or not the next thing for palombara to do was have anastasius recommended to whoever was caring for cyril in his captivity who was powerful enough to do that and could be persuaded to the answer to that question was undoubtedly zoe chrysaphes two days later he called upon her bringing with him as a gift this time a small but very beautiful neapolitan cameo carved with amazing delicacy he had chosen it himself and was reluctant to give it away although that was why he had bought it in the first place he saw in her eyes that it pleased her she turned it over in her fingers feeling the surface smiling then looked up at him exquisite your grace she said softly but i am past the days when men give me such gifts for my favors and you are a priest anyway if that was what you wanted you would have to be much subtler i think far more to the issue is the fact that i am byzantine and you are roman what is it you are looking for he was amused by her directness and forbore from telling her that he was not roman but aretino to him an important difference but not to her you are right of course he conceded looking her up and down slowly with candid appreciation as for your favors i would rather earn them than buy them what is purchased is of little worth and has no taste to linger in the mind he was delighted to see the color in her cheeks and realized that he had momentarily disconcerted her he met her eyes boldly what i want is for you to recommend a good physician for the deposed and now exiled subpatriarch cyril choniates who is presently quite seriously ill in the monastery at bithynia i have anastasius zarides in mind i believe your influence would be sufficient to have the abbot send for him it would she agreed her golden eyes quickening with interest and why do you care in the slightest what happens to cyril choniates i wish the union with rome to proceed with as little bloodshed as possible he answered for romes sakeas you wish it for byzantiums i have an addendum to the treaty of union which i believe cyril will sign even though he has refused the main agreement if he did then the many monks loyal to him would do so as well it will be a break in the resistance perhaps sufficient to bring peace she thought for several minutes turning away from him to stare at the window and the magnificent view across the rooftops toward the water i assume that this addendum will never be added to the agreement she said at last at least the main body of it will not perhaps a sentence or two with cyrils name and those of as many of his followers as you may obtain precisely he agreed but it will bring peace we do not want any more martyrs to a cause which cannot succeed she measured her words very carefully there are two of you are there not legates from the pope in rome yes is your companion aware that you have come to me with this she might already have the answer and to affirm it would be an unnecessary lie no we are not allies why do you ask he kept the irritation out of his voice her smile widened vivid with amusement cyril will not sign anything for you he felt a chill and a sudden awareness that she was playing manipulating him far more than he was her have you some other suggestion he asked she turned to face him looking up at last her gaze steady what you need is cyrils silence and word that he agreed which he cannot contest why would he not contest it if as you say he will not agree he is ill he is also old perhaps he will die she raised her superbly arched brows was she really suggesting what he thought why would she she was byzantine to the core and against anything and everything roman i shall recommend anastasius she went on he is known to be a clever physician and still resolutely orthodox in fact he is a good friend and something of a disciple of bishop constantine the most orthodox of all the bishops i myself will provide him with a medicine to help poor cyril he let out his breath slowly i see possibly you do she agreed skeptically are you sure you would not prefer that bishop vicenze should take this document to cyril after all i shall suggest it to him if you wish perhaps that would be a good idea palombara said slowly the blood roaring in his ears i would owe you much yes her smile widened you would but peace is in both our interests even in that of cyril choniates if he were but well enough to see it we must do for him what he cannot do for himself twentynine anna entered zoes room expecting to find her ill and was surprised when zoe walked toward her with all the grace and vitality of a woman on the verge of a huge endeavor i am obliged you came so quickly she said to anna regarding her with a slight smile cyril choniates is very ill indeed he is a man i used to know before his banishment and for whom i had the greatest admiration she regarded anna with a sudden solemnity he needs a far better physician than his current exile affords him she frowned one who will disregard his sins which i doubt are many and anyway sin is largely a matter of opinion one mans virtue may be another mans vice she looked grave anastasius you can treat him with herbs and tinctures medicines which will actually help his illness or at the very least if he is ill unto death ease his distress he deserves that do you take deserving into account no anna replied with a faint gleam of humor herself you know that as you say it is often only a point of view anyway i despise hypocrisy which would place me against half of the most pious people i know zoe laughed your frankness could prove your undoing anastasius i advise you to watch your tongue hypocrites have absolutely no sense of humor at all or they would see their own absurdity will you go and do what you can for cyril choniates will i be allowed to i shall see to it zoe replied he is at a monastery in bithynia and the papal legate bishop niccolo vicenze will accompany you there he has business with cyril which means he will organize and pay for the travel and the lodging that seems a good arrangement the weather is pleasant the journey on horseback will take you a few days but it will not be overarduous you know bithynia better than he can you will leave tomorrow morning there is no time to waste she moved slowly back across the room toward the table and smooth comfortable chairs i have an herbal mixture i would like you to take for cyril he used to enjoy it when i knew him in the past it is a simple restorative but it will give him pleasure and perhaps it will give him also an increase in strength i will take a little myself perhaps you would like some also anna hesitated as you please zoe said lightly reaching for the door of a carved wooden cabinet and opening it inside were many drawers each only a few inches square she pulled one open and took out a silk pouch full of fragments of leaves crushed so finely as to be almost a powder one takes it in a little wine she said suiting the action to the words she poured two goblets of red wine and sprinkled a little powder into each it dissolved almost immediately her eyes met annas as she picked up one of them and put it to her lips to cyril choniates she said softly and drank anna picked up the other and sipped there was no alteration to the flavor even the scent of the herb had vanished zoe emptied her goblet and offered a honey cake taking one herself and biting into it with pleasure anna drained her goblet as well honey cake zoe offered i recommend it it will take the aftertaste away anna accepted and ate zoe gave her the rest in the silk pouch thank you anna took it i will offer it to him anna made the short journey across the bosphorus to the nicean shore where she found bishop niccolo vicenze waiting for her somewhat impatiently he was pacing back and forth on the quayside his pale hair gleaming in the cool early light his face set in harsh lines of displeasure he was dressed for traveling as she was in shorter robes and soft leather boots covering his lower legs even so he managed to look severely clerical as if his office were part of himself their greeting was brief no more than an acknowledgment then they mounted the waiting horses and began the long journey inland through country she already knew the sun rose in a clear sky and the day was warm with only the slightest breeze but it was a long time since anna had ridden a horse for more than a couple of miles and she quickly grew both sore and tired although bishop vicenze was the last person to whom she would have displayed any weakness she had ridden in this land before years earlier with justinian if she closed her eyes and felt the sun on her face the strength of the animal beneath her she could imagine it was he riding ahead of her but it was vicenze who was there now along the track between the bracken the wild blackberries and the gorse and he shared nothing he never even looked back to see if she was keeping up it was familiar territory to her at least to begin with after that they followed vicenzes guidance from a map which appeared to be perfect it was fortunate but somehow it gave her little pleasure she had fully expected he would be infallible in such technical skills nevertheless she thanked him because she did not wish to be at fault in courtesy it would be a sign of weakness and although he was a priest she sensed no mercy in him they arrived at the massive fortresslike monastery after dark on the third day having found wayside lodging each night they were made welcome zoes messenger had arrived and left before them and anna at least was eagerly awaited as soon as she had been given the barest food and water and had washed her hands and face from the dust of the journey she was taken to see cyril with gratitude and anxiety a young monk took her along the silent corridors to cyrils cool stone cell it was a simple room no more than five paces by five the walls bare except for a large crucifix he lay on a narrow cot palefaced and exhausted from the pain in his chest and entire abdominal area that was not unusual with a longterm fever the normal functions do not occur and pain is natural she greeted him gently introducing herself and expressing sorrow for his illness he was not an old man as she considered age certainly not over seventy but his body was wasted from years of selfdenial and now also from illness his hair was thin and white and his face sunken his skin felt like old paper to her touch she asked him the usual questions and heard the answers she had expected she had brought herbs that were pleasant tasting but purgative to begin with what she wanted most was to give him some ease a better chance to sleep for a length of time and to restore the balance of fluid in his body drink as much as you can of this i have brewed for you she told him it will ease your pain considerably i shall make a jug full every few hours and bring it to you by tomorrow this time you will be less distressed she hoped that was true but belief was a large part of recovery christian or not it would be more comfortable if you were to be attended by someone you know well she said to him but i shall be as close by as your brethren will permit and will come at a moments notice if you call should i fast he inquired anxiously with brother thomass help i will pray i have already confessed my sins and received absolution prayer is always good she agreed but be brief do not weary god with what he already knows and no do not fast she added your spirit is strong enough in order to continue in service to god and man you need to regain the strength of your body take a little wine mixed with water and honey if you wish i abstain from wine he shook his head fractionally its not important she smiled at him now i shall make the herbal infusion for you and come back with it thank you brother anastasius he said weakly god be with you she sat up most of the night with him he was feverish and restless and she began to fear she would not be able to save him by morning he was very weak and she found it difficult to persuade him to drink the stronger herbs she had prepared he was in much distress and she became concerned that he had an internal obstruction rather than merely the natural effects of fever and ill diet she increased the strength of the purgative feeling she had little to lose this time she added sandalwood for the liver aloeswood to treat blockage in the liver and urinary system and again more calamint by nightfall he was in even greater distress but he had passed a large amount of water and seemed less pinched and his eyes less sunken sometime in the middle of the night the monk who was with him reported to her that cyril had passed a quantity of waste and seemed relieved in his pain he was now asleep she did not disturb him in the morning but looked at him closely and felt his brow he was no more than warm and he stirred vaguely at her touch without wakening she allowed herself to hope he might recover later in the day vicenze insisted on obtaining his audience as far as the monks were concerned it was he who had brought the physician under whose care cyril had begun to recover even though he was still desperately weak in gratitude the abbot could not refuse anna was kept from the room when finally she was allowed in again cyril was exhausted and he looked as if his fever were returning the young monk who had attended him all through his illness looked anxiously at anna but did not speak i will not cyril said hoarsely even if it costs me my life i will not sign a paper which swears away my faith and leads my people into apostasy he gulped his eyes fixed on annas face frightened and stubborn if i do i will lose my soul you understand that dont you anastasius i am not always sure what is right she began slowly choosing her words and watching his eyes but of course like everyone else i have thought very hard about loyalty to our faith and also the terrible danger of the latin crusaders storming the city again they will kill and burn everything in their path we have a duty to the lives of the people who trust us to care for them and for those they love their children their wives and their mothers i have heard stories of the sack in of a child who watched her mother raped and murdered in front of her he winced and the tears filled his eyes rolling down his tired cheeks but to deny our faith is a destruction even worse she went on hating herself for distressing him if you have the light of the holy spirit of god to tell you what is right then you can never deny it whatever the cost denial is not merely death it is hell he nodded slowly you are wise anastasius wiser i think than some of my own brethren certainly wiser than that coldhearted priest from rome he smiled weakly a flash of light in his eyes the only wisdom is to trust god he made the sign of the cross conspicuously in the orthodox way then lay back on his pillows and drifted into sleep a slight smile still on his face the next time she went to him he was awake and feverish his fingers trembling so it was difficult to hold the cup with the herbal infusion in it she had to put her own hands around his to help him this was the time to offer zoes restorative normally she would not give any herbs but those she had brought and mixed herself but she had already tried everything else she had she told him she was going to mix something more sent for him by zoe chrysaphes and left him with the young monk while she did so when she returned he looked tired and she offered him the new drink it may be bitter she warned i drank some myself as did zoe but we took it with wine and i know you do not wish for that he shook his head no wine he reached for the cup and she gave it to him he drank and pulled his mouth into a grimace its most unpleasant he said ruefully for once i wish i he stopped abruptly his face pale his eyes wide he gasped and clutched at his throat struggling for breath its poison the young monk cried out in terror youve poisoned him he scrambled to his feet and ran to the door help help cyril is poisoned come quickly there were footsteps clattering along the corridor loud with panic the young monk was still shouting in front of her cyril was gasping his eyes wild his skin drained of even the last vestige of color and turning blue as he choked but she herself had drunk exactly the same she had seen zoe take it out of the same silk purse and she had given cyril no more than a pinch she had not tasted bitterness but then she had taken it with wine and immediately after had cakes with honey was that it wine did zoe know cyril did not drink it she leapt up and ran to the door wine she shouted almost into the face of the monk only feet away from her get me wine and honey now this second for his life you poisoned him the monk accused his face contorted with loathing not i she said the first thing that would make any sense the roman dont stand there like a fool fetch wine and honey or do you want him dead that accusation moved him he swiveled on his heel and ran back down the corridor his sandals slapping on the stone she waited in an agony of fear dashing back into the room to hold cyril up in her arms trying to ease his breathing his throat had closed up and his chest heaved with the effort to fill his lungs it seemed to be endless one long dreadful breath after another rasping in pain at last the monk returned followed by another they had wine and honey she snatched it from them and mixed the two together not caring a bit how they tasted and held it to cyrils lips drink she commanded i dont care how hard it is drink your life depends on it she tried to pry his jaws apart and force it into his mouth he was barely breathing at all now his eyes rolled back into his head hold him she ordered the nearest monk do it he obeyed shivering with terror with two hands she was more able to force his lips apart and his head back a little of the liquid went into his mouth and he swallowed it convulsively he gagged then gulped again and it went down she gave him more and more infinitely slowly his throat eased his breathing became less labored and at last when he focused his eyes the panic had died out of them enough he said hoarsely a moment and i will take it all i promise she laid him back gently and sank to her knees on the hard floor the prayer of gratitude more audible than she had intended it was not just for cyrils life but perhaps for her own explain the abbot demanded when she stood before him in his beautiful sparse office later that evening he was gaunt his face lined with anxiety and the long battle against grief he deserved the truth absolute and not diminished or twisted by emotion but he also did not deserve her burden of suspicion that could not be proved she had had time to weigh what she should tell him zoe chrysaphes gave me an herb to offer to cyril she answered she told me it was a restorative she emptied some of it into her own wine goblet and then into mine and we both drank it with no ill effects she gave me the pouch of herbs and i took it it was from that that i mixed an infusion for cyril the abbot frowned that does not seem possible not until i remembered that zoe and i drank the herbs mixed with wine and cyril took his with water she explained also we ate honey cakes she said it prevented an aftertaste those were the only differences i knew so i immediately sent for wine and honey and forced cyril to take them he began to recover i assume it was the wine and that zoe chrysaphes had never taken it with water and did not know of its hideously different effect that of course was a lie but neither of them could prove it nor could they afford the truth i see he said slowly and what of the roman what part has he in this none that i know she said again it was a lie if he had not wished to persuade cyril to sign the addendum and zoe had not feared that he might succeed then cyril would simply have died quietly here in this monastery and public opinion regarding the union would have been unaffected zoe would choose that before his surrender annas visit had offered her the chance to make certain of cyrils refusal or if at the worst he had signed then anna and vicenze would be blamed for his murder and the document accounted worthless but the abbot did not need to know that we are grateful for your quick thought in saving him he said gravely perhaps you will tell zoe chrysaphes that i will convey whatever message you wish she replied thank you the abbot said gravely one of the brothers told me you are from nicea is that correct yes i grew up a little distance from here he smiled a slight sad gesture but it reached his eyes with a startling tenderness one of our brethren does not ever leave here there was a man who visited him but he has not been lately i think it would be a great kindness if you would spend an hour with brother john he barely made it a question anna did not hesitate of course it would be my pleasure thank you the abbot said again i shall take you and without hesitation he led her out of the room along a narrow slightly echoing passage and through a huge carved door studded with brass then up a steep and winding stairway he stopped on a small landing at the top high over the rest of the vast building he knocked at the only door and at the word of command he opened it and went in ahead of anna holding it for her to follow brother john he said quietly brother cyril has been ill and a physician has come from constantinople to help him he has done well and will shortly leave but he is from nicea and i thought you might like to speak with him for a while first his name is anastasius he reminds me somewhat of the man who used to come to see you three or four years ago anna looked at the young man who rose slowly from the hard wooden chair and thought how odd it was for the abbot to describe her when she was only a step behind him then she saw the mans face thin and worn with pain and yet startlingly gentle he was no more than in his twenties but the thing that made her heart beat wildly so the blood thundered in her head and her mouth went dry was that he had no eyes the ugly sockets were sunken giving his face a hollow mutilated look with a shock like fire she knew who he wasthis was john lascaris whose eyes had been put out by michael palaeologus so he could not succeed to the throne no wonder she reminded the abbot of the man who had come to see himit could only be justinian she choked on her own breath as it caught in her throat brother john she began how desperately she wanted to tell him that she too was a lascaris zarides was merely her married name but of course that was impossible he nodded slowly an instant of surprise in his expression because the abbot had not told him she was a eunuch and her voice betrayed her come in he invited please sit down i believe there is another chair yes thank you she accepted this man was not only the rightful emperor he was now held by many to be a saint a man of holiness so close to god as to be capable of calling upon him for miracles but it was justinians time with him that filled her mind the father abbot told me that you had a friend who came to visit you some years ago a man from nicea she began johns face lit with pleasure ah yes what a fire there was in him to learn he was truly seeking god he sounds like a fine person she said carefully would that more of us were seeking rather than assuming we already know he smiled a sudden radiant warmth in his sightless face you sound like him he said simply but perhaps a little wiser you already begin to know how vast is our capacity yet to learn and what we do not know is without end is that heaven she asked impulsively is it heaven to learn endlessly and to love she explained herself is that what he was looking for you care about him he said gently it was not entirely a question more a realization a friend a kinsman he did not have a brother he said so but a sister he said she was a physician a very gifted one she was glad he could not see her sudden tears justinian had spoken of her even here with john lascaris she swallowed the tightness in her throat a kinsman she replied needing to tell him as much truth as she could and claim the tie that was so close inside her but distant he was a lascaris he said softly rolling the name in his mouth as if the sound of it were sweet he doesnt come anymore i fear he was involved in something dangerous he spoke of michael palaeologus and a union with rome and how he wanted to save the city without either the bloodshed of war or the corruption of betrayal but it would be almost infinitely difficult john lascaris frowned the lines puckering his forehead and deepening the other lines of pain in his face something happened to him didnt it there was no possibility of lying yes but i dont know what it truly was i am trying to find out bessarion comnenos was murdered and justinian was implicated in helping the man who did it he is in exile in judea john let out his breath in a sigh it carried sorrow and infinite weariness im sorry if he could have anything to do with that then he did not find what he was seeking i sensed that the last time he was here he was different it was in his voice a disillusion disillusion she asked leaning closer to him with the church or something else my dear friend john said shaking his head a fraction from side to side justinian was looking for answers to questions of purpose and loneliness he wanted reasons that made sense to our incomplete grasp he would have been a better emperor himself than bessarion comnenos and i think he knew that but the throne would not have made him a better man im not sure if he understood that also emperor justinian he must have misunderstood but he loved the church she insisted he would have fought for it oh yes he agreed he hungered to belong to it to preserve its place its rituals its beauty and above all its identity a new idea flared up in her mind enough to die for it i cannot answer that john replied no man knows what he will die for until the moment comes do you know what you would die for anastasius she was taken aback she had no answer he smiled what do you want of god and what do you believe he wants of you i asked justinian that and he did not answer me i think he did not yet know what he believed you said he loved the church she said softly why the orthodox and not the roman they have beauty too and faith and ritual what did he believe in that he was willing to pay so much to keep it we love a familiar path john said simply none of us like to be told what to think what to do by a stranger imposing his will from another land in another tongue is that all it is a great deal he said with a small weary smile there are not many certainties in life not much that does not change wither deceive or disappoint at some time or other the sanctities of the church are the only things i know of are not these things worth living or dying for yes she said immediately did he find that at least that hope i dont know he answered his voice sad and very lonely but i miss him he looked tired the strength gone from his voice the sunken eye sockets more deeply shadowed i am doing what i can to prove he was wrongly accused she said impulsively if i succeed they will have to pardon him and he will return a cousin of a cousin he smiled at her and a friend she added i dont wish to tire you she rose frightened now in case she was tempted into betraying herself irreparably he lifted his hand in the old blessing may god light your path in the darkness and comfort your aloneness in the cold of the night anna lascaris the heat washed up her in a wave like fire yet it was sweet in spite of all the fear there should have been he knew her he had used her own name for a long terrible wonderful moment she was herself she leaned forward and touched his hand softly a totally feminine gesture then she turned and walked to the door the instant she was beyond it she would resume her role when she had made the long journey back to constantinople saying nothing but the few civil words necessary to vicenze she called upon zoe anna stood in the same room as always with its great golden cross on the wall and its magnificent view and faced zoe with a smile tasting the moment were you able to save the good cyril zoe asked her topaz eyes hard and too bright to hide her eagerness or the strange powerful emotions warring inside her yes indeed she replied levelly he may live for many years yet there was a flicker in zoes eyes and the legate vicenzedid he succeed in his purpose anna raised her eyebrows his purpose he did not go merely to accompany you zoe said keeping the temper out of her voice with difficulty oh he had an audience with cyril anna replied quite casually of course i was not present poor cyril was taken ill after that and all my attention was bent on treating him zoes anger burned behind her glittering gaze for the first time she had been balked by anna suddenly they met as equals anna smiled that was when i gave cyril the herbs that you so thoughtfully provided zoe took a deep breath and let it out slowly in that moment something changed in her a knowledge of having been confounded and they helped she asked knowing the answer already not at first anna told her in fact the effect was most unpleasant i quite feared for his life then i remembered that when you and i had taken them we did so with wine it made all the difference she smiled meeting zoes eyes unflinchingly i am grateful to you for your foresight i explained to the abbot exactly what had happened i would not wish such a holy man to imagine you had attempted to poison poor cyril that would be fearful zoes expression froze like white marble so tightly controlled that neither fury nor relief showed then something quite remarkable was there just for a second but long enough that anna was perfectly certain of what it wasadmiration how kind of you zoe said in a low voice i shall not forget it thirty vicenze returned to the house in a vicious temper how was your journey to bithynia palombara asked pointless vicenze snapped i went only because it was my holy duty to try he looked at palombara malevolently faintly suspicious as to how much he might know or guess one of us must do something to win over these obdurate people or give them room to condemn themselves utterly so that whatever we do we are justified palombara was surprised at how bitter he sounded exactly vicenze agreed it was a last attempt last vicenzes eyebrows rose and there was a gleam of satisfaction in his cold eyes next week we return to rome had you forgotten of course not palombara told him actually he had thought it was a little longer than that he had been considering with some anxiety exactly what he would report to the pope in what terms he would explain the nature of their failure to gain any more support for the agreement he had come to the point where he believed that michael could carry his people sufficiently for the appearance of union with rome and that the fact of a degree of independence could be disguised people would always believe differently from one place to another one social class one degree of wealth or education or emotional need to another but he did not think the pope would be well pleased with that it was an eminently practical answer but it was not a political victory thirtyone it was only days after that when anna attended an accident in the street an old man had tripped and bruised himself badly she was bending over his leg examining it when there was a disturbance in the crowd that had gathered and a young priest ashenfaced elbowed his way through pushing people aside roughly calling out her name is it an emergency she asked without looking up this man has had a bad shock and needs yes you may already be too late the priest reached for her arm and pulled her to her feet he is bleeding to death they have torn his tongue out she turned to the crowd and gestured to the old man take him home give him hot drinks and keep him wrapped up i have to go she picked up her bag and allowed the priest to half drag her around the corner and up an alley to a small house where the door was open she could hear gagging and wails of fear and distress even before she was inside the scene that met her was appalling a monk knelt sprawled on the floor blood streaming from his mouth pooling scarlet on the tiles in front of him covering his hands and forearms and the front of his robe he gasped gagged again and more blood gushed out of him his face was gray with pain and terror his eyes staring around him three other monks stood helplessly not knowing what to do the man was bleeding to death in front of them anna put down her bag and seized a piece of cloth from one of them glanced at it quickly to make certain it was clean then went to the man on the floor someone said his name was nicodemus i can help you she said firmly praying that please god she could im going to stop the bleeding and you wont choke youll have to breathe through your nose it may be difficult but you can do it keep still and let me press this its going to hurt but its necessary and before he could pull away she put her arm around him one of the monks suddenly grasped what she was going to do and moved forward to help together they held the terrified man while anna forced his mouth open wider and placed the cloth as hard as she could on the bloody remnant of his tongue it must have been agony but after the first convulsive jerk and shudder he kept as still as he could in a perfectly level voice she ordered the other monks and the priest who had come for her to fetch more clean cloths to open her case and take out certain herbs and spirits in small vials also her surgical needles and silk she directed two of them to fetch water and clean up the blood from the tiles all the time she kept the pressure on the stump of tongue trying desperately to prevent the man from bleeding to death choking on blood or suffocating because he could not draw air into his lungs she changed one bloodsoaked cloth for another still holding the man with her left arm she could hear the rhythmic murmur of prayer and wished she could join in finally more than half an hour after she had begun she pulled the cloth away slowly and judged that if she was quick she would be able to stitch the flesh and seal off the vessels enough to remove the cloth permanently it was a difficult task in the wavering candlelight and she was acutely conscious of the pain she must be causing unlike most other patients he could not even be given any herbs to drink to deaden the sensation his mouth and throat were a mass of swollen scarlet flesh terribly mutilated but all she had time to consider was saving his life from hemorrhaging away she worked as quickly as she could stitching pulling tying cutting stanching again always with too much blood and with pain almost palpable in the air finally she finished and swabbed away the remaining blood she gently washed his face meeting his eyes remembering that although he would never speak again he could hear everything she picked up herbs to show to all of them saying when to use them and how and in what proportions and you must keep his lips and his mouth moist she went on but dont touch the wound yet especially not with water if he will take it give him a little honeyed wine to drink but carefully dont let him choke food someone asked what can he eat gruel she replied warm not too hot and soups he will learn to chew and to swallow properly but give him time she hoped that was true she had no prior experience with such a mutilation thank you the priest who had called her said sincerely your name will always be in our prayers she waited with them all night watching listening to them trying to reassure one another and find courage for what they knew lay ahead perhaps for all of them nicodemus was the first but he would not be the last who did this she asked dreading the answer the monks glanced at one another then at her we do not know who they were one of them replied they had the emperors authority but they were led by a foreigner a roman priest with lightcolored hair and eyes like a winter sea he breathed in and out slowly and his voice dropped even lower he had a list anna felt the coldness scour through her as if strength drained away she was wrong to have doubted constantine too squeamish too cowardly of spirit to acknowledge the truth because she wanted to keep her hands clean she was ashamed of her stupidity faith called for high pricesfaith in god the light and the hope crucifixion was brutal she was sick at the thought of it the reality of the gasping for breath the agony through belly and loins and every sinew the sheer terror why did the images soften it as if christ had not been flesh like everyone else as if his searing horror had been different the answer was obviousto escape knowing it because it made our own betrayal of him easier then a curious peace filled her se had been wrong in her judgment of constantine wrong ignorant and shallow she was crushed with penitence they would all have to fight to pick up and use weapons that would hurt them as well as the enemy but the conflict inside her had ceased and instead there was the wide sweet balm of assurance she was called again to help other monks who had been tortured but none afflicted her with the same panic as the first one had she did not save everyone sometimes all she could do was ease the agony stay with them to be there in the last moments it was never enough she hated to be thanked to accept their gratitude even when she failed she did not feel brave she wanted to run away but the nightmares she would suffer forever if she left a dying man would have been worse than any waking horror at home she tossed and turned in the night and often woke gasping her face wet with tears her lungs aching she crept out of bed and knelt in prayer father help me teach me why do you let this happen they are good men peaceable men trying with all their hearts and bodies all their time every day to serve you why cant you help them or dont you care nothing answered her but the silence void as the night if there were real stars not just dreams and illusion they were infinitely out of reach once she only just escaped the emperors men when they broke into the house and she ran half dragged out of the back door by others who were just as passionately against the union they were willing to forfeit their homes and possessions to rescue the monks who still preached against it and were made martyrs for their faith she ran with them through the wind and rain their feet splashing in the rivulets of water streaming along the gutters bumping into blind walls and tripping over steps in the darkness she was pulled along someone else carrying her bag and her instruments she had little idea who they were only gratitude for their courage when eventually they burst into a quiet room with an old woman alone beside the fire she saw in the torchlight that there were three of them two men and a young woman with long wet hair you must be more careful the woman said gasping as she struggled to allow the breath into her lungs you have answered too many of these calls they know you now why me who knows me she asked fighting against the truth bishop constantine he answered people know you are his physician and you have helped him with the poor no more was said of it of course it was constantine who was behind the rescues the medicines the whole resistance of the mass of ordinary people it had been he who had fought to have justinian exiled instead of put to death for his involvement in bessarions murder they were all battling for the same cause the survival of the faith the life the existence of byzantium and the freedom to worship as they knew to be right she went to constantine in the quietness of his own house in the gallery where his favorite icon hung thank you she said simply standing hungry and bruised still exhausted in body from the nights loss and flight the whole bitter failure of it thank you for all you do for having the courage to lead us holding the light high for us to see i dont really know how much i care passionately for one faith over another one creed in the nature of god and the holy spirit but i know absolutely that i care for the love of humanity that christ taught us i know with all my heart that it is worth everything we can pay for it it is worth living and dying for without it in the end the darkness takes everything there was a moments prickling silence she realized what she had said if hell were not so deep that it could break your soul then heaven could not be so high would we want god to lower heaven she drew in her breath as he lifted his head from prayer and looked at her could he ever do that and still be god she asked although she could have answered it herself he said nothing but he made the sign of the cross in the air it did not matter she did not need his reply thirtytwo helena had a mild but embarrassing ailment that she preferred anna to treat rather than the physician she usually called it was the middle of the afternoon and simonis woke anna from a briefly snatched rest she was exhausted from treating the mutilated and dying and her first instinct when simonis told her helena had sent for her was to refuse how could she ever keep patience with a little irritation to the skin when men were being tortured to death bessarions widow simonis said sharply looking at annas face i know youre tired her voice softened but there was still urgency in it and an edge of fear you havent slept properly for weeks but you cant afford to refuse helena comnena she knew justinian she said his name gently and his friends she did not add any more but it hung in the air between them helena received anna in a newly painted lush room next to her bedchamber the murals had been redesigned far closer to the erotic than bessarion would have allowed anna hid her smile helena was dressed in a loose tunic she had an ugly rash on her arms at first she was frightened and polite then as the herbs and advice began to take effect she was no longer so concerned and her natural arrogance reasserted itself it still hurts helena said sharply pulling her arm away it will hurt for a little while longer anna told her you must keep the ointment on it and take the herbs at least twice a day theyre disgusting helena responded curling her lip havent you got anything that doesnt taste as if youre trying to poison me if i were trying to poison you i would make it sweet anna replied with a slight smile helena paled anna saw it and her interest sharpened why had helena mentioned poison so easily she looked away and allowed the silk of helenas robes to fall back into a more modest position do you really have any idea what youre doing helena snapped anna decided on the risk if you are worried i know other physicians who might suit you and i am sure zoe would know even more helenas eyes were bright and hard her cheeks flushed she swallowed as if there were something rank in her throat im sorry i spoke in haste your skill is quite sufficient i am unused to pain anna kept her eyes lowered in case helena saw in them the contempt she felt you are right to be apprehensive such things if not treated quickly can become serious helena drew in her breath with a little hiss really how quickly as you have done anna had exaggerated the danger i have another herb here which will help but if you wish i will stay with you so that if it should have any ill effects in other ways i can give you the antidote that was an invention but it would take time even to broach the subjects she wished to explore helena gulped what sort of effects will it make me ill faint anna replied thinking of something not too distressing perhaps a little hot but it will pass quickly if i give you the herb which counteracts it you mustnt take it if it isnt needed ill stay with you and charge extra no doubt helena snapped for the herb not for the time helena considered for several seconds then accepted anna mixed a number of herbs for her and had them steeped in hot water it would be relaxing good for the digestion she soothed her conscience by telling herself she had kept her oath if she was doing no good at least she was doing no harm helena saw annas eyes on the murals do you like them she asked anna drew in her breath ive seen nothing like them before nor in the flesh i suppose helena observed with a sneer anna longed to say that she had tended patients in a brothel once and seen something of the sort but she could not afford to no she said clenching her teeth helena laughed the servant returned with the steeped herbs in a glass helena sipped it its sour she remarked she looked at anna over the top of the glass anna could not afford to delay any longer you should look after yourself she said trying to invest her expression with concern you have suffered a good deal she realized with a jolt that for all she knew that could be true helena struggled to mask her surprise not entirely successfully my husband was murdered of course it is not easy as anna stood looking at her she knew it was perfectly possible helena had actually assisted in his murder but she hid her disgust behind a pretense of anxiety surely it was worse than that was he not killed by men you had supposed to be his friends and yours yes helena said slowly i had thought so im sorry anna murmured i cannot imagine what it must have been like for you of course you cant helena agreed a shadow across her face that might have been contempt or only a movement of the light justinian was in love with me you know anna gulped really i had heard it was antoninus but perhaps i misunderstood it was only gossip helena did not move no she denied antoninus admired me perhaps but that is hardly love is it i dont know anna lied helena smiled it isnt it is a hunger or dont you know what i mean she turned and looked at anna appraisingly it was a euphemism for lust anastasius anna lowered her eyes to prevent helena from reading them do i embarrass you helena asked with obvious pleasure anna ached to fight back to blaze at her that no she didnt she revolted her with greed manipulation and lies but she could not afford to i do embarrass you helena concluded happily but you didnt know antoninus he was handsome in a fashion she continued but he had not the depth of character of justinian he was extraordinary she let it hang in the air the suggestion infinite were they friends anna asked oh yes in many things helena replied but antoninus liked parties drinking games horses that sort of thing he was a good friend of andronicus the emperors sonalthough perhaps not as much as esaias justinian was an excellent rider too but he had more intelligence he read all sorts of things he liked architecture mosaics philosophy things that were beautiful regret touched her face only momentarily but it was deep anna was touched by it also with pity and with a closeness so in that instant she cared for helena as if they had been one in grief and perhaps they were then the mood shattered before she was ready for it youre right helena said huskily i have suffered far more than most people realize you must take care of me dont look so crushed youre a good physician anna forced her attention back to the present i didnt know that justinian loved you she said hearing her own voice artificial in her ears she remembered constantine saying how justinian had been revolted by helenas advances and rebuffed her surely that was the truth you must miss him anna added i do helena said with a tight gleaming smile unreadable except as a mask for something else anna was a servant and a eunuch why should helena show her anything she did not have to and your husband too anna added judiciously helena shrugged he was a bore he was always talking about religion and politics away with the damn bishop half the time constantine anna said in surprise of course constantine helena snapped she looked at the glass in her hand this is disgusting but it doesnt make me feel ill you dont need to stay she dismissed her come again in three days ill pay you then when anna returned she had been with helena only ten minutes when another visitor was announced eulogia mouzakios helena had little choice but either to invite her in as soon as she was dressed again or to allow eulogia to know that she had a physician presentor more dangerous than that some other caller she did not wish her to meet if you dare tell her what you came to treat me for i shall see you never work again she snarled do you understand me say you have sprained your ankle anna advised she will smell the unguent in the air i will not contradict you helena straightened her tunic she did not bother to answer eulogia came in a few moments later bearing a gift of honeyed fruit she was an elegant woman fairhaired and a little thin several inches taller than helena there was a jolting familiarity about her that froze anna in sudden confusion she searched her mind for the name and found nothing my physician helena said waving an arm at anna after she had greeted her guest anastasius she gave a slight smile infinitely condescending she was saying the name so eulogia would recognize anna instantly as a eunuch a womanish creature with a mans name and no gender at all eulogia stared at anna for a moment then looked away entering conversation with helena as if anna had been a servant in that instant anna recognized her eulogia was catalinas sister they had met several times in nicea years ago when catalina was alive no wonder eulogia had been disturbed by memory at first the sweat broke out on annas skin and her breath was shaky her hands trembling she must watch every gesture nothing must remind eulogia of justinians sister she had not finished prescribing for helena who would be angry if she left she was imprisoned here by obligation and circumstance helena sensed her discomfort and smiled she turned to eulogia have some wine and figs these are very good very quickly dried to produce excellent humors its kind of you to call she ordered the servant to bring refreshments including a glass for anna it seemed to amuse her anna considered refusing eulogia was watching her the puzzled look in her face again anna dared not let helena believe she was afraid of staying thank you she accepted smiling back ill have time to prepare your herbs ointment helena snapped then blushed aware she might have made a mistake i have a sprain she said to eulogia eulogia nodded and offered her sympathy they moved to sit together leaving anna to look in her bag for the appropriate items how is demetrios eulogia inquired well i imagine helena said casually the wine figs and nuts came she poured leaving aside a glass for anna but not offering it i imagine justinian will not be returning eulogia remarked looking obliquely at helena helena allowed herself to look sad no they believe he was deeply implicated in bessarions death of course he wasnt she smiled whoever it was tried before you know when justinian was in bithynia miles from here annas hand froze over the herbs fortunately her back was to the room and neither helena nor eulogia could see her face tried to kill him eulogia said in amazement how poison helena said simply ive no idea who it was she took a bite out of a dried fig and chewed it slowly and bessarion was attacked in the street a few months after that also it looked like an attempted robbery but afterward bessarion himself thought it was one of his own men but demetrios found them for him from friends of histhe varangian guard so it seems unlikely eulogia was curious demetrios vatatzes has friends in the varangian guard how interesting unusual for a man of an old imperial family but then his mother eirene is unusual helena shrugged it off thats what i thought he said perhaps i was wrong eulogia was concerned thats dreadful why would anyone wish to harm bessarion he was the noblest of men helena hid her impatience it was always religion with him so it was probably something to do with that of course he and justinian quarreled terribly about it twice that i know of and then justinian went to eirene heaven knows why after that of course bessarion really was killed by antoninus funny thing is that i never knew that antoninus cared about religion all that much he was a soldier for heavens sake anna turned around the herbs in her hand and a small jar of ointment she held them out why thank you anastasius helena said charmingly meeting annas eyes ill pay you if you come tomorrow when im not busy anna returned as commanded to collect the money when she arrived helena received her after only fifteen minutes wait and made her almost welcome they were in the newly decorated room with its exotic murals she was dressed in a soft deep plum color that became her excellently she had a minimum of jewelry but with her warm skin and rich hair she did not need it the silk of her dalmatica billowed around her as she came across the room it was one of the rare moments when helena was as beautiful as her mother thank you for coming she said warmly my ankle is so much better i shall recommend you to everyone i know she smiled but she made no reference to the money thank you anna replied taken by surprise odd that eulogia should call just as you were here helena went on she was related to justinian lascaris you know anna felt herself tense was she he was married some time ago helenas tone dismissed it as if it were not relevant anymore she died she was eulogias sister she was watching annas face as she spoke anna stood motionless awkward her hands seemed clumsy and in the way as if she had no idea what to do with them she swallowed really she tried to sound uninterested she was trembling helena picked up a small jeweled box from the table it was exquisite silver set with chalcedony and surrounded by pearls anna could not help looking at it you like it helena held it out for anna to see its very beautiful anna replied sincerely helena smiled justinian gave it to me unwise i suppose but as i told you he loved me she said it with satisfaction but still looking at anna under her eyelashes bessarion gave me very little that i can recall if he had chosen anything it would have been books or icons dark ones of course heavy and very serious she looked back at anna justinian was fun you know or dont you know that he had an elusive quality about him as if you could never really know all of him he would always surprise you i like that annas sense of discomfort grew why was helena telling her all this surely it was lies as constantine had said helena was beautiful and profoundly sensuous but justinian must have seen what was ugly inside her if not immediately then soon after helena turned the box in her hand its pearls catching the light why had justinian spent so much on her or was that a lie too helena was watching her there was an intensity in her gaze that was almost mesmeric the light was shining on the box on the plum silk of her dalmatica on the gloss of her hair do you like beautiful things anastasius she asked there was only one possible answer to that yes helenas winged eyebrows rose her eyes wide and dark just yes how unimaginative of you what kinds of beautiful things she insisted jewelry ornaments glass paintings tapestries statuary or do you like music and good food or something you can touch like silk or fur what gives you pleasure anastasius she put the box on the table and walked three steps closer to anna do eunuchs have pleasure she said softly was this what had happened to justinian anna felt the sweat run down her body and the blood hot in her face helena was trying to awaken her sexually for entertainment power simply to see if she could the air in the room prickled as if a storm were about to break anna would have given anything on earth to escape it was excruciating helenas eyes swept down annas body do you have anything left anastasius she asked her voice soft not with pity but with a sharp and curiously coarse interest her small hand reached out to touch annas groin where her male organs would have been had she had them they met nothing anna panicked and hysteria welled up as if she were going to choke helenas eyes were bright laughing at once both inviting and contemptuous no man however mutilated would refuse to speak at all and whatever anna said it must be what a man would say not the revulsion that was beating inside her now like a huge bird trapped and breaking itself to force a way out helena was still waiting she would never either forget or forgive a rebuff she was so close anna could feel the warmth of her and see the pulse beating in her throat pleasure must be mutual my lady anna said her voice catching in her throat i think it would take a remarkable man to please you helena stood absolutely still her features slack with surprise and disappointment anastasius had been polite to her flattering yet she knew she had been robbed of something she made a sharp little sound of annoyance and stepped back now it was she who did not know how to answer without giving herself away your money is on the table by the door she said between her teeth you bore me take it and go anna swiveled and went out forcing herself not to run thirtythree anna arrived home after her encounter with helena with her mind racing and her body still trembling as if she had been physically assaulted she strode past simonis with barely a word and went to her own room she took off her clothes and bandages and stood naked then washed herself over and over again as though she could cleanse herself with harsh astringent lotion smelling the bite of it with pleasure it stung even hurt but the pain pleased her she dressed again in her plain golden brown tunic and dalmatica and left the house without eating or drinking she was fortunate that constantine was at home he rose from his seat his broad face filled with anxiety the moment after she entered what is it he demanded whats happened is it another monk tortured dead it was preposterous her obsession with her own so desperately trivial hurt when people were dying terribly she started to laugh hearing it run out of control and end in sobbing no she gasped fumbling her way forward to sit in her accustomed chair no its nothing at all nothing that matters she put her elbows on the table and dropped her head into her hands i saw helena ive been treating hernothing serious just painful she what he demanded sitting opposite her his voice was gentle but there was an edge of alarm in it she looked up at him steadying herself really nothing she repeated you told me that she made an advance to justinian which he found acutely embarrassing she did not add her own experience but he understood it she saw his face darken and then pity and revulsion leap to his eyes as if he had been touched by it himself im sorry he said quietly be careful she is a dangerous woman i know i think i made a reasonably graceful refusal but i know she wont forget it i hope i dont have to treat her again perhaps she wont want me to dont rely on that anastasius it entertains her to humiliate anna pictured helenas face i think she knows humiliation she told me justinian was in love with her she showed me a beautiful box that she said he gave her she saw it in her mind as she said it it was the sort of thing justinian would have chosen but surely not for helena constantines mouth curled with distaste and perhaps a vestige of pity lies he said without hesitation he disliked her but he believed that bessarion could lead the people against the union with rome so he hid his feelings she said he quarreled with bessarion badly shortly before he was killed was that a lie too constantine stared at her no he said quietly that was the truth he told me of it himself why she demanded was it about helena did justinian tell him that helena had how could he tell him such a thing he didnt constantine shook his head minutely it was not to do with helena then what i cant tell you he replied im sorry the protest welled up inside her she saw in his face that he knew the answer and that he would not tell her was it a confession she said shakily justinian now the fear gripped inside her like an iron hand closing i cannot tell you constantine repeated to do so would betray others some things i know some i guess would you have me speak that aloud were it your heart and your secret no she said hoarsely no of course i wouldnt im sorry anastasius he swallowed hard his skin was very pale be very careful of helena of all of them there is such a lot that you dont understand life and death cruelty hatred old debts and dreams things that people never let go of he leaned farther toward her two men are dead already and a third exiled and that is only a tiny part of it serve god in your own way heal their ills but leave the rest of it alone to argue with him would be pointless and unfair she had not told him the truth so how could he understand they were each trying to reach the other he failing because he was bound by the sanctity of confession she because she could not trust him with the truth of why she could not let go of any of it thank you she said quietly thank you for listening we shall pray together he replied come she was at the blachernae palace having treated one of the eunuchs for a bad chest infection and been up with him all night until the crisis broke then she had been sent for by the emperor over a minor skin irritation she was still with him when the two papal legates from rome palombara and vicenze were granted an audience and were shown in as was customary by the varangian guard they were always there strong men with lean hard bodies dressed in full armor the emperor was never without them no matter the time of day or night how formal or trivial the occasion anna stood a little apart not included yet neither had she been given leave to go she recalled her unpleasant journey to bithynia with vicenze during which cyril choniates was nearly killed all the ritual greetings were exchanged wellwishes that no one meant beside anna nicephoras was watching every inflection while outwardly seeming merely to wait only once did he glance at her with a momentary smile she realized that he would remain here judging both words and silences and afterward give michael his counsel she was glad of that there is still some dissension among certain factions who do not see the need for christendom to stand together vicenze said with barely concealed impatience we must do something decisive to prevent them from causing trouble among the people im sure his majesty is aware of that palombara glanced at vicenze then away again both humor and dislike in his eyes he cannot be vicenze argued impatiently or he would have addressed it i seek only to inform and ask advice the look of contempt he shot his fellow legate was sharp and cold palombara smiled and that too was a gesture without warmth his majesty will not tell us everything he knows your grace he would hardly have led his people back again to their city and kept them safe were he ignorant of their nature and their passions or lacking in either the skill or the courage to govern them anna hid her smile with difficulty this was becoming interesting rome certainly did not speak with a single voice although it might be only ambition or personal enmity that divided them palombara looked at michael again time is short your majesty is there some way in which we might assist are there leaders with whom we might speak and resolve some of their fears i have already spoken with the patriarch vicenze told him he is an excellent man of great vision and understanding for half a second it was clear in palombaras face that he had not known that then he concealed it and smiled i dont think the patriarch is where we need to concentrate our efforts your grace actually i believe it is the monks in different abbeys who harbor the greatest reservations about trusting rome but perhaps your information is different from mine two spots of color stained vicenzes pale cheeks but he was too furious to trust himself to speak palombara looked at michael perhaps if we were to discuss the situation your majesty we might learn of a way in which in christian brotherhood we could find an accord with these holy men and persuade them of our common cause against the tide of islam which i fear is lapping ever closer around us this time it was michael whose face lit with amusement the conversation continued for a further twenty minutes and then the two legates withdrew and shortly afterward anna went after them having finally been noticed and given permission to leave she was on the way through the last hall before the great doors when she encountered palombara apparently alone he looked at her with interest and she was unpleasantly aware of a certain curiosity in him because he was clearly unfamiliar with eunuchs she became selfconscious aware of her womans body under the clothes as if he could see some kind of guilt in her eyes perhaps to a man unused to even the concept of a third gender her masquerade was more apparent did she look feminine to him or was he simply considering how mutilated she was that her hands were so slender and her neck her jaw lighter than a mans she must say something to him quickly engage his intellect away from her physical presence you will find it a difficult task persuading the monks of the truth of your doctrine your grace normally she was not conscious of her voice but now to her it sounded so much that of a woman without the mellower more throaty quality of a eunuch they have given their lives to orthodoxy she added some in most terrible martyrdom is that what you advise the emperor he asked taking a step closer to her in spite of his bishops robes and emblems of office there was a virility about him that was unpriestly she wanted to make some uniquely eunuch gesture to remind both of them that she was not a woman but she could think of nothing that would not be absurd the last advice i gave him was to drink infusion of camomile she answered and was delighted to see palombaras puzzlement for what purpose he asked knowing she was taking some advantage of him to amuse herself it relaxes the mind and assists digestion she replied then in case he should think the emperor was ill i came to attend one of the eunuchs who had a fever now she was aware of her crumpled dalmatica after a long night of nursing and the pallor of her face from weariness i have been with him for many hours but fortunately he is past the crisis now i am free to leave and attend my other patients she moved forward to pass him the emperors physician palombara observed you look young to have attained such responsibility i am young she responded fortunately the emperor has excellent health so you practice on the palace eunuchs i make no distinction between one sick person and another she raised her eyebrows i dont care whether they are roman greek muslim or jew except as their beliefs affect their treatment i imagine you are the same or have you ceased to minister to ordinary people that would explain your perception of the monks who do not wish to be driven into union with rome you are against the union he observed with faint irony as if he had known she would be tell me why is the issue of whether the holy spirit proceeds from the father only or the father and the son worth sacrificing your city foragain she did not wish to concede his point let me be equally direct it is you who will sack us not we who will come to rome and burn and pillage it why does the issue mean so much to you is it enough to justify the murder and rape of a nation for your aggrandizement you are too harsh he said softly we cannot sail from rome to acre without stopping somewhere on the way for water and provisions constantinople is the obvious place and you cannot visit a place without destroying it is that what you have in mind for jerusalem also if you beat the saracens very holy she added sarcastically all in the name of christ of course your christ not minemine was the one the romans crucified it seems to be becoming a habit was once not enough for you he winced his gray eyes widening i had no idea eunuchs were so savage in argument from the look on your face you have no idea about them us at all that was a bad slip did he anger her because he was a roman or because he could not take the gender for granted and made her so aware of her lie and the loss of herself as a woman i am beginning to realize how little i know about byzantium he said softly laughter and curiosity at the back of his eyes may i call on you if i need a physician if you fall ill you should call one of your own she responded you are more likely to need a priest than someone skilled in herbs and i cannot minister to a romans sins are not all sins much the same he asked amusement now quite open in his face exactly the same but some of us do not see them as sins and it is the healing i am responsible for not the shrivingor the judgment not the judgment his eyes widened she winced as the barb struck home are the sins different he asked if they are not then what have rome and byzantium been fighting for over the centuries he smiled power is that not what we always fight for and money she added and pride i suppose not much is hidden from a good physician he shook his head a little or a good priest she added although the damage you do is harder to attribute good day your grace she moved past him and walked down the steps toward the street thirtyfour zoe had seen the necklace when it was almost finished she had stood in the goldsmiths shop and watched him working the metal heating it slowly bending it and smoothing it into exactly the shape he wanted she had seen the stones because he had had them out in order to make the shapes to hold them golden topaz pale topaz almost like spring sunlight dark smoky citrines and quartz almost bronze only a woman with hair like autumn leaves and fire in her eyes could wear this without being dominated by it and made to look eclipsed rather than enhanced the goldsmith would be flattered that she wore it it would advertise his art and earn him more customers then everyone would want his work she arrived at his shop at midmorning gold coins ready in a small leather pouch she would not send sabas for this because she wanted to make sure the piece was perfect before she passed over her money she was irritated to see someone already there a gauntfaced middleaged man his graying hair prematurely thin he was holding coins in his hand he closed his fingers over them smiling and passed them to the smith the smith thanked him and picked up zoes necklace he laid it on a piece of ivory silk wrapped it gently and passed it to the man who took it and folded it away until it was concealed by his dalmatica he thanked the smith then turned and walked away toward zoe his face alight with satisfaction zoes fury overtook her the man had taken her necklace and the smith had allowed it it was only as the man passed her that she recognized him even after all these yearsarsenios vatatzes eirenes cousin by marriage the head of the house whose crest was carved on the back of her crucifix it was his family who had robbed zoes father in promising to help in that terrible escape then betraying them by keeping the relics the icons the documents of history that were uniquely byzantine they had fled to egypt and sold them to the alexandrians to finance a fat comfortable exile while zoes father hideously bereaved a widower with one small daughter had had to labor with his hands in order to survive now arsenios was rich and back again in constantinople the time was right she turned away in case he might recognize her also she arrived home with her mind racing there were a dozen ways of achieving someones ruin but it depended upon circumstance the persons friends and enemies their family or lovers their hungers their strengths the weaknesses through which they were vulnerable arsenios was clever and it seemed he had wealth which these days meant power the vatatzes had ruled byzantium in exile from to arsenioss brother gregory was married to eirene who was also of aristocratic descent from the doukas dynasty only a disgrace so clear so blatant as to be unarguable would work what kind of disgrace she paced the floor of her room walked over to the great cross and stared at it seeing in her minds eye the other side with one goal achieved one of its fourfold emblems meaningless at last the vatatzes must be next whom was the necklace for someone arsenios loved but whom it did not take long to find out that he was a widower and had one daughter maria who was soon to make a fortunate marriage into a family with not only wealth but immense power and ambition her beauty and her lineage were her strengths and therefore arsenioss strength also that was where to strike the plan took shape in her mind it would avenge the humiliation she had suffered in syracuse all those years ago arsenios would pay for that as he would pay for betraying byzantium anastasius zarides was the perfect vehicle but with a peculiar mixture of emotions she remembered their last encounter at first she had thought his saving the monk cyril was just one of those random pieces of good fortune that happen from time to time to anyone but then she had seen something in the healers eyes that made her believe he knew she had tried to poison cyril and had himself worked out exactly how she could see him in her minds eye and it was almost as if she had caught half an image on some polished surface herself and yet not herself the clothes were different the shape of the body no lush curves of bosom and hip yet the turn of the neck the refinement of the jaw just for half a second the blink of an eye were the same it was a delusion of course it was the fire in the mind that was the resemblance the steel inside of course anastasius had serious flaws he forgave and that was a weakness that sooner or later would prove fatal he overlooked faults such a defect infuriated zoe it was like a chip on the face of an otherwise perfect statue the mutilation of his manhood was a shame but he was too young to be of any interest to her although it was difficult to be accurate about the age of a man who was not a man a human being without the spirit or the fire to hate was only halfalive that was a waste she liked himapart from that she shook herself impatiently the only thing of importance was that he was the perfect tool for this task and perhaps for others in the future she realized with surprise just how sorry she would be if it did destroy him the sun was making bright patterns on the floor its warmth soothing her shoulders what was the cause of this new hate of anastasius in helena had he bested her too in something and was she stupid enough to resent it instead of tasting the amusement of it zoes daughter gave in to emotion instead of using it the idea that was forming in her mind had far greater possibilities than merely destroying arsenios by using anastasius she might also learn the answer to several questions that had become more and more insistent lately anastasius was always interested in the murder of bessarion zoe had assumed that the law was correct and antoninus had killed him and then justinian had helped him conceal it she had thought that she knew why but possibly she had been mistaken it could be dangerous to be wrong also dangerous was the possibility of michael learning that she had deliberately ruined arsenios if he discovered this he might deduce that she had also killed cosmas he might feel inclined to stop her that must be prevented michael was clever inventive a true byzantine above all he would save his country his people against their will if necessary but he would live or die to prevent the crusaders from burning constantinople again if zoe were indispensable to him in any part of foiling charles of anjou then he would protect her from the devil himself let alone some mere question of the law even as she stood in the sun the sounds of the street echoing below her the far light gleaming on the sea she began to see how she would do it it took over two weeks for scalini the sicilian to visit her alone and at night as she had insisted he was a weasel of a man but clever and not without a sense of humor and that quality alone redeemed him in her eyes i have a job for you scalini she told him as soon as he sat in the chair opposite her and she had poured wine it was long after midnight and she had only one torch lit of course he nodded and reached for the glass he put it to his long sharp nose and sniffed ascalon wine with honey and something else wild camomile seeds she told him he smiled where is the job sicily naples rome wherever the king of the two sicilies might be she replied as long as he is not here by then it would be too late he grinned his teeth were sharp and white well cared for he will not be here yet he said with relish licking his lips as if tasting something sweet the pope has forgiven the emperor of byzantium when he heard this piece of news his majesty of the two sicilies was so beside himself with rage that he snatched up his own scepter and bit off the top of it zoe laughed until the tears were wet on her face scalini joined in and they finished the wine she opened a new bottle and they finished that as well it was coming toward three in the morning when at last she leaned forward her face suddenly grave scalini for reasons which are not your concern i need to have something of great worth to offer the emperor a year from now may be sufficient but i need to be certain of it he pursed his lips the only thing michael palaeologus wants is his throne secure and constantinople safe hell trade anything else on earth for the citys securityeven the church and who threatens him she whispered charles of anjou the world knows that i want to know everything i can about him everything do you understand me scalini his small brown eyes searched her face studying inch by inch yes i understand thirtyfive it was beginning to disturb zoe that she did not know for certain who had betrayed justinian to the authorities she had assumed it was some clumsiness that had caused antoninus to be caught and he had been tortured which was a common practice but on reflection she doubted that even under torture antoninus an unquestionably brave man and a soldier of excellent record would betray any friend let alone one who was as close as justinian had been now she needed to know who it had been and if anastasius would discover that for her so much the better in the meanwhile he was treating maria vatatzes precisely according to zoes plan the whispers as to the exact nature of marias disease were spreading nicely the tide of anger would in time take back her brother and her father just as zoe intended if someone is poisoning her find out who and give her an antidote she said to anastasius if anyone knows such a thing it is you who would poison her anastasius asked zoe raised her eyebrows you ask as if i would know her brother georgios is a friend of andronicus palaeologus as esaias is and antoninus was they play hard drink hard and take their pleasure where they wish georgios has a high temper so i have heard perhaps he has enemies i have wondered if it could have a thread of connection with bessarions death after five years anastasius said with disbelief zoe smiled she was not quite sure how much anastasius knew and it was sharp in her memory that this blandseeming eunuch could bite very hard indeed five years is nothing there is much yet to learn she said gently antoninus is dead but justinian is still alive you have asked many questions but never the only one that i ask and cannot answer what question is that anastasiuss voice had dropped to a whisper there was no doubt that zoe had his total attention now who betrayed justinian to the authorities zoe answered antoninus anastasius replied but the certainty had gone from his voice zoe felt victory sing inside her at least for this first step i assumed it was but your questions stirred doubt in me shortly before bessarion was killed justinian quarreled with him passionately justinian went to eirene about it but she gave him no help he went to demetrios but he was no help either he did not come to me why was that zoe could see the thoughts racing behind anastasiuss dark gray eyes sometimes for an instant he looked like justinian the same expression except that justinian had been such a man do you think this poisoning of maria if thats what it is could have something to do with bessarions murder anastasius asked doubt still in his voice georgios vatatzes it might not the truth but close enough to be believable georgios knew bessarion and he knew antoninus even better thank you anastasius said quietly perhaps that is true anna found georgios as he was leaving the blachernae palace he was a betterlooking man than his father taller and leaner without the years of soft living larding his body with fat he recognized her after only a moments hesitation is my sister worse he said sharply stopping in the shadow of the great outer wall with its immense stones fitted so perfectly together and the high windows that let in so much light no anna said with rather more certainty than she felt but she may be if i dont find the source of the poison he stiffened why do you say it is poison or is this just an excuse because you dont know how to treat her i dont know who is poisoning maria she said quietly but i think that if you examine everything you know particularly about other plots other deaths you might know he looked totally confused whose death bessarion comnenos she suggested or antoninus was he not a friend of yours and andronicus palaeologus he froze god almighty that his face was pale do you know something that could be of danger to someone or of use and theyd poison maria he was aghast wouldnt they she asked what was antoninus like and justinian lascaris she almost stumbled over the name they were close friends he said slowly remembrance sharpening in his mind as he found the words justinian cared about the church more than he let on i think he frowned antoninus was different when he was with justinian he was thoughtful loved beautiful things but when he was with andronicus and esaias he was just like any other soldier enjoying the moment i never knew which was the real man a shadow crossed his face we were going to have a great party the night after bessarion was killed esaias and andronicus were going to be there andronicus planned to have races firstthat was antoninuss idea like the old days before the exile justinian loved horses too he always said wed know we really had our city back when we opened the hippodrome again was justinian going to be at the party no antoninus said he had to be somewhere else but what the devil can this have to do with maria anger darkened his face again just cure her ill find out who did it it was pointless to argue any further anna thanked him and walked away leaving him staring out across the city toward the western headland and the old hippodrome she turned over everything that he had said was the party important it had been canceled because antoninus was arrested that day had he betrayed justinian for what they had executed him anyway or was zoe right and it had been someone else perhaps esaias what was supposed to have happened at that party which was the real antoninusthe partygoer drunkard and lover of horse races whom georgios had described and she had heard about from others or the man of passion and intelligence whom justinian would have wanted as a friend anna discovered the nature of the poison afflicting maria vatatzesit was administered through the stems and leaves of the flowers that arrived fresh every few days in marias room maria was recovering but it was too late to save her reputation from the whispers about her virtue her marriage to john kalamanos was canceled his family would no longer countenance it and he yielded to their wishes maria was devastated even though she was almost in full health again she threw herself onto her bed and sobbed there was nothing anna could do to help it was unjust but there was no recourse anna had not been long home after what was her final visit to maria when simonis came in to say that there was a gentleman to see her it was after dark and leo was still out on an errand anna could see the anxiety in simoniss face anna smiled show him in please i expect he has some matter to discuss which is urgent if he calls at this hour georgios vatatzes entered in a towering rage his face was flushed and he stormed into the room slamming the door behind him with simonis barely through it anna squared her shoulders and stood as tall as she could but she was still several inches shorter than him and half his weight have you discovered something she said as stiffly as she could but her voice wavered a little giving her away she sounded like a woman no i havent in gods name what does it matter who poisoned her his voice was thick with rage the kalamani have withdrawn their offer of marriage as if our family were unclean it stains all of us they wont remember it was some unknown poison all theyll think of was that the word went around maria was a whore you let the filthy gossips say whatever they wanted when you could have told them the truth you could have said it was poison she countered i was not free to whos going to believe us when you wouldnt back us up he was drunk slurring his words the poison worked didnt it it didnt kill her but she might as well be dead he was standing so close to her that she could smell the acrid sweat on him and the odor of wine her breath was ragged you could have told anyone you wished to that she was being poisoned you destroyed her with your sanctimonious silence as surely as if youd poisoned her yourself he sneered she might as well be dead because she didnt marry john kalamanos she said if he loved her he would believe what she said and marry her anyway georgios lunged forward and struck anna across the side of the face sending her sprawling backward arms flailing she caught her left hand on the edge of a small table and pain shot through her arm he reached for her pulling her up by the front of her tunic and hit her again she could hardly get her breath for the fear that seemed to paralyze her she was dizzy and could taste blood she knew he was going to go on beating her any moment her clothes would rip and expose the padding and her breasts then it wouldnt matter if he killed her or not it would all be ended anyway the next time he came forward she managed to roll over sideways away from him and reached for the small stool half under the table his blow landed on her shoulder numbing her arm she grasped the stool with her other hand and swung it back toward his face as hard as she could she heard him roar with surprise and pain then there was a scream that was not hersand surely was too highpitched to be his there were other people in the room more shouting and banging the heavy thud of bone against flesh and bodies swaying and lashing weight hitting the floor finally heavy breathing and no more movement she was halfblinded and all she could feel was her own pain someone reached for her and she clenched trying to think how to strike back she would have only one chance but the hands were gentle lifting her up a cold wet cloth touched the throbbing wound in her cheek and jaw she opened her eyes and saw a mans face someone she knew but she could not think from where nothing is broken he said with a rueful smile i am sorry we should have been here sooner why could she not remember him he put the wet cloth to her face again there was blood on it who are you she wanted to shake her head but with the slightest movement pain shot through her like a knife blade my name is sabas he replied but i expect you have never heard it sabas it meant nothing zoe chrysaphes was afraid for you he said she knew that georgios vatatzes had a violent temper and overbearing family pride her breath caught in her throat all but choking her had sabas shrugged i am afraid he attacked us also and in order to subdue him it was necessary he left the sentence unfinished she sat up a little farther and looked past him georgios lay on the floor blood on his face and his head at an angle that made it clear his neck was broken another man stood by him dont worry sabas said hastily well take him away perhaps you should say a burglar attacked you if anyone asks you frightened him off she laughed abruptly close to hysteria well if they look at me and reckon i made an even worse mess of him no one will try to rob me again sabas smiled softening the hard lines of his face bought at a high price but a good thing he helped her to stand guiding her to a chair can your own servants assist you or would you like us to send for another physician they can assist me thank you she replied would you be kind enough to thank zoe chrysaphes for her concern and your courage if ever you need any help it is yours or your friends he bowed and then the two of them picked up georgios and carried him out leaving simonis to come in her face blanched with shock while she did what she could to clean annas cuts and apply ointment to the bruises annas mind raced she should have known georgios vatatzes would take his sisters rejection badly or was it more complex than that bessarions murder again old fear old vengeance and how had zoes servants known what to expect and from whom the answer to that was only too obvious once anna faced the facts zoe had poisoned maria knowing it would ruin the family and intending it to she had sent sabas and his fellow servant not so much to rescue anna as to make certain that georgios was killed but what had they done to earn zoes hatred to such a depth thirtysix when anastasius was shown into zoes magnificent room the physician was clearly angry but quietly so his eyes hard as stones on the shore he looked appalling his face was swollen and dark with bruises and he limped he dropped herbs on the table as if she had ordered them but presumably they were to explain to the servants why he was here what are they zoe inquired with interest as if she had no concern at his appearance no sudden welling up of fear that he was really hurt the antidote to the poison you used on maria vatatzes anastasius replied icily i brought it so that you know i have it and other antidotes and that arsenios knows i have it zoe raised her eyebrows it seems to have taken you rather a long time to find it i assume you learned nothing about bessarions death from georgios before he attacked you unfortunately you will learn nothing now temper flared in anastasiuss eyes it wont take so long if it happens again he retorted entirely ignoring the question about georgios and bessarions death because i shall know where to look of course should you be the victim that would be different you might find it yourself first if you are well enough to get out of bed zoe was stunned was he threatening her how ungrateful of you anastasius after i had the forethought to send sabas to your rescue she regarded him up and down carefully you look awful not that i doubted sabas he never lies anastasiuss face tightened he told the truth had he not come i would be dead were i not grateful for that i would have made it public that you had poisoned maria i know that from the flower seller and she will say nothing but if harm comes to her then i will speak you cant poison everyone but in case you have a mind to arsenios is perfectly aware that it was you who destroyed his daughter and who caused his son to be killed in disgrace i have no idea why you hate him but he knows and has taken steps to protect himself youre threatening me zoe said in amazement perversely she was pleased that amuses you anastasius said disgust twisting his mouth it shouldnt people are at their most dangerous when they have nothing left to lose if you hate arsenios you should have left him something worth surviving to save that was a mistake he turned and walked out still limping but with dignity of course the question of allowing arsenios to continue spreading the rumors was settled zoe could not she must deal with him but the question was how again poison was the obvious weapon it was her supreme skill of course arsenios would never take food or drink from her even in a public place she would have to find another way to administer it another hundred candles to the virgin she selected the poison carefully something to which there was no antidote it had no color and no odor and it acted rapidly enough that arsenios would have no chance to call for help or to attack her before he was incapacitated it was ideal this would look like a hemorrhage no one would ever trace it back to her either from its nature or because she was known to have purchased it she had possessed it for years and had never needed it until now a further hundred candles to light the priest smiled at her knowing her now zoe arrived at arsenioss home carrying her own most precious and beautiful icon the dark blue sloeeyed figure in the frame inset with smoky citrine and river pearls she wrapped it in silk first then over that oiled silk to protect it from the weather should it suddenly rain the sky was overcast and there was a light wind from the west but she did not feel the chill in it even now at dusk he had agreed to see her only because she was bringing the icon he sensed she was afraid at a disadvantage and his lust for revenge mounted higher it was what she counted on but it was a dangerous game sabas was barred from entering and told to wait outside she was shown into arsenioss presence that was what she had expected she trusted sabas but she did not want him to see her kill arsenios that might strain his loyalty he was a good man but his willing blindness would go only so far arsenios dismissed the servants telling them the matter was private he smiled as the door closed leaving them alone in the room with its walls inlaid with porphyry and its tessellated floor it seemed he had no more desire to have servants present than she did her pulse quickened the icon he asked looking at it as she laid it on the table gorgeous i trust she allowed herself to flinch confirming what he already believed he must not think she was in control acting from my own collection she replied huskily then she lowered her eyes but you know the real from the false it was time to let him know that she understood his anger and that it was justified she should seem afraid to anger him further why do you bring it to me zoe chrysaphes what are you looking for in return you never trade except for advantage trade she allowed the tension in her to show in the trembling hand the uncertain words yes of course i want something but not money he did not answer her but pulled on a pair of fine soft leather gloves so light in weight that he could move his fingers easily in them and then carefully he unwrapped the icon from its silks she watched listened to the sudden intake of his breath with admiration as the last wrapping fell away and he saw the glowing beauty of the virgins face and felt the weight of gold in the frame she saw the lust for it in his eyes and the delicate movement of his finger as it traced the lines of the frame and moved it so the light caught the gems she stood motionless watching he turned and looked at her studying her face the rigidity of her body the power of emotion in her savoring it this was what he wantedher fear she started to speak and then stopped he smiled slowly and turned back to the icon its exquisite he said his voice filled with awe in spite of himself but it is rather similar to one i already have it did not matter she had no intention of giving it to him but she tried to appear crushed and even more than that afraid again she started to speak and stopped she looked at him imagining his cousin gregory perhaps the only man she had loved for himself years ago and made her eyes plead with him arsenios fingered the front of the icon picked it up and examined the back his heavylidded eyes flicking up at her and down at the frame he saw the small tack she had left projecting and his smile widened deliberately she shuddered she would have gone pale were it within her power careless he whispered not up to your usual standard zoe his voice was a hiss anger flaring in his eyes im ssorry she stammered reaching into the folds of her tunic for the dagger in its jeweled sheath crystals blazing in the light she pulled it forward enough for him to see it he saw it and lunged forward his fingers grasping her wrist like a vise she did not need to pretend in order to cry out in pain she was a tall woman his height but she was no match for him in strength he wrenched the sheath from her easily bruising the slender bones of her wrist and bending the arm back until it was twisted bringing tears to her eyes he was close to her she could smell the sweat of anger on him and see the pores of his skin just a little scratch he said between his teeth an accident with a careless tack and i would have been dead why zoe because gregory would not marry you you fool eirene was a doukas do you imagine he would have given that up for you why bother you lay with him whenever he wanted anyway one doesnt marry a whore she did not have to pretend anger or pain she let it blaze up in her eyes and tried to snatch back the dagger but deliberately aiming to the left as if misjudging he laughed a harsh ugly sound and grasped the handle to yank it free it did not come and he pulled harder you tried to stab me he said jubilantly thats what you came for to murder me we struggled and tragically in spite of all i could do you slipped and the knife turned on youfatally his lips drew back from his teeth in triumph he pulled again on the knife hilt his other hand on the sheath to free it and felt the tiny needle in his flesh it was seconds before he knew what it was then as the pain flooded through him his eyes widened and he stared at her in sudden terrible understanding she stood straight now shoulders back head high but far enough away from him that even if he fell forward he could not reach her she smiled a slow sweet taste of victory it was nothing to do with gregory she told him as he fell forward onto his knees his face purple his hands clutching at his stomach i had all i wanted from him that was almost true it was your fathers theft of the icons when the city was burning you took our family relics and you kept them you betrayed byzantium and for that you must pay with your life she stepped backward as he crawled a few inches toward her his throat was closing and his eyes bulged in his head saliva dribbled from his mouth and there was a terrible hacking rasping sound in his chest then he vomited blood in a scarlet tide he screamed and almost instantly choked as more blood spewed out his eyes rolled in terror and he gagged and choked swallowing drowning she watched a few moments longer until his face turned purple and he lay still she walked around him and picked up her icon and the knife rewrapping both carefully in the silk she walked to the door and opened it silently there was no one in the hall or the room beyond she moved soundlessly over the marble and out the great carved front door sabas was watching for her and appeared out of the shade servants would find arsenios and suppose he had died of a hemorrhage perhaps too much wine had ulcerated his stomach that night she celebrated with the best wine in her cellar but she awoke sometime in the dark shivering and nauseated her body running with sweat she had been dreaming seeing arsenioss body on the floor again vomiting rivers of blood and the icons on the wall above him their calmeyed faces watching his horror she lay rigid in the bed what if his servants knew it was poison was anyone clever enough to find traces of it surely not she had been careful he had died dreadfullyquickly but in agony and horror when daylight came it was not so bad she could see the realities of her house her servants moving around sabas came in and at first she dared not meet his eyes then she could not look away from him what did he know to explain herself to a servant would embarrass them bothand yet she wanted to desperately she wanted not to be alone that night the dreams were worse arsenios took longer to die there was more blood she saw his bulging eyes always looking at her staring stripping her clothes off literally until she stood in front of him naked vulnerable her breasts hanging her stomach bulging repulsive he crawled on the floor after her refusing to be paralyzed refusing to choke to die he grasped her ankle with his claw of a hand pain shooting through her again as it had when he had taken her wrist he had been going to kill her he had said so she had had no choice she was justified it was selfdefense to which everyone is entitled there was no justice in this she woke with her body covered in sweat her clothes sticking to her icecold the minute she threw off the cover and slid out she knelt on the marble floor shuddering her hands folded in prayer knuckles shining white in the candlelight blessed virgin holy mother of god she whispered hoarsely if i have sinned forgive me i did it only to prevent him from keeping the icons which belong to the people forgive me please wash me of my sins she crept back to bed still shaking with cold but she dared not sleep the following night she did the same but spending longer on her knees recounting to the blessed virgin the icons arsenios had taken and his impiety in keeping them all these yearsand that was apart from the less precious less beautiful ones he had sold anyone could guess as to whomthe buyer with the most money as if that mattered on the fourth day she heard the news she had prayed for arsenios vatatzes had been buried they said he had died of a hemorrhage to the stomach shortly after zoe had visited him his servants had found him she listened carefully but there was no whisper of blame she had got away with it the conclusion was obvious heaven was with her she was an instrument in the hands of god the rest was just bad dreams nothing more they should be forgotten like any other nonsense tomorrow she would go out and offer her thanks with gifts to the virgin mary in the hagia sophia knowing that she had divine approval candles were not enough but she would offer them anyway hundreds of them enough to light the whole dome and also perhaps one of her lesser icons thirtyseven giuliano dandolo enjoyed being back in constantinople the vitality of the city excited him the tolerance and width of vision was like the wind off a great ocean it called to him more and more powerfully each time he saw it now he was here at contarinis orders to observe for himself rather than by rumor whether byzantium was finally keeping the rules of the union with rome or as before paying them lip service while going its own way what he had seen so far should have pleased him for the prospects of a new crusade passing this way and storming the city and the profit that that would mean for venice but giuliano could not rejoice in it he learned of the strength of the resistance with a sense of foreboding not only had the leaders of opposition to the union been blinded mutilated or banished many had fled to separatist byzantine states the prisons were crowded and most embarrassing to michael many of his immediate relatives were actively engaged in plotting against him it seemed he was attacked at the front and beset on all sides the blachernae palace was beautiful even if it was poor compared with the glories of venice there were still the marks of fire and pillage all through it and it had none of the sheer grace of pale marble and the endless reflections of light that he was used to but when giuliano was facetoface with michael he saw a man of remarkable composure there was a weariness in the emperors face but nothing of fear he received giuliano with courtesy and even a shadow of wit against his will giuliano felt both a pity and an admiration for him whatever michael lacked it was not courage and of course there is the east a eunuch told giuliano as he was conducted away after his audience was over the eunuchs name was nicephoras giuliano dragged his mind back to the issues as they walked side by side along a vaulted corridor paved with mosaics everything is changing all the time nicephoras added choosing his words carefully it appears at the moment as if the greatest threat to us is from the west the next crusade but in truth i think we have as much if not more to fear from the east it is simply that the west will be first if we do not find some accommodation with rome however much we hate it but there is no accommodation to be found with the east he looked at giuliano there is much balancing to be done and it is hard to know which way to turn first giuliano wanted to say something intelligent and sympathetic without betraying venice or sounding patronizing but nothing whatever came to him i begin to feel as if venetian politics are relatively simple he said quietly this is like taking out a boat that is leaking in ten different places a good analogy nicephoras agreed with appreciation but we are good at it we have had much practice giuliano was still on the steps leaving the palace when he came to the bottom at the same time as another eunuch apparently also leaving this person was considerably smaller several inches shorter than giuliano himself and more delicate of appearance when he turned there was a flash of recognition in his dark gray eyes and giuliano remembered him from the hagia sophia this was the same man who had seen him clean enrico dandolos tomb and whose face had shown such grief and such compassion good morning giuliano said quickly then wondered if perhaps he had been precipitate in speaking to him that it would be taken as overfamiliarity giuliano dandolo ambassador from the doge of venice he introduced himself the eunuch smiled his face was effeminate but certainly not without character and again the burning intelligence giuliano thought he had seen in the hagia sophia anastasius zarides the eunuch said sometime physician to emperor michael palaeologus giuliano was surprised he had not placed the man as a physician but it only reminded him how alien byzantium was he hastened to say something else i live in the venetian quarter he made a gesture roughly in the direction of the shore but i am beginning to think perhaps that restricts me from knowing the city better he stopped gazing across the rooftops the golden horn was spread below them shining in the morning sun dotted with boats from every corner of the mediterranean the air was warm and giuliano could imagine he smelled the odors of salt and spice drifting up from the harbor front anastasius followed his gaze if i could choose i would live where i could see the sun rise over the bosphorus and that requires some height such places are expensive he laughed with gentle selfmockery i would have to save the life of the richest man in byzantium in order to afford that and fortunately for him if less so for me he is in excellent health giuliano regarded him with amusement and if he were ill would he send for you he asked anastasius shrugged not yet but by the time he is ill maybe he was joking lightly in the meantime healing merely the emperor where do you live giuliano kept up the easy tone anastasius pointed down the hill over there beyond those trees i still have a good view although only to the north but there is an excellent place my favorite in the city a hundred yards away up on that hill where you can see in almost a full circle and it is quiet very few other people seem to go there perhaps i am the only one with time to stand and stare giuliano had a sudden thought that perhaps what he really meant was to stand and dream but selfconsciousness had prevented him from saying so were you born here he asked quickly anastasius looked surprised no my parents were part of the exile i was born in thessalonica and i grew up in nicea but this is our ancestral home the heart of our culture and i suppose of our faith as well giuliano felt stupid of course he was born somewhere else he had forgotten that almost everyone he spoke to in this city would have been born during the exile and was therefore from somewhere else even his own mother had been my mother was born in nicea he said aloud then instantly wondered why he looked away keeping his face in profile to anastasius as if sensing something of a retreat anastasius changed the subject they say that some of venice is like constantinople is that true some of it yes he replied especially where there are mosaics one in particular i like in a church very similar to one here suddenly he remembered how many byzantine works of art had been stolen in the ruin in and felt his face grow hot with embarrassment and the money exchanges of course and the he stopped the silk trade had once been purely byzantine now the art the weaving and even the colors were venetian weve learned much from you he said a little awkwardly anastasius smiled and gave a slight shrug perhaps i shouldnt have asked i opened the door to an honest answer he was startled it was a response with more grace than he had expected or perhaps deserved he smiled back we are learning but there is a vitality here a complexity of thought we may never acquire anastasius inclined his head in acknowledgment then excused himself with ease as if they might meet again with the same interest giuliano walked down the steep street lightly anastasius had been born during the exile and judging from his age his parents must have been also it had been over seventy years now that meant of course that giulianos own mother had been a child of the exile even if her heritage was pure byzantine and so shortly after the pillage of the city her hatred for venice must have been very strong how on earth had she come to marry a venetian more than before now that he had stood in the wind and the sun and spoken so candidly with another lost different child of the exile born away from a spiritual home he was compelled to find out more about the woman whose child he was he began to inquire diligently and the answers led him to many interesting people and eventually to a woman well into her seventies who had actually fled the invading armies after the fall of the city she must have been amazingly beautiful in her youth and in her middle years even now she had a depth of passion a flair and individuality that fascinated him her name was zoe chrysaphes she seemed to be willing to talk about the city its history its legends and its people the room where she received giuliano overlooked a vast panorama of the roofs of lesser houses standing beside him at the window she told him of the traders who came from alexandria and a great river of egypt that wound like a snake into unknown heart of africa and from the holy land she went on extending her arm jeweled fingers pointing below down near the seas edge persians and saracens and remnants of the crusader armies of the past ancient kings of jerusalem and arabs from the desert have you been there to the holy land giuliano asked impulsively she was amused her golden eyes flashed at some memory she would not share i have never been far from byzantium it is my heart and mind the roots from which i live in the exile my family went first to nicea then east to trebizund and georgia and the shores of the black sea once for a while farther still to samarkand always i looked to come home again he was stabbed with the old guilt of being venetian and his peoples part in carrying the crusader army here it seemed foolish to ask why zoe had hungered to come home even though she could hardly know it after so many years and none of her family were left he must instead ask her the questions that mattered he might not have the opportunity again and the hunger ate inside him with a growing need you know all the old families he said a little abruptly did you know of theodoulos agallon she stood quite still ive heard of him he has been dead many years now she smiled if you want to know more im sure it can be learned he turned away so she would not read the vulnerability in his eyes my mothers name was agallon i should be interested to know if there was a connection really she sounded interested not inquisitive what was her christian name maddalena even saying it was painful as if it revealed something private that could not be recovered again he swallowed his throat tight his mother was probably dead and if she wasnt the last thing he wanted was to meet her giuliano turned to look at zoe searching for a way to change his mind she was staring at him her brilliant tawnycolored eyes almost at a level with his i will inquire she promised discreetly of course an old story something i heard and cant remember where she smiled it may take me a little while but it would be interesting we are linked in love and hate your city and mine for a moment her expression was unreadable as if she contained inside her some other creature unknowable driven by pain then it was gone again and she was smiling at him still beautiful still full of laughter and a craving for the taste the smell and the texture of life come back in a month and see what i have discovered thirtyeight zoe stood alone after the venetian had gone she had liked giuliano he was handsome and he cared intensely she knew that as vividly as she would feel a touch she had to hate him he was a dandolo this could be the best of all the vengeances she hungered for she must remind herself of all that was worst most rending of the heart and soul deliberately as if taking a knife to her flesh she lived it again in her mind to remind herself at the end of the besieging crusaders had sent an insolent message to then emperor alexios iii it was at the instigation of enrico dandolo it was a threat and the ringleader of a plot against the emperor his soninlaw had incited a riot in the hagia sophia they tore down the great statue of athena that had once graced the acropolis of athens in its golden age there was more rioting in the city attempts in the harbor to set fire to the venetian fleet the besiegers must fight or die dandolo for the venetians and boniface of montferrat and baldwin of flanders and other french knights agreed on the division of spoils when the city was sacked in march the westerners decided to conquer not only constantinople but the entire byzantine empire by midapril the city was burning and pillage robbery and slaughter raged through the streets houses churches and monasteries were robbed of their treasures chalices for the taking of the sacrament were used to swill the wine of drunkards icons were used as gaming boards jewels were gouged out and gold and silver melted down the monuments of antiquity that had been revered down the centuries were looted and broken imperial tombs even that of constantine the great were stripped and the corpse of justinian the lawgiver desecrated nuns were raped in the hagia sophia itself soldiers smashed the altar and stripped the sanctuary of its silver and gold horses and mules were brought in to be loaded with the spoil and their hooves slid in the blood on the marble floors a prostitute danced on the throne of the patriarch and sang obscene songs the treasure stolen was said to be worth four hundred thousand silver marks four times as much as the cost of the entire fleet the doge of venice enrico dandolo personally took fifty thousand marks that was not all the four great gilded bronze horses had been stolen and now adorned the cathedral of st mark in venice enrico dandolo had chosen the bronze horses he also took the vial containing drops of the blood of christ the icon encased in gold that constantine the great had carried with him into battle a part of the head of john the baptist and a nail from the cross last and perhaps worst there was the shroud of christ the loss of all these was far more than sacrilege of holy things it was an alteration of the character of the whole city as if its heart had been ripped out pilgrims travelers the lifeblood of exchange commerce the trade of the world now no longer came here they went to venice or rome constantinople grieved in poverty like a beggar at the gates of europe zoe stood with her hands clenched till her bones ached and there was blood on her palms if giuliano died a thousand times over it would not be enough to pay for that there would never be mercy only blood and more blood thirtynine for zoe chrysaphes to inquire was excellent but it was not all that giuliano could do he also looked in the other quarters of the city for people who knew which families had gone where during the long exile it had to be done in the time he did not need for his duties to venice toward the end of the month zoe had set for his return giuliano visited the hill from which anastasius had said he could see in every direction it was not difficult to find the exact place and the view was as spectacular as described it was also sheltered from the west wind and there was a balm in the air vines below him were in flower and sent up a perfume delicate and sweet it was some time before he realized it was the softness of the waning light on the sea that reminded him of home he looked up narrowing his eyes and the small rippled clouds like the scales of a fish were the same also and mares tails shredding in gossamer to the northeast fanning the suns rays into a skeletal hand the following evening he returned and this time anastasius was there the physician turned and smiled but did not speak for several minutes as if the sea spread before them were eloquent enough it is a perfect place giuliano said at last but perhaps it would be wrong for any one person to possess it anastasius smiled i hadnt thought of that you are right it should be here for everyone who can see and no oaf who cant then he shook his head thats too harsh i have been dealing with fools all day and i am shorttempered im sorry giuliano was oddly pleased to find him fallible he had been a trifle daunting before although he realized it only now he found himself smiling did you know a family named agallon in nicea he asked the question before considering it anastasius thought for a moment i remember my father mentioning a name like that he treated many people he was a physician also he asked anastasius looked out across the water yes he taught me most of what i know he had stopped but giuliano sensed that there was more an intimate memory that was so sweet it was painful to bring it back now when the reality was gone did you learn willingly he asked instead oh yes suddenly anastasiuss face came alive eyes bright lips parted i loved it from as far back as i can remember he had no interest in me when i was born but as soon as i could speak he taught me all kinds of things i remember helping him in the garden he went on at least i imagined i was helping i expect i was far more of a nuisance but he never told me so we used to tend the herbs together and i learned them all what they looked like smelled like which part to use root or leaf or flower how to harvest them and keep them safe and from spoiling giuliano envisioned it the small boy and his father teaching him telling him over and over never losing patience my father taught me too he said quickly memory sharp all the islands of venice and the waterways the harbor where the shipyards were he took me to see the builders how they laid the great keels and attached the ribs then the timbers and the caulking how they seated the masts it was the same thing a man teaching his child the things he loved the skills he lived by he remembered it so clearly always his father never his mother he knew every port from genova to alexandria he went on and what was good and bad about each did he take you anastasius asked did you see all those places some of them he remembered the close quarters of the boats feeling seasick and shut in then the strangeness and the excitement of alexandria the heat and the arab faces and language he did not understand it was terrifying and wonderful he said ruefully i think i was petrified with fear more than half the time but i would rather have died than said so where did your father take you nowhere much to begin with anastasius replied mostly to see old people with congested chests and bad hearts i remember the first dead one though giulianos eyes opened wide dead one how old were you about eight cant be squeamish about death if youre going to be a physician my father was gentle very kind but on that visit he made me look at what had killed this patient he stopped and what was it giuliano tried to picture a child with anastasiuss solemn gray eyes and delicate bones that tender mouth anastasius smiled the man was chasing a dog that had stolen his dinner and he tripped and fell over it broke his neck youre making it up giuliano accused im not it was the beginning of a lesson in anatomy father showed me all the muscles of the back and the bones of the spine giuliano was startled are you allowed to do that it was a human body no anastasius grinned but i never forgot i was terrified hed be caught i drew a picture of everything so id never have to do it again there was a sudden sadness in his voice were you the only child giuliano asked aloud anastasius looked momentarily taken aback no i had a brother have a brother he is still alive i believe he looked disconcerted annoyed with himself as if he had not meant to say that he looked away i have not heard from him for some time giuliano had no wish to pry your father must be proud of your skills if you treat the emperor he meant it as a simple observation not flattery anastasius relaxed he would be he took a deep breath and let it out slowly he did not speak for a while then he turned his back to the sea is agallon part of your family is that why you look for them yes giuliano had no thought to lie my mother was byzantine he could see instantly from anastasiuss face that he understood the conflict i have made some inquiries there are people who may be able to tell me more sensing his reluctance anastasius said nothing more of it but started to point out some of the landmarks on the dark outline of the opposite shore beyond which lay nicea giuliano continued in his quest for hard facts that pointed to the likelihood of a crusade by sea stopping here for provisions and support rather than going by land a choice that still allowed for the possibility of passing the city before crossing to asia and south if only michael could persuade his people to yield to rome no crusader would dare attack the sovereign realm of a catholic emperor no crusader or pilgrim would gain absolution for that whatever shrines he visited afterward but as giuliano watched weighed and judged he still felt like a man assessing the chances and profits of war and he was ill at ease with himself for doing it toward the end of the month he received a message from zoe chrysaphes saying that she had managed to learn some facts about maddalena agallon she was not certain that he would wish to hear them but if he did she would be pleased to receive him in two days time of course he went whatever the news was he was compelled to hear it when he arrived at zoes house and was admitted by her servants he was struggling to keep a veneer of composure she pretended to notice nothing have you seen more of the city she asked conversationally leading him again toward the magnificent windows it was early evening and the light was soft blurring the harsher lines i have he answered i have taken time to visit many of the places you spoke of i have seen some views lovely enough to hold me spellbound but nothing as good as this you flatter me she said not youyour city he corrected with a smile but his tone allowed that the distinction was minimal she turned to look at him it is cruel to stretch out the response she gave a slight shrug some people find spiders beautiful i dont the silken thread which traps flies is clever but distasteful he felt his pulse beating so hard he was surprised she did not see it in his temples or perhaps she did are you certain you wish to hear she asked quietly you do not have to i can forget it and tell no one if you prefer his mouth was dry i want to hear in that instant he was not sure if he meant it but he would be a coward to retreat now the agallons were an excellent family with two daughters she began maddalena your mother eloped with a venetian sea captain giovanni dandolo your father it seemed at the time that they were very much in love but after less than a year in fact only a matter of months your mother left him and returned to nicea where she married a byzantine of considerable wealth he should not have been surprised it was what he had expected still to hear it in words so clear in this exquisite room was the end of all denial all escape into hope im sorry zoe said quietly the muted light from the window removed all lines from her face and she looked as she must have in her youth but when maddalenas new husband discovered that she was already with child he threw her out he would not raise another mans son and a venetians at that he had lost his parents and a brother in the sacking of the city her voice cracked but she faltered for only a moment she did not want the responsibility and the burden of a child so she gave you away news of it must have reached your father and he came and found you and took you with him back to venice i wish i could have told you something less cruel but you would have learned this sooner or later if you had persisted in searching now you can bury it and not think of it again but that was impossible he was barely aware of thanking her or of struggling through the rest of the evening he did not know what time it was when he finally excused himself and fumbled his way out into the night forty three months later giuliano arrived back in venice to report to the doge even more important for him was the need to recapture the old sense of belonging this was the home where he had been happy yet he felt a part of him had already left venice for the last time that afternoon the doge sent for him and he reported to the palace it still felt faintly alien to find contarini there and not tiepolo that was foolish doges died like kings or popes and were succeeded by the new but giuliano had cared for tiepolo and he missed him tell me the truth of the union contarini asked after the formalities had been conducted and all but his secretary had left as giuliano told him the real depth of the dissension that faced michael palaeologus contarini nodded then a crusade is inevitable the doge looked relieved no doubt he was thinking of the wood already negotiated and in part paid for i think so giuliano agreed is constantinople rebuilding its sea defenses contarini pressed yes but slowly giuliano replied if the new crusade comes through in the next two or three years they will not be ready will it be two or three years contarini demanded our bankers here need to know we cannot commit money timber shipyards or a hope which may be years away at the beginning of the century we stopped all other business and threw everything into building for the fourth crusade and if your greatgrandfather had not finally lost his patience with the devious byzantines and their endless arguments and excuses then the losses to venice would have ruined us i know giuliano said quietly the figures were clear enough but the fires and the sacrilege still shamed him he looked up to see contarini watching him were his thoughts so clear in his face what if michael wins his people over giuliano asked contarini thought for several moments the new pope is less predictable than gregory was he said ruefully he may choose not to believe it the latins will see what they want to see giuliano knew that was true he despised himself for what he was doing although he had left himself no choice contarini was still guarded his eyelids heavy concealing our shipwrights must work trade must continue whose ships they are is a matter of judgment careful planning and foreknowledge giuliano knew exactly what he was going to say next he waited respectfully if constantinople is still vulnerable contarini went on then charles of anjou will hasten his plans so he can strike while it remains so the longer he waits the harder his battle will be he paced across the checkered marble floor this month he is in sicily go there dandolo watch listen and observe the pope has said the crusade will take place in or we cannot be ready before that but you say constantinople is rebuilding and michael is clever which man will outwit the other the frenchman or the byzantine charles has all of europe on his side bent on regaining the holy land for christendom not to mention an overweening ambition but michael is fighting for survival he might not care whether we win jerusalem or not if it is at the expense of his people what can i learn in sicily of his plans giuliano asked reasonably many a mans weaknesses lie at home where he does not expect them the king of the two sicilies is arrogant come back to me in three months you will be provided with all you need of money and letters of authority giuliano made no demur saying nothing of the fact that he had only just arrived back that he had had no rest and barely time to speak to his friends he was more than willing to go because venice had not healed the ache inside him as he had believed it would fortyone giulianos ship docked in the sicilian port of palermo two weeks later he stood on the harbor wall in the harsh eyesearing sun and stared around him the glittering light off the water was blue to the horizon the town rose on gentle hills the buildings pale soft colors like the bleached earth with occasional splashes of colored vines or bright clothes strung across the street from window to window in the hot air in time he would present himself at the court of charles of anjou but first he wanted to arm himself with some knowledge of the town and its people he should never forget that he was in what was essentially an occupied city french on the surface sicilian at heart for that he needed to be among the people he set out to look for lodgings hoping to find a family of ordinary local people who would take him in so he would have an opportunity to share at least some part of their lives and their less guarded opinions the first two had no extra room the third one welcomed him the house looked like any other from the outside simple badly weathered fishing nets and lobster pots set nearby to dry on the inside the poverty was more apparent the floor of earthen tile was worn uneven by passing feet the wooden furniture was well used and the dishes of beautiful heavy ceramic in tones of blue were occasionally chipped they offered him a room and food at a price he thought was too little and he was uncertain whether to offer more or if it would make his comparative wealth ungraciously obvious he ate supper with them giuseppe maria and six children of ages from four to twelve it was noisy and happy the food appeared plentiful although simple mostly vegetables from their own rich earth but he noticed that every scrap was eaten and no one asked for more as if they already knew that there was none the oldest boy francisco looked at giuliano with interest are you a sailor he asked politely yes giuliano did not wish to be obviously venetian but any lie or evasion would betray him in a way he could not afford have you been to lots of places francisco went on his face eager giuliano smiled from genoa right around to venice and to constantinople and all the ports on the way there and twice as far as acre but i didnt go overland to jerusalem once i went to alexandria in egypt franciscos eyes were wide and giuliano noticed that no one else around the table was paying any attention to food anymore are you here to see the king one of the girls asked he wouldnt be staying with us if he were here to see the king stupid one of the other boys told her why would anyone want to see that fat bastard giuseppe asked with a savage edge to his voice hush maria warned him her eyes wide conspicuously not looking at giuliano you mustnt say that and anyway its not true they say charles is not fat at all and his father died before he was born but hes legitimate its not the same thing as being a bastard giuliano knew she was not criticizing her husband she was trying to protect him from indiscretion in front of a stranger but giuseppe was not so easily silenced forgive us he said we take our taxes hard charles doesnt tax his own frenchmen as heavily as he does us giuseppe could not keep the edge of bitterness out of his voice that betrayed the hatred close under the surface giuliano had heard it already even in the few hours he had been here i know he agreed it might be unwise to criticize him but i think it would make you an outcast to praise him and a liar giuseppe smiled and clapped him on the shoulder wise man he said cheerfully youre welcome in my house giuliano spent four weeks with giuseppe and his family listening to their conversations and those of the other fishermen and farmers in the local taverns he heard the undertones of anger and also a sense of helplessness he mentioned byzantium once or twice and the responses he heard were so open in interest and sympathy on weighing them afterward he thought they were innocent of intent but the anger was there it would not take a great deal to ignite it one act of stupidity that intruded into the fabric of their lives one desecration of a church one abuse of a woman or child and the flame would be lit if he could see that then if michael had spies here they would see it too the question was not if the will was present but if the coherence of effort could be organized well enough to succeed if the sicilians rose up and were crushed it would be a tragedy giuliano was not prepared to incite it would be the ultimate betrayal of hospitality to eat a mans bread in his own house and then sell him to the enemy was beyond pardon guiliano presented himself at the court of charles of anjou or as he was known here in palermo the king of the two sicilies giuliano was not surprised by the lavish beauty of the palace but beneath it all was the comparative austerity of the court the exorbitant taxes charles drained from the land were for war not pleasure men dressed simply and the king himself counted only on the power of his presence to command respect he was as burning with energy as usual and welcomed giuliano with an instant recollection of exactly who he was ah returned again dandolo he said enthusiastically come to see how our preparations for the crusade are progressing yes sire giuliano answered investing his expression with far more eagerness than he felt well my friend charles slapped him on the back all goes very well all europe is stirring to the call we are about to unite christendom can you see it dandolo one army under god there was only one possible answer i can see it in my mind he replied i look for the day when it is more than a vision an army in the flesh more than the flesh charles corrected him looking at him sideways with sudden acute perception we need it in the steel and the wood the wine the salt and the bread we need it in the will and the courage and in the gold do we not we need all those things giuliano agreed but we need them supplied willingly and not at a price we cannot pay the cause is to win back the holy land for christendom not to enrich every merchant and shipbuilder in europeexcept justly of course charles roared with laughter ever the careful diplomat eh what you mean is that venice will not promise anything until they see which way everyone else jumps dont be too cautious or youll invest too late anyone can tell you are traders not soldiers it was said with a smile but it was an insult nevertheless i am a sailor sire he replied i am for god adventure and profit no man who will face the sea deserves to be called a coward charles spread his arms wide you are right dandolo i take it back and any man who trusts the sea is a fool you are more interesting than i thought come and dine with me come he held out his hand then turned and led the way certain that giuliano would follow every time charles invited him to join in a game of chance giuliano accepted apart from the fact that one did not easily refuse a king even if one was not his subject he needed to be in charless company to make any judgment as to his immediate intentions everyone knew what they were eventually he had made no secret of it but the timing was of intense importance to venice when they played at dice or cards charles was highly competitive but giuliano learned easily that although he did not like to be beaten he resented even more bitterly being condescended to giuliano needed all his wits to play well and still lose once or twice he failed and won he waited with muscles clenched ready to defend himself but after a moments prickling silence charles swore briefly and with considerable inventiveness then demanded a further game at which giuliano made absolutely certain he lost the word byzantium awoke a fire in charless eyes as if some legendary treasure had been named giuliano saw his hands tighten and the muscles in his thick wrists knot as if to grasp something precious yet infinitely elusive it was at sea a few days after that that charless more contemplative nature asserted itself he was less sure of his own skills on the water and took some care not to attempt anything where it was possible he might fail giuliano twice saw him move to begin and then change his mind it was more revealing than he could have known he was still the younger brother unwanted afraid of failure not confident enough to shrug it away he needed to be seen to succeed every time yet he had no hesitation in allowing the helmsman to take the boat through heavier seas close in past jagged rocks of a promontory with the surge roaring past it it was failure charles feared not death giuliano felt a sudden understanding for him born after his fathers death and unloved by his mother his oldest brother had been king of france and perceived by many as a saint what was there left for a man of hunger and passion to do except demand attention by achieving the impossible they passed the point and were out into calmer deep water with the mainland falling away to the west and the islands of alicudi and filicudi far to the north salina panara and beyond that the smoking crown of stromboli staining the horizon charles swiveled round ignoring the current now his face toward the east that way lies byzantium he said jubilantly well be there dandolo like your greatgrandfather i shall leap from my ship to the sand and lead the assault we too shall storm the walls again and break them down he lifted both his arms balancing in the rocking boat his hands locked into fists i shall be crowned in the hagia sophia myself then he turned and smiled at giuliano ready at last to talk details about money and ships numbers of men to be transported with all their armor horses engines of war and other necessary equipment fortytwo in the early evening anna stood in the place high on the hill overlooking the sea where she had stood with giuliano dandolo and spoken of the glory of the city spread below them it was still as beautiful but it was the shore of asia beyond that she stared at now above it the sun was making shining towers of the slow clouds sailing like ships around the edges of heaven the silence was heavy in the air lately she had been so busy with patients that she had had little opportunity to come here and the solitude was welcome yet she would have liked to be able to speak to giuliano or even simply meet his eyes and know that he saw the same beauty in it that she did words would be unnecessary but even as the thoughts came to her she was conscious of her own foolishness she could not afford to think of him in such a way his friendship was something to savor then to let go not to cling to as if it could be permanent she could stand here and watch the light fade over the water only for a little longer see the shadows turn gold and then darken and color fill the hollows in purple and amber blurring the outlines splashing the windows with fire she had not accomplished much in clearing justinians name he was still in a desert monastery imprisoned and useless fretting away the hours let alone the days and the years while she gathered shreds too small to weave into anything she was not even certain that bessarions death was a result of his religious fervor it could have been personal he had clearly been abrasive difficult to be at ease with and helena had been bored with him that she could understand too easily she had thought that bessarion himself must be the key to his own death it had not been difficult to ask about him the city was still full of memories and as the stories of torture and imprisonment mounted his stature as a hero grew but anna had found that the humanity of the man eluded her he had shared the fire of his belief with everyone but never the hunger of his dreams then why had he been murdered it was like looking at a mosaic picture with the center missing it could have been any of a score of things without it she was floundering wasting more precious time again and again she came back to the church and its danger of being consumed by rome had justinian loved it with the passion that would drive him to spend time energy and loyalty with people he did not like in order to preserve its identity from corruption she shivered in the dying sun even though the whisper of a breeze rising held no chill at all she needed to meet others like esaias glabas who had been an unlikely friend of justinians and eirene and demetrios vatatzes eirene sometimes had poor health anna must exert all her efforts to become her physician zoe could aid her with that it took anna a number of weeks to contrive her first professional call on eirene she liked her immediately even distressed by illness as eirene was now her face was vivid with intelligence and yet startlingly ugly but anna realized that that was at least in part because of the strength in her the consultation was brief anna had the impression that it was largely for eirene to decide whether she wished to trust anna or not however on the second call eirene greeted anna with relief and without prevarication leading her into a more private room looking onto a small inner court there were no murals except one simple picture of vines but the proportions were so perfect that they seemed to form the walls rather than be added to them i am afraid the pain is worse eirene said frankly standing with her arms limp at her sides as if even in front of a physician she was embarrassed to mention something so personal anna was not surprised there had been an awkwardness in the way she moved and a stiffness that betrayed locked muscles and above all fear now that she was still she lifted her left arm and cradled it in her right hand and in the chest also anna asked her eirene smiled you are going to tell me that my heart is weak i shall acknowledge it and save your searching for comforting words there was a bitterness to her humor but no selfpity no anna replied eirenes eyebrows shot up sin id heard better of you than that zoe chrysaphes said you were no lover of obedient thoughts and the safety of mens beliefs i had not imagined her so sharp of vision anna replied or that she looked at me at all beyond my professional ability eirene smiled widely in her ugly face it was like a blaze of sunlight across a bleak landscape zoe looks at everyone especially those she judges can be of use to her dont take it as flattery it is merely that she weighs every tool to the fraction of an ounce before she considers using it now give me a candid answer what is wrong with me you looked at me thoroughly enough when you were here before anna was not ready to answer yet she knew that eirenes husband was still alive because his name had been mentioned in her first visit where is your husband she asked anger flared up eirenes face her eyes burning you will answer to me you impudent creature my body is my affair not my husbands anna was stung by surprise and then the instant after by how revealing eirenes answer had been what had her husband done to lacerate eirene so profoundly that the wound bled at a touch much of your illness comes from anxiety anna said lowering her voice trying to keep pity out of it i know from last time i was here that your son is in constantinople i wondered if your husband was traveling perhaps in dangerous regions although i am not sure how many are safe the sea never changes its shores or its rocks and whirlpools pirates come and go eirene blushed i apologize my husband is in alexandria i do not know whether he is safe or not i do not worry about it because it would be pointless she turned away and with an effort walked upright toward the archway into the court and the high bright flowers beyond so gregory was still in egypt even so many years after most other exiles had returned to constantinople from every other region anna followed eirene to the courtyard it too was sparsely beautiful cleanlined the fountain fell into a shaded pool the water catching the light only at its peak she spoke to eirene of the usual things a physician addresses food sleep the benefits of walking do you imagine i havent thought of all that eirene said disappointment dragging her voice down again i am sure you have anna replied have you done them they will not cure you but they will allow your body to begin curing itself you are as bad as my priest eirene remarked would you like me to say a dozen paternosters if you can do it without your mind wandering off to other things anna replied perfectly seriously i dont think i could eirene looked at her a beginning of interest in her eyes is that a rather abstruse way of saying that it is sin at the heart of this after all i do not need to be sheltered from the truth i am just as strong as zoe chrysaphes a flash of light almost like a moments laughter glanced in her eyes or did you wrap up the truth for her too like a childs medicine hidden in honey i would not dare anna replied unless of course i was sure i could do it well enough that she would never know this time eirene laughed outright a rich sound with layers of meaning at least some of them malicious how had zoe hurt her i have an herbal extract for you anna began what is it a sedative something to stop me feeling the pain there was contempt in eirenes face is that your solution to lifes griefs physician cover them up dont look at what will hurt you anna should have been insulted but she was not a sedative will relax your muscles so your body does not fight itself and send you into spasm relax so you can eat without gulping in air and giving yourself indigestion to cramp your stomach relax so your neck does not ache from bearing your head up and your head pound from the blood trying to pass through flesh that is knotted as if ease were your enemy i suppose you know what you are talking about eirene said with a shrug you can tell zoe that my household knows you came on her recommendation i shall hold her responsible for anything that happens to me come back tomorrow when she returned anna found eirene much the same if the pain was less it could be attributed to the nights rest partially induced by the sedative she was still tired and in considerably short temper afterward anna found eirenes son demetrios waiting for her he asked with some concern over his mothers condition she could easily understand why helena was attracted to him how is my mother he repeated urgently i believe anxiety and fear are eating inside her anna answered not meeting his eyes as she would have were her conscience at ease what has she to be afraid of demetrios was watching her closely but disguising it in a show of disdain we can fear all manner of things real and unreal she replied the sack of the city again if there is another crusade in the corner of her vision she saw the impatient gesture of his hand brushing away the idea the forced union of the church with rome she went on and this time he stood perfectly still violence in the city if that should happen she added measuring her words as precisely as she could possible attempts to usurp michaels power over the church her voice was shaking a little now by those who are passionately against union the silence was so intense she could hear a servant drop a fork on the tiled floor two rooms away usurp michaels power over the church he asked at length what on earth do you mean he was very pale michael is emperor or do you mean usurp the throne her heart pounding she met his eyes do i thats ridiculous stay with your medicine demetrios snapped you know nothing about the world and still less about the relations of power there is something that disturbs your mother she lied her mind racing something keeps her from sleeping and takes the pleasure from her food so she eats it badly and too fast i suppose thats better than saying her illness is caused by sin he conceded dryly a sudden very real sadness crossed his face but if you think my mothers a coward then you are a fool i never saw her afraid of anything of course you didnt anna thought eirenes fears were of the heart not of the mind or the flesh like most women she feared loneliness and rejection losing the man she loved to someone like zoe fortythree a ceiling in the papal palace in viterbo had caved in splintering to a thousand shards of wood plaster and rubble killing pope john xxi the news reduced rome to stunned silence then slowly spread to the rest of christendom once again the world had no voice for god to lead it palombara heard the news in the blachernae palace at an audience with the emperor now he stood in one of the great galleries in front of a magnificent statue it was one of a few that had survived with only the slightest chip in one arm as if to show that it too was subject to time and chance it was greek from before christ preserved here in this seldom used corner beautiful and almost naked anna was in the same corridor returning from treating a patient she saw bishop palombara but he was deep in thought and as unaware of her as if he had been alone she read in his face in the unguarded moment a vulnerability to beauty as if it could reach inside him effortlessly past all the barriers he had built up and touch the wounds beyond yet he allowed it some part of him hungered for the overwhelming emotion even if it was so threaded through with pain yet its reality eluded him she knew that when he turned to her only for an instant she saw it in his eyes then as if by mutual agreement he walked away back toward the main gallery and she was ashamed of having intruded even though it had been unintentional she heard a noise of swift footsteps and swung around sharply as if she had been caught somewhere she should not have been why should she feel so exposed because she had experienced a moments empathy with the roman this was the immediate razor edge of the schism not arguments about the nature of god it was the poison in the nature of man where the lines of enormity were drawn in the ground and one was afraid to stretch out the hand across them fortyfour from may to november there was another long void in struggle between rome and byzantium until pope nicholas iii was elected toward the end of november he was italian passionately so he dispossessed charles of anjou of his position as senator of rome so he could vote in no future papal elections thus considerably reducing his power he packed the high offices close to him with his own brothers nephews and cousins gaining a stronghold on rome he also required yet another affirmation of the union between rome and byzantium this time it was not michael and his son who should sign the promises of the new restrictions it was all the bishops and senior clergy in what remained of the empire anna found constantine in despair i shouldnt have done it he said hoarsely but how could i have been wrong he seemed almost on the edge of tears his eyes hot beseeching escape from a reality he could not bear he flung out his hands in a gesture of pleading pope john forced the emperor into signing the promise to obey rome and a month afterwardjust a monththe ceiling of his palace fell in on him it was an act of god it had to be she did not argue i told the people so he went on urgently even the cardinals in rome must have seen it what more do they need as a sign do they not believe it was god who brought down the walls of jericho on the sinners within his voice was rising in a wild plea i told them it was the miracle we had waited for i had promised them that the blessed virgin would save us if only we had faith he choked gagging for breath i have betrayed them she was embarrassed for him this was the sort of crisis of faith one should have alone and afterward be able to pretend had not happened no one said it would be easy she began at least no one who tells the truth or that it wouldnt hurt and we would always win the crucifixion must have looked like the end of everything he breathed out heavily we must keep on fighting to the death if necessary we must find new heart somehow if we havent the truth then we have nothing at all the faintest flicker of a smile touched his eyes and he moved absently to straighten his robe thank you anastasius your faith in me has given me strength this is a setback it is not a defeat tomorrow will see the resurrection if we have faith he straightened his shoulders i shall begin immediately your grace she reached out as if to touch him then dropped her hand at the last moment be careful she warned thinking of his arrest perhaps worse if you speak out too clearly against the union you will be thrown out of office she said urgently and then who will minister to the poor and the sick you will end up in exile like cyril choniates and what good will that do i have no intention of being so impractical he promised her i shall walk quietly and keep the faith constantine was on the steps of the church of the holy apostles a crowd was pressing forward anxiously looking to constantine waiting for him to speak and reassure them tell them that their ancient comforts were not empty he was not aware of anna in the shadow a few yards behind him his eyes and his mind were on the eager faces in front of him be patient he said quietly in order to hear him they ceased talking to one another and gradually the silence spread we are entering a difficult time he went on we must be outwardly obedient or we will cause dissension in the community perhaps violence old ways vie with new ones but we know the truth of our faith and we will practice virtue in our homes even should it become impossible in our streets or churches we will keep the faith and abide in hope god will yet rescue us the panic ebbed away anna could see the faces begin to smile the jostling cease god bless the bishop someone called out constantine bishop constantine the cry was taken up and repeated like an incantation constantine smiled go in peace my brethren never lose faith to the true heart there is no such thing as defeat only a time of waiting an exercise of trust and a keeping of gods commandments until the dawn again the cry came his name blessings then again his name over and over anna looked at him and saw the humble bearing of his head the gesture of declining the praise but she also saw his body shiver his fist halfhidden in his robes tighten into a clench and the sheen of sweat on his skin when he turned toward her modestly withdrawing from the adulation his eyes were shining and his cheeks were flushed she had seen the same look on eustathiuss face the first time he had made love to her back in the beginning when the hunger and the anticipation had burned through both of them before the bitterness suddenly she was revolted and ashamed wishing she had not seen it but it was too late the look in constantines face was printed on her mind he did not notice he was reveling in being adored she stood in the shadow and was hot with guilt because she was aware of the ugliness in him the doubt and then the lust and she had not the honesty to tell him constantine had given her a link to the vast body of the church again a purpose to strive for beyond the daily healing of the sick to separate from him irrevocablyand it would be irrevocablewould mean standing alone which was the greater betrayal to face him with the truth or not to face him she turned and walked away ahead of him so she could not see his eyes nor he see hers fortyfive anna stood in eirene vatatzess elegant quiet bedroom and looked down at the woman lying on the bed her clothes were rumpled and marked with blood and around her neck there were stains of an ointment in two places was also the yellow mucus of suppuration there was an open ulcer on her cheek and another just under her jawline on the opposite side her hands were covered in red weals some already swollen where the pus was gathering into a head anna knew from her son demetrios that his father gregory was due to return shortly from alexandria this time to remain indefinitely eirene was in physical pain but her distress was greater is the rest of your body affected as well anna asked gently eirene glared at her that doesnt matter she made a sharp gesture with her hands cure my face do whatever you have to the cost is unimportant she drew in a long breath so is the pain her voice was brittle anna could hear the edges of the words like shards of glass grating together annas mind raced over every possibility she could think of every treatment however radicalchristian jewish or arabic were any of them of use if the source of the illness was the fear in eirenes mind annas imagination flew to the wounds she guessed at the rejection of clever ugly vulnerable eirene for the sensuous zoe who would laugh and enjoy then leave taking whatever she wanted and needing nothing was gregory a man bored by what he could have and fascinated by what he could not how shallow how cruel and yet how desperately understandable what was the point in healing the skin from outside only to have it erupt again a day later dont stand there like a fool eirene snapped twisting a little to look at her if you dont know what to do say so ill call someone else if youre in poverty for gods sake take some money but dont stare at me as if you expected me to heal myself what are you going to tell me that i should pray do you think i havent prayed all my life you stupid suddenly she turned her face away tears wet on her blemished cheeks i am considering what remedies there are and which would be best anna said gently some form of intoxication would relieve the selfconsciousness that prevented eirene from allowing her passion or her anger to show and that had perhaps masked the laughter that could have made her less easy to read it might even allow the sensuality that could have made her entertaining and just beyond gregorys total reach it would be a shortterm answer but what use was a longterm cure if she perished of misery now i will give you an ointment to take away the heat she said aloud i dont care what it feels like you fool eirene shouted at her can you see nothing you and the redness anna finished calmly eirene needed her to understand yet if she did that would be intolerable also another humiliation and an infusion to heal it from within so it does not recur she added for the suppuration you will just have to wait i will wash them with a tincture i have prepared and put on light bandages to keep them from rubbing eirene looked taken aback but she would not apologize physicians were like good servants hardly equals thank you she said awkwardly anna fetched clean water from one of the servants and dropped in a small measure of liquid from a little vial the sharp aroma filled the air but it was pleasant invigorating she began to wash each individual sore working gently and slowly she intended to be here as long as possible since the last time she had been here demetrioss words had raced in her brain it still seemed absurd and she remembered his contempt with a heat of embarrassment he had said the idea of usurping michael was ridiculous she knew that to succeed one would have to overcome the varangian guard demetrios knew them even had friends among them it would not be possible one would need to have the army with you antoninus was a soldier he would know that and the navy and the merchants which justinian would know his ever increasing business had been in such things one would need sound economic advice and access to the treasury since then anna had learned that the lord of the treasury was eirenes cousin theodorus doukas and they were close some people had suggested that at least part of his brilliance was actually eirenes her foresight her genius with figures and what could the easy charming esaias glabas do in such a plan was he cleverer than anyone supposed and helena was she a part of this plot or merely bessarions wife they are not as deep as i had feared anna said dabbing gently at one of the scars cleaning away the suppuration i think it may heal over without leaving a mark last time i was here i spoke a little with demetrios he was most interesting really eirene said with skepticism i think so anna positioned the bandage easing it smooth and bound it lightly im told he has friends among the varangian guard she bent to her work again yes eirene agreed wincing as one of the worst sores was washed i think they are grateful that a man of demetrioss rank should befriend them some noble families treat them less courteously not rudely so much as with indifference she smiled bleakly like a good servant you mean bessarion or justinian lascaris justinian less so of course to bessarion they were heathens for the most part certainly those from the far north she bit her lip forcing herself not to pull away from the pain anna affected not to notice someone told me esaias glabas was talented is that true good heavens no eirene said with contempt he could tell a story well and he knew endless jokes most of them unrepeatable in front of women he could flatter and keep his temper even when provoked anna smiled you didnt like him it was more an observation than a question he is not dead eirene snapped at least not as far as i know i think demetrios would have mentioned it they were friends anna did not look up from her work i suppose so esaias was really a companion of the emperors son andronicus they used to go riding together and to the horse races and of course drinking gambling parties of one sort and another i cant see bessarion liking that anna remarked from what people say he was remarkably serious the word you are looking for is humorless eirene said wryly at last looking at the sore as anna finished bandaging it you are gentle thank you eirene was too clever to be fooled if the wild idea in annas mind was right it would be not only pointless but dangerous to awaken her suspicions she felt her hands shaking im sorry she apologized its nothing eirene said dismissing the slight brush of annas hand over one of the other wounds you are quite right bessarion did not like esaias i think he merely used him anna took a deep quivering breath in his struggle to to save the church she invested her voice with puzzlement as if she did not understand i cannot imagine him working to indulge in such parties there was a minutes fleeting pity in eirenes eyes for the eunuch robbed of manhood which she took anna to be of both its pleasures and its weaknesses he didnt she said gently nor justinian esaias was planning the biggest party with horse races from the night after bessarion was killed it would have been superb esaias was a magnificent host i should add that to his list of qualities anna pretended interest really horse racing that can be exciting to watch i suppose everyone would have been there even bessarion eirene hesitated wouldnt they annas heart was thundering inside her eirene looked away no i believe on that occasion bessarion was supposed to have an audience with the emperor the silence in the room was heavy almost prickling anna started to roll up the unused bandages and put them away so the emperor would not have been there it hardly matters now eirene said a sudden hard edge to her voice bessarion and antoninus are dead and justinian is in exile she looked at her bandaged arms thank you ill come and dress them again tomorrow anna told her standing up and bring you more herbs working quietly in the evening alone in the room where she kept her medicines anna crushed leaves ground roots and stems sometimes with mortar and pestle always being careful never to let one herb contaminate another and all the while thoughts crowded her mind as she turned over every possible interpretation of what she had learned did she have all the pieces that mattered if only she could put them in the right order bessarion was a religious fanatic devoted to the orthodox church he was a comnenos one of the old imperial families he was passionate to prevent the union with rome that michael palaeologus had already begun and that was dividing the nation because he believed it was the only way to avert another invasion justinian had quarreled several times with bessarion the last and worst argument was just before the murder it made a picture she could no longer deny they had planned to kill michael so bessarion could usurp the throne justinian would help him esaias and antoninus were to hold andronicus perhaps even kill him also then bessarion would withdraw all agreement to the union with romecalling on those loyal to the church to support him and that support would naturally be led by constantine all the difficulties had been foreseen and planned for justinian to deal with the merchants and the harbormasters antoninus to hold the leaders of the army demetrios himself to have bribed or otherwise won over the varangian guard on duty that night and once the emperor was dead to give their loyalty to the new emperor bessarion who would actually have killed michael the varangian guard would not let anyone close enough there could be only one answer to that zoe would do it if she believed it was to save byzantium anna poured powder into a jar labeled it and cleaned her tools then began again dynasties had changed violently before and no doubt would again the more she thought of it the more did bessarion seem just the nature of fanatic to whom that would be the necessary and noble thing to do it was an explanation that answered far too much for her to discount it she would have to struggle with the rest but immeasurably more carefullyand never for the second in which it takes to say a word or make an unguarded gesture forget that all the rest of the conspirators were still here still alive and perhaps seeking another pretender to the throne such as demetrios vatatzes she shivered as the knots of fear wound tighter inside her the next patient she treated required several days of her attention and he was in the venetian quarter down by the shore he had been quite severely cut when he was attacked in a brawl near the docks his family were afraid to ask a local christian doctor and annas reputation had spread he was bleeding profusely she had no choice but to try a method she had seen her father use in extreme cases he had learned it traveling in his youth north and eastward beyond the black sea she collected the blood in a clean pot and put it near the fire then she cleaned the wound and packed it with cotton cloth until the bleeding eased it took some little time during which she talked to the man gently to ease his fear and gave him a tincture to help the pain when the blood in the pot had at last coagulated she took it and painted it gently on the raw wound sealing it over when she was sure there was no more bleeding she mixed the most healing and strengthening herbs finely powdered into a paste softened with butter and used them to prevent the cloth of the bandage from sticking to the wound she stayed in the house with him going out only to purchase more herbs and then returning to sit by his bedside hearing the rhythm and patterns of the venetian tongue around her made it impossible not to think of giuliano dandolo she had no idea why he had left so suddenly but she was aware of missing him although in a way his absence was also a relief it was impossible that they should ever be more than occasional friends people able to speak of dreams deeper than the surface joys and sorrows that touched the bone and laughing at the same moment at small absurdities but he awoke something else in her that she could not afford yes it was a relief that giuliano dandolo had gone back to venice like eirene vatatzes she needed a little numbing a rest from the pain of caring fortysix anna returned to see eirene as soon as her venetian patient was sufficiently recovered she found the ulcers noticeably improved eirene was up and dressed in a simple almost severe tunic helena called when anna was there but she was not received i am in no mood to receive helena when i look more like the gorgon eirene said it wryly as if it were amusing but there was pain behind it and it showed in her eyes and in the tightness of her shoulders as she turned away anna forced herself to smile i wonder what helen looked like that they were willing to burn a city and ruin a civilization for her eirene went on pursuing the conversation as if there were nothing else to remark upon i was taught that their concept of beauty was far deeper than a mere matter of form anna replied it needed to be of the mind as well of the intellect and imagination and of the heart if all you want is a beautiful face a statue will do and you can own it completely it doesnt even need feeding she wondered if eirenes selfknowledge had created gregorys rejection was it possible that her belief in her own ugliness had made her seem so to others might they have forgotten it had she allowed them to anna looked at her the awkwardness of eirenes movement was no more than that of many other women her age time and intelligence had lent a distinction to her features that they would not have had in youth had eirene not allowed herself to see it she both loved and hated gregory the look in her eyes the tension in her hands gave her away she believed she could not be loved not with passion or laughter or tenderness not with that desperate hunger for her to love in return that made passion a mutual thing later as anna stood in the main room receiving payment from demetrios for the herbs she was conscious of helena in a pale tunic trimmed with gold her hair elaborately dressed without intending to anna compared her with zoe and helena was still the loser thank you anna said as demetrios gave her the coins i shall return in a day or two i believe she will continue to recover and by then it may be time to change the treatment a little she did not add that she was concerned not to dose eirene too heavily with the intoxicant she had used in case she became dependent upon its artificial sense of wellbeing she intended to use it only as long as it was necessary to face gregorys return dont change it demetrios said hastily his face puckered with concern it is working well anna left and walked to her next patient and the one after it was late and she was tired when she turned aside to climb the steps to her favorite place overlooking the sea this place drew her because of its silence the wind and the gulls were no disturbance to the flight of thought she was not yet ready to answer leos solicitous questions as to her welfare or see in simoniss eyes the slow dying of hope that they would one day prove justinians innocence anna stood on the small level surface at the top of the path the wind fluttering the leaves above her slowly the color bled away on the horizon and dusk filled the air she was annoyed when she heard footsteps on the path below her deliberately she turned her back and faced the east and the blurred coast of nicea already dark she heard her name it was giulianos voice it took her a moment to compose herself before she greeted him are you back here for the doge again she asked he smiled he thinks so actually i am back for the sunset and the conversation he was flippant but there was a rueful honesty there for a second home is never quite the same when you go back he walked the last few paces and stood beside her everything is smaller she agreed lightly she must not allow her burning emotions to show she was glad to have her back to the last of the light he looked at her and something of the tension in his face smoothed away the smile became wider easier the caf√©s on the waterfront here havent changed neither have the arguments thats another kind of home we greeks are always arguing she told him we cant be bothered with subjects about which there is only one valid opinion i noticed he said wryly there was still enough light reflected up from the water to see the sheen on his skin the faint pucker around his eyes but the emperor has sworn his loyalty to rome doesnt that end some of your freedom to argue not as much as an invasion would she said dryly therell be another crusade sooner or later sooner he said a sudden tightness in his voice have you come to warn us he looked down at his hands resting on the rough wood that formed a kind of railing theres no point you know as much of its coming as anyone does well still argue about god and what he wants of us she changed the subject someone asked me the other day and i realized i had never seriously considered it he frowned i think the church would say that nothing we could do would be of much value to him but he requires obedience and i suppose praise do you like to be praised she asked occasionally but im not god the smile flickered across his face neither am i she agreed seriously and i like to be praised only if i have done something well and i know the person speaking is sincere but once is enough i would hate it all the time just words endless you are wonderful you are marvelous no of course not he turned around his back half to the sea his face toward her that would be ridiculous and unbelievably shallow and obedience she went on do you like it if people do what you tell them to never because they have thought of it themselves not because they care and want to do it without growth without learning wouldnt eternity be boring i never thought of the possibility of heaven being a bore he said half laughing now but after a hundred thousand years yes terrible in fact maybe thats hell no she said hell is having had heaven and then let it slip from your grasp he put his hands up to his face and pushed the heels of his palms hard against the skin oh god you are being serious she felt selfconscious should i not be im sorry no he looked at her you should be now i know what i missed most when i was away from byzantium for a moment tears filled her eyes and her vision swam then she took one hand in the other and twisted her fingers until the pain reminded her of reality limits the things she could have and those she could not maybe theres more than one hell she suggested maybe one of them is to repeat the same thing over and over again until you finally realize that you are dead in every sense that matters you have ceased to grow im tempted to joke that that is pure byzantine and probably heretical giuliano answered but i have an awful feeling that you are right fortyseven of course helena had told zoe of gregory vatatzess return from alexandria she had stood to the middle of the glorious room overlooking the sea and said it quite casually as if it were of no more meaning than the price of some new luxury in the market entertaining but of no matter how much did helena know or worse than that was there something zoe did not know she stared at the great gold cross poor eirene she had sought refuge in her intelligence and her anger instead of using both to win what she wanted and gregory was on his way back at last he would arrive any day now zoe remembered him as vividly as if he had gone only a week ago not more years than she wanted to count would his hair be gray but he would still be as tall towering even over her perhaps it was as well they had not married the edge of danger might have gone they could have become bored with each other arsenios had been his cousin in the elder branch of the family he had kept the money and the gorgeous stolen icons sharing nothing so his sin had not tainted gregory in fact gregory had hated arsenios for it if he hadnt zoe could never have loved him but he was still arsenioss cousin and he would be concerned by his death and of course the ruin of his daughter and the death of his son which zoe had so brilliantly contrived would he deduce what had happened and how she had brought it about he had always been as clever as she or very nearly she shivered although the air from the open window was still warm would he look for revenge he had had no love for arsenios but family meant something pride of blood she dressed in dark blue one day crimson and topaz the next used oils and unguents perfumes had thomais brush her hair until it gleamed the sheen bronze and then gold as she moved like the warp and weft of silk the days went by word spread that he was home her servants told her helena told her he would come he would not be able to resist it zoe could outwait him she had always been able to do that whatever it cost her she paced the floor lost her temper with thomais and threw a dish at her catching her on the cheek in a curving gash seeing the sudden blood run scarlet on the black skin she sent for anastasius to stitch it up telling him nothing when gregory finally came he still caught her by surprise all the pictures in her mind did not match the shock of seeing him come into the room she had been reading with the lights high so she could see too late to dim them now he walked in slowly his hair was winged with gray but still thick his long face sunken below the cheekbones eyes black as tar but it was his voice that always reached deepest into her the careful diction as if he loved the roll of the words the dark bass resonance of it it doesnt look very different he said softly his eyes gazing around before resting on her and you still wear the same colors im glad some things shouldnt change she felt a flutter inside her like a trapped bird she thought of arsenios dying on the floor spewing blood his eyes glittering with hate hello gregory she said casually she moved a step or two toward him you still look byzantine in spite of your years in egypt did you have a good voyage tedious he replied with a slight smile but safe enough youll find the city changed oh yes much is rebuilt but not all the seawalls are largely repaired but you have no games no chariot races at the hippodrome he observed and arsenios is dead i know she had prepared for this moment i feel for your loss but eirene is well and demetrios although i know they missed you that was a formality he shrugged perhaps he acknowledged demetrios speaks much of helena a slight smile touched his lips i thought she would tire of bessarion in fact it took longer that i had expected bessarion is dead she replied really he was young at least young to die he was murdered she told him keeping her voice perfectly level a razorsharp amusement crossed his face and vanished as quickly indeed by whom zoe had not intended to meet gregorys eyes but the impulse was irresistible she saw the fire of intelligence there and a bottomless understanding to look away would be a defeat a young man called antoninus i believe assisted by a friend justinian lascaris he disposed of the body gregory looked surprised why if ever a man were totally ineffectual it was bessarion surely not over helena bessarion wouldnt have given a damn if she had affairs as long as she was discreet of course not over helena she said tartly bessarion was leading the battle against union with rome he had gained a considerable reputation as a religious hero how interesting he sounded as if he meant it and these other men antoninus and justinian were for the union not at all especially justinian she replied they were profoundly against it that is the part of it which does not make sense this really is interesting he murmured what about helena did she wish to be a heros wife or might a heros widow suit her better bessarion sounds extremely tedious he was someone tried to kill him before antoninus did three times twice with poison once with a knife in the street not antoninus definitely not he was not incompetent far from it justinian lascaris even less so then perhaps it was helena after all he said thoughtfully you said lascaris a good name she did not answer she could feel her heart pounding and her breath tight in her chest gregory smiled his teeth were still white still strong that is something you never did zoe he said it softly as if with approval if you were going to kill someone you would do it yourself more efficient and safer although even with the greatest care the utmost secrecy there is always a way to find out but not to prove it she said with barely a flutter in her breath he moved another step closing the distance between them he touched her cheek with his fingers then kissed her slowly intimately as if he had all the time in the world she decided to attack if in doubt always attack she answered him with equal intimacy her lips her tongue her body and it was he who stepped back you do not need to prove anything he said if what you want is revenge all you need is to be sure i understand revenge she answered him her voice caressing the words not for myselfno one has wronged me deeply enough for thatbut for my city for its rape and the spoiling of its holy relics i understand it gregory i shall never think of byzantium without thinking of you zoe but there are other loyalties such as that of blood one day we will all die but byzantium will not be the same after you do something will have gone and i shall regret that he looked once more around the room then quickly turned on his heel and left he knew she had killed arsenios that was what he had come to tell her he would let her wait wondering when he would do it and how gregory never rushed his pleasures either physical or emotional she remembered that about him he tasted every bit slowly she stood in her room holding her arms around herself the rape of constantinople could not be forgiven until all of it was paid for not ever put to the back of the mind and allowed to heal high among those from whom she must wring the last drop was giuliano dandolo the greatgrandson of that monstrous old man who had led the ruinous crusade she walked to the window gazed across at the rising moon spilling silver over the horn and began to plan the destruction of gregory she regretted it she remembered him passionately with both pleasure and regret maybe she would lie with him one last time she would mourn him perhaps even more than eirene would fortyeight for zoe towering over such relatively smaller considerations as how to destroy gregory was the fact that he was forewarned poison was her weapon either of the mind or of the body she could anger tempt or provoke people even mislead them into destroying themselves every quality that was power could become a weakness if carried to excess even the gold byzant that most exquisite of coins had two sides she stared at herself in the glass in this dim room shaded from the sunlight she was still beautiful she had never been indecisive never a coward would he use those things against her of course he would if he could find a way how by baiting her to attack him that is what she would have done use her courage to tempt her to seize the chance recklessly and then trap her should she do the same bluff double bluff triple bluff abandon them all and act simply nothing byzantine nothing egyptianjust crude as a latin and therefore unexpected from her what if she just waited and watched to see what he did how soon would he decide to act after all it was gregory who wanted revenge for arsenioss death she could afford time care always the utmost care even so three days later after a trip to the baths and eating fruit afterward she was dreadfully ill by the time she got home she was nauseated and filled with stabbing pains already she was beginning to grow dizzy how had he reached her she had eaten only what she had seen others eat harmless things apricots and pistachios from a common dish she staggered into her bedroom thomais supporting her no she gasped as thomais tried to help her lie down i have been poisoned you fool i must mix an emetic fetch me a bowl and my herbs be quick dont stand there like an idiot she heard the fear in her own voice as the room swayed and blurred around her darkening as if the candles were burning down thomais returned with a bowl and a jug of water in the other hand she set them down and waited grayfaced to be told what to do next zoe told her precisely which bottle and which jar to bring fingers shaking she put a tiny spoonful of one in a glass then two crushed leaves of the other and drank them the taste was vile and she knew that in a few moments the pain would get worse and she would vomit terribly but it would not last long and her stomach would be empty by tomorrow morning she would begin to recover damn gregory damn him it was nearly two weeks before she saw him again it was at the blachernae palace everyone who mattered from church or state was there old blood or new money a kings ransom of jewels was worn by men and women alike although admittedly there were few women present zoe could not outshine the empress so she chose to wear no gems at all simply to use her height and her magnificent hair to accentuate the beautiful bones of her face and thus mark herself as different her tunic was of bronze silk sheened light and dark as she moved and she wore a rope of gold in her hair like a crown faces turned to stare and the gasps told her she had succeeded she saw gregory early onhis height made that inevitablebut it was over an hour before he actually spoke to her they were briefly alone cut off from the crowd by a row of exquisitely tiled pillars creating a separate room he offered her a honey cake decorated with almonds no thank you she declined perhaps too quickly a slow smile spread across his face he made no remark but their eyes met and she knew exactly what he was thinking as he knew what she thought his smile widened you look marvelous as always zoe you make every other woman in the room appear as if she is trying too hard perhaps what they wish for can be gained by wealth she replied wondering how he would interpret that how tedious he said still not moving his eyes from hers how very young what can be bought cloys so quickly dont you think what can be bought by one person can also be bought by another she agreed eventually it becomes vulgar but not revenge he replied the perfect revenge is an art and that has to be created it can never be satisfying if it is the work of someone else do you agree oh yes creating it is half the flavor but of course only if it succeeds he looked at her studying her of course it must but you disappoint me if you think that it must do so immediately that would be like pouring good wine down your throat rather than sipping it a little at a time and my dear you were never a barbarian to waste your pleasures so he had not meant to kill her not yet anyway he was going to play first a cut here a cut there bleeding away courage a little at a time it was the insult to his proud name that counted to gregory her monstrous temerity in daring to kill one of his bloodin fact counting georgios two it was war she smiled up at him i am byzantine she replied that means that i am both sophisticated and barbaric whatever i do i do it to the ultimate degree i am surprised you need to be reminded of that she looked him up and down is your health failing you not at all nor will it i am younger than you are she laughed you always were younger my dear all men are it is something women must learn to accept but i am glad if you have not forgotten to forget ones pleasures would be a kind of death a little one inch by inch she smiled at him eyes bright my memory is perfect he did not answer but she saw the muscles tighten in his jaw whether he admitted it or not she still had power to arouse him it was a great pity he had to die he moved a step away distancing himself a fraction she allowed her smile to widen laughter into her eyes too little or too much she asked softly anger flared up in the stain of blood in his cheeks he put out his hand and caught her arm his fingers hard and tight she could not have escaped even had she wanted to physical memory of passion was suddenly so sharp that it ran hot through her body she looked up at him if he did not give in to the temptation and make love to her she would never forgive him then killing him would be easy hardly even regrettable if he did and it had all the old passion and strength then dear god killing him would be the hardest thing she had ever had to do he kept his grip on her arm and strode out half dragging her along until they were beyond the public rooms in some private quarters with chairs and cushions for an instant she was frightened if she screamed here not even the varangian guard would come she must not let him see that she was afraid but he had seen he knew it as if he could smell it in the air he smiled slowly then allowed himself to laugh a deep rich sound of pure pleasure she drew in her breath and let it out very slowly the seconds seemed to be caught suspended one by one then he let go of her arm and placed his hand on her chest and pushed she fell backward surprised and a little ashamed landing hard on the cushions she stayed motionless frightened zoe he asked she still did not know if he was going to make love to her or kill her or possibly both any word she said might be the wrong one what was he waiting for she let out her breath in a sigh as if bored he tore open her tunic and kissed her hard over and over as he had done in the days when they had loved then she knew that at least he would not be able to kill her not tonight there were too many old hungers to answer too much present fire for both of them it was easy as if the years had never happened they said nothing afterward they kissed once and both knew it would be the last time fortynine zoe knew beyond any doubt that she would have only one chance to kill gregory if she lost it she lost everything he would not fail she was thinking of this on her way home from the baths her servant sabas a few feet behind her when she was bumped unexpectedly hard by a messenger running around a group of women talking in the street zoe lost her balance and in trying to regain it without falling over she stepped out into the path of the traffic she was struck by a cart that had just started moving forward she fell heavily and felt a sharp pain in her lower leg there were shouts of alarm and sympathy around her people rushed forward sabas among them and a tangle of arms thrust out to help her pushing and shoving to get the cart backward without startling the horse into bolting arms pulled her up tearing her robe and she was unceremoniously put down on the ground with her back to the wall of the nearest shop while an old woman wagged her head and looked with alarm at the blood staining the fabric then sabas was there bending over her without asking permission he tore the hem off zoes tunic and used it to bind the wound look where youre going in future an old man said waspishly zoe was too shaken to retaliate but she looked at his face so she would remember it and one day she would repay his insolence he saw something in her gaze and hurried away sabas found a carriage and helped her in and she was carried home angry and for the moment consumed with pain as soon as she arrived she sent sabas off again at a run to fetch anastasius he was obliged to ask simonis where anastasius was and then follow her to another patient who was not seriously ill anastasius left almost immediately and accompanied him back zoe was in too much distress to complain about waiting blood had soaked through the makeshift bandage and the wound was throbbing so she could feel it all the way up to the groin she told anastasius what had happened and watched while he unbound the bloody edge of her tunic and exposed the wound it looked horrible and it turned her stomach and sent a chill of fear through her but she would not let him see her avert her eyes he worked quickly she noticed that he had beautiful hands like a womansslender longfingeredand he moved with both delicacy and strength she wondered what he would have been like had he been allowed to grow into a man there was something in the turn of his head an inflection of the voice that reminded her of justinian it came suddenly as he frowned and bent to look more closely at an herb then the likeness was gone again i need to stitch the sides together anastasius told her otherwise it will take a long time to heal and it will leave a worse scar im sorry but it will feel unpleasant then do it quickly zoe ordered him i want it healed and i dont care for blood all over the place anastasius threaded one of his curved needles with silk now please keep perfectly still i dont wish to cause you any more pain than i have to would you like thomais to hold you steady zoe looked at anastasius and met the unflinching gray eyes it was the first time she had looked at him so intently he had long eyelashes and his eyes were beautiful but it was the intelligence in them that excited her even alarmed her it was as if his mind touched hers and read it much more intimately than she would have expected he had started to stitch and she had not noticed it she watched him work quickly admiring his skill it seems you are busy now anastasius she remarked your reputation has spread i hear many people speaking of your abilities he smiled without taking his eyes from his work i am grateful to you for that i owe my first recommendations to you i believe it was you who gave my name to eirene vatatzes i have attended her since then zoe froze her body suddenly rigid im sorry anastasius apologized i am nearly finished zoe swallowed tell me about eirene it will take my mind off what you are doing how is she now that her husband has returned from alexandria recovering anastasius put in the last stitch and very gently so as not to pull the flesh cut the silk with a blade it may take her a little while thank you did you meet her husband anastasius looked up yes an interesting man he mentioned that he knew you a long time ago what did he say anastasius smiled as if he knew exactly what was in her mind and in eirenes he said you were the most beautiful woman in byzantium not for your face or even your body but for the passion in you zoe looked away she could not face anastasiuss eyes really no doubt he said it to annoy eirene she has a temper and that amuses him and what did you say she demanded facing him again the high color in her cheeks masked as anger anastasius smiled my answer was unimportant oh what was it i told him that i was not in a position to appreciate it but i quite believed him that it was so anastasius replied she gasped at his nerve felt the remembered heat scorch up her face again then burst into laughter a rich peal of pure delight anastasius poured some fine powder into a small silk sachet and then placed a jar of ointment on the table beside it take a spoonful of this in hot water once a day he handed her a ceramic spoon wide but shallow level do not heap it draw a knife over the top to make certain of that it will keep the infection from getting worse and put the ointment on if it starts to itch it probably will do as it heals i shall call again in a week to remove some of the stitches and then take out the rest a week or so after that but if it gives you cause for anxiety because it is inflamed or it suppurates send for me immediately or if you become feverish after anastasius was gone and thomais had assisted her to bathe and put on clean clothes zoe became aware of the steadily increasing pain in her leg by nightfall it was throbbing so powerfully that she could think of little else she sent for hot water and measured out the powder anastasius had left and dropped it into the cup she was about to drink it and suddenly a hideous thought came to her what if gregory was using anastasius perhaps the only person outside her own household whom she would trust carefully in case any of it spilled on her she threw out the medicine at first she thought to destroy it with fire and then realized just in time that it might be just as lethal if it was burned and its fumes inhaled she ended up tipping all the powder into the hot water and pouring it down the drain three days later she was in even greater pain in spite of having treated it herself and taken one of her own powders to get rid of fever the wound was red and angry and it felt as if it were on fire every now and then she was dizzy she drank glass after glass of water it tasted even more brackish than usual and she was always thirsty now she was certain that gregory was behind the attack and that somehow he had managed to introduce poison into the wound look for poison she told anastasius when he came the wound is infected someone is trying to kill me anastasius looked at her studying her hot golden eyes her flushed skin and then last the raw wound in her leg which was beginning to suppurate he touched it gently with one cool finger then turned to her did you use the medicine i gave you and dont lie unless you want to lose your leg no she said quietly i was afraid that whoever poisoned me might have reached you too anastasius nodded i see then we had better start again from the beginning the infection is serious now i shall stay here and watch you i have every interest in your recovery it would be bad for my reputation if you died so do as i tell you he smiled very slightly a deep inward humor he stayed nursing her all day and to begin with all night as well he sat beside her talking to her through the increasing pain at first it irritated her then gradually she realized that as she answered his questions she became less aware of how badly she hurt obliquely it was kind of him demetrios she answered his last question smiling in spite of herself not like his father weaker in love with helena probably not in love with power certainly thinks he hides it but he doesnt eirenes son but without her intelligence brilliant with money like her she laughed but so deep inside herself that he did not hear it helena thinks he loves her but then she thinks all sorts of things fool did justinian love her anastasius asked sounding only mildly interested as if he were still trying to take her mind from the pain loathed her zoe answered frankly damn it her leg hurt she was getting a little dizzy was she going to die after all he made her drink something more that tasted foul had gregory got to him she searched his eyes his face and could read something in it beyond curiosity but what anastasius zoe whispered yes if i am alive in the morning i shall tell you why justinian lascaris killed bessarion bloody fool he didnt come to me and i was the one person who would have believed him i can see it for myself now only mistake he made but it cost him everything idiot anastasius looked as if she had struck him his face an odd mixture of ashen pale and red spots on his cheeks like weals the room was beginning to swim around zoe she was growing delirious with fever he forced her to drink something that was even more vile than the last time but when she awoke at midday she was much improved anastasius was smiling at her better he inquired with some satisfaction much better she sat up slowly and he offered her something to drink that was pleasant thank you he eased her back down again he was stronger than she had expected or perhaps she was weaker its morning anastasius observed i can see that zoe snapped a smile flickered in anastasiuss eyes then you will tell me why justinian was a fool not to trust you he said with an edge to his voice or was i the fool to believe it memory rushed back what was that you just gave me anastasius smiled you havent answered my question justinian knew bessarion was useless zoe said quietly he would have been a disaster on the throne but the others wouldnt believe justinian theyd put everything into it and the plans had gone too far the only way to stop it was to kill bessarion antoninus believed justinian he helped she almost laughed when she thought of it except that it was so futile fool i would have stopped it they could have done nothing without me but justinian didnt trust me what was it i just drank anastasius stared at her as if mesmerized what was it i just drank zoe repeated her voice more angry and frightened than she had wanted to betray infusion of camomile anastasius answered its good for the digestion just camomile leaves in hot water nothing else its bitter because youve been ill that alters your taste she did not want to admire anastasius and it was a curious feeling to trust him yet at least as far as medicine was concerned she did she lay back at last for the time being content after three days she began to regain strength and the wound was less red and the swelling subsided after a week he pronounced it satisfactory and said he would leave and return at the end of another three days she thanked him paid him generously and also gave him the gift of a small enameled box made of silver and inlaid with aquamarine he touched it gently looking first at its beauty then up at her his appreciation of it was clear in his face and she was satisfied she told him to leave zoe was glad anastasius had liked it he had ministered to her not only with skill but with gentleness it had given her a serious fright to be so vulnerable it could not go on like this an idea was beginning to take shape in her mind she would make gregorys death count she would contrive a means to have giuliano dandolo blamed for it that way she could bear to kill gregory she could even do it herself fifty with gregory zoe would have no second chance in a perverse way this last battle between them was another kind of bond she thought of him during the day she lay awake at night and remembered how it was to be with him another piece of the plan fell into her hands it was the street attacks upon bessarion and then upon herself that gave her the idea the first thing was to plant the seeds in peoples minds that there was a quarrel between gregory and giuliano dandolo it must be just a superficial word so slight that the meaning was recalled only afterward and understood then the second thing was to go to bardas a maker of daggers whom she knew and had trusted in the past she put on her heaviest dalmatica and went out into the windy street and the light rain walking quickly she left sabas far behind her as he was used to being discreet seeing and hearing nothing the pain in her leg was barely there anymore yes mistress the swordsmith said immediately pleased to see her again only a fool forgot a benefactress or broke his word to a woman who never forgot or forgave what can i make for you this time i want a good dagger she replied it doesnt have to be the best but i want a family crest on the hilt and i want you to be discreet about it it is a gift and it will be spoiled if anyone else hears of it your business is no one elses lady whose crest would that be dandolo she answered as soon as she had the dagger which was beautifulbardas was even better than his wordshe sent a letter to giuliano dandolo who was still lodging in the venetian quarter the message was simple she had learned more about his dead mother giuliano came as she had known he would she looked at him standing in her magnificent room although he was ill at ease trying to hide the eagerness to learn what she had to say burning inside him he still moved with grace and grudgingly she admitted to herself he was better than handsome he had a vitality of mind that she could not ignore if she had been younger she would have wanted to lie with him but he was a dandolo and the dream in the eyes the shape of a cheekbone the width of his shoulders or the way he walked could not pardon that he made all the usual polite remarks not rushing into asking for the new information and she played the game uncertain whether she enjoyed it or not i have heard more of your mother she said as soon as the greetings were over and the casual remarks that courtesy required she was beautiful but perhaps you knew that already she saw the flicker of emotion in his face the sharp hurt too deep to camouflage perhaps you did not know that maddalena had a sister eudoxia also beautiful but regrettably there is considerable scandal about her name again she saw the emotion raw in him a pity she could not be young again what i did not know before is that eudoxia is said by some to have repented deeply in her old age and to have joined some holy order i do not know which but i may be able to learn it is possible that she is still alive alive his eyes opened wide please leave it to me i have ways which are not open to you and i can do it discreetly i will let you know as soon as i have something that is certain thank you he smiled at her a handsome selfassured man with a charm that came without effort i was three when my mother died she said to giuliano aware that her voice was shaking but unable to control it im sorry he responded with sudden shock his eyes tender she did not wish his sympathy she was raped and murdered then she wished she had not told him it was a weakness and a tactical error he might work out the year and the circumstances and then know he could never trust her i have something for you she said hastily trying to cover it i came by it almost by chance so please feel no obligation she moved away from him over to the table on which lay the dagger with the dandolo crest she unwrapped the blue silk cloth around it and held it out hilt toward him crest upward bardas had done a perfect job it looked old and well used yet every detail of it was clear giuliano stared at it then looked up at her take it she urged it should be yours anyway what on earth would i do with a dagger that carried a venetian crest on it he was not clumsy enough to offer to pay for it he would give her a gift of appropriate value a little more than he judged the dagger to be worth he weighed it in his hands the balance is perfect he observed where did it come from i dont know she answered but if i find out i shall tell you thank you he was not effusive but the depth of his feeling filled his voice his eyes even the way he stood and the touch of his hands on the knife wear it she said quite casually it will become you she would pray that he did kneel before the virgin mary and beseech her that he did unless the dagger was known to be giulianos zoes plan would not work i will he seemed about to add something further then changed his mind and took his leave she watched him go with an odd little pain biting in her side as if something were slipping out of her hands now there was nothing to do but wait two or three weeks at least she had to be sure others had seen giuliano with the knife and knew it was his she waited a month time seemed to crawl by like a crippled thing dragging days behind it the heat of noon paralyzed the afternoons were heavy and silent darkness was a mask that could hide anything every creak and footstep a possible assassin as she had expected giuliano sent her a gift a brooch for her dalmatica she liked it more than she wished to it was black onyx and topaz in a bed of gold she did not want to wear it yet she could not resist doing so her fingers straying to it because it was also beautiful to the touch damn him finally she could wait no longer and she sent for a thief she had used in the past when necessity dictated she told him the knife was hers and had been taken in a robbery then sold to giuliano dandolo she had seen him with it and realized he had no idea of its origin she had offered to buy it back and because of the family crest he had not surprisingly refused she had no recourse but to have it stolen as it had been stolen from her the thief asked no questions and promised to do as she wished for a price next she wrote a letter to gregory disguising her hand to look like that of dandolo copying from the letter he had sent her accepting her earlier invitation she said she had accidentally stumbled on a revealing secret about zoe chrysaphes and would be willing to inform gregory if gregory would assist him in a certain diplomatic matter of no detriment to byzantium she signed it with his name also copied finally she sent a similar letter to giuliano from gregory saying he had heard that giuliano was interested in learning about maddalena agallon he had known and admired her and would be happy to tell giuliano all he was able to she signed it gregory vatatzes she knew his hand well enough to forge it without effort then she sat in the large red chair under the torches and stared at the ceiling relishing the moment feeling her heart beat so hard and so high in her chest that she could scarcely breathe the night of the assignation between gregory and giuliano zoe was filled with a torrent of doubts she stood at the window and looked out at the hazy darkness and the faintly moving gleam of lanterns like crawling fireflies in the streets below was she being absurd poor zoe chrysaphes once the greatest beauty in exiled byzantium the mistress of emperors soon to be a crazy old woman in the streets dressed in rags trying to kill people she strode over to the great cross on the wall and stared at it willing herself to regain the passion of vengeance that would overcome her weakness the kantakouzenos were destroyed in cosmas and the vatatzes with arsenios the doukas in euphrosane the rest did not matter only dandolo was left and that would soon be over too she moved to the icon of the virgin mary and knelt blessed mother of god fill me with strength to complete my mission she pleaded she looked up at the somber face with its aureole of gold and it seemed to smile at her as if some hidden floodgates inside zoe had opened the blood throbbed in her veins and her muscles had the vitality of a young woman she rose crossed herself and hurried out alone in the night as light and easy in her stride as a deer it was mild the wind off the sea smelling of salt only when she was half a mile from her home did she realize that the old beggar woman she was dressed to seem would never have walked as she was doing as she rounded a corner she bent a little and slowed her pace she went another mile slowly painfully gregory had to pass this way to keep his appointment with giuliano here was the place to catch him in the venetian quarter she had calculated the time he would pass and before giuliano could arrive but only just it had to be exact she touched the dagger at her belt hidden by her cloak then crossed herself again now she must wait there was someone coming along the street now two young men arm in arm drunk their bodies swaying making the shadows move she heard their voices and their laughter and shrank back into the lee of a doorway should she attack gregory from behind no that was a cowards way he would suspect anyone following him but not an old woman facetoface she bent farther forward as if age crippled her there was laughter down the street lights going the other way the wind was saltier here close to the waterfront there was someone else coming a tall man carrying a lantern she recognized his step she hobbled barely glancing at his face her voice whining highpitched and servile spare an old woman a few pence may god bless you he stopped his hand going toward his side money or a weapon there was no time to wait and see zoe drew out the knife from beneath her cloak and clawed upward with it at the same time kicking him as hard as she could on the shin he jerked forward with surprise and she swept the blade hard across his throat using all her strength helped by the weight of his body as he lurched off balance from the kick the lantern crashed and went out but her eyes were accustomed to the night there was blood jetting out of his throat warm and sticky on her hand she could smell it he did not even cry out making only a terrible gurgle as he choked wrenching around grabbing at her as his life gushed out of him he tore at her shoulder pulling the muscles hurting as if he had stabbed her but he was already losing his balance carrying her down with him she felt herself falling and the ground hit her hard with a pain in her elbow that took her breath away but his grasp had loosened she did not want him to go without knowing it was she who had done it gregory she said clearly gregory for a moment his eyes focused on her and his lips formed something that might have been her name then the light in him went out and his tar black eyes were empty slowly her bones aching her muscles stiff she rose and turned to walk away her vision was blurred hot tears streamed down her face it puzzled her why she felt as if the void were not at her feet but inside her and she knew with certainty that it would never again be filled fiftyone anna woke in the night to find simonis standing over her with a candle in her hand simoniss voice was sharp with irritation its a man from the venetian quarter on horseback says youre to come right away theres been an accident and they need help he wants you to go on his horse theyre mad people ill go and tell him to get one of their own she half turned away tell him ill be there in a minute anna ordered she went with the venetian accepting his hand to haul her up into the saddle behind him clutching her bag you wont need it he told her hes dead we we need your help to get rid of the body so it wont be found and we wont get the blame for his murder she was stunned why on earth would i help you she demanded preparing to slide off and return to her bed he urged the animal forward gathering speed too quickly for her to do such a thing they clattered down the hill and along the level if he replied to her question she did not hear his words it was a quarter of an hour of clinging to him awkwardly in the hazy darkness her bag slapping against her legs before they came to a halt in an alley a little knot of people had gathered outside the doorway of a small shop at their feet was sprawled the body of a man one of the group produced a lantern and held it up in its wavering light she could see the fear in his face and the scarlet of blood on the stones we found him in our doorway the man said quietly we didnt do it hes not one of us hes a nobleman and byzantine what shall we do anna took the lantern from him and lowered it to look at the body she saw straightaway that it was gregory vatatzes his throat had been cut in a terrible jagged wound and scarlet with gore on the road beside him was a fine dagger with the dandolo crest on the hilt she had seen it before less than a week ago in giulianos hands he had cut a ripe peach with it offering her half they had laughed together over something trivial there had been only the one peach it had been his and he had shared it with her she ran her hands over the body searching to see if he was armed if there had been a fight she was cold with fear that giuliano could have been injured as well she found a weapon another jeweled knife this one with a different shape of blade still in its sheath at his belt and unstained gregory had not even drawn it there was a piece of paper in his pocket an invitation to meet about three hundred yards from here signed by giuliano with stiff hands she tore the paper into tiny pieces and put the dandolo dagger in her own bag then turned to the man who had come for her help me move him into the middle of the road somebody get a horse with any kind of cart as many of you as can climb into it and drive over the body just once over his neck so we can hide the wound go on quickly anna bent down forcing herself to grip gregorys body it was heavy it was hard work to drag it into the middle of the street where the traffic had worn the stones concave over the years the sweat broke out on her body yet she was shivering so violently that her teeth chattered she tried not to think of what she was doing only what it would cost giuliano if she failed and these people who had trusted her and would pay a terrible price to the authorities if it was thought to be murder when the task was completed in swaying jerking lantern light the women helped her find the place where gregory had been killed so that in daylight the blood would not make it obvious he had been moved they worked hard with lye and potash and brushes to get rid of every trace scrubbing swilling scraping between the stones by the time they were satisfied the man had returned with the cart drawn by a swaybacked horse he did not say where he had got it and no one asked it was a fearful job the horse was frightened by the smell of blood and death and it did everything it could to avoid treading on the corpse it had to be led talked to softly encouraged against its will in order to draw the wheels over gregorys neck and shoulders its not good enough anna told them staring at the mangled flesh and hideously exposed bone she could not leave it looking so obviously like a murder do it once more no one will believe it an accident if its clear the cart went over him several times they might accept that the horse was frightened and backed once be careful the cart began to move the man dragging at the halter of the reluctant animal which was sweating its flanks lathered its eyes rolling to the left she said urgently waving her arm more thats it now forward she forced herself to look the body looked terrible anyone seeing it would assume he had been knocked down and then dragged until the wheels finally went over him as the animal panicked she turned away thank you the man said his voice cracked with emotion ill take you back home you stay here clean the cart and the horses hooves do that very carefully or theyll find it if they look ill tell the authorities you called me to an accident she gulped again her head swimming its easy to explain dark night frightened horse a man returned from a long exile in alexandria who didnt know the venetian quarter well bad accident but they happen dont add to it she felt her stomach churning you found him you called me because you knew me you didnt see in the dark how bad it was she walked away quickly and as soon as she was around the corner she retched it took her several minutes before she was well enough to stand up and go on she was less than a mile from the house where giuliano lodged and he should have returned by now the time of his appointment with gregory was long past before she could report gregorys death to the night watch she must give giuliano back the dagger she reached the door he used at the side of the house and rapped on it hard there was no answer she tried again and waited she had tried a third time and was about to walk away but then she heard a brief noise and the door swung open to show light and the bulk of a man behind it giuliano she said urgently he pulled it wider his face stunned with surprise in the upward glow of the lantern anastasius whats happened you look terrible come in man he pulled the door wide are you hurt let me she had forgotten how filthy she was stained with dirt from the street and with gregorys blood im not hurt she said sharply close the door please he was standing in a nightshirt his hair tousled as if he had already been back in bed she felt her face burning she took the bloody dagger out of her bag and showed it to him gripping it by the handle but so that he could see the dandolo crest the blade was scarlet with bloodcongealing but not yet dry giulianos face went white he stared at her in horror i found it in the street a mile from here she told him beside the body of gregory vatatzes his throat had been torn out he started to speak but choked on the words she told him briefly how she had been sent for and what she had done theyll assume it was an accident clean your knife soak it until there isnt a smear of blood on it anywhere even in the crevices of the handle did you go to meet him yes giuliano said hoarsely having to clear his throat to force out the word he wasnt there thats my knife zoe chrysaphes gave it to me because it has the dandolo crest on it but it was stolen a couple of days ago zoe she said incredulously he still did not comprehend shes helping me to find my mothers sister who may still be alive thats why i went to meet gregory he wrote to me saying he had word of her he walked over toward a chest by the wall carrying the lantern with him so he could find the paper he held it out to her the light high for her to read it it was almost immaterial what it said it was zoes writing the slant of the letters was different from her usualbolder more masculinebut anna recognized the characteristic capitals she had seen zoes script often enough on letters and instructions lists of ingredients zoe chrysaphes she said softly her voice rasped with fury you fool she was shaking in spite of the effort to control herself shes byzantine to the soul and you are not only a venetian youre a dandolo you let her give you a dagger anyone would recognize where were your wits he stood frozen to the spot she closed her eyes please god no one will ask you but if they do stick to the truth that you were out someone may have seen you i shant tell you where it happened because you shouldnt know dont mention the dagger i think im the only one who really saw it just clean the damn thing without giving him more than a glance anna opened the door and went out into the corridor and then the street again quickly stumbling and shivering she hurried to the nearest watch point of the civil authority of the city thank heaven it was in the venetian quarter still and the watchmen had no willingness to consider it anything more than the accident it appeared to be and what were you doing there the watchman asked her i have several patients in the quarter she replied at that hour of night no sir i was just a physician they had consulted they knew that i would come the man was dead you say what could you do for him the man frowned at her nothing im afraid but they were very distressed especially the women they needed help treatment i see thank you she stayed only a little longer leaving her name and address for them to find her again if necessary then still shaking with horror and fear still wretched with nausea the sweat cold on her skin she began the long walk back up the hill homeward fiftytwo zoe was too excited to sleep when she returned to her house she took off her old womans rags and burned them in the hearth no one must see them especially soaked with blood as they were fortunately she had little of it on herself as if she had merely found herself having a restless night she sent for thomais and told her to heat water for her to bathe and to fetch towels carefully she chose her most precious luxurious oils and perfumes and unguents for her skin when the water was ready steam rising moist on the skin and sweet to the smell she stepped in slowly savoring the sensation the heat the gentle touch of it eased out all the tightknotted aches and fears she remembered with a pleasure made sharper by grief how gregory had wanted her tasted her slowly it was right that she had killed him physically violently facetoface that was how they had loved and hated poison was right for men like arsenios not for gregory she stood up when the water was cooling and noticed with amusement that thomais still looked at her with admiration in her eyes she dressed in fresh clothes and ordered fruit and a glass of wine alone in the silence of the end of night she stood in front of the window and watched the dawn pale in the east today she would go to the hagia sophia and offer up her thanks to the virgin mary she would give hundreds of candles make the whole place a glory of light gregory vatatzes and giuliano dandolo destroyed in one superb act and she was safe the dawn broadened thomais returned to say that the physician anastasius had called requesting to see her immediately what on earth could he want at this hour but since zoe was up and dressed anyway it was not an inconvenience send him in she ordered and bring more fruit and another glass a moment later anastasius came in his face ashen except for two high spots of color on his cheeks his hair was barely combed and he looked both exhausted and furious good morning anastasius zoe said may i offer you wine a little fruit gregory vatatzes is dead anastasius said in a hard thin voice i did not know he was ill zoe replied with perfect calm from your apparent distress i assume you attended him there was nothing to attend anastasius replied bitterly he was lying in a street in the venetian quarter his throat torn open with the dagger you gave to giuliano dandolo murdered zoe turned the word over on her tongue as if uncertain of it he must have had more enemies than he realized dandolo you said really i believe gregory spent some time in venice before going to alexandria perhaps it was a family feud i am sure it was anastasius agreed dandolo is a dangerous name to carry in constantinople with the history it has i would be surprised if you gave him such a gift he smiled with scalding irony his eyes brilliant the intelligence in them hard and probing with the hilt toward him that is a flash of humor lit zoes smile for an instant you think i should have presented it blade first i think you did anastasius retorted only he did not realize it zoe shrugged then it looks as if he too is a victim of this murder im sorry he is your friend i would not intentionally have had it so he is not a victim anastasius said the authorities have concluded that gregorys death was a tragic accident he was apparently struck by a horse and cart in the darkness of course and the unfamiliar streets and it tore his throat out zoe said incredulously was it the horse which did that or the cart anastasiuss face was unreadable it looks as if he was in the middle of the street and was knocked down the wheels of the cart went over gregorys throat at least that is what it looked like to me and the dandolo dagger zoe asked sarcastically was the horse carrying that as well or the driver perhaps that would have been someone else who left the scene anastasius said but since the dagger has disappeared it doesnt really matter no one else saw it and i daresay giuliano has it back by now and will take better care of it in future zoe had to control her eyes her mouth even the pallor in her face anastasius must see nothing she stood staring at him his blazing eyes the face so strong yet so unmasculine with its soft mouth passionate and vulnerable he could not be related to dandolo there was no resemblance dandolos mothers family perhaps there was no one of his generation except giuliano himself eudoxia had become a nun maddalena was dead love a physically immature eunuch with a man like dandolo then like lightning a wild idea cut across the darkness dazzling zoe with its obviousness and she began to laugh perfectly clear nowand yet impossible but she believed it anastasius was not a eunuch at allhe was as much a woman as zoe herself her love for dandolo was just the same love zoe would have had for him had she been the right age and he not a venetian or maybe even if he had been just not a dandolo anastasius or whatever her name was stood frozen to the floor staring zoe went on laughing this person who had been so sad and confusing as half a man was infinitely understandable as a woman finally zoe regained control of herself and walked over to the wine and the glasses she poured a glass to the brim and held it out offering it no thank you anastasius said coldly zoe shrugged and drank the glass halfempty herself then filled the other glass she offered the first glass again this time anastasius took it drank it to the lees then put it down and turned on her heel and walked out zoe drank her own glass slowly savoring it thinking she had learned something of delicious and immeasurable value the power it gave her over anastasiusno anastasiawas limitless but before she attempted to use it she would learn all she could about this woman who had chosen to deny herself the greatest natural asset she had what did she want that she would pay this terrible price for it zoes mind raced she had said she was from nicea but was that true probably only a fool created unnecessary lies the more zoe thought about it the more it intrigued her what passion was immense enough for such a masquerade anastasia was interested in justinian lascaris was zarides her true name or was she too a lascaris part of another imperial family wife of justinian if so she did not love him or she would not have so rashly risked her life to save the venetian beyond doubt she loved the venetian sister of justinian that was what zoe had glimpsed before a sister wanting to prove his innocence and was justinian innocent zoe had thought not but could she be wrong was there something else she had not guessed at the more zoe could learn about anastasia the better she would also learn more about giuliano dandolos mother and her life and death so she could twist the knife of pain in his heart anything that he could not disprove would do fiftythree a week after that anna returned home to find simonis waiting for her with a strip of paper in her hand from zoe chrysaphes simonis said pursing her lips thank you she put down her bag of herbs and oils and opened the paper anastasius unfortunately i have a slight wound in my leg which needs a surgeons attention please call on me immediately you receive this zoe chrysaphes when did this come anna asked less than an hour ago half an hour perhaps simonis raised her eyebrows are you going i am anna replied simonis knew perfectly well that ethically she could not do anything else nor would she easily survive the damage to her reputation were she to refuse what she found upon her arrival at zoes was the one thing anna had never considered giuliano was there leaning casually against the sill of the great window that looked across to the bosphorus he straightened up with slight discomfort when anna came in and she saw the flush on his cheeks he acknowledged her courteously with no shadow in his face from their last conversation or gregorys murder ah zoe said with clear pleasure thank you for coming anastasius i have a deep spelk in my leg i am afraid if it is not removed and treated it may poison me she pulled the hem of her goldcolored tunic higher and exposed an angry wound with a spelk of wood sticking out of it and a crust of dried blood around the edges when did it happen anna put her bag on the floor and bent to examine the leg i was walking in the courtyard last night zoe replied after dark it did not seem serious enough to call you then but this morning i realized the spelk was still there perhaps i should leave you giulianos voice came from behind anna the reluctance so sharp that he could not disguise it i can return on another occasion he moved away from the window not at all zoe dismissed the idea it is only my ankle it would be pleasanter for me to have company to take my mind off what anastasius must do please anna looked up and saw zoe smiling and inside her own mind she could hear her wild almost delirious laughter completely out of control the sound of it had haunted anna giuliano relaxed thank you zoe looked at anna again tell me what you need and i shall send my maid for it hot water bandages yes please anna tried to concentrate her attention on the wound and salt you are not one to put salt in anyones wounds are you anastasius zoe said lightly not so far anna replied but the thought has occurred to me once or twice the salt is to clean my knife when i use it and the ointment for the first layer of bandages it will be less painful if they do not cling to the flesh especially if it bleeds thomais brought the water in several dishes and the salt and a pile of clean linen bandages then zoe dismissed her she rested her leg on a stool leaving anna to work on it ignoring her and turned to giuliano i have learned a great deal more about maddalena agallon she said it softly dropping her voice as if in deep emotion and causing giuliano to move closer to her and into annas range of vision most of it concerns her life after she left her husband and her infant son zoes face was full of pain but it was impossible to tell if it was pity for that long ago abandoned child or from the prick of the blade in annas hand as she pierced the angry flesh around the spelk of wood why did she go giuliano forced the words from deep inside him zoe hesitated im sorry she said gently to giuliano ignoring the wound as if she could not even feel the blade it seems she did not want the responsibility of caring for a small boy she became bored with it she returned to the life she had had before but no decent man would have her how did she live giuliano asked his voice cracking anna looked up and saw zoes golden eyes looking back first at the knife then at anna directly there was triumph burning in her mind and anna read it as clearly as words she bent to the wound again blade poised cant you do it zoe asked no stomach for it anastasius anna saw her smile and the knowledge in it bright as a flame which turned her own stomach cold was it conceivable zoe had guessed she was a woman she looked down again and deliberately pushed the point of her knife into the flesh on the other side of the spelk saw the blood ooze and then flood she was tempted to push harder even to slice through an artery and watch it gush pumping as gregorys blood must have pouring life away zoe turned back to giuliano she turned to the streets as all women do when there is nothing else she said her voice filling the silence of the room especially beautiful women and she was beautiful anna turned the knife delicately lifted out the spelk and dropped it on one of the spare plates as beautiful as anastasius here would be zoe went on she had not even flinched if he were a woman and not a eunuch anna felt her face flame she could feel giulianos hurt as if the blade had gouged a living organ out of him she should not be here to witness this awful scene she looked up and met zoes eyes bright and hard as agate have i offended you anastasius zoe asked with mild interest it is not a bad thing to be beautiful you know she turned and looked across at giuliano then picked up a paper from the table beside her a letter from the mother abbess of santa teresa im sorry but you have to know this one day you have insisted on knowing maddalena ended her life a suicide so many women do who look to the street for their livelihood every vestige of blood drained from giulianos face anna spoke impulsively out of a passion to protect him nothing could undo the wound nothing could make him imagine she had not heard or seen his pain i suppose some are better at whoring than others she said looking zoe full in the face but even the most beautiful fade eventually the lips crease the breasts sag the thighs become lumpy the skin wrinkles and falls away lust becomes empty and then only love matters giuliano gasped swinging around to anna in amazement even taking a step toward her as if physically to protect her from zoes fury zoes eyes widened the little eunuch has teeth signor dandolo i do believe he likes you how grotesque the blood burned up giulianos cheeks and he turned away thank you for taking the trouble to find the information for me he said his voice choking i will leave you to your treatment he walked out of the room and they both heard the footsteps of his leather boots along the marbled corridor you are leaving me to bleed zoe remarked looking down at her ankle and foot now dripping scarlet onto the floor i thought you were a more honorable physician than that anastasius anna saw the gloating in zoes face this was vengeance on giuliano because of his greatgrandfather and on anna for loving a dandolo and she did love him it would be pointless now to deny it to herself it is good for it to bleed she said forming the words deliberately even though her voice shook it will carry away the poison the spelk may have left she picked up the knife again and touched the wound with the point of it pricking but no more deeply than she had to then it will be clean and i shall bind it several moments of silence went by this must be hard for you zoe said quietly anna smiled but not impossible i decide who i am you dont but you are right beauty can be dangerous it can give people delusions of being loved when in truth they are only consumed like a peach or a fig eirene vatatzes said that gregory liked figs zoes foot dripped blood onto the floor more rapidly making a little pool of scarlet i think it is ready to be bound up anna met zoes eyes and smiled i have just the ointment here to put on it it would be very serious if it were to become poisoned now when the flesh is so vulnerable a sudden shadow of fear crossed zoes face she leaned forward be careful she whispered your love for dandolo could cost you very dear even your life if my foot does not heal you will regret it anna smiled at her even more widely her eyes ice cold there is nothing wrong with it that removing the spelk did not cure you were wise enough not to pick a poisonous wood the surprise flashed in zoes eyes for only an instant i would not like to destroy you she said casually dont oblige me to do so fiftyfour giuliano left zoes house and walked out into the broad open street barely seeing where he was going the pain seemed so huge it threatened to tear through his skin from the inside and overwhelm him he was filled with shame and the knowledge that this woman he could just remembera lovely face tears warmth and a sweet smellnot only had not loved him enough to keep him but had descended to that most despicable of trades he had seldom used whores himself he was handsome and charming and had had no need to he shivered with a new revulsion at himself when he remembered the times he had he barely saw the street around him other people were so many blurs of color and movement he felt sick cold to the very pit of his belly and shivering thank god at least his father had never known that maddalena had died by her own hand beyond the reach of the church even in death he crossed the busy street traffic stopping drivers of carts shouting at him but their words did not penetrate his mind he went on down the steep incline toward the venetian quarter by the shore she had borne him carried him within her body and given him life he hated her for what she had become yet he had learned love at his fathers knee at his side her name had been the last word he spoke what was giuliano if he denied her now damn zoe chrysaphesdamn her to a hell of pain that would last all life longas his would anastasius had been extraordinary he was a true friend first rescuing him from being blamed for gregory vatatzess murder which he deserved for stupidity if nothing else and then defending him against zoe both times it had been at risk to himself giuliano was realizing now just how great a risk and anastasius had asked for nothing in return still giuliano could not bear to be with anastasius again after this he was the one person who had seen and heard and he would never be able to forget it even if only in anger at zoe or in pity it was the pity that hurt the deepest after stopping at his lodging he went along to the busy dockyards looking for any venetian ship in the harbor there were two the first was a merchantman bound for caesarea the second just berthed and due out to venice again within the week giuliano dandolo on the doges business he introduced himself i seek passage home to report to the doge as soon as possible excellent the captain said enthusiastically a little earlier than i expected but excellent all the same welcome aboard boito will be delighted you may use my cabin you will not be interrupted giuliano had no idea what the man was speaking about boito he said slowly searching for meaning in it the doges emissary the captain replied he has letters for you and no doubt other things too complex or too secret to commit to paper i was not aware he had even sent word to you yet but he said it would be today as soon as possible come ill take you in the cramped but wellfurnished cabin that was the captains domain giuliano found himself sitting opposite a narrowfaced handsome man in his early fifties who produced letters of authority from the doge he thanked the captain and asked permission to be uninterrupted until he and giuliano had finished their business as soon as the door closed boito looked gravely at giuliano i have seen you before i served doge tiepolo you must have news to have sought me even before i sent you word i was here tell me about the venetian quarter of the city giuliano had done his job spoken casually to all the major families in the quarter and perhaps more tellingly listened to the younger men talking in the caf√©s and bars along the waterfront and in the street where the best food was served from the stalls they had been born in byzantine territory their loyalties were torn those who still have family in venice will probably remain loyal to us he said carefully and the younger ones boito said impatiently most of them are byzantine now they have never been to venice some of them are married to byzantines they have homes and business here there is always the chance that if loyalty to venice did not move them faith in the church of rome might boito breathed out very slowly and his shoulders eased so slightly that it was visible only in the smallest alteration of the way the creases in his coat changed a fraction and you think that faith will not hold them i doubt it he answered boito frowned i see and what is the likelihood of constantinople accepting the union with the church of rome i know some of the monasteries and maybe most of the outlying towns perhaps all of nicea will refuse there are even members of the imperial family imprisoned for refusing giuliano was venetian that was where his loyalties must be and he had promised tiepolo the thought of his byzantine mother was too bitter even to touch the friends he had made here were mostly venetian anyway constantinople was zoe chrysaphes and people like her except anastasius but you could not distort the fate of nations or the course of a crusade on the friendship of one person however passionate generous or vulnerable yet anastasius had not hesitated to risk his life to save giuliano from prosecution for the murder of gregory in fact he had not even asked giuliano if he were guilty and he had been willing to fight zoe in a way for which she would never forgive him how does a man honor debts to two opposing forces they need more time giuliano answered dragging his mind back to the moment and this small woodenwalled cabin so like all the others he had sailed in give it to them and they may see the wisdom of it they need to feel that they are not betraying the faith they understand you cannot expect a man to deny his god and then be loyal to you boito made a steeple of his long thin fingers and regarded giuliano thoughtfully there is little time to give them whether we wish it or not the doge is certain that charles of anjou is already making plans that will considerably further his ambition to rule all the eastern mediterranean including those areas of trade and influence which belong rightfully to venice im sure you dont wish to see that happen giuliano was startled but byzantium wont stop charles because it cant they are subtle and wise and cruel but their power is waning their strength is exhausted the sack of devastated them and they have not yet recovered boito sat in silence his hooded eyes distant finally he smiled knowledge is what we need at this point the doge must know exactly what obstacles lie in the way of the king of the two sicilies and his ambition to be king of jerusalem also his expression was enigmatic he did not say whether it was to remove the obstacles or to strengthen them giuliano had a strong impression it might be the latter to be specific boito continued the doge must know the military situation in palestine and what an intelligent man would predict for the future say the next three or four years giuliano turned it over in his mind it was knowledge of the most intense importance perhaps to the whole of christendom and the future of the world if charles conquered the holy land and united the five ancient patriarchates it would be the most powerful kingdom in the west i see that you understand boito said with an easing of his smile into warmth i suggest you go by the safest route possible and the most inconspicuous that would be from here down the coast of palestine to acre and then make your way inland there are always pilgrims attach yourself to one of their groups and you will pass initially unnoticed when you return you will report to the doge himself no one else is that clear of course the doge needs eyes and ears that he can trust as you love and owe the city of your heritage dandolo the city that has given you hope and honor give her your service now for the sake of the future yes i will there was no other possible answer apart from anything else giuliano had promised tiepolo fiftyfive anna stood in her herb room mixing ointments and distilling tinctures in each of the little wooden drawers of powders she kept one whole leaf of each type so she would not mistake what it was she had watched giuliano go from zoes house almost blind with the pain of what she had told him and anna had known also that her own presence there had made it doubly agonizing for him she did not expect to see him again in the next few weeks or perhaps even months that hurt her with a persistent ache like a hunger but she knew of no way to heal it zoes extraordinary admissions when she had been feverish made her certain beyond doubt they had planned to kill michael palaeologus and for bessarion to usurp the throne and then deny the union and rally the country behind him to save the orthodox church from rome but how had they thought to withstand the crusader armies or had they not even considered that were they so steeped in religious fervor that they believed the virgin mary would save them justinian had been levelheaded in nicea selfmocking at times he had far too sharp a sense of wit and of the ironies of life to trust a man like bessarion without knowing exactly what he meant to do and how she stood with the leaves in her hand breathing in their aromatic perfume trying to steady her racing mind how had justinian discovered the plot or had he been part of it from the beginning then how had he taken so long to realize it could not work she looked at the astrolabe on the table with its beautiful inlays and circles orbits within orbits was the plot like that or far simpler a desperate agreement by all of them albeit from different priorities bessarion for faith and perhapswhether he recognized it or notfor ambition and glory for himself the old power returned to his family helena quite simply for power she had the honesty or perhaps the lack of conscience that she had never pretended faith of esaias she still knew little others had spoken of him as shallow but that did not have to be true knowledge of the plot made her realize everyone might be utterly different from the character they had presented for the purpose of achieving that one overriding aim she had finished putting away the herbs and began pouring the tinctures into vials and labeling them antoninus might have been exactly what he now seemed a man loyal to the church even at the cost of his own life a good friend to justinian acknowledging his part in it after torture and only when it was pointless to deny it but he had joined with justinian to kill not michael in order to save the church but bessarion and for what to save byzantium because bessarion had neither the grasp of reality nor the nerve to do as michael palaeologus was doing and make the only peace possible justinian had been devoutly against the union from the beginning his allegiance to constantine was witness to that and constantines loyalty to him in return was that not one passion that could be trusted she stopped working and began to wash her mortar pestle and dishes then put them away justinian was the first as an outsider to see bessarions weaknesses as well as his dreams and to realize that far from saving constantinople he would seal its fate she tried to imagine how he must have felt as the evidence forced itself upon him and little by little he understood that bessarion must not be allowed to take the throne if justinian withdrew from the plan demetrios would simply take his place bessarion must be stopped he could have gone to him and tried to persuade him more and more forcefully as bessarion resisted the quarrels had become deeper in momentary desperation he had gone to others even to eirene but not to zoe why had justinian and she not allied to serve the common cause the only one justinian had trusted was antoninus who in the end had gone to his death tortured and alone then who had betrayed justinian to the authorities if bessarion had lived the plot would have gone ahead the next evening they would have attempted to kill the emperor zoe had the courage and the skill to do it whatever bessarions failings but had zoe honestly believed that bessarion had the courage and the fire to save both the city from the latins and the church from rome and would bessarion have obeyed her or was his arrogance such that once on the throne he would have defied all advice especially from a woman how had she imagined she could manipulate him because she had more political intelligence than he and more realism or more allies perhaps knowledge of michaels network of spies and agents of violence information and deceit then he could keep his hands clean and still reap the benefits perhaps zoe would have allowed bessarion to take the throne and then helped demetrios vatatzes to usurp bessarion or was that eirenes plan justinian had prevented any of it from happening if he had killed bessarion then far from being a conspirator against the emperor he had saved his life had michael known that had nicephoras and a cold and ugly thought had constantine allowed justinian to be blamed as an act of revenge for his change of allegiance his understanding of reality fiftysix anna chose her time with care from her many visits to the blachernae she was familiar with nicephorass routine she went when she knew he would be alone and undisturbed unless there was some crisis she was uncharacteristically nervous climbing the palace steps although she was now wellknown having attended most of the eunuchs at one time or another she passed the broken statues the dark stains of fire the passages blocked with rubble because the fabric of the building was dangerous perhaps michael kept it this way so that neither he nor his servants would ever forget what being faithful to orthodoxy cost she found nicephoras in his usual room open onto the courtyard his servant went ahead and whispered that anastasius had come and a moment later she was shown in instantly she saw both the tiredness in his face and the sudden lift of pleasure at the sight of her we are not falling ill often enough it seems a long time since you have been here what brings you i have not heard of anyone needing your help it is i who need yours anna replied but perhaps i can offer something in return you look weary he gave a little shake of his head anna was aware of the loneliness within him the hunger to speak of things deeper in the heart than policy or the realities of diplomacy that vase is new she observed looking at a smoothly curved bowl sitting on one of the tables to the side alabaster yes he said quickly his face brightening do you like it its perfect she replied its as simple as the moon as as complete in itself unconcerned with admiration i like that he said quickly you are quite right many things try too hard you hear the artists voice crying through the work for your attention this has the supreme confidence of knowing exactly what it is thank you i shall like it even more from now on do i interrupt you reading she asked seeing the manuscript on his desk ah yes i was it is about england and i daresay it would be considered highly seditious here but it is extraordinarily interesting his eyes were bright watching her face carefully she was surprised england to her it meant only a barbarism beyond even the french and she said as much i thought so too he admitted but they wrote a great charter in different from our laws of justinian because they were created by the barons the aristocracy and forced upon the king whereas ours were codified by the emperor nevertheless some of their provisions are interesting she feigned interest for his sake really his enthusiasm was too keen to be dampened by her lack of it my favorite is the dictum that justice delayed is justice denied do you not like that yes i do she said to please him then realized how profoundly she meant it very much it is certainly true is that what you were reading no much more recent actually have you heard of simon de montfort the earl of leicester no she hoped this was not going to be long is he one of the barons who forced this charter no he turned the manuscript facedown deliberately but you have come about something in particular i see it in your face the murder of bessarion again you know me too well she confessed then felt as if with the words she had betrayed him he knew nothing at all of her in reality she could not meet his eyes and was surprised how much that hurt she had planned in her mind exactly what to say practicing the details what is it he asked she plunged in all her careful rehearsal abandoned i believe there was a plot to assassinate the emperor and for bessarion to take his place in order to save the church from union with rome whoever killed bessarion prevented that from happening it was an act of loyalty not treason they should not have been punished for it his face was filled with a sadness she did not understand who were the conspirators apart from justinian and antoninus she said nothing she could not prove it and in spite of what they had planned to do it seemed such a betrayal to tell him he would have to act they would be arrested tortured horrible pictures filled her imagination zoe stripped humiliated her body mocked and perhaps touched with fire again and she could not prove it anyway i did not think you would tell me nicephoras said i might have been disappointed if you had justinian would not either nor antoninus his voice dropped even lower and was rough with pain even under torture she stared at him new terror gripping her like a clenched fist inside her stomach tightening is he she forced the words out between dry lips she remembered john lascariss blind face justinian it was almost more than she could bear we did not maim him perhaps without meaning to nicephoras was taking part of the blame himself he was the emperors man justinian could not tell us that they wouldnt try again can you she thought about it struggling twisting this way and that in her mind finding no escape no she said at last what is justinian lascaris to you that you risk so much to save him he asked she felt the blood hot in her face we are related closely he said in little more than a whisper brother husband it was as if time stopped frozen between one heartbeat and the next he knew it was perfectly clear in his face to deny it would be idiotic he waited his eyes so gentle that it made the tears spill over onto her cheeks for the shame of her deceit would he think her disguise mocked him she kept her eyes down unable to look at him and hating herself my twin she whispered anastasia lascaris anna she corrected him as if that tiny piece of honesty mattered zarides now im a widow whoever the other conspirators are they are still dangerous he warned i believe you know who they are one of them betrayed justinian i dont know which and if i did i would not tell you for your own sake they would betray you just as quickly i know the words caught in her throat thank you by the way you should lengthen your stride a little you still take short steps like a woman otherwise you are pretty good she nodded unable to speak then turned slowly and walked away her mind numb finding it hard to keep her balance she would have to correct her walk some other time fiftyseven a week later anna had just seen her last patient of the morning and was standing in the kitchen when leo brought her a letter from zoe chrysaphes dear anastasia i have just received news of a most important matter concerning the true faith which we both espouse i need to inform you of the details as soon as possible please regard this as urgent and call upon me today zoe the blurred writing of her name using the feminine rather than masculine was a veiled reminder to anna of zoes power over her she dared not refuse there was no decision to make i have to call on zoe chrysaphes she did not want to frighten leo by telling him that zoe knew her secret it is something to do with the church it should be interesting but interest was the emotion furthest from her mind when she was shown into zoes room the fear and the loss in their previous encounter seemed to close in on her as if she could never escape it she felt as though giuliano must be just out of the line of her sight and any moment he would move and she would see the pain in his face zoe came forward superbly head high back straight the deep bluegray silk of her tunic swirled around her ankles unbroken by gold ornament simple as the dusk sky thank you for coming so quickly she said i have remarkable news but before i tell you i must swear you to secrecy a promise to me is little promise to mary the mother of god that you will betray this secret to no one i charge you her golden eyes blazed with a sudden flare of passion anna was astonished and if i will not do that we need not consider it zoe replied her smile not wavering because you will betrayal of secrets can be a most painful thing the outcome can even kill but you know that give me your promise anna felt her face burn she had walked directly into the trap i will promise mary the mother of god she said with a faint echo of sarcasm good zoe responded immediately and most appropriate everyone knows that the venetians stole the shroud of christ from the hagia sophia and also a nail from the true cross it is the most holy relic on earth and only god knows where it is now probably in venice or maybe rome theyre all thieves she tried to keep the fury from her voice and failed and the crown of thorns she added but i have word out of jerusalem of another relic nearly as good it has just come to light after more than twelve hundred years anna tried not to care she should never forget that above all zoe was a creature of revenge and deception only a fool would trust her yet she found herself asking almost holding her breath for the answer zoes smile widened the portrait of the mother of god painted by st luke she whispered imagine it he was a physician like you and an artist he saw her just as you and i can see each other her voice was husky with excitement perhaps she was older but all the passion and the grief would be there in her face her eyes were alight with wonder maryas an old woman who had given birth to the son of god and stood at the foot of the cross at his death helpless to save him mary who knew he was risen not by faith or belief or the sermons of priests but because she had seen him where is this painting anna asked who has it how do you know it is genuine there are more pieces of the true cross sold to pilgrims than would furnish a forest its existence has been confirmed zoe said calmly seeing victory why do you tell me she dreaded the answer zoes eyes were unblinking because i wish you to go to jerusalem and purchase it for me of course dont pretend to be stupid anastasia naturally i will provide the money when you return with the picture i shall give it to the emperor and once again byzantium will have one of the great relics of christendom she is our patron saint our guardian and our advocate with god she will protect us from rome whether it is the violence of the crusaders or the corruption of popes anna was stunned another thought occurred to her zoe had said it was to give to the emperor not the church did michael know perfectly well that it was zoe who had been going to kill him and this was a bargain for her freedom even her life aloud she asked why me i know nothing of paintings zoe looked deeply satisfied i trust you she said smoothly you will not betray me because to do so you would have to betray yourself and justinian do not forget how well i know you i cant travel alone to jerusalem anna pointed out although now her heart was racing at the thought jerusalemso near sinai she might see justinian did zoe think of that too still less could i return without an armed guard if i am carrying a relic like that she added i dont expect you to zoe gazed out of the window at the fading light of the sky i have already made inquiries as to your passage and arranged it where you will be perfectly safe except of course from the rigors of a voyage but that is inescapable she was smiling there is a ship chartered and commanded by a venetian about to leave constantinople for acre and then its captain with suitable guard i imagine will make his way to jerusalem they are willing for a consideration which i will pay to allow you to accompany them the captain will be aware of your purpose but no one else a venetian anna was appalled theyll let me get the painting then steal it probably throw me overboard and youll never see the painting again not this captain zoe said with secret amusement he is giuliano dandolo i have told him only that it is the picture of a byzantine madonna posed for by a merchants daughter perhaps his mother you would be wise not to tell him differently anna stood rigid and if i refuse she stammered then i shall no longer feel bound to be discreet about your identity to the emperor the church or to dandolo be sure that that is what you want before you provoke it to happen ill go she said quietly zoe smiled of course you will she picked up a package lying on the table at her side and held it out to anna here is the money and your instructions a letter of safe conduct for you with the emperors signature godspeed and may the blessed virgin protect you she crossed herself piously at the teeming dockside anna came to a threemasted venetian round ship with lateen sails and a high stern it was broadbeamed hence the name and she judged it to be at least fifty paces from end to end she made inquiries of the sailor at the bottom of the gangway stating her name and zoes and was permitted to board she found giuliano on deck he was dressed in a leather coat and britches nothing like the courtly tunic and robes hed worn in the city suddenly he looked venetian and alien captain dandolo she said firmly whatever the cost there was nowhere to retreat zoe chrysaphes told me that you had agreed to take me as passenger on your voyage to acre and then afterward to jerusalem with you she said she had paid you the price you considered fair annas voice was cold with the tension that knotted inside her he turned around slowly surprise in his face then a quick flame of recognition suffocated the moment after by memory of the last time they had met anastasius zarides his voice was quiet not audible twelve feet away where sailors were working on the ropes and rigging yes zoe made arrangements for a passenger she did not say it would be you his face darkened since when were you her servant since she has the power to hurt me she replied not flinching from his gaze but the commission on which she sends me is good to bring back a picture which belongs in constantinople a picture did she tell you of whom anna longed to be able to answer him honestly lying was like deliberately staking out a space between them but the gulf was there already a byzantine lady of good family she answered but apparently the victim of some tragedy or other why does zoe care do you think i asked her she said with an attempt at light sarcasm i think you might have guessed he replied she was not sure if there was gentleness in his voice or sadness now it was her turn to look away over the choppy waters of the harbor i think it is a picture she wants because it will give her power she answered but it could be merely one whose beauty she likes she has a passion for beauty ive seen her stare at the sunset till the sight of it should be printed on her soul she has a soul he said with sudden bitterness surely a soul twisted is far worse than no soul at all she asked it is the loss of what could have been which tortures the fact that something was within your reach and you let it slip away i dont think hell is fire and torn flesh and the smell of sulfur choking you i think it is the taste of heaven rememberedand lost god preserve us anastasius giuliano exclaimed where on earth do you come up with things like that he put his hand on her back swiftly in a companionable gesture far from a caress a moment later he took it away and it was as if she had lost the warmth of the sun on her youd better come to jerusalem with us and get this picture for zoe he said cheerfully we sail tomorrow morning but i daresay you know that he gave a brief laugh but the smile remained in his eyes weve never had a ships physician before fiftyeight anna stood at the railing of the ship in the late afternoon sun it was already low on the horizon the wind was cold on her face and the sharp salt air filled her lungs they were several days out of constantinople having sailed through the sea of marmara and into the mediterranean and she had begun to find the pitch and slight roll of the deck more natural she had even grown accustomed to the seamans britches she had been lent a tunic and dalmatica being awkward garments in which to climb steps and move easily in narrow spaces there was no room to hold on to skirts and they were more immodest than she had previously considered giuliano had suggested the change and after a few hours she had found it agreeable giuliano was busy most of the time it took all his skill to command men he knew little and to work south at this time of the year against the current sweeping up from egypt past palestine and then westward even when they were with the wind they still had to tack and veer precisely she heard his footsteps across the deck behind her she did not need to turn to know it was he where are we she asked as he stepped beside her he pointed rhodes is there ahead of us cyprus over there farther to the south and east and jerusalem she asked farther still alexandrias that way he swung around and extended his arm south rome there to the west venice is to the north of that this was the first time they had had more than a few moments in which to talk without being overheard by the crew zoe and the death of gregory crowded her mind but she did not want to say anything that would tear scabs off the wounds and prevent the fragile healing she thought of the great rock that was reputed to guard the other end of the mediterranean from the ocean which as far as anyone knew stretched out to the edge of the world have you been out through the gates of hercules into the atlantic she asked her imagination fired at the thought not yet one day id like to he narrowed his eyes against the sun smiling if you could go anywhere at all where would you choose she was taken by surprise her mind raced she did not want to talk about old dreams that did not matter anymore venice is it very beautiful she wanted to hear the urgency and the tenderness in his voice he smiled indulging her its like nowhere else he answered so beautiful you think it must be a city of dreams an idea floating on the face of the water touching it would be like trying to catch moonlight with a net and yet it is as real as marble and blood and as brutal as betrayal there were passion and regret in his eyes it has the ephemeral loveliness of music in the night and yet it stays in the mind as great visions do coming back again and again just when you think it has finally left you in peace he looked at the darkening horizon but i dont think i could forget byzantium either now it is subtle wounded more tolerant than the west and perhaps wiser he drew in a deep breath and let it out slowly the wind was rising from the north whitening the wave crests as the current buffeted them anna waited for him to speak happy in the sounds of the water and the creaking of wood i know we want to retake jerusalem for christianity he went on but i wonder if weve thought beyond that to the cost he gave a hard little laugh we sacrifice byzantium to gain jerusalemand lose the world i dont know but ive got a decent red wine venetian of course she interrupted lightly tearing the thread of tension that was tightening inside herself he laughed of course come and well share it over dinner ships rations but not bad he spoke easily without hesitation banishing thought for anything beyond the moment she accepted rising to her feet and having to steady herself to the slight pitch of the deck it was a good meal although she was barely aware of what she ate or of anything beyond the sweetness and the fire of the wine they spoke easily of all manner of things places they had been to people they had met or known he described the funny and the absurd with pleasure and she noticed without cruelty the more she listened to him the more irrevocably she felt bound to the good in him and the less could she ever tell him the truth he saw her as a man but one from whom he need fear no rivalry she knew that something of his gentleness with her was because he was a whole man able to taste the physical pleasures of life in a way anastasius never would and she was startled by the delicacy he exercised in never overtly mentioning such things she left at about two in the morning when duty called him up to the deck because the weather was worsening she had drunk more wine than usual and she felt so close to weeping as she closed the door of her own cabin that the tears actually spilled over her cheeks hot and painful had she been less exhausted she might have given in and sobbed until she had nothing left inside her but when would she stop what end was there except to treasure friendship or laughter trust tolerance and the will to share she would not sacrifice that for some momentary indulgence in selfpity or grief for what she herself had closed the door against the following day the weather was bad a storm driving down from the north forcing them to stand farther out than they would otherwise giuliano was fully occupied with navigation and keeping the ship from drifting onto the dangerous troughs where she could lose sails or even a mast the next time they spoke it was the morning watch as dawn was rising from the east where cyprus lay far beyond view the sea was calm and there was a slight breeze smelling sweet and exquisitely clean the pale light barely tipping the crests of the water too delicate to be touched with foam in the silence they could have been the first humans to see the earth or breathe its air for a long time they stood at the rail almost a yard apart staring across at the radiance spreading over the sky melting the shadows between one wave and another she did not need to look at him she was certain his thoughts were also filled by the enormity of it it was not frightening to be alone on the oceans face in fact there was a curious comfort in it on other occasions snatched in moments here or there she and giuliano spoke of memories experiences good and bad sometimes matching tall stories she pulled many from the tales her father had told her that she could identify with well enough at times when she was embroidering rather a lot he would realize it and they laughed together it was a joke with no ill will she had no need to explain her inventions one night when they were on deck watching the sun sink squandering fire beyond the black outline of cyprus the wind cold in their faces the conversation turned toward religion and the union with rome pride and history apart he said seriously is separation from rome really worth dying for do you think it is he was direct a personal question not a general one she stared at the fading light changing even as she watched no two sunsets were ever the same i dont know im not sure how much i am prepared to have anyone else tell me what to think but i also know for certain that i am not prepared to demand anyone else sacrifice their lives or the lives of those they love because im certain of the differences between the roman and byzantine faiths maybe any church can only take us so far provide a framework in which we can climb far enough to see just how much farther there is to go and that the journey is infinitely worth it sooner or later we outgrow it and it becomes a shackle to the spirit then how do we do the rest there was no banter in his voice she could hardly see the outline of his head and shoulders against the darkness of the sky but she felt the warmth of him near her maybe we have to want it with such a passion of hunger that no one can hold us back from reaching it she said quietly we cannot be led or commanded we must labor with our own strength seeing with the light of the mind even if its only a short space ahead thats enough thats hard he let out his breath slowly i would like to believe it difficult and lonely as it sounds your heaven would be worth looking for and creating out of my own mistakes building out of forgiveness and seeking in every new place he leaned back a little and looked up at the sky we had better weave some ladders anastasius fiftynine after calling at famagusta in the east of cyprus they sailed through rough weather tacking across the wind coming about hard the huge lateen sails were heavy creaking as they fell slack then filled and billowed out again every time she marveled at the skill of the men her hands clenching as she saw the precise judgment and timing and knew how easily a mast could break they worked their way steadily south along the coast of palestine putting ashore at tyre then at sidon and finally at acre a wide busy seaport it spread out from the high magnificent old crusader walls into trading quarterspisan genoese and of course venetianquays busy water dotted with ships this was the gateway to the holy land and the beginning of the sixto tenday journey overland to jerusalem anna stayed on the ship while giuliano went ashore ostensibly to see to unloading his cargo and obtaining another shipment for the return journey she stood on the deck looking at the sunbleached land pale docks and landing piers above glittering bright water she realized sharply that giuliano would be judging it all with a military eye as had generations of men before him from the far christian corners of the world thinking to conquer itfor what for god for christ some perhaps more probably for glory it was a land of milk and honey perhaps but also of blood on the third day she and giuliano went ashore he had sent the ship off down the coast with cargo to return in two months time when he and anastasius would meet them here again if they were late then his men would obtain the best cargo they could and wait they were dressed in the recognized costume for pilgrims a gray cowl scrip and scarf a red cross on the shoulder a broad belt to which was attached a rosary and a water bottle they each wore a broadbrimmed hat turned up at the front and carried over their shoulders a sack and a gourd anna also had a small case of medical supplies a knife needle and silk a few herbs and a pot of unguent she felt untidy anonymous and uncomfortable she was glad there was no glass in which to see herself she looked at giuliano at a glance he seemed like anyone else gray one of scores of travelers weary footsore and a little crazy a light in the eyes and repetitive songs on the lips but when he moved he still had the easy gait the slight swagger of the mariner she would have liked to stay in acre for longer to walk through the streets of this last stronghold of the christian kingdom of jerusalem and see where the men of the past crusaders knights kings and even queens had lived but she knew there was no time we must join with others she urged we need guides ahead of us he pointed we leave in just over an hour itll be hard and cold this time of year they formed a group of about twenty pilgrims most of them dressed in gray as anna and giuliano were more than half of them were men but anna was surprised how many women there wereat least six one old woman with a windburned face and gnarled hands clutched the staff she used to support herself she never stopped muttering the names of all the holy places she had been to like an incantation canterbury walsingham lourdes compostela and now the greatest of all jerusalem they all had the pallor of a long sea voyage cramped in ships that gave them barely enough room to lie down and no privacy at all a soldier appeared to be the natural leader and it was he who stepped forward to speak to the darkskinned arab who offered to guide them he was a small fiercelooking man with hawklike features and broken teeth anna did not understand the words but the meaning was clear they were haggling over price and conditions voices grew louder the arab professed astonishment the soldier insisted there was a flurry of abuse on both sides the soldier would not yield his position and finally there were smiles everyone contributed their money they set out at midday walking steadily anna did not want to grow close to any of the other pilgrims since she must always guard her identity she was in the strange position of being neither man nor woman but she could not help looking at them with interest and now and then overhearing their conversation most of them had come by sea from venice which was the meeting place for pilgrims from other parts of europe thousands of them giuliano told her when they made a brief stop the money changers on the rialto make a fortune thats mostly what theyre complaining about he indicated a group of the others a few yards away and the sea journey it was rough and theyre terribly cramped it takes a lot of faith to come she said with respect or nothing much to leave behind he added then he saw her face sorry but thats the truth too if they survive and get home again they can wear the palm in their hats for the rest of their lives its a badge of honor theyll be forgiven all sins and respected by family neighbors and friends and they will have earned it he saw her puzzlement how do i know im a venetian ive seen them all my life coming and going full of hope piety pride he bit his lip we let them all in sell them real holy relics and false ones give them hospitality guidance advice passage to acre or jaffa and fleece them of most of their money she pushed her hand through her hair which was dusty already and smiled at him it was an admission he had made describing the venal side of his city as well as the clever and the beautiful he did not say he was ashamed but she knew it anna was not used to walking all day her feet became blistered and her back and legs ached until she was filled with an allconsuming weariness she was bitterly aware that giuliano had so much more strength than she and she dared not allow him to help her even when he offered with real concern by the first nightfall they stopped at an inn she was overwhelmingly relieved just to sit down and it was only after they had all eaten around one large wooden board that she realized she was also glad of the warmth it was far colder outside than she had expected and the pilgrims gray cloak was not as warm as her own woolen dalmatica would have been over the next days she forced herself to walk on even when her feet bled she found herself so weak that she staggered more often losing her balance and stumbling but always she rose again she insisted on privacy for bodily functions but as a eunuch that was granted her even if for quite mistaken reasons no one wished to embarrass her for the organs they rightly assumed she did not have they all suffered the same blisters the cold from the wind and rain the rough road under their feet the ache in the bones from nights on hard boards and with too little sleep the land was hard built of rock and dust and the few trees were windgnarled there were long stretches where there was no water at all except what they carried with them the rain was cold and made mud of the track underfoot but it was still welcome on the parched skin she tried not to look at giuliano she knew exactly why the doge had sent someone not only to sail to acre but to walk this route as the crusader army would have to walk it he would be looking at the fortifications of jerusalem also with a soldiers eyes seeing their strengths and weaknesses whatever had changed since western knights and squires were last here venices full profit would depend on the degree of their success she did not want to know if that thought was as sour to him as it was to her he was venetian he must see it differently she thought of the first roman soldiers marching in their legions to conquer the troublesome jews could even the boldest of them have imagined one man from judea would change the world forever over a thousand years later the road was worn smooth with people summer and winter who believed that in some way they were following in christs footsteps were they in any way that mattered without having intended to she looked quickly at giuliano and found his eyes steady on hers he smiled and there was an intense gentleness in him for a terrible instant she thought he understood the real nature of her physical weakness then she realized it was the confusion he read in her that moved him anna smiled back and was surprised how lifted her spirits were just to know he was there sixty five days later they reached the crest of the slope legs aching bodies weary they had climbed almost three hundred feet since leaving acre there before them lay jerusalem spread out over the hills all light and shadow the sunfacing walls were blistered white punctured by alleys like dark knife cuts winding and impenetrable the rooftops were flat with here and there the smooth arc of a dome or the sudden steep sides of a tower there were few trees mostly the silver gray of olives or the dark irregularity of date palms the huge crenellated outer walls were unbroken except for the great gates now open and crowded by little antlike figures coming and going tiny spots of color anna stood beside giuliano and stared in spite of herself gasping with amazement she looked at him quickly and saw the same wonder in his eyes the arab signaled impatiently and they began to move forward toward the jaffa gate where pilgrims entered as they came closer the walls became enormous and pockmarked by time and erosion and the violence of siege the gate itself was vast like half a castle men crowded outside it darkeyed bearded robes dusty from the ever creeping sand they talked gesticulating with their hands arguing haggling over an opinion or a price a group of children played some game with small stones throwing them up and catching them on the backs of their thin brown hands making complicated patterns a woman was beating a carpet a cloud of dust rising it was all so ordinarydaily life and a moment in eternity then reality engulfed them again there was money to pay directions to ask and accommodations to find before nightfall anna said goodbye to her traveling companions with real regret they had shared too many simple physical hardships for parting to be easy the safety of the journey was over the danger of being too close of betraying emotion or physical weakness was past at least for the time being a different kind of loneliness was beginning they secured rooms at a hostelry the first night anna could barely sleep tired as she was the night was cold and the darkness full of strange noises and totally different odors from the ones she was accustomed to the voices she heard were arabic hebrew and others she could not place there was a mustiness in the air of closed streets of animals and of the dry bitter smell of unfamiliar herbs it was not unpleasant but it left her feeling alien and uneasy she read again and again her instructions from zoe she must find a jew by the name of simcha ben ehud he knew where the painting was and would verify it although zoe had given instructions for anna to look at it minutely also the description was exact she dared not fail not for an instant did she doubt that zoe would take the first chance she had to use her power to destroy once she had the painting she might well do it anyway anna had been naive to imagine she would be able to hand it over and walk away safe because zoe had promised between now and then she would have to think of some weapon for her own use zoe had no respect for mercy after she had the picture she would have time to think of justinian and find a way to travel to the monastery in sinai in the morning she and giuliano ate breakfast together they had grown accustomed to dates and a little coarse bread be careful he warned as they parted in the street he was on his way to study first the warren of alleys the halfhidden waterways of underground rivers and springs a desert city lives or dies on its water as does any army besieging it i will she said quietly zoe gave me the name of the man to ask for and a story as to why i want the picture and i know what it is supposed to look like you be careful too examining fortifications isnt a good thing to be caught doing either im not he said quickly im a pilgrim praying in every place christ walked just like all the others she smiled at him then turned away quickly and went without looking back her feet felt bruised on the uneven pavement her shoulders bumped one moment against other people the next against the protruding walls as the alley became narrower then suddenly there were steps and she was climbing down she began in the jewish quarter at the address she had been given by zoe simcha ben ehud she asked several local shopkeepers they all shook their heads she tried day after day growing afraid that she was drawing attention to herself one morning when she had been in jerusalem a little over three weeks anna was walking up a narrow flight of steps legs aching muscles so weary that she was consumed in the concentration of forcing one foot after the other she almost collided with a man coming in the opposite direction she apologized and was about to move on when he caught her by the shoulder her first instinct was to fight then he spoke to her quietly with his mouth almost to her ear you are looking for simcha ben ehud yes do you know where i can find him she had a knife at her belt but she was afraid to reach for it the man was only an inch or two taller than her but he was wiry and she knew from the pressure of his hand on her shoulder that he was strong he had a hawk nose and hooded eyes almost black but there was a gentleness in his mouth even an ease of laughter in the lines cut deep by the passage of emotion you are simcha ben ehud she asked you have come from byzantium from zoe chrysaphes he returned yes and your name anastasius zarides come with me follow me and say nothing stay close he turned and led the way back up the steps and along a narrow lane not once did he turn to make sure she was following but he moved slowly and she knew he was deliberately making sure she did not lose him finally he turned into a small courtyard with a well and a narrow wooden door at the opposite side inside was a room with a stairway to another room above it this was full of light in it sat a very old man whitebearded his eyes were opaque as milk and he was clearly blind i have the messenger from byzantium jacob ben israel ben ehud said quietly he has come to see the painting with your permission ben israel nodded show him he agreed his voice was hoarse as if he were unused to speaking ben ehud went to another door this one no more than three feet high opened it and after a moments consideration pulled out a small square of wood wrapped in linen cloth he took off the cloth and held it up for anna to see the picture she felt a sudden wave of disappointment it was the head and shoulders of a woman her face was worn with age but her eyes were bright her expression almost rapturous she wore a simple robe of the shade of blue traditionally associated with the madonna you are disappointed ben ehud observed he was waiting still holding the picture do you think it is worth your journey no she replied there is nothing special about her face no understanding i dont think the artist knew her at all he was a physician not a painter ben ehud pointed out i am a physician not a painter anna argued i can still see that that is poor she was the mother of christ there has to have been something in her greater than this he put the picture on the ground and returned to the cupboard he took out another painting a fraction smaller unwrapped it and turned it toward her this one was also of a woman her face touched by age and grief but her eyes had seen visions beyond human pain she had endured the best and the worst and knew herself with an inner peace that the artist had tried to capture ending with only the grace to understand that he could not catch the infinite with the strokes of a brush ben ehud was studying her you wish for this one i do he wrapped it again carefully and then took another larger piece of linen and wrapped that around it also he ignored the first painting as if it were not worth consideration it had served its purpose i do not know if it is what you hope he said quietly we will choose to believe that it is she replied that will be as good after settling with ben ehud she carried the painting back to the hostelry clutching it inside her robe she was not far from the hotel when she was aware of someone behind her she touched the knife at her belt but it was little comfort she had only ever used it for food or a few brief moments of first aid she forced herself to walk rapidly but quelling the panic inside her she reached the entrance of the hostelry just as giuliano approached from the opposite direction he saw the fear in her face perhaps in the haste of her movement as well he grasped her by the arms and pulled her up the steps and then into an archway three men heavily robed in gray their faces hidden hurried past them and up into an open square one had a curved knife still in his hand ive got it she gasped as soon as they were in his room and the door latched its beautiful i think its real but it doesnt matter its the face of a woman who has seen something of god that the rest of us only hope for and the questions about sinai giuliano asked was that to do with the painting anna was startled she thought she had been discreet but somehow he had heard thats my own search she knew as she said it that she was opening a door she would not ever be able to close again it has nothing to do with zoe but she knows about it he insisted thats how she was able to make you come he was guessing she could see the puzzlement and the hurt in his face that she had not trusted him yes she said without hesitation she must tell him now there was no alternative there is a relative of mine who has been accused of a crime and exiled somewhere near here what is he accused of collusion in murder she replied but his reasons were noble ones i think i could prove that if i could speak to him learn from him the details not just the pieces i already have who is he supposed to have killed bessarion comnenos his eyes widened and he breathed out slowly youre fishing in deep waters are you sure you know what youre doing im not at all sure she said bitterly but i have no choice he did not argue ill help you first wed better put the picture somewhere where it will be safe where i dont know how big is it she took it out unwrapped it carefully and held it up for him to see she watched his face seeing the disbelief in his eyes melt away and wonder take its place we must put it on the ship he said simply its the only place where itll be safe do you think those men were after it she asked dont you and whether they were or not others will be if zoe knew of it so do they the monastery i want is at mount sinai she forced out the words he studied her face trying to understand a relative he said softly how much dared she tell him the longer she hesitated the more anything she said would seem to be false my brother she said in a whisper im sorry now she would have to lie again or tell him that her name before she married was lascaris men did not change their names at marriage and eunuchs did not marry at all he would have to think she simply lied about her name to hide it this masquerade had once seemed so obvious that she had even become accustomed to thinking of it as easy even the freedom to move about the streets she now took for granted he was still puzzled he said nothing but it was in his eyes justinian lascaris she said wading in more deeply at last understanding filled his eyes are you related to john lascaris whose eyes the emperor put out yes she mustnt elaborate please dont he put up his hand to silence her you must go to mount sinai ill take the picture to the ship ill look after it i promise he smiled with a hard biting pain of shame ill not steal it for venice i give you my word i wasnt afraid you would she replied well go very carefully he said i think well be safer outside the city how long will it take you to get to mount sinai a month to go there and back she answered he hesitated ill be back here by the time the ship returns she promised just keep the picture safe i must see jaffa and caesarea on the coast he said ill be back in thirtyfive days he looked anxious on the brink of speaking and then changed his mind there was a sound of footsteps outside in the hostelry corridor and hushed voices arguing we cant stay here he told her quietly you must change your appearance and get out of the city how are you getting to sinai a caravan yes they go every two or three days then you must get out of the pilgrim gray thats what theyre looking for ill go and get you something right now you could dress as a boy she saw the embarrassment in his face in case he had insulted her but there was no time or safety to spare for such things she took the initiative better still as a woman she told him he looked startled they wont let women into the monastery i know ill find another hostelry on the road outside the walls then ill change back again he left and she barred the door behind him she spent a miserable hour waiting for his return afraid in case he was attacked she was too tense to sit or even to stand still she paced the floor back and forth only a few steps each way five times she heard footsteps outside and thought it was giuliano then stood with pounding heart and ears straining as they passed and the silence closed in again once someone knocked and she was about to undo the bolt when she realized it could be anyone she froze she could hear someone breathing heavily just on the other side of the wood there was a thump against the door as if someone had tested it with his weight she stepped back silently there was another thump this one harder the door shook on its hinges there were voices then quick footsteps someone stopped outside the door anastasius it was giulianos voice urgent and sharp with fear relief washed over her like a sudden heat she tried to loosen the bar and found it jammed by the previous pressure from outside she jerked her own weight against it heard it give giuliano stepped in and replaced the bar instantly he had a bundle of clothes in his arms some for her and some for himself well go tonight he said quietly change into these ive got merchants clothes for myself ill try to look like an armenian he shrugged at least i can speak greek he began slipping off his gray pilgrim cloak was he coming with her how far she picked up the womens clothes and turned her back to put them on if she made any kind of an issue of modesty now it would draw his suspicion if she was quick enough he might be too occupied with his own clothing to notice anything else the dress was wool dark wine red roughly shaped and tied with a girdle she slipped into it with an ease that tore away the years of pretense as if they had been paper and once again she was the widow who had returned from eustathiuss house to that of her parents she bound her hair like a womans wrapped the outer robe of darker wool around her and without thinking adjusted it with the grace she had struggled so hard to abandon he looked at her for an instant his face was blank then it filled with sharp painful surprise he picked up the painting and handed it to her he turned to the door opened it carefully with his hand on the hilt of his knife having looked to right and left he nodded at her to follow him outside in the street there were several groups of people standing around apparently arguing or haggling over the prices of goods giuliano went immediately north keeping a steady pace she could match without appearing to stride like a man she kept her eyes down and her steps shorter in spite of the fear tightening her muscles she enjoyed the brief freedom of being a woman as if it were a wild dangerous escape that would have to end too soon jerusalem was a small city they walked quickly keeping to the wider streets where possible they were climbing steadily the great site of the temple mount to their right she thought giuliano was making for the damascus gate to the northwest and the nablus road they were accosted once and giuliano stopped and turned smiling hand on his belt it was a peddler selling holy relics he thought giuliano was reaching for his purse anna knew he had a hand on the knife hilt no thank you he said briefly catching anna by the arm he hurried onward his grip was warm and harder than it would have been had he touched a woman she struggled to keep up with him never daring to draw attention to herself by looking backward the damascus gate was crowded with merchants peddlers camel drivers and several pilgrims dressed in gray suddenly they appeared sinister and without realizing it she slowed her step giulianos hand tightened again pulling her forward did he feel her fear or the slenderness of her bones and wonder they knew so much of each otherof dreams and beliefsand yet so little it was all shot through with assumptions and lies probably the lies were all hers they pushed through the crowds at the gate and then they were out on the open road after they had gone swiftly for about two hundred yards and strayed off the path downward giuliano stopped are you all right he said anxiously yes she said do you want to go south now she pointed back to the road the jaffa gates that way thats herods gate ahead of us i could go in there theres a pilgrim lodging near st stephens ill stay there overnight and go down to the sion gate before morning ill come with you he said quickly no take the painting and go back to acre and the sea ill stay in this until morning then ill put on the gray again she looked at him briefly then turned away beyond his shoulder she saw the scarred hillside with holes in it that seemed at a glance like the eyes and nostrils of a great skull she shivered what is it he asked swiveling around to follow her line of sight theres no one i know it wasnt that her voice tailed off he stood closer to her his hand on her arm do you know where we are he said softly no but even as she denied it she understood yes golgotha the place of the crucifixion perhaps i know some people think its inside the city and perhaps it doesnt matter id rather it were here desolate with the earth and the sky it shouldnt have a pretty church built over it that is to efface all it means it had to be terrible and alone like this do you think well all come to such a place one day she asked or be brought here maybe one day or another he answered she stood still for several moments longer then she turned to him but i must go to sinai and you must go to acre ill see you again in thirtyfive days or as close as i can to that she found it difficult to keep her voice level the emotion in control she wanted to leave before it broke she glanced down to where he held his sack with the clothes and the picture thank you she smiled briefly and turned away climbing back up the steep incline to the road at the top she looked at him once and saw he was still on the same spot still watching her the skull of golgotha behind him she took a deep breath swallowed and started walking again sixtyone giuliano watched until the slender lonely figure of anastasius disappeared into the distance then he walked over the rough ground and climbed back up to the road joining it farther to the south and west was that the true golgotha on which they had stood the desolation of it seeped into his bones drowning his mind why hast thou forsaken me the cry of every human soul who looks upon despair was the sad powerful face on the wooden painting he carried really that of mary it didnt matter the passion was real who cared if it was this place or that place this woman or another why did the sight of anastasius dressed as a woman trouble giuliano so much he not only looked so natural in the clothes he even changed his walk and the angle of his head the way he looked at the passing men was feminine different his character had changed he was no longer the friend giuliano had come to know so well at least he thought he had there were days at a time when he forgot that anastasius was a eunuch his sexuality or lack of it was of no importance it was his courage his gentleness his intelligence his quick wit and soaring imagination that mattered and made him who he was now suddenly the whole issue was forced into the open anastasius truly was a third gender neither male nor female he could slip from one to the other as silk changed in the light almost as if there were nothing innate that defined him but it was worse than that it was something deeper something within himself that troubled him he had found anastasius dressed as a woman to be beautiful he knew perfectly well that he was if not a man then definitely male yet momentarily he had responded to him as if he had been female he had felt protective and then been aware of the sharp stirrings of sexual attraction giuliano was relieved that he had to go to jaffa and there was no real question of his traveling to sinai as well yet the moment anastasius such a vulnerable figure was gone he felt strangely alone he would soon be surrounded by people but there was no one to whom he could speak of the burdens inside him the guilt at having fallen so far short of being the kind of friend anastasius needed and deserved perhaps worse than that cutting more deeply into the fabric of himself he was not the man he himself needed to be he had realized that perhaps he could not love passionately or with lifelong honor and completeness as his mother could not and his father did so unrequitedly perhaps the depth of that was not in him but he had believed that friendship was another kind of love just as profound and just as precious and he was wrong in that too had anastasius the gentleness to forgive that out of the great well of his loneliness the compassion giuliano had seen in him so often could he and should he sixtytwo dressed as a pilgrim once more and having to force herself to adopt the habits and gestures of a eunuch again anna asked the caravan master at the sion gate for passage across the negev desert to st catherines monastery in sinai she still had a great deal of zoes money more than was necessary to pay for her passage he haggled a few minutes but time was short and the money she offered was good even generous anna was unused to riding a donkey but since there was no alternative she accepted the assistance of one of the guides he was a dark mildfaced man of whose language she understood only a few words but his tone of voice was sufficiently explicit that even the camels were obedient to him the caravan that left the shelter of jerusalem numbered as near as she could tell about fifteen camels twenty donkeys and about forty pilgrims plus a number of camel and donkey drivers and two guides it was apparently a small number compared with what was usual it was a journey that began easily as they followed the road south the first place of any note they passed was desolate unremarkable until the man on the donkey beside her crossed himself and began to pray over and over again as if warding off some evil fate she was startled by the fear in his voice are you ill she asked in concern he made the sign of the cross in the air aceldama he said hoarsely pray brother pray aceldama of course the field of blood where judas slew himself surprisingly it was not fear that took hold of her but a savage and overwhelming pity was that really a road from which there was no returning when they moved past aceldama and into the evershifting everchanging desert there was nothing left behind but an old grief the first night she was stiff and cold too tired to sleep at first and very aware of the miserable accommodations three dirty leaking sheds where they huddled together trying to find enough rest to gain strength for the next day it was a relief to eat and drink a little and begin the days journey at least it was warmer to move even in the wind than to lie still the scenery changed from black and white to faded colors bleached by heat and cold almost devoid of life except for miserable little tamarisk trees thick with thorns pale sand gave way to almost black flat and hard covered with little flints black mountains were dense and jagged in the distance the wind roared and stung with hard little edges of sand like myriad insects stinging they were told quite cheerfully by the guides that at other seasons it was worse they were warned not to leave the caravan for any reason whatever to stray was to invite death one could become lost in minutes disoriented and perish of thirst the wastes beyond the known path were littered with the white bones of the foolish at night the sky was ink black and burned with stars so low as to seem barely out of reach beautiful and alien they exerted such a profound fascination that anna found it hard to tear her gaze away from them and remember that she must sleep if she was to survive day followed day the scenery changed limitless horizons giving way to lines of hills black desert changed to pale or even white with gray lines and shadows across it then at last on the fifteenth day almost as if a cloud had cleared in front of them two towering summits appeared with a deepclefted valley between high and steep the mountains of moses the caravan master announced with pride horeb and sinai we will climb we will be there before nightfall anna thought they must already be several thousand feet above acre and the sea at last they reached the outer walls of st catherines the vast square fortress towered above them thirty to forty feet high crammed into the fork between the peaks of horeb and sinai it was built out of smooth dustcolored rock hewn into giant squares and placed together so one could barely get a knife blade between the only way in was to hail the watchtower and request entrance if it was granted a small door opened high above and a knotted rope was let down the guest would place his foot in a loop at the end and on command be hauled up after only a short hesitation anna found herself clinging with desperate hands numb and dizzy while she was raised up the outer face of the great wall the sun burned red and purple on the western horizon she would have liked to look at the scene until every last vestige of light faded but already her hands were locked and slipped on the rope her legs ached so fiercely she found it difficult to keep them straight she scrambled a little awkwardly through the small door an elderly monk greeted her civilly enough but with little interest perhaps he was so used to seeing pilgrims that they had all melted into one for him so many of them would come with impossible dreams expecting miracles here where moses had seen a burning bush from which god had spoken to him sixtythree she presented the letter that nicephoras had given her and asked to see justinian alone the letter suggested without directly saying so that she was on the emperors business and the monk did not question it nicephoras had been careful to word it ambiguously she was conducted into a small irregularshaped courtyard and the monk leading her stopped take your shoes off he whispered the place where you stand is holy ground anna bent to obey and suddenly found tears in her eyes she looked up boots in her hand and saw in the lantern light a huge spread of leaves where a bush mounded higher than her head and seemed to pour over the stones a wild thought came into her head was this mosess bush which had once burned with the voice of god she turned to the monk he nodded slowly smiling you may have a short time until the next call to prayer he said gently but the warning was implicit in his voice she should not forget that justinian was a prisoner here and she was being granted a privilege in speaking alone with him she was left to wait in an airless stone cell barely large enough to pace back and forth more than a few steps when she heard the door swing on its heavy hinges she whirled around for the first instant he looked as he always had his eyes his mouth the way his hair grew from his brow her heart lurched and she could hardly breathe the years vanished and all that had happened between ceased to be real he was staring at her confused blinking there was a first stumbling of hope in his face and then fear the monk behind him was waiting she must explain quickly before either of them betrayed themselves i am a physician she said clearly my name is anastasius zarides the emperor michael palaeologus has given me permission to speak with you if you will permit me to even though she had pitched her voice with the throaty quality of a eunuch he recognized it instantly joy flared up in his eyes but he stood perfectly still his back to the monk still standing behind him when he answered his voice trembled a little i will be happy to speak with you as the emperor wishes he half turned to the monk behind him thank you brother thomas brother thomas inclined his head and withdrew anna what in the name of justinian started she cut him off by stepping forward and putting her arms around him he responded holding her so tightly that she felt bruised although the pain was welcome we have only a few minutes his body was hard far thinner than last time they had seen each other so many years ago he looked older almost gaunt the lines in his face were deeper and there were hollows around his eyes you look like a eunuch he replied still holding on to her what on earth are you doing for gods sake be careful if the monks find out theyll she pulled away a little and looked up at him im good at it she said ruefully i didnt dress like this to get in here although i would have im like this all the time he was incredulous why youre beautiful and you can practice medicine as a woman its for a different reason she also could not bear to tell him that she was unmarriageable and why that was a burden he did not need i have a good practice she went on quickly often at the blachernae palace for the eunuchs there and sometimes for the emperor himself anna he cut across her dont no practice is worth the risk youre taking im not doing it for the practice she said im doing it to find out enough to prove why you killed bessarion comnenos its taken me so long because at first i didnt even know why anyone would but now i know no you dont he contradicted her his voice dropped suddenly gentle you cant help anna please dont become involved you have no idea how dangerous it is you dont know zoe chrysaphes yes i do im her physician she looked straight into his eyes i think she poisoned both cosmas kantakouzenos and arsenios vatatzes im certain she killed gregory vatatzes facetoface with a dagger and tried to have the venetian ambassador arrested for it he stared at her tried to i prevented it she felt the heat burn in her face you dont need to know now but yes i know zoe and helena and eirene and demetrios she went on hastily and bishop constantine of course he smiled at constantines name how is he i get so little news here is he well are you asking me as his physician it sounded lighthearted but she said it because she suddenly realized that he had not seen the darker weaker side of constantine the way he had changed under the desperate pressure of the union of failure the burden of leading so much of the resistance almost alone his eyebrows shot up youre his physician too why not she bit her lip to him im a eunuch isnt that appropriate he paled anna you cant get away with this for gods sake go home have you any idea the risks youre taking you cant prove anything i i can prove why you killed bessarion she replied and that you had no other choice you were foiling a plot to usurp michael the only way possible the emperor should thank you reward you he touched her face so gently she felt little more than the warmth of his hand anna it was a plot to usurp michael in order to save the church from rome it was only when i finally realized that bessarion had not the fire or the guts to succeed that i changed course michael knows that i killed bessarion he said in little more than a whisper it was the hardest thing ive ever done and i still have nightmares about it but if he had usurped the throne it would have been a disaster for byzantium i was a fool for it to take me so long to see that i didnt want to and then it was too late but im here because i wouldnt tell michael the names of the rest of the conspirators i i couldnt they were no more guilty than iperhaps less they still believed it was the right thing to do for the cityand the faith she dropped her head and leaned against him i know that i know who they are and i couldnt tell him either but there must be something i can do there isnt he said softly leave it be anna constantine will do what he can he already saved my life hell plead for me with the emperor if theres a chance there was no one else except her to fight for justinian and she had more chance of the emperors ear than constantine now who betrayed you to the authorities she asked i dont know he answered and it doesnt matter theres nothing you can do about it even if you were certain what do you want vengeance she looked at him searching i dont want revenge she admitted at least only when im not really thinking then id like to see them pay leave it please he begged in the end it isnt worth anything it isnt failure not if byzantium survives and michael will win that if anyone can at the cost of the church he asked with disbelief go home anna he whispered please be safe i want to think of you healing people living to be old and wise and knowing that you did it well the tears blinded her he had paid so much to give her that chance and she had made him a promise she knew she could not keep you wont will you he said touching the tears on her cheek i cant i dont know that they arent still planning to kill michael demetrios is a vatatzes and a doukas through eirene he could try for the throne if michael were dead and andronicus he might have a chance especially with crusaders at the gates he gripped her harder his hands tight on her shoulders i know that i think he might have taken over once bessarion had got rid of michael for him anyway and you she added youre a lascaris the key sounded in the lock justinian pushed her away she wiped her hand across her cheek to get rid of the tears and forced herself to steady her voice thank you brother justinian i shall carry your message back to constantinople she made the sign of the cross in the orthodox fashion smiled at him once briefly then she followed the monk out into the corridor feeling her way rather than seeing it sixtyfour the journey by caravan from st catherines back to jerusalem took fifteen days again apparently it always did whatever one had negotiated this time anna stared at the stark magnificence of the desert around her with different emotions it was still beautiful the shadings ran from black through a hundred shades of umber and gray in daylight the blue was scorched with the dull ocher of dust on the wind sometimes rawedged with cold now it was indelible in her heart with the terrible price justinian had paid for his error and then to put it right she ignored the physical exhaustion the ache in her body from the hardness of the ground on which she slept had she been in justinians place she might so easily have done exactly the same if she had had the courage bessarion would have been a disaster as emperor but he was too arrogant to see it and the others were too far committed to accept such a bitter truth except perhaps demetrios was justinian right and he had planned to kill not only michael and andronicus but perhaps bessarion also what irony that would have been the archconspirator to turn against them as soon as the murder of michael was accomplished kill bessarion and claim to restore order then step into the breach himself the hero of the hour and would he have got rid of justinian as well because as a lascaris he was a threat then there would be nobody left but himself demetrios would console the widow poor helena and in due course marry her and combine the families of comnenos doukas and vatatzes in one glorious dynasty were they still plotting that was something she needed to know because she realized with some surprise that she was wholeheartedly behind michael he was the only hope the city had now she arrived back in jerusalem windburned and exhausted her bones aching but she had no time to rest she must take the next caravan back to acre and meet giuliano on the ship carefully she counted out what was left of zoes money she smiled it must have hurt zoe to change it from gold byzants into venetian ducats she could not afford to spend it all yet she would need to wait in acre if the ship was late she would need food and lodging but she knew that walking for another five days was beyond her physical strength she had learned a few tactics since last time and considerably sharper words since her stay in jerusalem and her journey to sinai and back the deal was made and she rode an awkward and highly illtempered mule all the way to acre before they arrived there the beast had discovered that she too could be stubborn and awkward if she chose secretly she thought that they had gained some mutual respect and was quite sorry to part with it she spent a few coins on buying it a treat of bread dipped in oil the animal was most surprised but accepted the gift with something approaching grace she had one night to purchase poor lodgings and she had no breakfast then she saw the ship come in on precisely the day giuliano had said he would return she boarded midmorning not to betray how eager she was to see him he hid his relief in front of the crewmen however later alone on deck as they pulled away in the darkening sky he spoke to her alone standing a little apart his voice was gentle although he looked not at her but at the white wake of water behind them was the journey hard they say it is im not used to riding an ass day after day a patient little beast but uncomfortable the deserts cold this time of year especially at night its beautifuland terrible and sinai he asked turning to look at her now in the stern his back was to the light as they moved westward she could not see his face its over five thousand feet above the sea she began and yet the mountains around almost make it look insignificant until you get to it and realize the walls are thirty or forty feet high and massive even if you could get a siege engine up there nothing could break them there are buttresses and towers but no doors near the ground the only way in is through a small opening near the top you have to be winched up standing in a rope stirrup thats true he said his voice hushed with wonder i heard it but i thought it was imagination its true inside its beautiful austere and you can never forget the mountains that seem to be almost hanging over you blocking out the sky behind mount sinai and mount horeb there is a pathway upward in the cleft between them steep stairs now thats where moses climbed up to meet god i didnt go i didnt have time and im not sure if i wanted to maybe i would have met god and im not ready she smiled and looked down or maybe i wouldnt and im not ready to face that either but i saw the burning bush its still there it looks like any other bush but you know it isnt how he asked probably because the monk told me i was standing on holy groundto take my shoes off he laughed and the tension eased out of his shoulders only then did she realize how awkward he had been without his usual grace she thought of their parting in golgotha of his face when he had seen the painting of maryshe chose to believe that was who it was other moments crowded her mind and she knew that something had changed she did not want to understand what it was because it included a hurt she could not reach sixtyfive well simonis demanded when anna was home at last washed and rested and sitting in clean clothes at the table hot soup and fresh bread in front of her what did you learn of justinian i can see by your face that he is alive what else when will he be home anna had told simonis and leo nothing of zoes picture they had both assumed her entire journey was to gain news of justinian leo had cautioned her against going saying she would endanger herself for little purpose simonis had been furious with him and praised anna for at last taking the step that she had hoped of her from the beginning i saw him anna began he is thinner but he seemed well drink your soup simonis directed what did he say anna felt the knot of disappointment tighten inside her he told me what happened she replied beginning the soup because its fragrance tempted her and eating would not make what she had to say better or worse it was almost what i had believed from what i learned myself you didnt tell us simonis accused her face darkening again leo touched her arm gently with a small restraining gesture she shook him off still staring at anna so how are you going to prove his innocence she repeated im not anna said bluntly he killed bessarion he couldnt simonis said furiously not justinian you perhaps you could have stop it leo said sharply you exceed yourself simonis blushed hotly anna too was caught by surprise thank you leo she said to him gravely the story is simple and now that i know from justinian that it is true i shall tell you but if you value your lives or mine you will not repeat it she waited for their word this is as justinian wishes simonis nodded reluctantly her face still hot and angry of course leo promised briefly she told them not elaborating any of the details simonis looked crushed she stared in miserable silence anna you must obey justinians wishes leo said with concern you cant let anyone know that you are aware of all this or they will destroy you simonis was looking at her too but she expected action youll go to the emperor and tell him who the other conspirators were she said as if it were a conclusion they had all agreed youll say you saw justinian and he told you who they were then the emperor will free him no i cant anna said they tortured justinian to make him tell and he didnt you want me to do it now after the price he has paid simonis shouted at her men are fools they keep to people who betray them when theres no sense in it you must do it for him that way his hands are clean not if she says that it was justinian who told her leo interrupted her it doesnt matter anna said desperately he doesnt want it done by me or himself or anyone of course he does simonis contradicted her witheringly why else would he tell you he didnt need to tell me i already knew anna pointed out she did not mention her conversation with nicephoras oh so its your honor now is it simonis almost choked on her words he sits in prison in the desert beaten and tortured and you increase your practice here in constantinople and grow fat wearing silks but you dont want to stain some honor you imagine you have you didnt mind sacrificing his whole future over your mistakes in nicea did you or have you chosen to forget that none of this would ever have happened if youd owned up then hed be a doctor and you wouldnt where was your precious honor then you you coward sobbing gasping for breath she blundered out of the room and they heard her feet down the passageway anna found the tears were hot in her eyes he begged me not to she whispered its not for me its for him i will speak to her leo said quietly perhaps you should send her back to nicea no she shook her head i cant do that you cant excuse what she said he replied it was unforgivable very little is unforgivable she said wearily and anyway i cant afford to have a stranger here in her place not in the house are you afraid she will betray you he asked no of course not she denied too quickly she would never do that justinian wouldnt forgive her anna took the picture to zoe chrysaphes the following day there were no servants present simply the two of them in the silent room it was filled with sharp pale spring sunlight she handed over the package quite small heavily wrapped just as giuliano had passed it back to her zoe did not pretend to be interested in anna she cut the fastenings with a small thinbladed knife then undid them and stared at the wooden panel for a long time she did not speak her face transfixed with crowding emotions awe amazement overwhelming joy strangely there was no open victory in itrather the opposite a sense of sudden humility finally she looked up at anna and her eyes were totally without guile you did well anastasia she said quietly as one woman might speak to another who was an equalpossibly for a moment even her friend i could pay you in gold for your skill and your hardship but that seems crass there is a jeweled candlestick on the table it is yours take it and set your taper in it to carry the light anna turned and saw it it was exquisite smallnot more than a few inches highbut set with rubies and pearls that burned softly even in the harsh morning light she picked it up and turned to thank zoe but zoes head was bent and she was totally absorbed in the picture anna left without breaking the silence sixtysix michael palaeologus emperor of byzantium stood in the pale sunlight in his private chamber on the chest in front of him was a simple picture but the face in it was that of the mother of god he knew it without question the artist who had painted it had known and the passion the suffering and the beauty of soul were attempted in the lines it was not his imagination not an ideal he was trying to capture in line and shading what he saw in front of him zoe chrysaphes had sent the eunuch physician to jerusalem to bring it back it was a gift not to the church but to michael personally of course michael knew why zoe had given it to him she was afraid that he was aware of her part in bessarion comnenoss plan to usurp the throne and that one day when michael would have no need of her he would take his revenge for that this was to buy him off it had succeeded if it was not the greatest relic in christendom it was certainly the most beautiful the most moving to the soul very slowly he bent to his knees the tears wet on his cheeks the blessed virgin was back in byzantium again in a way she had never been before how strange that zoe of all people had caused her to be brought sixtyseven in constantinople the summer of was hot and still palombara was again in the city surrounded by its vivid mixture of sounds and colors its racing ideas its passionate religious debate unfortunately he had once more been accompanied by niccolo vicenze the holy father had told palombara that vicenze knew nothing of his real mission which was supporting the emperor in obeying the act of union with rome and naturally to preserve the emperors life and power should they be threatened it was implicit that it was also palombaras task to be sure he was aware of such threats whoever posed them of course what the holy father had actually said to vicenze could be completely different that must never be forgotten the priority now was to deal with bishop constantine he was foremost among those still irrevocably opposed to the union arguing with him was pointless he must be defeated it was an ugly thought but too many lives rested on it to be squeamish the question was one of means at constantines side through hunger and disease had been the physician anastasius if anyone knew the bishops weaknesses it was he and what was equally certain in palombaras mind was that anastasius would never willingly betray them least of all to rome deceiving him was not something palombara looked forward to another thought occurred to him subtle and dangerous if he were in constantines place determined at any cost to save the freedom of the orthodox church the one man above all others who stood in his way was michael himself remove the emperor put an orthodox believer in his place without either his intelligence or his steel and all this other maneuvering would be unnecessary his urgency to see anastasius doubled fragments of conversation came back to his mind old plots and murders imperial names like lascaris and comnenos his intimacy with zoe chrysaphes that most byzantine of women and his treatment of the emperor it was over a week before the opportunity came without forcing it he had been attempting to cross anastasiuss path by chance and eventually they met on the hill above the docks palombara had just arrived by water taxi and anastasius was walking along the cobbles it was early evening the sun low and hazy healing the jagged scars of violence and poverty beneath a patina of gold my favorite time of day palombara said quite casually as if it were a natural thing they should meet again after so long a space of time is it anastasius said you look forward to the night he stood still and courtesy demanded that anastasius do the same i was speaking of these moments only not what came before or will follow there was interest in anastasiuss eyes palombara knew they were dark gray but facing the sun as he was he thought they could have been brown palombara smiled there is a tenderness in the shadows he continued a mercy the hard light of morning doesnt allow you like mercy my lord anastasius said curiously i like beauty palombara corrected him i like the unreality of the softer lightthe permission to dream anastasius smiled the quick warm gesture lighting his face palombara had the sudden thought that he was beautiful neither man nor woman but not a distortion of either i need to dream he explained quickly reality is harsh and its fruits will come quickly enough you refer to something specific anastasius glanced to his side at the ruin of a tower one side of it had crashed to the ground the rubble still uncleared are you still here trying to persuade us to join rome in heart as well as in treaty charles of anjou wants any excuse to take constantinople again the emperor knows that anastasius nodded he would hardly unite with rome against a lesser threat palombara winced thats harsh shouldnt christendom be united islam is rising in the east do we fight one darkness by embracing another anastasius said softly palombara shivered he wondered if anastasius really saw it like that what is so different between rome and byzantium that you can consider one light and the other darkness he asked anastasius was silent for a long time it is all far subtler a million shades between one and the other he said at length i want a church that teaches pity and gentleness patience hope forbearance from selfrighteousness but still with room for passion and laughter and dreams you want a lot palombara said gently are you expecting the elders of the church to produce all this as well i just need a church that doesnt stand in our way anastasius replied i believe god wants us to teach to befriend and finally to createthat is the purpose to become like god as all children dream of becoming like their fathers palombara studied his face the hope in it the hunger and the ability to be hurt anastasius had been right the thought was beautiful but it was also turbulent intensely alive palombara did not believe for an instant that either the byzantine church or the roman would ever accept such an idea it painted something of an awe and a beauty too limitless for ordinary men to conceive of one would have to catch some glimpse of the heart of god even to dream so much but then perhaps anastasius had and palombara envied him that they stood over the darkening seascape the lights of the dockside behind them for long minutes neither of them spoke palombara was afraid anastasius would leave and his opportunity would be lost finally he spoke the emperor is determined to save the city from charles of anjou by declaring union with rome but he cannot force his subjects to abandon the old faith not even enough to satisfy appearances from the pope anastasius did not answer perhaps he knew it was not a question you ask a great deal about the murder of bessarion comnenos several years ago palombara pressed on was that a thwarted attempt to usurp the throne and then fight to keep religious independence anastasius turned slightly toward him why do you care bishop palombara it failed bessarion is dead so are those who conspired with him so you know who they were he said instantly anastasius drew in a deep slow breath only two of them but without those and without bessarion himself what can they do that question concerns me palombara replied any such attempt now would incite a terrible revenge the mutilation of the monks would seem trivial by comparison and the only man to win would be charles of anjou and the pope anastasius added his eyes catching the light of a cart passing with a lantern held high but it would be a bitter victory your grace and the blood of it would not wash off your hands sixtyeight the historic icon of the virgin that the emperor michael had carried into constantinople when the people returned from exile in vicenze said unequivocally that is what it will take palombara did not reply they were standing in the room overlooking the long slope down to the shore the light danced on the water and the tall masts of the ships swayed gently as the hulls rolled on the slight morning swell well never succeed until we have a symbol of byzantine surrender to rome vicenze went on the icon of the virgin is it they believe it saved them from invasion once before palombara had no argument to offer against it his reluctance was purely practical it will be impossible to get it so the effectiveness of it hardly matters but you agree as to the power it will have vicenze stuck to his point in theory of course palombara looked at him more closely he realized that vicenze had a plan one he was sufficiently pleased with that he had no doubt of victory he was telling palombara only because he wanted him to know not to participate it meant palombara must form his own plan with absolute secrecy or vicenze would be there first and take the prize to the pope alone the secrecy was necessary because it would not be beyond vicenzes mind deliberately to sabotage palombara and allow all attention to focus on him while he executed his own scheme palombara could end up in a byzantine jail while vicenze wringing his hands with hypocritical sorrow would make his way to the vatican icon in hand we must obtain it vicenze said with a thin smile i will let you know what plan i can contrive if you can think of anything then you will naturally inform me naturally palombara agreed he went out into the air feeling the faint wind in his face for several moments he stared over the rooftops toward the sea then he started to walk he just wanted the comfort of movement the cobbles under his feet and the ever changing sights michael could not be bought with money or coerced with office the only thing he cared about was saving his city from charles of anjou and the duplicity of rome no that was not true he would save it from anyone christian or muslim it had always been byzantiums art through the centuries to form alliances to deal in trade to turn its enemies against one another could he be persuaded to ally with rome against the hot wind of islam that was already scorching the southern borders what could bring such an alliance into being an atrocity in constantinople itself something that would enrage christendom and draw the two opposing churches into each others arms at least long enough to send the icon to rome as proof of byzantiums good faith an outrage but not murder burn a shrine and see that the muslims were blamed and there would be rage among the people then they would accept any price michael was able to pay even tribute to rome palombara knew how to do it he had papal money even some that vicenze knew nothing about and he had contact with people who understood how to arrange precise and limited violence at a price he would be very very careful indeed no one would know most particularly not niccolo vicenze the burning of the sacred shrine to saint veronica was spectacular palombara stood in the street at dusk anonymous in the gathering crowd and felt the searing heat as the flames consumed the fragile buildings and scorched the walls of the surrounding houses and shops near him an old woman howled tearing at her hair her voice rising in pitch until it was close to a scream the roar of the fire grew louder the crackle of wood explosive sending sparks and burning cinders high into the air the heat drove palombara backward and he reached out to pull the old woman to greater safety but she snatched her arm away from him gradually the flames subsided starved of something to consume but the rage that followed it was as white hot as the heart of the fire had been palombara did not need to fan the flames he asked for an audience with the emperor and was granted it when he entered the emperors presence michael looked tired and worried and his temper was extremely short what is it my lord bishop michael said tersely he was robed in a red dalmatica crusted with jewels the varangian guard remained at the doors very much in evidence palombara did not waste time i came to offer the sympathy of the holy father in rome upon your loss majesty rubbish michael snapped you have come to gloat and to see what profit you can make out of it palombara smiled profit for all of us majesty if islam rises in the south to even more power than it has now and continues to press the borders of christendom it will take more than a crusade to keep them from attacking us and then inevitably a full invasion and i am not speaking of centuries in the future majesty perhaps not even decades michaels face was pale under his black beard but his expression did not change he had led his people in exile he knew war well and carried the scars of it on his body he was prepared to pay the last desperate price of compromising his religious faith to preserve his people michael palaeologus emperor of byzantium and equal of the apostles knew the taste of failure defeat and the art and cost of survival palombara was touched with an amazement of pity for this very human man in his gorgeous robes and his still ruined palace majesty he said humbly may i suggest a more final recognition of byzantiums union with rome one upon which no enemy either through malice or stupidity can cast doubt michael looked at him with cold suspicion what have you in mind bishop palombara palombara found himself hesitating before he could force the words to his mouth send to rome the icon of the holy virgin that you carried above you as you entered into constantinople after the exile he answered finally let it come to rome as a symbol of the union of the two great christian churches of the world willing to stand side by side against the tide of islam rising around us then rome will forever be mindful of you and that you are the bastion of christ against the infidel and if we let you fall then the enemies of god will be at our own gates michael was silent but there was no anger no will to fight the impossible or make a show of injured dignity michael was a realist he was neatly caught the irony of it was not lost on him but he who had thought himself so clever was utterly out of his depth look after her well michael answered at last she will not forgive you if you defile her that is what you should fear palombara not me not byzantium nor even the connivings of rome or the floods of islam fear god and the holy virgin a week later the ancient icon that had saved byzantium centuries ago was delivered to the beautiful house where palombara and vicenze lodged they stood in one of the large reception rooms and watched as it was unpacked in silence vicenze was overwhelmed by palombaras success he stood in the sunlight streaming in through the windows and his pale face was bleak looking at him palombara saw a rage and envy that was real then as michaels man worked on the packing palombara saw a new expression enter vicenzes face a vision beyond his own failure to gain the icon the last wrapping fell away and each man silently leaned closer to gaze on the somber beautiful face and as close to it as they were the marks of time and weather visible in the minute cracks in the paint the pinhole marks in the gold leaf the banner itself was rubbed smooth by many hands and the oil from human skin over the generations had polished the surfaces of the wood where it was held vicenze opened his mouth to say something then changed his mind palombara did not even look at him the chill dreamlessness of vicenzes face would infuriate him it was simple enough to hire a ship palombara made the agreement with one of the many captains in the port of constantinople vicenze oversaw the carter who was actually carrying the icon which was even more carefully packed in an outer wooden crate it was discreetly marked so they could identify it easily but no one else could guess the contents they took little with them not wanting to give notice to servants or the ever present watchers and listeners that they might not be returning for some time in fact it was possible they might be elevated to the cardinals purple and not return at all palombara regretted leaving behind some of the exquisite artifacts he had purchased while here but it was necessary in order to create the illusion that he was merely visiting the dockside and would return before dusk however as he arrived on the quay he saw with disbelief their ship pull away the water churned around the hull as it gathered speed oars dipping rhythmically until they should be beyond the harbor shelter and find the soft wind to fill the sails vicenze stood on the ship near the rail the sun in his pale hair was like a halo and his wide flat mouth was smiling palombara broke into a sweat of blind fury he had never experienced defeat so total and so consuming that no other emotion was possible my lord bishop a voice said sounding concerned are you ill sir astonished palombara looked at the speaker it was the captain of the ship to whom he had not yet paid the money believing that that fact alone would hold him loyal theyve taken your ship he said harshly flinging out his arm to point into the bay where the hull of it was already growing smaller in the distance no sir the captain said incredulously my ship is over there waiting for you and your cargo i just saw bishop vicenze on board he gestured out to sea again there the captain shaded his eyes and followed palombaras gaze thats not my ship sir that is captain dandolos palombara blinked dandolo he took the package onto his own ship he had a big package sir several feet high and wide about the size you described to me bishop vicenze brought it no sir captain dandolo brought it himself sir will you still be wanting to sail to rome sir yes by god in heaven i will sixtynine constantine strode through the hard bright sun to visit theodosia skleros the only daughter of nicholas skleros one of the wealthiest men to have returned to constantinople after the exile none of the family wavered in their devotion to the orthodox church and consequently in their loathing of rome and all its abuse of power theodosia was married to a man who in constantines opinion was worthy of neither her high intelligence nor more important her great spiritual beauty still since he was apparently her choice constantine treated him with all the courtesy he would grant to any man with such an exceptional wife he found theodosia at prayer he knew she would be alone at this hour and no caller would be more welcome than he she greeted him with a smile of pleasure and perhaps surprise also usually he sent a message before he came bishop constantine she said warmly coming into the spare elegant room with its classical murals of urns and flowers she was not a lovely woman although she walked with grace and her voice had a richness to it a care and clarity of diction that made listening to her a joy theodosia he smiled already the weight of his anger easing you are most gracious to receive me when i took no care to ask if it was convenient it is always convenient my lord she replied and she invested it with such sincerity that he could not doubt it standing here in the shadow away from the harsh sunlight she reminded him of maria the only girl he had ever loved it was not that their faces were alike maria had been beautiful at least that was how he remembered her but they had been little more than children his elder brothers were young men handsome and bawdy feeling their new strength and exercising it not always with kindness it was just after constantine was castrated his body ached now at the remembrance of it not of the physical pain but of the emotional shame not that the pain was negligible but the wound had healed in time he wished that had been true for niphon too but it had not he had been the youngest brother confused by what had happened to him not understanding his wound had become infected constantine had never been able to forget his white face as he lay on the bed the sweatsoaked sheets damp around him constantine had sat with him holding his limp hand talking to him all the time so he would know he was never alone he was still a child softskinned slendershouldered and so frightened he had looked so small when he was dead as if it had never been possible he would grow up they had all grieved for him but constantine the most maria was the only one who had understood how deeply it had cut into all that he was she had been the most beautiful girl in the town all the young men had wanted to court her but it seemed she had chosen brash charming paulus constantines eldest brother then suddenly without anyone knowing the reason she had turned away from him and wanted instead to be with constantine theirs had been a pure friendship asking nothing but understanding the joy of sharing both beauty and pain the exhilaration of ideas and sometimes on wonderful occasions laughter she had wished to become a nun she had confided that to him softly with a shy smile but her family forced her to marry into a wealthy family with whom they had ties and constantine had never seen maria again nor had he ever learned what had happened to her she remained for him the ideal not only of womanhood but of love itself now as theodosia smiled at him in her quiet grave way and offered him honey cakes and wine he saw in her dark eyes something of maria again an echo of the same trust in him a peace settled inside him so sweet he began to find again the courage to fight harder with new power more belief it gave him the confidence to try a more dangerous path one that repelled him and yet in theodosias piety and unquestioning devotion to the faith he understood the necessity of using every weapon within his reach it was strange to visit zoes house afterward constantine had no delusions that she welcomed him out of anything but an intense curiosity to know what he could want with her he had forgotten how striking she was although she was in her late seventies still she walked with her head high and the same grace in her steps the suppleness of body he remembered he greeted her cautiously accepting hospitality in order to make it clear that he intended the visit to have meaning you must be aware of the danger we are in perhaps even more than i am he began the emperor sees it as so imminent that he has taken the icon of the virgin which he carried in triumph and sent it to rome he told me that was to preserve it should the city be burned again but he has not told the people this presumably he is afraid of panic all times require care my lord bishop she answered although there was no belief or acceptance in her face we have many enemies we were preserved in spite of the earthly strength of our enemies he replied because we believed god cannot save us if we will not trust him we have an advocate in the blessed virgin i know that you know this which is why i came to you even though we are not friends and i do not trust you in most things i admit that but in your love of byzantium and of the holy church we both believe in i trust you with my life she smiled as if some faint amusement overrode all that she heard in him but her eyes were hot and still and there was a color in her cheeks that owed nothing to art now was the time to tell her his purpose i trust you because we have a common cause he said again and therefore common enemies in the powerful families who for one reason or another support the union what have you in mind your graceprecisely information of course he replied you have weapons you cannot use but i can now is the time before it becomes too late is it not already too late she said coolly we have had at least this much common purpose for years because you will not part with the kind of information i want while it is still of more value to you he replied you cannot use it with impunity i can possibly i can think of nothing i know which will enlarge the kingdom of god there was a flicker of amusement in her eyes but perhaps you have more in mind than reduction of the realm of the devil he felt a chill my enemys enemy is my friend he quoted and which particular enemy are you referring to she asked i have but one cause he replied the preservation of the orthodox church for which we need also to preserve the city she pointed out what is your plan bishop he looked at her unflinchingly to persuade the great families who support the union to change their allegiance from expediency to trust in god if they will not do so willingly then i shall in the interest of their souls remind them of some of the sins of which i can absolve them before god if not before the publicand of course of what awaits those without forgiveness a little late she said would you have given me such weapons earlier when charles of anjou was not preparing to sail i am not sure if i will now perhaps i would prefer to use them myself you have power to wound just as i have zoe chrysaphes he said with a slight smile but i have power to heal and you do not he named three families she hesitated studying his face then something seemed to amuse her and she told him what he needed to know seventy palombara arrived in rome only days after vicenze the voyage had been good enough for time and seamanship but the taste of defeat had robbed him of any pleasure at all he had landed at ostia and even the briefest inquiry had told him vicenze had beaten him by at least twentyfour hours the pope and the cardinals were already assembled in the anteroom to the popes chambers in the vatican palace when palombara strode in still travel stained his clothes shabby with dust and sweat at any other time he could have been barred entrance in his disheveled state but the buzz of excitement was in the air as in a summer lightning storm when the wind was dry prickling on the skin like the touch of a hundred flies people started to speak and then stopped eyes darted everywhere seeing him and smiling did he imagine the mockery or was it only too real the huge crate stood with its wood neatly opened only the cloth covering protected the icon of the blessed virgin that michael palaeologus had carried in triumph when his people had returned home vicenze stood a little to one side of it his face burning with victory his pale eyes glittering only once did he look at palombara then away again as though he were insignificant a man who had ceased to matter a workman stepped forward at his signal there was no other sound in the room no rustle of heavy robes no shifting of feet even the pope seemed to be holding his breath the workman reached up and pulled off the protecting cloth the pope and the cardinals craned forward there was utter silence palombara looked blinked and stared god almighty what met his gaze was not the exquisite features of the virgin but a riotous profusion of naked flesh in exuberant joyful detail and painted with great skill the central figure was a smiling parody of the virgin but so overtly feminine that one could not look at it without a quickening of the pulse a remembrance of the hot blood of passion one lush breast was exposed and her slender hand rested intimately on the groin of the man nearest to her one of the less abstemious cardinals exploded with laughter and instantly tried to suffocate it in a fit of coughing the popes face was scarlet although there could have been more than one reason for that other cardinals choked someone snorted in disgust another laughed quite openly vicenze was white to the lips his eyes as hectic as if he were consumed with fever on the edge of delirium palombara tried for a full minute to look as if he were not laughing and failed it was exquisite he too owed someone a debt he would never be able to pay palombara had no choice but to go when nicholas sent for him the holy fathers expression was unreadable explain yourself enrico he said very quietly his voice trembled and palombara had no idea if the emotion all but choking him was fury or laughter there was nothing to offer but the truth yes holy father he said piously i persuaded the emperor to send the icon to rome it arrived at the house we had taken for our stay in the city it was unpacked in front of us and it was quite definitely a very somber very beautiful picture of the virgin mary it was repacked in front of us ready to ship this tells me nothing nicholas said dryly who obtained it you yes holy father and what did vicenze do about it dont tell me this is his revenge for your superiority he could never have done this to himself the laughter will follow him to the grave as well you know he leaned forward this looks a great deal more like your wit enrico for which i shall pardon you the faintest twitch pulled the corner of his mouth and with difficulty he controlled it if you return the icon of the virgin to me forthwith discreetly of course nicholas might not have a towering faith with a light to lead christendom but he unquestionably had a sharp sense of humor and to palombara that was a grace sufficient to redeem him from almost any other failure is it still in constantinople nicholas asked i dont know holy father but i doubt it palombara replied i think michael was honest do you then i am inclined to accept that nicholas said thoughtfully you are a cynical man you manipulate others so you expect them to do the same to you he raised his eyebrows dont look so crushed so where is the icon whoever has it i do not require to know if such knowledge would be embarrassing my guess would be venice palombara replied the captain who brought vicenze and the icon to rome was a venetiangiuliano dandolo ah yes i have heard of him a descendant of the great doge nicholas said quietly how very interesting he smiled when you return to constantinople you will take a letter for me in which i shall thank the emperor michael for his gift of good faith and assure him that the union is regarded with the utmost gravity and honor by rome he looked at palombara steadily you will return to byzantium taking vicenze with you palombara was horrified at the thought nicholas saw his distress and chose to ignore it i do not want him here in rome i quite see that you do not want him either but i am pope enrico and you are notat least not yet take vicenze you still have work to do there charles of anjou will sail and then it will be too late to stop him perhaps you can find some byzantine friend who will curb his excesses for you godspeed palombara had no choice but to leave the reclaiming of the icon to nicholas if dandolo had any sense he would yield it easily enough god knows venice had relics to spare and to steal from the pope and thus from the heart of the church was a dangerous thing to do possibly dandolo might present it to the holy father himself with any claim he could think of as to how it had come into his possession nicholas might be inclined to forgive him for it and pretend to believe any tale of its adventures seventyone during the voyage back to constantinople palombara and vicenze had barely spoken to each other and then only in a bitterly civil manner as was necessary in front of the sailors it deceived no one now palombara went to the one person who had the power and the means to destroy a papal legate he needed to convince her of the need zoe welcomed him with interest her curiosity sharpened however he was not blind to the hatred in her eyes the hunger to hurt him because he was the one who had persuaded michael to give the icon of the virgin to rome instead of telling her that he too believed in the need for byzantium to survive with its values and its civilization he told her of the shipping of the icon he described his own fury as he saw vicenze in the stern of the ship waving at him he touched briefly on his seemingly endless voyage in pursuit but only for dramatic effect then in detail drawing it out he told her of the unveiling the moment of incredulity and then in much freer detail than he would have to any other woman he described the picture and the cardinals horror the popes laughter and vicenzes incandescent rage she laughed until the tears ran down her cheeks in that moment he could have reached across and touched her and she would not have pulled away as thin as spiders silk and as strong it was a bond neither of them would ever forget an unbreakable intimacy i dont know where it is he said softly i would guess in venice i imagine dandolo took it from vicenze he is the only one who had the chance to but i will see that the pope receives it and perhaps even sends it back and what are you going to do enrico palombara you must deal with vicenze oh i know he assured her smiling bitterly this pope would protect me today but tomorrow could be different he shrugged over the last few years popes have come and gone faster than the weather has changed their promises are worth nothing because their successors are not bound by them she did not answer him but there was a sudden light in her eyes a different understanding it took only an instant for him to know that she had let slip the dream of defying the union and seen the reality and its flaws it was his first step toward convincing her he must tread lightly the smallest attempt at deception and he would lose her she searched his face curiously quite frankly you are trying to tell me that union with rome may not be as bad as i had supposed because little note can be kept of actual practice a popes word is worth little so ours need be worth no more as long as we are discreet and do not force anyones attention to us we may quietly do as we have always done he smiled his acknowledgment although she understood perfectly she was enjoying playing with him and what is it you would like of me palombara i find it inconvenient always having to watch over my shoulder he replied so you wish vicenze got rid of you think i can do that and that i would i am quite sure you could he replied but i dont want him killed i would be suspected whatever the circumstances and of rather more practical importance than that he would only be replaced and by someone i dont know and therefore would find harder to predict she nodded you have been in byzantium long enough to learn a little wisdom he smiled and inclined his head i need vicenzes attention diverted something that will give him no time to concentrate on destroying me she considered carefully you cannot afford to leave alive someone who will kill you if they can sooner or later they will find the opportunity you cannot stay awake all the time one day you will forget be at a disadvantage too tired to think seize the time palombara or he will he realized with a wave of certainty that she was speaking from her own experience and the instant after he knew exactly where and when the grief was for gregory vatatzes but she had had no choice for her own survival was arsenios vatatzess death her doing also one of her vengeances the important thing is that only you and i know this he chose his words carefully edged with double meaning while i appreciate your help i cannot afford to be in your debt you wont be she promised you have given me knowledge of papal plans which enables me to revise my situation on the union with rome that is important to me he rose to his feet and she did also standing close enough to him that he could smell the perfume of her hair and her skin if the balance between them had been just a little different he would have touched her and maybe more than that as it was their understanding was deep even intimate she would curb vicenze for him and it would amuse her to do so if he ever presented a danger to her with intense regret she would kill him they both knew that too the difference between them was that apart from his admiration for her his involvement was ultimately sealed in his mind his urgent busy intellect there was no wave strong enough to knock him off his feet bury him pummel him and carry him far far out of his depth whereas she cared passionately he envied her that seventytwo constantine paced the floor of his beautiful room with the icons grasping at the air with his hands please help her anastasius she is so wounded by the betrayal she is ill with grief i think she does not care if she lives or not i have done all i can but i am no use theodosia is a good woman perhaps the best i know how can a man abandon a wife of years for some some harlot with a pretty face just because she may give him a child yes of course ill go to her anna replied but i have no cure for grief all i can do is wait with her try to persuade her to eat help her to sleep but the pain will still be there when she wakens constantine breathed out a great sigh thank you he smiled suddenly i knew you would anna found theodosia skleros suffering in spirit as deeply as constantine had said she was a darkhaired woman of great dignity if not beauty she was sitting in a chair staring out of the window with unfocused eyes anna carried over another chair and sat near her for a long time saying nothing finally theodosia turned to her as if her presence required some response i dont know who you are she said politely or why you have come i did not send for you and i seek no counseling there is no purpose you can serve here except the easing of your own sense of duty please feel released from obligation and leave there is probably someone you can serve elsewhere i am a physician anna explained anastasius zarides i came because bishop constantine is deeply concerned for you he told me you are the finest woman he knows there is no comfort in being fine alone theodosia said bitterly there is not much comfort in doing anything alone anna replied i hadnt imagined you did it for comfort from what bishop constantine said i had thought it was simply who you were theodosia turned slowly and looked at her very slight surprise in her face but no light no hope is that supposed to cure me she said with mockery i have no interest in being a saint perhaps you would like to be dead but you havent the anger yet to commit that sin because it would be irrevocable or perhaps you are just afraid of the physical pain of dying please stop insulting me and go away theodosia said clearly i have no need of you she looked back out of the window would you want him back if he came anna asked her no then theodosia drew in her breath sharply and turned to face anna again im not grieving for him i am mourning what i believed he was perhaps you cant understand that do you imagine you are the only person to taste the dregs of disillusion did you not understand me when i told you to go away yes the words are simple enough you keep twisting your hands your eyes are sunken and your color is bad do you have a headache i ache everywhere theodosia replied you are not drinking enough your skin will begin to hurt soon i expect then your stomach although i imagine that pains you already and you will become constipated theodosia winced that is too personal and it is not your business i am a physician are you trying to punish someone by deliberately afflicting your body do you imagine your husband cares my god you are cruel youre heartless theodosia accused your body doesnt care about just or unjust only practical anna pointed out i cannot stop your heart aching any more than i could stop my own but i can heal your body if you dont leave it too long oh give me the herbs then go away and leave me in peace theodosia said impatiently but anna stayed until theodosia was asleep and she returned every day for the next week then every second or third day the grief did not go but the urgency of it abated they spoke together of many things seldom personal more of art and philosophy of tastes in food of works of literature and thought thank you constantine said to anna a little more than a month later your gentleness of spirit has bound the wound perhaps in time god may heal it i am truly grateful anna had seen theodosia at her deepest distress at her most vulnerable and humiliated anna understood very well why she did not wish their association to continue it was forever taking the plaster off the wound to look at it again it was wiser to leave it alone to mend unseen she acknowledged constantines thanks and changed the subject seventythree anna picked delicately at the herb leaves in her small garden it was time to harvest many of them the wild poppy heads were nearly ready to gather she watered and tended the hellebore aconite digitalis pennyroyal and the mandrake she was carefully encouraging if it grew successfully she would take some of it to avram shachar it would be a small gift in return for all his kindness here in the shelter of the house on one side and the outer wall on the other the sun was warm on her shoulders a memory of summer as the year faded fast if the union did not become real enough to hold off charles of anjou and his crusaders next summer might be the last before they attacked would she be one of those who tried to escape or would she stay as perhaps a physician should she would be needed here and afterward what then life in an occupied city under an enforced crusader rule there would be no orthodox church then but if she was honest it was becoming more and more difficult for her to ally wholeheartedly with the orthodox faith she was beginning to accept that the way to god was a solitary one born of a passion and a hunger of the spirit that no hierarchy no ritual however beautiful could give you nor in the end prevent you from achieving she missed giuliano she could still remember as if it had been moments ago the look in his face when he had seen her in a dress it was almost as if part of him had known and been repelled so intensely that it had churned his stomach filled his mind with an inner betrayal he could not bear afterward on the voyage back he had made a massive effort of will to forget it but nothing could erase the knowledge from his mind or hers in a way they had gone back almost to the beginning again strangers feeling their way delicately now she would do for him the only thing she could release him from his own sense of being tainted by his mothers betrayal unloved and possibly unable to love as if her blood in him were a poison in his soul if she was able to discover more perhaps it would not be as bad as zoe had said where would zoe have looked for maddalena agallon was there still an agallon family in constantinople or had they remained in the cities of their exile anna collected what she had harvested and took it inside she washed her hands separated the leaves and roots labeled them and put them away all except the lemon thyme and the mandrake root big enough to harvest she wrapped them separately to take she would begin her quest by asking shachar months passed as she awaited his answers she came in answer to his summons the heavy skies of early winter were closing in and his message told her to come warmly clothed and prepared for a long ride i have made inquiries about the agallons we are going to a monastery shachar informed her it is several miles outside the city we may not be back until morning she felt a quickening in her pulse fear and surprise he smiled leading the way through to the back courtyard of his house where she had never been before two mules were ready and obviously he intended to leave without delay they were a mile beyond the outskirts of the city and it was dark almost moonless when he spoke to her quietly i have found maddalenas sister eudoxia i have little idea what she will tell you but she is old and ill a nun in a monastery you are calling as a physician to see her and possibly treat her you may ask what you wish but you will have to accept whatever she says and under whatever conditions she imposes your treatment is not conditional if she chooses to tell you nothing then still you will do your best for her i she said quickly what about you i am a jew he reminded her i will be your manservant i know the way and you do not i will wait outside you are both a christian and a eunuch the ideal person to treat a nun they rode together in silent companionship for another two hours until the black mass of the monastery loomed out of the shadows on the hillside it was a huge building with small high windows like a fortress or a prison shachar was admitted only as far as the shelter of the kitchen anna was conducted along narrow stone corridors to a cell where an old woman lay on the bed her face was ravaged by age and grief but it still held the remnants of great beauty anna did not need to ask who she was the likeness to giuliano jarred her as if she had been physically struck she tried to swallow the tightness in her throat and thanked the nun who had escorted her then stepped into the room there was a plain wooden crucifix above the bed and near the door was a dark severe and beautiful icon of mary sister eudoxia she said quietly the woman opened her eyes curiously and then sat up a little farther on the bed the physician they are kind to have sent for you but you are wasting your time young man there is no cure for age except gods cure and i think i shall gain that quite soon do you have pain anna asked sitting down only such as mortality and regret bring to all of us eudoxia replied anna reached for her pulse and felt it thin but regular enough she did not have a fever it is not a trouble do you sleep well well enough are you sure is there nothing i can do for you no discomfort i can ease perhaps i could sleep better sometimes i dream i would like to do that less the old woman replied with a slight smile can you help that a draft could ease you what about pain i am stiff but that is time catching up with me sister eudoxia now that the moment had come what anna had to say seemed intrusive and she was ashamed the old woman looked at her curiously waiting then she frowned what troubles you physician are you looking for a way to tell me i am going to die i have made peace with it there is something i would like very much to know and only you can tell me anna began i recently sailed to acre on a venetian ship the captain was giuliano dandolo she saw the shock in eudoxias face the sudden leap of pain giuliano eudoxia said no more than a breath between her lips can you tell me about his mother anna asked the truth i will tell him only if you give me permission to he suffers bitterly believing that she left him willingly not loving or wanting him eudoxia put a frail blueveined hand up to her cheek fingers still slender maddalena ran away with giovanni dandolo she said quietly they were married in sicily our father followed her found her and took her away by force he brought her back to nicea he married her to the man he had chosen for her in the first place but her marriage to dandolo anna protested father had it annulled he did not know that maddalena was already with child eudoxia was pale tears welled in her eyes anna leaned over with a soft muslin and wiped them gently giuliano she asked her husband accepted the situation to begin with he took maddalena to live some distance away however when the baby was born and was a boy he became jealous he was brutal not only to maddalena but he threatened the child also at first it was only in little ways and maddalena thought he would get over it her voice was strained with old grief sharp again as when it was new but maddalenas husband knew she still loved the boys father and every time he looked at the child it was a reminder another twist to the knife of his jealousy his violence increased giuliano began to have accidents twice the servants rescued him only just in time from being seriously injured perhaps killed anna could imagine it only too vividly the fear the shame the constant anxiety to protect the boy maddalena took him and fled eudoxia continued she came to me i was married then and happy enough my husband bored me she flinched at the admission he was wealthy and gave me a good life but he could not give me children in fact he could not she left the sentence unfinished anna smiled and touched the thin hand on top of the nuns gown did you help maddalena i did as she asked which was that i should rear the child as my own my husband agreed i think at first he was quite happy to do it i took giuliano and gave maddalena what support i could she blinked but not fast enough to hold the tears i loved the boy go on anna whispered all was well until giuliano was five my husband became possessive and even more dogmatic more boring i she let out her breath in a sigh i was beautiful when i was younger like maddalena we were so alike people sometimes mistook one of us for the other anna waited i was lonely both in mind and in body eudoxia went on i took a loverin fact more than one i behaved badly my husband accused me of being a common whore and said that he had witnesses to prove it she gave a deep shuddering sigh maddalena took the blame she insisted it was she and not i who had been with the man she did it for giulianos sakei know thatnot mine i could care for the boy she couldnt anna found she could barely swallow the pain choking her throat maddalena was found guilty and suffered the penalty for being a whore she died not long afterward beaten and destitute i think by then she wanted to die she never stopped loving giovanni dandolo and there was nothing else left for her eudoxias voice was choked with tears my husband knew it was i who had been in the tavern that night and he knew why maddalena had lied for me he forced me to grant him a divorce and to take the nuns veil but he refused to take giuliano he would put him on the street or sell him to some dealer in children for god knows what use she shivered i took him myself i ran away from nicea and begged and stole and prostituted my way to venice with him there i gave him to his father a dandolo he wasnt difficult to find i thought of staying in venice even of dying there but i hadnt the courage there was something in me which needed a better atonement than that i came back and took the veil as i had promised my husband i would i have been here nearly forty years perhaps i have made my peace anna nodded the tears wet on her own face a human mistake a loneliness and a hunger so easy to understand of course you have made your peace now may i bring giuliano so you can tell him pleaseplease do eudoxia cried i i did not even know if he was still alive tell me is he a good man a happy man he is very good anna replied and this will give him a greater gift of happiness than anything else possible thank you eudoxia sighed dont bother with the draft for sleep i shant need it seventyfour giuliano had given the icon to the pope he would have liked to give it back to michael but with reluctance he understood why that could not be if he did it would only necessitate michael packing it up and sending it again it could be lost at sea especially at this time of year so when the popes envoy had approached him in venice he had produced the icon immediately and presented it to the man to take with him to rome a gift from the venetian republic which had rescued it from pirates no one believed that but it did not matter they split a good bottle of venetian wine laughed hard and the envoy left with the icon well guarded by a number of soldiers giuliano left for constantinople and arrived six weeks later sailing up the sea of marmara against a heavy wind and glad to dock at last in the golden horn the familiar outline of the great lighthouse the warm red of the hagia sophia were strangely pleasing to his mind yet even as he thought of it he was also aware that it was an illusion of safety as soon as he stepped ashore the harbormaster gave him a letter with his name on it and the word urgent on the outside it had already been there two days dear giuliano through the good offices of my friend avram shachar i have found a close relative of your mother however there is little time she is old and very fragile i have visited her and i fear she has not long left she told me the truth of your parents and i could repeat it to you myself but it would be far better that you should hear it from her it would also bring her great peace i promise you it is a story you will want to hear anastasius giuliano thanked the harbormaster and returned to his ship he handed over command to his lieutenant and without even changing his sea clothes he went straight to anastasiuss house anastasius stood at his doorway talking to leo he turned and saw giuliano and his face lit with pleasure giuliano strode forward and clasped his hand forgetting for a moment how slender it was he eased his grasp thank you more than i can say anastasius took a step backward but he was still smiling he regarded giulianos disheveled clothes the leather worn with use and still stained here and there by salt water we should go tonight it will be a hard ride he said apologetically but we shouldnt wait giuliano dismissed the inconvenience instantly but was glad to rest an hour or two leo went to hire horses for the journey and anastasius himself prepared and served them a brief meal is simonis ill giuliano asked anastasius smiled bleakly she has chosen to live elsewhere she comes in during the day now and then he did not add any more and giuliano sensed that the subject was painful they set out at dusk at first riding side by side he was excited longing to hear the story afraid of what it would be how it might damage the fragile defense he had built against the truth rather than endure his own thoughts he told her about the icon and how he had stolen it from vicenze replacing it with the other picture and what he had heard of its unveiling in front of the pope and all the cardinals they both laughed so hard that for several minutes they were breathless then the road narrowed and they were obliged to go single file and further conversation was impossible when at last they arrived at the monastery they were tired and cold but they did little more than take a hot drink and wash off the dirt of travel before anastasius asked to see eudoxia they found her pale breathing shallowly and close to death but her joy at seeing giuliano knowing immediately who he was transfigured her so like your mother she whispered touching his face with her fragile hand cold when he clasped it in his she told him the story as she had told it to anastasius giuliano was not ashamed to weep for his mother for his own misjudgment of her or for eudoxia he stayed with her for most of the night tiptoeing away to his own rough bed only toward dawn he rose late the following day and attended a service with the nuns he could never thank his aunt enough he sat with her again helped her eat a little and drink all the time telling her about his life his travels at sea and especially his journey to jerusalem he found it hard to leave but her strength was slipping away and he knew it was right to let her rest there was a peace in her smile a calmness in her that had not been there upon their arrival and most profoundly he marveled at the truth his mother had loved him all that had been broken inside him was healing how could he ever thank anastasius for that he and anastasius set out riding single file again down the new pathway and he was glad of the chance to be alone with his thoughts in one day what had been a feeling of abandonment and shame had become the deepest love imaginable his mother had sacrificed every happiness she had so that he would survive and be loved now his byzantine heritage was rich with passionate lifelong and selfless love surely no child had been loved more he was glad that in the darkness of the long ride anastasius could not see the tears on his face and that with the frequent need to pass single file on the rough road there was little chance to speak seventyfive anna sat with eirene vatatzes in her rich unfeminine bedroom with its somber colors and rigid patterns on the walls it was at once beautiful and lonely now it smelled stale of perspiration and decay she did all she could for eirene to lessen the pain and simply by being there by a touch a word to still some of her fear she did not lie to her it would have been pointless she knew eirene would not recover this time each day her strength lessened and her times of complete lucidity became briefer anna dearly wished that she could ask eirene some of the unanswered questions about the plot to usurp michael eirene tossed in the bed turning over dragging the sheet with her she moaned in pain anna leaned over and straightened it where it was crumpled then dipped a small cloth in a bowl of cool water and herbs and wrung it out freeing the perfume of it into the air she placed the cloth gently on eirenes brow and for a few moments she was quiet maybe only demetrioss intentions now were important but eirene was annas patient and she could not tax her with it for nearly an hour she lay motionless on the bed as if she were sinking into the last peace of death then she gasped and started turning again and again tangling the covers zoe she said suddenly her eyes were closed but there was such an expression of ferocity in her face that it was hard to believe she was not conscious soon youll be all alone she whispered well be dead what will you do then nobody to love nobody to hate anna stiffened she knew what eirene was thinkingzoe and gregory the jealousy still corroded her inside nothing could take that away anna put out her hand and laid it gently on eirenes wrist he had to die eirene began again shaking her head abruptly from side to side deserved it anna was startled was eirenes unforgiveness for her husband really so deep that she had wanted gregory dead his throat torn out and his body left bleeding on the stones of some street he did not know no he didnt deserve it anna said aloud not knowing if eirene still remembered what she had said or even if she could hear anything at all outside her own head eirenes voice came back so strongly it startled her yes he did he kept the icons his father stole when they were leaving the burning city he should have given them back i could have killed him myself if id dared i should have anna looked at her and saw her eyes were open and clear the anger burning hot in them you knew that gregory had the icons from the sack of anna asked not gregory you fool eirene said witheringly now fully conscious his cousin arsenios thats why zoe killed him she closed her eyes again as if too weary to be bothered with anyone so stupid gregory knew that she added as if it were an afterthought revenge always revenge she sighed and seemed to drift into sleep again anna pieced it together zoe had killed arsenios in revenge for his keeping the icons and gregory knew it he would have felt compelled to retaliate for his cousins death and knowing that zoe had struck first but zoes revenge had not been only arsenioss death it was his daughters humiliation and his sons death as well and unwittingly anna had contributed to that in her medical treatment of the daughter she was cold now at the thought no wonder eirene hated zoe how could she not she looked down now at her lying on the bed eirenes face was not so much at peace as totally empty of passion or even intelligence had gregory ever loved her did he care about her ugliness or had she cared about it so much that in the end she had forced him to care also for another two days eirene seemed to remain much the same she was often asleep but apparently easier in her mind the pain less acute then quite suddenly she became worse she woke in the night barely able to move her body drenched in sweat anna treated her with herbs and drugs as much as she dared but sometime after midnight of the third day anna was standing close to the bed looking at eirene and she saw that even in the warm glow of the candlelight her face was haggard and there was a gray pallor to her skin eirene opened her sunken clouded eyes and stared at anna anna ached with pity for her but eirene was beyond physical help would you like me to send for demetrios given up at last eirenes lips were dry and her throat tight give me some more of that herb that tastes like gall she blinked and stared at anna she must know she had not long and the breaking of her body consumed her anna ached to help her but if she gave eirene another dose of the poppy it might kill her she decided to do it anyway anna nodded and turned aside to reach for the small bottle she would put it with a lot of waterin fact mostly water the illusion of opium might help as much as the reality after eirene took three or four sips anna laid her back as gently as she could straightened the covers then went to the door and called the servant fetch demetrios she told him i think she has not long left the servant went away footsteps rapid on the tiled floor he returned ten minutes later to say that demetrios had gone out earlier and not yet returned apparently he had not expected to be needed so soon if he returns tell him his mother is dying anna answered then turned away and went back into the room the candle guttered she lit another suddenly eirene opened her eyes again and her voice was quite clear im going to die before morning arent i i think so anna replied honestly fetch demetrios i have something i need to give him i already sent for him hes not in the house and the servant cannot tell me where he is eirene was silent for a few moments then i suppose youll have to do she said at last gregory thought zoe loved him but she betrayed him with michael she said you didnt know that did you there was satisfaction in her michael is helenas father imagine that that would have given bessarion a double right to the throne dont you see a chill thought struck anna this could alter more than she could imagine it explained helenas part in the usurpation totally how do you know that helena is really michaels child she asked i have letters eirene said biting her lip as the pain washed over her again from him to zoe anna was skeptical how did you get them eirene smiled although it was more a baring of the teeth gregory took them does zoe know you have these letters she knows gregory did she didnt know i took them from him he never dared challenge me for them back annas mind was in turmoil racing from one new meaning to another helena doesnt know she asked yet again it is better she doesnt eirene repeated wearily she would become impossible to manage why should i believe all this because it is true eirene replied i bequeathed some of the letters to helena my cousin will give them to her in time but the rest are there in my safe box the key is under my pillow give them to demetrios she smiled slightly once helena knows then shell have the power thats why zoe has never told her she took a long shuddering breath but now i dont care itll be hell for zoe every day a faint smile parted her lips as if to taste something sweet she closed her eyes and gradually all expression emptied out of her face she slept for perhaps half an hour there was a noise in the corridor outside and the door swung open demetrios came in dalmatica swirling wet from the rain his eyes dark and angry mother he said quietly mother eirene opened her eyes taking several moments to focus demetrios im here good get anastasius to give you the letters dont lose them dont throw she took a long deep breath and let it out with a sigh a little gasp in her throat then silence demetrios waited for several more minutes and then stood up shes gone what letters was she talking about where are they anna took the key from under the pillow and went to the box behind the icon on the wall as eirene had told her the letters were in a neatly tied bundle thank you he said taking them from her hand you can go i would rather be alone with her there was nothing for anna to do but obey seventysix zoe heard of eirenes death without surprise she had been ill for some time it was not exactly grief zoe felt for they had been both friends and enemies what troubled her was that they had also been coconspirators against michael when zoe had believed that bessarion could have usurped the throne and led a resistance against the union with rome and that such a thing would have saved both constantinople and the church now she knew that that could never have succeeded justinian had realized it and done what zoe should have done herself his action had had the advantage that it was he who had paid the price for it not she the thought that gnawed at the back of her mind as she paced the floor in her marvelous room was that anastasius inquisitive and unpredictable was the one who had treated eirene in her last days sometimes when people are ill frightened and realizing that death cannot be held at bay any longer they tell secrets they never would have were they going to face the results and then there was helena she had changed since eirenes death she had always been arrogant but there was a selfconfidence in her now that was disturbing as if nothing frightened her anymore did she think that now eirene was dead demetrios would marry her that made no sense he would have to observe a decent period of mourning but as zoe thought back on helenas mood her behavior there was certainly no new warmth toward demetrios if anything rather the opposite she seemed consumed in herself it was something far more powerful than security or status something perhaps like a glimpse of the throne could there be another attempt at usurpation one that this time might succeed the situation was vastly changed and this time zoe would have no part in it but could she betray it to michael she could not her part in the last plot had been too close if helena attempted and failed zoe would be ruined michael was their only hope his overthrow would bring chaos to the empire and to her personally a whole new balance of relationships worst of all helena would exercise her longhopedfor revenge in the end survival was all byzantium must not be raped again whatever was paid to prevent that it was not too much seventyseven the man who brought the message from the pope was obviously tired and profoundly unhappy courtesy required that palombara offer him refreshment but as soon as the servant had gone to prepare it he pleaded to know the news god knows we tried to create a union but we have failed the man said miserably the king of the two sicilies is gathering more ships and more allies with every passing week and we can no longer pretend that the orthodox church is one with us in spirit and intent it is only too obvious that their acceptance of our hand of friendship is a farce a convenience to protect their physical safety no more palombaras mind was heavy with the terrible inevitability of it yet he had hoped that somehow the passion for survival would overcome if you wish to return to rome my lord the holy father gives you leave to do so the messengers voice dropped the holy father has recognized that he no longer has any control over the actions of the king there will be another crusade perhaps as soon as and it will be an army such as we have not seen before he met palombaras eyes but if you wish to remain in constantinople at least for the time being there may be some christian work to do here he made the sign of the cross naturally in the roman way after the man had gone palombara remained alone in the great room watching the afternoon sun sink over the ferries and water taxies and the distant business of the harbor rome saw constantinoples tolerance of ideas as a moral laxity its patience with even the most ridiculous or abstruse idea rather than suppression of it to be a weakness they did not see that blind obedience eventually ended in the suffocation of thought palombara did not want to return to rome and work at some timeserving job shuffling papers delivering messages playing at the politics of office he faced the window and the light came in on his face he closed his eyes and felt its warmth on his eyelids the darkness was closing in but he was not yet ready to give up if charles of anjou landed here palombara might save something from the wreckage definitely he could not simply walk away he found the words quite clear in his mind please dear lord do not let all this be destroyed please do not let us do that to themor to ourselves he stood silent for a moment amen he added seventyeight giuliano dandolo returned to venice with a ship filled with gold from all over europe in england spain france and the holy roman empire men were preparing for a great crusade some of the ships were built already the shipyards worked night and day charles of anjou had paid his share of the contract he would receive what he had ordered nevertheless giuliano was not happy as he stood on the balcony and stared at the splendor of the dying sun over the adriatic the doge had told him that venice had abrogated the treaty it had made with byzantium it had lasted just two years giuliano had had nothing to do with it neither its creation nor its destruction yet he felt racked with shame for the betrayal of it he stared at the light on the water watching it change the translucency of it the moving shadows were so subtle that one nameless tone vanished into another it was like the bosphorus what would happen to constantinople when the crusaders landed the whole issue of fighting over faith was absurd how far from the teachings of christ were all these quarrels as to who had power or rights over what he remembered the conversations he had had with anastasius at sea and in that desolate site that might or might not have been golgotha the thought of anastasius cut to the heart of his pain how would the crusaders treat him how could he protect himself the thought of it was too terrible to allow into giulianos mind it was the whole city that mattered and all the lands around it but in the end as perhaps with everyone it all came down to those you knew the faces the voices the people you broke bread with and who trusted you the shadows were stronger the light was fading rapidly seventynine anna had been called yet again to the house of joanna strabomytes even though the servants did not know if there was money left to pay her it did not matter payment was not part of annas decision to come she was here not to prolong her suffering only to ease the pain of her letting go joanna was wasted by disease so that she looked far more than her fortyodd years and now she had little time left the draft anna had given her had afforded an hour or so of peace and she was no longer troubled by needless pain of body or the torment of mind that twisted inside her she had said little about it it had wounded her so deeply it had robbed her of words other than the same question over and overcouldnt her husband have waited leonicus had left joanna as she was dying because he was in love with theodosia whose own husband had so cruelly abandoned her leonicus would not wait until he was free he wished his own happiness now this week this month or perhaps theodosia wanted it and he had not had the courage or the honor to deny her for once the hot still room was silent as anna stood at the end of the bed making certain joanna was really asleep before she turned and walked away she went out briefly into the courtyard where in spite of the summer heat she could at least escape from the odor of herbs and the bodily functions of the dying theodosia had been a religious woman all her life anna pictured her at prayer kneeling before constantine in devout gratitude for the sacrament of repentance and absolution theodosia knew the bitterness the shock of being rejected how could she of all people do this to another woman what sweetness was there in taking any man at such a price would anna have wanted even giuliano this way theodosia had been in good health when her husband had gone and it had hurt her almost beyond bearing bringing her to the edge of suicide anna remembered it still with pity joanna was ill and dying could theodosia really mean to do this was joanna suffering some kind of delusion a despair that was part of her illness perhaps it was annas judgment that was hasty partial in knowledge and therefore completely unfair during one of joannas better spells anna gave careful instructions to the servants then after returning to her own home to collect more herbs she went to theodosias house and requested to see her i am sorry but the lady theodosia is unable to receive you the servant said some moments later anna insisted upon the urgency and importance of her errand the servant took the request again the second time it was leonicus who came to the entrance himself there was a sadness in his eyes as well as a certain anger when he faced anna i am sorry but theodosia does not wish to speak with you he said she has no need of your services and there is really nothing further to add thank you for coming but please do not do so again he turned and walked away leaving the servant to close the door in annas face anna returned to complete her care for leonicuss wife and ease her pain of mind and body as well as she could she mixed herbs for her sat with her when she could not sleep spoke to her of anything and everything she could think of that was funny kind or offered any beauty and then she held her hand as her consciousness slipped away and then finally her life by september much of the overt anger at romes demands upon the church was swept away by the more urgent anxieties of news about the gathering armies to the west anna was in the blachernae palace having attended various eunuchs who were indisposed with minor illnesses when she was sent for to go to nicephorass rooms she found him unusually grim his face dark with anxiety i have just received news from bishop palombara nicephoras said the pope is dead again i mean another pope she could scarcely believe it so we have no leader in rome to argue with even if we wanted to its far worse than that he said quickly no longer even attempting to mask his fear pope nicholas exacted from charles of anjou an oath not to attack byzantium nicholass death frees him from that apparently oaths do not carry from one pope to another bitter humor flashed in his eyes for an instant then was gone anna was stunned what does the emperor say she heard her voice wavering i am about to tell him nicephoras drew in his breath deeply then let it out in a sigh he will find it very hard i would like you to come with me in case he is ill she answered only with a nod and as he turned to lead the way to the emperors rooms she followed him with a heavy sense of foreboding michael was sitting at a table writing when she entered behind nicephoras the strong sunlight slanted across the chair the papers spread across the tabletop and the assorted pens it was a cruel light and it laid bare his weariness the heavy gray was not only in his hair but in his beard but more than that there were shadows around his eyes and his skin had a thin papery texture even the iron will that had carried him to military victory was fading perhaps harder than that of arms was the victory of the mind over the fractiousness of his people the ceaseless threats to his power his life his family the quarrels over every conceivable issue arising from union with rome and every year there was at least one ugly suggestion that this person or that had more right to the throne than he he was never safe from the threat of a usurper yes he asked looking up at nicephoras reading bad news in the mans face he tensed a tightening of expression that was barely perceptible to anna briefly nicephoras told the emperor that pope nicholas iii was dead there was no need to add that there was now nothing to prevent charles of anjou from sacking constantinople as he wanted to and in time conquering what was left of the byzantine empire michael sat perfectly still absorbing the shock anna saw the exhaustion in him the fight not to crumple under the blow he had preserved his people in the city for eighteen long difficult years and now she was seeing clearly at what cost it had been to himself was it surprising if he felt beaten even by fate now that yet another pope was dead anna felt it too a gathering of dread she was afraid of a future without him constantine was ill again and sent for anna she took the herbs she thought she would need and followed his servant along the busy street and finally up the steps into constantines increasingly handsome house every time she went there there was some new ornament or embellishment always the gift of a grateful petitioner that the bishop explained he could not refuse she found him lying in his bed his face pale from the position of his heavy body he was apparently in some discomfort she considered it was probably caused largely by anxiety a stomach too clenched with emotion to digest his food i must be well in two weeks time he told her with some concern his eyes narrowed his lips tight i will do all i can she promised you would greatly improve your health if you were to rest more rest his body flinched as if she had hurt him every hour is precious do you not know the peril we are in i know but your health still demands that you rest what is happening in two weeks time he smiled i am going to perform the marriage ceremony for leonicus strabomytes and theodosia it will be in the hagia sophiaa truly splendid occasion an example to the people of the blessing and mercy of god it will uplift everyone and fire a new piety in them anna assumed she must have misunderstood theodosia skleros he looked at her steadily does your largeness of heart not extend to her anastasius i have given theodosia a special icon of the blessed virgin mary as a token of her absolution anna was amazed theodosia and leonicus committed real sin and they did it knowingly and with choice they deliberately took what was not theirs and they kept it they havent repented a jot she said so to him harshly her words tearing out of her all the loneliness and her own weight of guilt that she had carried through the years knowing the fault was still in her it is a mockery of those who are truly sorry and have paid long and bitterly i asked no payment of her except humility and obedience to the church he retorted you have sins also anastasius it ill becomes you to judge when you yourself have neither confessed nor repented i dont know what your sins are but they are heavy and deep i know that because i see it in your eyes i know you ache to confess and find absolution but your pride holds you prisoner and you cling to it rather than to the church she said nothing almost breathless with the accuracy of his blow deep as the bone shocking her with pain he sat up his hand on her wrist his face close to hers you are in sin anastasius come to me and confess in humility and i will give you pardon she was frozen inside as if he had in some profound way assaulted her she could only remove his fingers from her arm and straighten the bottles on the table then turn and leave walking in a daze of misery and wild twisting confusion never in her life had she felt more absolutely alone eighty it was autumn of a month after the wedding before anna saw theodosia again they passed in the street without speaking and anna felt strangely snubbed while being quite aware that it was foolish of her they had not been friends they had shared an experience of deep pain in theodosias life and it was easy to understand why she would avoid someone who had seen her at her most vulnerable she stood in the street the wind harsh in her face perhaps constantine was right did anna fail to forgive theodosia because she could not forgive herself for eustathius and the child she had not wanted because it would have been his it was she who was wrong not theodosia she should go to her and apologize it would be galling bitter to swallow but nothing less would make it right she started to walk again urgently even up the steepening incline needing to have the apology made before her resolve weakened theodosia received her reluctantly she stood looking toward the window anna barely noticed that the room was more ornate than before the floor newly tiled in marble larger torch brackets gilded at the top thank you for coming theodosia said politely but i believe i told you last time you called that i have no need of your services she turned and looked momentarily at anna and there was a curious emptiness in her eyes i came to apologize to you anna said i presumed to think that you could not have been absolved for taking joannas husband from her when she was dying that was arrogant of me to the point of absurdity it is none of my business and i have no right even to think it theodosia shrugged slightly yes it is arrogant but i accept your apology i have the churchs absolution and that is really all that counts she half turned away anna contradicted her your face your eyes say that it doesnt count at all because you dont believe it it isnt a matter of belief its fact bishop constantine said so theodosia replied tartly and as you say it is not your concern the churchs absolution or gods anna refused to be dismissed theodosia blinked i am not sure that i believe in god or resurrection and eternity in your christian sense of course i cant imagine time ending no one can it will go on what else could it do a kind of endless desert stretching without purpose into the darkness you dont believe in heaven countered anna but surely what you have described is hell or one kind of hell if not the deepest theodosias voice was tinged with sarcasm is there deeper than that the deepest would be to have held heaven in your hands and let it slip away to have known what it was and then lost it anna replied and would the god you believe in do that to anyone theodosia challenged its bestial god doesnt do it anna answered her without hesitation theodosias voice was harsh with pain are you saying i did that to myself anna opened her mouth to deny it then realized it was dishonest i have no idea she said did you have heaven or only something that was good and at least a belief in joy in some reachable future theodosia stared at her anger confusion and grief in her face anna felt a moment of pity so fierce it took her breath away there is a way back she said impulsively then instantly knew it was a mistake back to what theodosia asked surprise in her voice as if she had taken a step only to find the ground beneath her was no longer there now it was anna who turned away walking alone to the door and outside into the street she moved along the cobbles slowly up steps and down them punishment was for societys sense of order necessary for survival theodosia executed her own punishment and it was far more terrible than god would have given her because it was destructive gods punishment should be for the healing of the sinner freeing him from the sin to move on without it by denying theodosias sin constantine had injured her in lying and she had injured herself because she knew better anna turned the corner and the wind was cold in her face she could not let the matter rest she went to constantine and found him busy ministering to supplicants of one sort or another what can i do for you anastasius he asked guardedly they were in his ochercolored room facing onto the courtyard there was no purpose in trying to be tactful i have just visited theodosia she has lost the strength and comfort of her faith nonsense constantine said sharply she attends mass every sunday i did not say she has fallen from the church anna replied patiently i said she is without that inner light of hope the trust that keeps us going even when we cannot see the way at all but still feel the love of god in the dark she saw a flash of amazement in constantines eyes as if he had caught a glimpse of something he had barely guessed at before anna went on with a surge of belief within herself she does not believe in a god who overlooks her offense without healing it as if neither she nor it mattered if she were to offer some deep penitence a sacrifice of something important to her she might be able to believe again constantine looked at her with a strange mixture of wonder and hostility what had you in mind he said coldly perhaps to part from leonicus for a whilesay two years it was being with him when joanna was dying that was wrong she could devote her time to caring for the sick as joanna was then she would come back from it whole able to take up and treasure what she had paid for albeit with pain then she could accept forgiveness because she was honest constantine raised his eyebrows are you saying that she has not accepted gods absolution he said incredulously the churchs not gods please at least offer theodosia the chance to earn back her faith anna pleaded what are any of us without it the shadows are closing in everywhere armies on the outside and selfishness fear and doubt within if we havent even a pinpoint of faith that god is absolutely good a pure love of the heart and soul what hope is there for any of us constantine blinked and stared at her ill see her he conceded but she wont agree eightyone constantine had been certain at the time he gave absolution to theodosia that he was the instrument of her salvation and that she would be eternally grateful to him for that now he felt the deep gnawing pain inside him that anastasius was right he recalled theodosias desperate humiliation after her husband left her she had been grateful for constantines support his assurance his constant promise to her of gods guidance and blessing lately when they met she was courteous but her eyes were blank she received him and he felt his belly tighten with apprehension bishop constantine she said courteously coming forward to greet him how are you she looked magnificent in an emerald green embroidered tunic and a dalmatica crusted with gold gold ornaments in her dark hair somehow the hues rich as they were leached the color out of her skin well enough he replied considering that we live in such threatening times we do she agreed turning her eyes away as if regarding some danger beyond the gorgeous painted walls of the room may i offer you refreshment perhaps some almonds or dates thank you having food would make his task easier it would be too discourteous to ask him to leave while he was eating i have not had time to speak with you in the last month or two you look disturbed is there anything with which i can help you i am well i assure you she said he had given much thought as to how he could broach the subject of penitence with any delicacy at all you have not been to confession lately theodosia you are a fine woman you have been as long as i have known you but we all fall short at times even if it is no more than a lack of complete trust in god and his church that is a sin you know one it is hard not to commit we all have doubts anxieties fear of the unknown what is it you expect me to confess she asked and he heard the bitterness in her voice anastasius was right constantine looked around the room where is the icon he asked theodosia would know which one he meant there was only one icon that had passed between them his gift to mark her absolution and return to the church in my private apartments she replied does it help your faith to look at her and remember her sublime trust in gods will he asked be it unto me according to thy word he quoted marys answer when gabriel had told her she would be the mother of christ the silence was harsh between them confession and penitence can heal all mortal sin he said gently that is the atonement of christ she faced him believe what you wish to bishop if it comforts you i no longer have that certainty perhaps one day i may regain it but there is nothing you can do for me he was annoyed she had no right to speak to him in such a way as if the sacrament of the church were ineffectual if you accepted a penance he said firmly such as parting from leonicus for a space and devoting yourself to caring for the sick then i do not need a penance bishop she cut off his words you have already absolved me from any error i may have committed if my faith is less than it should be that is my loss now please leave before leonicus returns i do not wish him to think that i have been confiding in you do you need human love so much that you would forfeit divine love to keep even the semblance of it he asked with a terrible pity i can love a human being bishop theodosia said fiercely i cannot love a principle men adhere to when it suits them what you preach is a set of myths and ordinances rules that move with your own convenience leonicus is a human man not perfect maybe as you say not even loyal but real he speaks to me answers me smiles to see me even needs me at times he bowed to the inevitable you will change your mind one day theodosia the church will be here and willing to forgive please leave she said softly you dont love god any more than i do you love your office your robes your authority your safety from having to think for yourself or from facing the fact that you are alone and you mean nothingjust like the rest of us constantine stared at her shuddering in her despair as if it were cold water lapping around his feet ice cold as it crept up to his knees his thighs the mutilation where his organs should have been was it true of him also that it was the church he loved not god the order the authority the illusion of power and not the passionate exquisite everlasting love of god he refused to think of it thrusting it out of his mind he turned on his heel and strode out i offered it to her he told anastasius later but she would not accept any penance at all but i had to try he looked at anastasius searching for the respect that should have been in his eyes the acknowledgment of patience and honor he saw only contempt as if he were making excuses it appalled him how much that hurt your arrogance is blasphemous constantine cried out in sudden overwhelming outrage you have no humility you are quick to suggest penance for theodosia but your own sins go unconfessed come back to me when you can do so on your knees whitefaced anastasius walked away leaving the bishop glaring at his back still wanting to say more but lost for words hard enough sharp enough to wound the heart the pain of annas disillusion was deep she had once seen so much that was good in constantine perhaps because she needed to now the ordinances of the church were closed to her because she had not the belief to trust them how could she in offering such an empty forgiveness to theodosia constantine had poured away the possibility of annas absolution also she could lean only on her own understanding of god seeking that flame in the night the warmth that wrapped around the heart when she was alone on her knees perhaps that was as it had to be when there was no one beside you you looked upward it is the darkness that tests the light she must accept being alone not looking for the support or the forgiveness of others but working in her mind and her soul until she found it for herself eightytwo zoe paced the floor of her great room each time she turned gazing at the great cross only the back of which carried a name still burned on her heartdandolo the greatest of them all she must create a way to be revenged on him and his heirs on giuliano before the crusaders came again and it was too late the year of was waning fast and the invasion would be soon now perhaps even next year by the window she stopped and stared out at the darkening winter sky helena had been particularly arrogant lately several times zoe had caught a look in her eyes that seemed to be laughter close to mockery as some people see in anothers defeat zoe was growing more and more certain that helena knew michael was her father and that she was planning to use it for her gain perhaps it would be a good idea to send sabas to watch her rather more carefully helena had appeared cooler toward demetrios the signs were tiny a little less voluptuousness in her dress a momentary distraction of mind now and then that clearly had nothing to do with him an inattention to his words was there someone else there was no better pretender to the throne she was still pondering this when one of the servants came in he stood in front of her with his eyes on the beautiful tessellated floor not daring to raise them what she demanded what news could paralyze the idiot like this we have just heard that doge contarini abdicated a few weeks ago he replied there is a new doge in venice of course there is fool she snapped who is it giovanni dandolo his voice cracked with nervous tension she made a suppressed noise of fury and told him to get out he obeyed with indecent haste so there was another dandolo in the ducal palace in venice beyond her reachbut giuliano was not what relationship was there between him and this new doge it did not matter old enrico was common to both of them and that was all that counted giuliano might now be returned to venice to a higher calling she must exact her revenge quickly before that too slipped out of her grasp she was still considering this when an old friend called he came in whitefaced his body tense hands curling and uncurling even as he spoke he stammered over his words you may wish to go although i cant imagine it not now it is too near the end charles of anjous armies are besieging berat berat was the great byzantine fortress in albania just miles away and holding the key to the land route from the west when it falls he went on constantinople will lie open and undefended before him the emperor has no army capable of withstanding an assault from the land or from the sea when the venetian fleet arrives perhaps that will not even be needed they can take what they want of food and stores and sail on to acre she was cold inside as if his framing it in words had made it real zoe he prompted but she did not answer him there was nothing to say she received it in silence as the darkness of the night comes without sound he crossed himself and left her nightmares of childhood returned she woke sweating alone in the darkness even in the winter night her body was seared by a heat that still lay in her dreams but how much longer would that be true when would the acrid smell of smoke the crushing and the screaming be real pictures danced before her of her mother clothes torn thighs scarlet with blood her face distorted with terror trying to crawl back to protect her child when she rose in the morning people around her were packing up ready to leave if the news got worse gathering in little huddles in street corners stopping every stranger to ask if there was any further word zoe put together jewels and artifacts things of great beauty a winged horse in bronze necklaces of gold dishes ewers gemencrusted reliquaries alabaster and cloisonn√© jars and sold them with the money she bought great vats full of pitch and had them piled up on the roofs of her house she would burn the city down herself and destroy the latins in their own flames before she would let constantinople be taken again this time she would die in the fires never would she run away let them all leave if they were coward enough she would do it alone if necessary she would never surrender and she would never run away again eightythree palombara finally returned to rome in february of there was a faint buzz of excitement in the street as he walked toward st peters and the vatican on his first morning back in spite of the cold wind and the beginning of rain there was an energy in the air he came to the open square and crossed it to the steps up to the vatican a group of young priests were standing on the bottom step one of them laughed another chided him gently in french they noticed palombara and spoke to him courteously in heavily accented italian good morning your grace palombara stopped good morning he replied i have been at sea for several weeks from constantinople do we have a new holy father yet one of the young men opened his eyes wide oh yes your grace we have order again and we will have peace the young man crossed himself thanks to the good offices of his majesty of the two sicilies palombara froze what i mean what offices could he exert the young men glanced at each other the holy father restored him as senator of rome he said after his election palombara pointed out of course but his majestys troops surrounded the papal palace at viterbo until the cardinals should reach a decision he smiled broadly it clarified their minds wonderfully and quickly one of the others added with a little laugh palombara found his heart beating high in his chest almost choking him and who is our holy father he was assuredly french simon de brie the first young man answered he has taken the name of martin the fourth thank you palombara said the words with difficulty the french faction had won it was the worst news he could hear he turned to go on up the steps the holy father is not here one of the priests called out after him he lives in orvieto or else in perugia rome is governed by his majesty of the two sicilies the first young man added helpfully charles of anjou in the following days palombara came to appreciate just how profound was the victory of charles of anjou he had assumed that the healing of the rift between rome and byzantium was a firm accomplishment but the last shreds of that loosened and fell apart as he overheard the speculation around him of how finally they would end the wavering and deceit of michael palaeologus and force a true obedience a victory for christendom that had meaning at last palombara was sent for when martin iv was making one of his rare visits to rome the rituals were the same as before the professions of loyalty the pretense at trust mutual respect and of course faith in their ultimate victory palombara looked at simon de brie now martin iv his trim white beard and pale eyes and he felt the coldness enlarging inside him he did not like the man and he certainly did not trust him de brie had spent most of his career as diplomatic adviser to the king of france old loyalties did not die so easily looking into the hard broadboned face of the new holy father palombara was absolutely certain that likewise martin neither liked nor trusted him i have read your reports on constantinople and the obduracy of the emperor michael palaeologus martin spoke in latin but with a considerable french accent our patience is exhausted palombara wondered whether the new pope spoke in the plural as if his office entitled him to think of himself in the royal form or if he actively meant himself and his counselors and advisers he had a growing fear that it was charles of anjou i wish you to return to byzantium martin continued not looking at palombara as if his feelings were irrelevant they know you and more important you know them this situation must be resolved it has dragged on far too long palombara wondered why he did not send a frenchman and as soon as the idea had formed in his mind he knew the answer there was no glory in failure he looked up and met the cool faintly amused stare of the holy father martin raised his hand in blessing eightyfour in march giuliano was in the private quarters of the new doge overlooking the canal seeing the light on the ever shifting water the sound of it through the open windows like the breathing of the sea stirring in its sleep they had been eating a light supper and reminiscing about giulianos father who had been the doges cousin there were exaggerated tales of fishing wine drinking brawls and loves they were laughing when there was a sharp rap on the door and a moment later a stiff gentleman in an embroidered doublet came into the room and bowed from the neck there is extraordinary news from berat your serene highness the gentleman said there is a soldier here with a firsthand account of it if you will receive him yes send him in then give him a good meal and wine the man bowed and left a moment later he conducted in a soldier obviously newly landed still wearing his worn and bloodstained clothes well tell me the doge ordered the fortress at berat has been relieved and charles of anjous army completely routed the man exclaimed your serene highness the doge was startled routed are you sure yes sir the sailor replied apparently hugues de sully himself their great hero undefeated before was captured his face was flushed with his delight not only for the news he carried but clearly also that he should be the one to tell the doge really the doge glanced at giuliano do you know this de sully no sir giuliano admitted a burgundian a huge man enormous a symbol of their invincibility the doge held his hands out far apart to suggest his size with hair like a roof on fire never seemed to get tired so i am told in the last two years he has been ordering boatloads of soldiers horses arms money siege engines he has taken them to the balkans to march first on thessalonica then on to constantinople the doge turned back to the soldier tell me more there was the beginning of a slender thread of skepticism in his voice de sully had an army of above eight thousand men when he marched from durazzo to take berat what happened to it yes highness the soldier agreed his eyes still brilliant with triumph but the byzantines dared not lose berat it holds the gateway through macedonia and thus all the way to constantinople itself lose berat and the empire is anjous for the taking michael palaeologus is no foolwell not militarily anyway but he has no army of size skill or experience to relieve the city when it is surrounded by a force such as de sullys or led by such a man the doge said my information was that they were starving and obliged to smuggle food in by putting it on rafts and floating it down the river by night what happened the soldier grinned i wasnt there but i heard it from several who were de sully was always arrogant but he let it pickle his wits he thought no one would touch him he rode out to inspect the defenses with only a very small guard the byzantines ambushed him and took him prisoner letting his whole army see what they had done his eyes danced with delight it was as if the byzantines had gouged out the hearts of the lot of them the entire angevin army turned tail and fled he laughed they did not stop running until they reached the adriatic sea hugues de sully and the rest of the prisoners were transported back to constantinople to be paraded through the streets for the immense good cheer of the crowd giuliano looked from one to the other of them seeing the undisguised pleasure in the doges face thank you the doge said sincerely you did excellently to bring such news and so rapidly venice is grateful my chamberlain will give you a purse of gold so you may celebrate appropriately then go wash eat and drink to our prosperity the soldier thanked him profoundly and left still grinning this is excellent the doge said as soon as he was certain they were alone after this any crusade will have no choice but to go by sea which means in venetian ships he laughed i have an excellent red wine let us drink a toast to the future but giuliano woke the following morning with an ache inside himself so deep it consumed all the elation at victory he had felt the night before with pale sharp daylight came reality charles of anjou coveted constantinople his soul starved for it giuliano had seen it in his eyes in his clenched fist as if he could grasp it and hold his fingers around it forever he wanted to take it by violence and crush it unconditionally giuliano knew charless brutal rule he had seen it in sicily where he taxed his own people into penury what would he do to a conquered nation as byzantium would become he would crush it burn it murder its people such thoughts of byzantium were disloyal to all that had bred and nurtured giuliano and to the promise he had made to tiepolo on his deathbed but he could not deny himself perhaps the decision had been there for a long time and he had needed only to be here in venice to see the vast shipyards busy night and day to make him face the reality of it he could no longer belong to a place with the ease of friendship it gave and its torture of conscience he must choose a morality a people and belief that he loved and that had held truths bigger than comfort or acceptance he might never again serve this doge or any other the knowledge came with a wrenching loneliness and a sudden high bright freedom he must do what he could to prevent the invasion charles of anjou had friends in rome but somewhere he must have enemies sicily was the place to seek them he returned to sicily finding lodging again with giuseppe and maria where he had stayed before ah giuliano maria said with joy lighting her face as she came out to greet him in the front room with its shabby chairs and welltrodden floor she flung her arms around him holding him tightly then blushed as she realized that she was making a spectacle of herself have you come to stay for a while she asked him you must eat with us tell us everything are you married yet what is her name what is she like why did you not bring her no giuliano was used to her questions and shrugged them off without offense im here because no one can cook like you or make me laugh as hard she dismissed this with a wave of her hand but she colored with pleasure ive been to all sorts of places he said following her into the busy chaotic kitchen where loaves of bread and vegetables were piled up olives in pottery jars lemons onions rich gold and winecolored and bright fruit sit she ordered him there out of my way now tell me about all these places where is it youve been thats better than here jerusalem he said grinning at her her hands stopped midair and she turned to look at him gravely you wouldnt lie to me would you giuliano that would be very wicked certainly not he said with much indignation do you want me to tell you about it if you dont tell me i wont feed you and every word had better be true he told her many things and the warmth of her friendship eased out the aches from his body and at least some from his heart and after maria had gone to tidy up and the children were in bed he stood outside with giuseppe staring across the harbor they walked together down to the wall to watch the sea lapping against the stones how is it really giuliano asked people complain but they always do is it worse giuseppe shrugged people are angry and they are afraid the king is planning another crusade and as always we are going to pay for his ships and his horses and his armor they were going to pay venice of course but he did not say that it lay an unspoken wound between them the king has friends giuliano said grimly the pope is his man and of course his nephew is king of france hasnt he any enemies giuseppe stared at him in the fading light peter of aragon so they say real enemy or just a petty difference real enough the way i hear it and john of procida for whatever thats worth giuliano could not remember hearing the names before peter of aragon explained itself but john of procida he did not know he repeated the name as a question portugal giuseppe replied with real anxiety sharpening his voice in the darkness what are you going to do be careful my friend the king has ears everywhere giuliano smiled and said nothing it was safer for giuseppe that he did not know a man named scalini made inquiries and obtained giuliano passage to the coast of aragon it was hard labor being an ordinary seaman however that was the only vacancy open to him perhaps it was wiser than being conspicuous by seeking command he also chose to use his mothers name of agallon he was surprised how much pleasure it gave him even though at times he forgot and was slow to answer in aragon giuliano heard more and more anxiety about the growing influence of france through an overtly french pope and a projected crusade led by a prince of france he began to join in the conversations bad for trade he said shaking his head judiciously you think so the man asked look at sicily he exclaimed taxed until they can barely afford to eat everywhere frenchmen in the major offices all the castles the best lands frenchmen in the churches and marrying the girls you think theyll give us a chance to trade on equal terms when they hold the mediterranean from egypt to venice sicily and all the french coast youre dreaming venice wont allow that another man interrupted never i dont see them doing anything to stop it giuliano felt another stab of disloyalty but what he said was true theyre selling them the ships theyll profit as always they have a treaty with the french pope no doubt theyre getting something from that the fear was growing and giuliano worked to foster it it would reach the ears of the soldiers and the princes and add to their anger which was already set against the king of the two sicilies by october he had planted all the seeds of trouble he could in aragon and was in portugal when he heard that pope martin iv had excommunicated michael of byzantium from the fellowship of the christian church charles of anjou was now the most powerful sovereign in europe perhaps most important of all the pope was under his influence and in his debt who would dare to ride against a catholic king who so clearly had the unconditional favor of the pope would they then find themselves excommunicated also did this now threaten anyone who raised his hand or his voice against the crusade and charles of anjou giuliano felt that the darkness was closing in on all liberty and honor and on the people he cared about profoundly eightyfive on martins orders palombara was in constantinople again late in but in spite of the euphoria of the citizenry after the relief of berat a sense of anxiety crowded within him that matched the darkness of the fading year martin iv had excommunicated the emperor michael the words echoed in palombaras head like the closing of an iron door it was a steppingstone to invasion martin was sending palombara with a death sentence for the city and they both knew it and once again he was accompanied by niccolo vicenze they were practically dancing in the streets vicenze said to him over dinner one evening referring to the byzantines rejoicing over berat in the spring didnt the fools realize it only meant that he would come by sea instead of by land he smirked as he said it but palombara saw the flare of temper beneath it in his pale face as if he were savoring the vision of revenge when the great fleet of charles of anjou would sweep across the sea and break the city walls to enter with fear and death as before palombara had begun by disliking vicenze but as he looked at him across the table now he realized he actually hated him i think the point is that they have proved to themselves that they can win albeit with the aid of a miracle he replied coldly and are they relying on another miracle vicenze asked with a sarcastic pitch to his voice palombara put an equal surprise in his reply really i have no idea if you wish to know you should ask one of their bishops perhaps constantine could enlighten you i dont care vicenze snapped icily later alone palombara walked up the steep incline to a place where he could see over the narrow stretch of water to asia he was on the edge of the christian world and beyond it was a yet unknown force yet it was the west that had destroyed byzantium in the past and was poised to do so again what could he do his mind ranged over a dozen options all of them useless the answer was not what he wished yet he cared enough to be honest with himself and admit that it was the only one he turned away from the cold wind and the sea and started to climb up the steep street toward the magnificent house of zoe chrysaphes she greeted him with amusement you did not come merely to inform me that you are in constantinople again she observed or to commiserate with us over the excommunication of the emperor there was selfmockery in her face and a certain bitterness he smiled back at her i did consider asking your help in converting him to the roman faith she started to laugh then stopped herself and it was only just before it turned to weeping of course he continued that would achieve nothing the pope is a frenchman bought and paid for by his majesty of naples that is a debt you could pay for forever without having purchased anything she was surprised by his candor so what is it you want palombara she asked without disguising her curiosity and with a certain warmth should we expect god to achieve by miracle what we could do for ourselves with labor and a degree of intelligence he asked how very roman of you she said with mockery but she was far too interested to disguise it what miracles did you have in mind saving constantinople from defeat and occupation by charles of anjou he replied really why she stood perfectly still only the flames of the fire in the great hearth gave an illusion of movement in the room because if byzantium falls then the rest of christendom will not be far behind it he replied that was not the whole truth part of palombaras motivation was anger at the hollowness of the papacy the departure from the passion and the honor that it should have had and part of it was to his surprise that he had come to admire the subtlety and the intricate devious beauty of byzantine culture if it was ruined the world would lose she nodded slowly why are you telling me it is the pope who needs to know he is shortsighted and worldly why do you suppose we in the orthodox church hate the idea of owing him allegiance i came to suggest a different course of action her eyes widened different from what from pouring greek fire over the walls onto the heads of the invaders he replied with a smile not that i have anything against that i would just like to strike a little sooner he had her complete attention at his support in europe before he sets sail he continued particularly in spain portugal possibly parts of france to foment trouble insurrection to appeal to selfinterest trade to make very clear indeed some of the disadvantages if charles of anjou succeeds trouble costs money she pointed out but the flame was back in her eyes michaels treasury is fully engaged in armaments for defense palombara knew that michaels treasury was all but empty but he did not say so what about the great merchant houses of constantinople he asked instead could they not be persuaded to contributehandsomely very slowly she smiled you know my lord bishop i think they could i am sure there are ways to convince them he kept his eyes on hers if i can be of assistance please tell me oh i will may i offer you wine almonds he accepted as if to eat and drink together sealed a bargain eightysix the winter seemed to zoe unnaturally dark but after palombaras visit the cold no longer touched her bones she knew what she was going to do it merely required a little thought as to exactly how she knew from scalini and other men like him that the forces of the new crusade were gathering in the west he had brought her word of siege engines catapults horse armor and trappings ready for the foot soldiers and the mounted knights that would mass in sicily they would storm constantinople then ride in triumph into jerusalem with charles of anjou at their head anyone in their path would be trampled a road stained with blood had never troubled crusaders also of great concern to zoe was the change in helena it dated since soon after eirenes deathso soon in fact that it was hard to believe they were unconnected the conclusion was unpleasantly clear somehow helena had found out who her father was zoe stood warming herself by the fire the thought of helena kept returning to her mind so sharp that it was as if someone had left a window open letting in a knife cut of iceladen air from outside helena would not stand on the walls with her mother and pour fire on the invaders then die in her own funeral pyre she was a survivor not a martyr she would find a way to escape and start again somewhere else and she would certainly escape with money michael would never yield he would die before he accommodated charles not that charles would leave him alive anyway he would destroy all royal claimants and if helena did not know that then she was a fool her birth would be her death sentence charles would leave his puppet emperor without a rival of any sort the answer came to zoe with the scorching heat of the greek fire she planned to use if charles wanted to hold byzantium with a hand of peace to free his armies to go on to jerusalem what better than to marry his puppet emperor to a legitimate heir of the palaeologi murder michael and andronicus and who was left helena zoes mind raced horrified it was betrayal beyond imagining she sat with her arms around herself shivering in spite of the fire before it came anywhere near that she must raise the money palombara had suggested buy all the trouble anger and rebellion she could and she knew now exactly where that money was coming from her power had always lain in knowledge of other peoples secrets and the proof that could ruin them the man to help her now was philotheos makrembolites she had heard only last week that he was on his deathbed perfect in pain frightened and with nothing to lose zoe went to her herb room and prepared various mixtures for the relief of different kinds of pain she also collected sleeping powders sweetsmelling oils and restoratives that would give a shortlived clarity to the mind even if after that there was only the slipping away into the last silence she bathed and dressed perfuming herself but wearing rich sober colors as befitted one going to visit the dying she did not worry that philotheos would not receive her he had a withered arm from the fires of and a bitter heart he would want to relive old wrongs and would not be unwilling to help her exact a vengeance that was beyond his own reach secrets were worth nothing in the grave he received her in his dim overhot room with as much curiosity as she had hoped he hoisted himself onto his elbows wincing with pain and screwing up his face into a snarl drawing his lips back from stained teeth come to gloat at my death zoe chrysaphes he said his breath wheezing out of his lungs with a sound like tearing cloth make the most of it your turn will come and youll likely see the city put to blood and fire again before that happens she put down the leather satchel in which she had brought the herbs and ointments they knew each other far too well for pretenses she would not have come except for good reasons of her own whats in there he asked eyeing it suspiciously relief from pain she answered temporarily of course it will all be finished when god wishes it you are little younger than i am for all your paint and perfume you smell like an alchemists parlor he responded she wrinkled her nose you dont rather more like a charnel house do you wish a little ease or not whats the price his eyes were yellowing as if his kidneys were failing him have you spent all your money no more charms to get men to give it to you keep your money you can bury it with you for all i care she replied better that than let it fall into crusader hands theyll probably dig you up anyway just to see if theres anything worth taking id rather they ravaged my corpse than my living body he retorted looking her up and down his gaze lingered on her breasts and then her belly perhaps youd better kill yourself before they come not before ive finished what i mean to do she would not be distracted by his spite interest flared up in his face whats that revenge of course what else is there left nothing he answered who is there to pay anything now the kantakouzenos are all gone and the vatatzes the doukas bessarion comnenos whos left of course theyre gone she said impatiently but there are new traitors who would sell us again let us begin with the skleros then perhaps the akropolites and the sphrantzes he breathed out with a harsh rattle in his throat and a little more of the color drained from his face she was seized by a fear that he would die before he could tell her what she needed to know there was a jug of water on the table she rose took a small glass and measured a portion of liquid into it from one of the vials she had brought then added a little water she returned to the bed and held it for him he drank the potion and choked it exhausted him for several minutes but when he finally opened his eyes again there was a touch of color in his cheeks and his breathing was easier so what is it you want zoe chrysaphes he asked charles of anjou will burn all of us the only difference is that i shall not feel it and you will probably but you know many secrets about the old families of constantinople you want to damage them he was surprised why of course i dont you fool she snapped i want them to crush the rebellions and back michael you want my herbs you may roast in the flames of hell tomorrow like a pig on a spit but tonight you can be a lot easier if you tell me what i want to know all the shabby and fraudulent secrets of the dissenters to union he said turning the idea over in his mind i could tell you those there are plenty of them his smile was cruel and sharp with pleasure she remained with philotheos three long days and nights portioning out the medicine keeping him alive using all the skills she had little by little laced with viciousness he told her the secrets that she could use to bleed the skleros dry of money and the sphrantzes and the akropolites it would be worth thousands of gold byzants used with skill and care as she would it might just foment enough doubt and rebellion in the west to weaken even the strength of charles of anjou the day after philotheos died zoe was at the blachernae palace and told some of her plan to michael as they walked together along one of the great galleries the light streaming in through the long high windows showed cruelly the chipped marble of pillars the broken hands of a porphyry statue the emperor looked at her wearily and the defeat in his face frightened her its too late zoe we must think of defense i tried everything i know and i couldnt carry the people with me even now they dont see the destruction awaiting them not from charles of anjou maybe she leaned closer to him ignoring all the rules of etiquette but they will understand shame in the eyes of their peers the men they see every week the men they talk to in business and government the men they will do business with even in a new exile they will pay to avoid that he looked at her more closely his eyes narrowing what shame zoe she smiled old secrets if you know them why didnt you use them before he asked ive only just learned them she replied philotheos makrembolites is dead did you know that even so it is too late this pope is frances creature spain and portugal will ally with him they cant afford not to all the gold in byzantium wont change that hes pope for as long as he lives she replied softly what does he need the king of the two sicilies for now are you saying he will honor all his debts hell pay them only if there is something he still wants michael agreed think of your own people she urged think of their suffering in the long years of exile and of those who never came back we have been here a thousand years we have built great palaces and churches we have created beauty to the eye the ear and the heart we have imported spices colored silks like the sun and the moon jewels from the corners of the earth bronze and gold jars urns bowls statues of men and beasts she spread her hands we have measured the skies and traced the paths of the stars our medicine has cured what no one else could even name she spoke with intense intimacy but more than any of these our dreams have lit fire in the minds of half the world our lives have brought justice to rich and poor our literature has furnished the minds of generations of people and made the world sweeter than it would ever have been without us dont let the barbarians kill us again we will not rise a second time you dont know when you are beaten do you zoe he said with a soft sweet smile yes i do she answered i was beaten the first time seventy years ago i saw the fires of hell consume everyone i loved this time if it happens i will go with it she took a breath but in the name of the holy virgin i will not die without a fight if we fail michael history will not forgive us i know he admitted quietly tell me zoe cosmas kantakouzenos is dead and arsenios vatatzes and georgios and gregory and now eirene why is giuliano dandolo still alive she should have known he would have understood all along and allowed her to take her revenge only if it suited him he was waiting he is still useful to me she replied he is courting enemies of charles of anjou awakening trouble in sicily i will have scalini kill him when we dont need him i would have liked something more elegant but we no longer have time she added he nodded his eyes sad a pity i liked him so did i she agreed what has that to do with it he is a dandolo i know he said softly its still a pity eightyseven zoe stood at the open window and stared at the far light on the sea the wind stinging her face was sharp off the water it still carried the smell of ice from the east but also present in the breeze was the promise of spring zoes plans were maturing nicely she had the money albeit under bitter protest yesterday the skleros had yielded and she had exacted an extra price just as a surety that they should cease their opposition to the union with rome constantinople needed every shred of power or influence it had with the west survival depended on it and zoes efforts would thwart helena which compared with the survival of byzantium was trivial but there was still a dark sweetness to it thomais was at the door she looked frightened bishop constantine is here to see you my lady he is very angry zoe had expected constantine to be angry let him wait a few minutes then send him in thomais looked cornered are you well she asked shall i bring you an infusion of camomile i can tell the bishop to come another day zoe smiled at the thought it was almost worth doing simply for the satisfaction of it she was still considering her answer when she saw the large figure of constantine magnificently robed in the passage behind thomais obviously he was intending to come in with or without permission thomais turned to face him get out of my way woman his face was white and his eyes blazing now that he was closer zoe could see the gleaming silk of his dalmatica in spite of the inclement weather it flowed around him fluttering wide with his movement making him appear even larger his arrogance was intolerable to zoe she had a wild idea to wait until thomais had retreated and closed the door then take off her tunic and stand naked before the bishop it would appall him so terribly he would never exercise such highhandedness again and it would be funny thomais was waiting for her to give the order send sabas to wait outside the door zoe told her i doubt his grace will continue with such ill manners but if he does i would like you and sabas to be within call thomais obeyed constantine came in and shut the door almost catching the end of his tunic between it and the jamb you seem to have lost control of yourself zoe observed coolly i would offer you wine but you appear to have had more than sufficient already what is it you wish you have betrayed the orthodox church he replied through clenched teeth the muscles of his smooth beardless jaw bulging theodosia skleros would have told him no doubt she had asked absolution again for the sins of her brothers constantines eyes glittered with a fanatic anger and there was sweat beading his skin you have foresworn all that you professed to believe and broken the covenants of your baptism his voice trembled you have abandoned the faith blasphemed god and the holy virgin and you are excommunicated from the fellowship of christ you are no longer one of us he flung out his arm fingers pointing at her almost as if he would jab her you are denied the body and blood of christ your sins are upon your own head and in the day of judgment he will not atone for you the holy virgin will not intercede for you before god her prayers will not speak your name nor will she hear your words at the hour of your death among the company of saints you no longer exist she stared at him it could not be true he was standing in the light alone the rest of the room blurring around him so she could not see it there was a strange fuzzy sound in her ears she tried to speak to tell him he was wrong but she could not find any words and the pain in her head was unbearable she put up her hands to block it out and then suddenly she was on the floor darkness and light splintered into each other in total and incomprehensible silence then nothing at all constantine had expected her to be terrified zoe had committed the ultimate sin but he had not thought that she would be so affected that she would be struck speechless and fall to the ground unable to move he looked where she lay her eyes halfopen but apparently sightless was she dead he moved closer and stared he could see her chest rise and fall with her breathing no he had not killed her better than that she was sightless and dumb but still alive to know it victory soared up inside him as if he were suddenly without weight he turned on his heel and walked to the door he pulled it open and saw the servants standing in a huddle he drew in his breath and let it out slowly be warned he said measuring each word the holy church of christ will not be mocked your mistress made light of her oaths and betrayed her promises i have delivered gods message to her and he has struck her down he gestured behind him to where zoe lay call a physician if you wish but he cannot undo the work of god and he would be a fool to try eightyeight anna had been sent for and accompanied the whitefaced messenger to zoes home sabas was waiting for her and took her immediately to where zoe was lying on her bed thomais at her side her face impassive bishop constantine excommunicated her from the church sabas informed anna god has stricken her but still she lives please help her anna moved forward and looked down at zoe her tunic was crumpled and she lay awkwardly as if placed there by someone who dared not touch her with any more intimacy her eyes were almost closed but she was breathing quite regularly without thinking anna smoothed zoes dress over her stomach and thighs then she felt her pulse it was weak but quite regular is it not the bishops doing thomais asked anna hesitated constantine would not have poisoned her or struck her he might have frightened her into an apoplectic fit if he had invoked the deep terror inside her of the punishment of god the abandonment of all light and hope she touched zoes hand gently it was warm she was not dead or even dying we must not let her get cold and put a little ointment on her lips to stop them drying i will fetch herbs and come back thomais stared at her her face filled with doubt perhaps fear god may have struck her anna said gently if he takes her life that is his judgment its not mine she did all she could for zoe waiting and watching to see if her condition changed on the fifth night she was sitting in the corner of zoes room next to a painted and inlaid screen half asleep the room was almost dark one small candle burned on the table about seven feet from zoe just enough to see her outline not enough to shine on her face she still had not opened her eyes or stirred more than to move one hand a few inches anna did not know if she ever would again thinking of the destruction zoe had caused anna should have been glad it confused her that she felt instead a sense of loss and a troubling pity she was almost asleep when she was suddenly terrifyingly aware that there was someone else in the room he was moving soundlessly no more than a shadow passing across the floor he couldnt be a servant or he would have spoken she froze her breath caught in her throat she watched as he crept toward the bed a small man dressed not in a tunic but a shirt and britches he had a pointed beard and as he came closer to zoe the candlelight touched his face and she saw that he had sharp features thin and clever his hands were empty her mind raced she knew from the awkward way the mans jacket lay over his hip that he had a knife at his belt and zoe was defenseless if anna called out there was no one near enough to hear or come in time to help anna herself would be dead before then she must move silently or the intruder would hear her and strike probably zoe first and then her she had nothing near her no heavy bowl no candlestick but there was the tapestry if she threw that over him it might confuse him for long enough to reach for the candlestick on the table zoe he said quietly zoe could he not see she was not asleep but senseless no thank god the candle was small and far enough from her that her face was in the shadow zoe he said more urgently it is going well sicily is like a tinderbox one spark one wrong word or move and it will burn like a forest fire dandolo has worked well but he has just about served our purposes give me the word and ill kill him myself one quick thrust and it will be over ill use the dandolo dagger you gave him he gave a low soft laugh then hell know the message of death comes from you anna broke out in a sweat whatever happened she must not move or make the slightest sound if he knew she was here he would kill her too her nose itched her mouth was dry still the intruder sat silently by zoes side then she heard a footstep outside the door a brief knock and the door opened the intruder moved toward the tapestry like a shadow anna turned as the door swung open and thomais entered only then did anna see in the widening light that one of the windows was not fastened anna stirred as if just waking up ill come and get a little wine she said sleepily to thomais can you find me some cakes im hungry anna walked over to the door not even glancing at the shadow beyond zoes bed where the intruder had melted into the corner he would not hurt zoe and if anna was out of the room for a few minutes he would leave as he must have come through the window into the night she must see that from now on all the windows and doors were more carefully barred two days later zoe opened her eyes puzzled frightened unable to speak she tried but the words were garbled animal sounds thomais tried offering her a pen and a piece of paper she gripped the pen awkwardly made a few scratches on the white surface and gave up helena was informed that her mother was awake but unable to speak she came stared at zoe with a strange pleasure then turned and left it was after she had gone that zoe spoke her first comprehensible word anna she said clearly it was a slow task by evening zoe had managed a few more simple words and names requests movement that was a little more coordinated anna looked at the terror in her eyes and in spite of herself felt a sharp pity for her she wished zoe could have died simply at the first blow of the apoplexy rather than inch by inch like this and anna also knew that if she recovered the intruder would be back and zoe would give the order for giuliano to be murdered if she could not stop zoe perhaps she could find the intruder and stop him there was only one man she could trust and who had the power to helpnicephoras it was late and raining hard when she reached the blachernae palace and it took her several minutes of argument to persuade the guard to allow her in and then to disturb nicephoras to receive her he looked troubled his face was grave still heavy with sleep his beardless cheeks soft what is it he asked anxiously is zoe dead no shes not dead anna replied in fact she may recover completely her progress is very rapid and she has a will of iron briefly anna told nicephoras of the intruder his assumption that zoe could hear him and his promise to kill giuliano as soon as she gave the word he is trying to provoke a rising in sicily against charles of anjou i think she added but giuliano dandolo is an ally not an enemy if we destroy those who serve us or allow them to be destroyed we will not find many wanting to help us next time we need them and there will always be a next time nicephoras smiled from your description it has to have been scalini i will not allow dandolo to be killedat least not at zoes behest what else happens to him in sicily is outside my control i think scalini has now served his purpose and he is zoes creature not ours is he she asked quickly oh yes his expression was bleak but i know where to find him he will not leave constantinople i promise you thank you she said with profound gratitude thank you zoe continued to recover in another few days she could form sentences although many words still eluded her she began to eat and to drink all the herbs anna mixed for her surprisingly she was a good patient obeying every instruction and she progressed accordingly two weeks after her initial attack the four skleros brothers publicly declared total allegiance to the emperor michael in his efforts to save the empire and privately changed from giving a large donation to the church to giving a significant part of their fortune to zoe to further whatever civil unrest she could effect in the dominions of charles of anjou eightynine constantine stood alone in the courtyard staring at the fountain and in his mind everything shrank into a tiny crystalclear picture sharpedged as a polar wind and just as simple he could see the whole pattern as clearly as a great mosaic every piece in its place his whole life every experience good and bad had been leading up to this time when his understanding was like a shaft of light and at last undeniable even betrayed he had not abandoned the cause from that surely he must conclude that god would never abandon him his task now was the one above all others zoe chrysaphes must be stopped he had struck her down once with the power of god in his hand and anastasius the vain the shallow and fickle as water had healed her he must go to zoe late in the evening when he was certain to find her alone his resolve was absolute he could not leave the destiny of gods people on earth in the slippery hands of zoe chrysaphes it was a dark night cloudcovered and windy with pieces of debris blown rattling along the street he would not have chosen to be out but this must be done and perhaps such a night was created for decisions that could never be reversed he was admitted warily by her servants and shown into the entrance room with its old mosaic floors and arched doorways leading to her private apartments but he had to insist even imply the threat of excommunication to them in order to see her alone after his last visit zoes servants mistrusted him finally only anastasius stood in his way i will see her alone constantine said firmly that is her right would you deny her the final sacrament of extreme unction can you face god yourself if you do such a thing anastasius reluctantly stepped away and constantine went in closing the door behind him the great room was as magnificent as always the torches were burning in their ornate stands yellow flames giving it a warm peaceful feeling like a fine painting framed and dusted with gold the great crucifix was hanging in its usual place it was beautiful but constantine did not like it there was something almost barbaric about it it made him uncomfortable like a sort of indecency zoe sat in a huge chair with her back to one of the tapestries all wines and scarlets and purples with threads of bronze she was wearing red again a brazen color it lit her face which was not as gaunt as it should be after her illness and showed off those golden eyes i know what you have done zoe chrysaphes he said quietly and what you plan to do really she seemed barely interested he leaned closer there are plans in heaven that earth knows nothing of he said harshly that is the meaning of faith trust god that he will provide for us whatever is necessary her fine eyebrows rose do you believe that bishop constantine i more than believe it he said with ringing certainty i know it you mean i cannot change you she persisted not at all he smiled you have such faith her voice was slow almost a caress i have he declared then why are you here he felt the heat in his skin zoe had nearly tricked him to save your soul woman he retorted you told me i had already lost it she reminded him are you going to forgive me after all i can do he told her if you repent and come back as an obedient daughter of the church recant all that you have said in support of union with rome forgive your enemies return the money to the church you have taken and submit yourself to discipline continue the rest of your days in prayer to the holy virgin and you may at the last be washed clean all that before charles of anjou burns us to the ground again she said with mocking incredulity god can do anything he said forcefully if you repent and obey i dont believe you she said softly we must help ourselves you blaspheme his voice rose in amazement and fury god will strike you dead he lifted his hand and pointed at her jabbing his finger in the air as if it were a weapon she sat staring at him smiling slightly lopsidedly the right side of her face a little stiff then my physician will heal me again she replied you have the power to destroy and he to make whole think of that bishop which of you does that make the greater he lunged forward and seized a cushion from the nearest chair he flung himself on top of her pressing the soft stifling fabric over her face she struggled arms and legs thrashing but he was more than twice her weight and he held her down crushing her lungs suffocating her it was only a few hideous moments before she stopped moving and his rage went cold his body covered in icy sweat he stood up slowly and looked at zoe where she lay sprawled on the floor hair tangled tunic up around her thighs he should remember her like this broken without dignity at once both exciting and disgusting in her suggestion of sensuality feeling a revulsion he could barely control he touched her hair with his hand to straighten it around her face it was soft so soft that he could barely feel it the backs of his fingers brushed against her cheek her skin was still warm he shuddered convulsively this was obscene he wanted to strike her tear down one of the huge tapestries and cover her with it but of course he must not do that he was a bishop tending a penitent sinner on her deathbed he pulled her tunic down as far as it would go it was not far enough it still looked as if she had had it lifted as if he refused to follow that thought his mutilation burned in his soul he lifted her thighs she was heavy and warm then he pulled her tunic straight he stood up his whole body trembling he waited several more minutes then walked to the door and opened it he stopped abruptly or he would have bumped into anastasius standing just beyond it he looked anastasius straight in the eye she repented of all her errors and saved her soul it is a time for great rejoicing zoe chrysaphes died a loyal daughter of the true church he took a deep steadying breath she will be buried in the hagia sophia i shall offer the funeral mass myself he forced himself to smile it was like the rictus of the dead on his face anastasius stared in total disbelief his eyes wide and unbelievably filled with grief constantine crossed himself and walked past him his huge hands clenched his heart pounding with victory ninety anna walked into the room and stared down at the body of zoe she saw the blue face the bitten lip and the blood on it she bent down beside her pushing back a stray lock of hair off her brow gently she lifted one eyelid she saw the tiny pinpricks of red and knew what had happened she stood up slowly and faced thomais lay her out she said make her look beautiful her voice strangled in her throat it was not only zoe who was dead it was constantine also and in an infinitely more terrible way anna went outside into the rising wind and the first spots of rain she walked alone to helenas house to give her the news she did not want to do it so it was best done quickly now the weight of what constantine had said lay increasingly heavily on her he would claim that zoe had taken back all her support for union with rome and died in the bosom of the church he would make pomp and display of it helena took a long time to appear the servants had admitted anna only with great reluctance but she had told them why she had come and not one of them wished to tell helena of zoes death themselves anna waited grateful for the wine and bread she was offered she was cold through to the bone now and her eyes stung with tiredness and with sorrow helena came across the room and anna rose to her feet what on earth have you to say that cannot wait until morning helena said irritably i am very sorry indeed to tell you that your mother is dead anna replied helenas dark eyes widened in momentary disbelief dead yes really at last helena straightened her back and held her head a little higher a slight smile touched the corner of her mouth and one might have thought it was superb courage and dignity in the face of loss anna had the ugly thought that in fact it was an attempt to contain her victory she felt the tears for zoe welling behind her own eyelids something of byzantium was gone it was more than an age that was past it was a passion a fury a love of life and its leaving took something irreplaceable from the world ninetyone palombara landed in constantinople weighed down by the bitter news he carried the fleet of charles of anjou had sailed for sicily and from there it would leave for constantinople they could count the time until invasion in weeks back again at the house he shared with vicenze palombara found him busy in his study writing a pile of dispatches vicenze secretive as always turned them upside down the moment he saw him in the doorway good voyage vicenze asked politely good enough palombara replied he held out the letters the pope had sent vicenze still sealed vicenze took them thank you he looked at palombara i dont suppose youve heard yet but zoe chrysaphes is dead had an apoplexy or something bishop constantine said a requiem mass for her in the hagia sophia the hypocrite said she died reconciled to the orthodox church damn liar he smiled palombara was stunned it had seemed as if nothing could destroy zoe he stood still in the middle of the floor and was overwhelmed with loss as if byzantium itself had begun to die vicenze was still staring at him still smiling palombara had an almost overwhelming desire to strike him so hard that it would break his teeth perhaps its just as well he said as calmly as he could charles of anjou has set sail for messina at least she will be spared knowing that he went to see helena comnena to offer his condolences she had moved into zoes house and she received him in the room that had once been her mothers the view was the one palombara remembered but the colors were already different the new tapestries were pale intricately detailed there were blues and greens no warmth of the earth tones helenas perfectly balanced face with its winged eyebrows almost like her mothers was lovely but he had no sense of the steel within there seemed to be in her a hunger without joy i am grieved to hear of your mothers death he said formally please accept my condolences personally she asked or do you speak for rome he smiled personally really she regarded him with dry rather sour amusement i had not realized that you were fond of her i rather assumed the opposite he met her dark eyes i admired your mother i enjoyed her intelligence and her infinite capacity to care about everything admired her helena repeated the words curiously as if she found them inappropriate but surely she was nothing that rome approves of she had no humility she was never obedient to anything but her own desires and she was certainly very far from chaste he was angry with her for not defending her mother she was more alive than anyone else i know you sound like the eunuch physician anastasius she observed sourly he mourns her which is stupid she would have destroyed him without a thought if it had been worth her trouble there was contempt in her voice and a sharp edge that palombara recognized with surprise as resentment you are mistaken he said icily zoe admired anastasius greatly quite apart from his medical skill she liked his wit and his courage his imagination and the fact that he was not afraid of her or of life helena laughed how quaint you are your grace and how terribly innocent you know nothing he forced himself to smile if you have your mothers papers i daresay you are aware of a great deal that others are not some of it will be very dangerous but you must already know that oh yes very dangerous indeed she said in little more than a whisper but you are foolish to pretend that you know of what you speak your grace her smile was bright and hard you dont what was it that obviously pleased her so much she was looking at him and gloating why it seems not he agreed lowering his eyes as if he were crestfallen helena laughed a shrill cruel sound i see my mother did not share it with you she observed but she discovered that your precious eunuch whom you admire so much is actually the most superb liar his entire life and everything about him is a lie palombara stiffened anger swirling up inside him helena looked at him with derision or to be accurate i should say her whole life she went on anna zarides is as much a woman as i am or at least legally she is there must be something repulsively wrong with her that she would masquerade as a man all these years dont you think wouldnt you say it was a sin what do you think i should do bishop palombara should i assist in her deceit is that morally right he was so stunned he could hardly find his voice yet as helena said the words he believed them he looked at her face shining with malice and he hated her then he smiled her envy was so highly visible zoe was gone and now helena could not taste her victory completely without zoe to see there was no flavor in it but she could at least destroy anastasius the daughter zoe had preferred palombara met helenas eyes and saw the fury in them my condolences he repeated then excused himself and walked away outside in the street the sense of triumph wore off within moments replaced by fear if anastasius was actually a woman and helena knew it then she was in the most intense danger if helena chose to expose her he did not know what punishment anastasius would face but it would be savage zoe had known and had not betrayed anastasiuss secret that too was a mystery she must in her own way have had a great respect even a kind of affection for her he walked along the busy street with the crowd jostling around him news of the fleet having left for messina had reached constantinople with the ship on which palombara arrived fear spread like fire on the wind sharp and dangerous edged with panic quick to violence as the threat became suddenly no longer a nightmare but a reality he walked more rapidly facing into the wind the more he considered what helena had said the more it frightened him should he find anna zarides and warn her but what use would that be there was nothing she could do except perhaps flee like so many others but would she do that it led him to the question of why she had ever begun such a desperate course in the first place dressed as a woman she would be beautiful why did anna zarides not use that what could have compelled her to such an act and over the space of years who or what did she care about to this cost to find out he began with a man he knew quite well who had been a patient of anastasiuss for some time from him palombara learned of people she had treated without charge in her work with bishop constantine the picture emerged of a woman dedicated to medicine absorbed in its practice but also fascinated by its details its art its curiosities and the endless learning it inspired yet she was not without fault she made errors of judgment and she had a temper palombara became increasingly aware of a sense of guilt within her although he had no idea what caused it the more he learned the more he was fascinated by her the more intense became his need to protect her over and over again anna zarides appeared to have asked about the murder of bessarion comnenos had she had some relationship with him but she had not been to constantinople before and he had never left it since the return now nearly twenty years ago it must be someone else the obvious candidate was justinian lascaris the man exiled for bessarions murder justinian lascaris was in exile near jerusalem this much he also learned her husband then she was a lascaris as well at least by marriage a member of one of the imperial families with a passionate vengeance to wreak against the palaeologi it was imperative palombara see anna zarides where vicenze would not know of it his curiosity was cruel endless and still fueled by his need for revenge over the substitution of the nude painting for the icon of the virgin so palombara made his inquiries obliquely as if they were of interest rather than importance and it was three days before he finally presented himself at her house he noticed that she looked tired there were fine lines around her eyes and a pallor to her skin she had to be even more aware than he of the fear in the city and how short a time they had left before the end how can i help you bishop palombara she asked looking at his eyes his face then at the way he stood she could have seen no signs of illness in him because there were none i was grieved to hear of the death of zoe chrysaphes he replied he saw the answering emotion in her a sharper sadness than he would have expected and he liked her for it i went to convey my sympathies to helena comnena that was gracious of you she responded how does that reflect on your health it doesnt he did not alter his steady gaze she told me that in her mothers papers she discovered something startling it is a piece of information which i fear helena will use to her advantage unless she can be prevented anna clearly had no idea what he was referring to he hated what he had to do but her ignorance compelled him to act is justinian lascaris your husband or your brother he asked bluntly she stood completely motionless the remnants of color draining from her skin at first there was nothing in her eyes as if she were too stunned to react at all then the fear came violent all but consuming her she breathed slowly her chest heaving my brother she said at last my twin brother i came to warn you not to threaten you he said gently you might prefer to leave the city the ghost of a smile crossed her face but there will certainly be work enough for a physician when the city falls her voice was thick with emotion as if she found the words hard to say at all helena hates you he said urgently shes changed since zoes death its almost as if it has freed her im sure shes planning something if she has access to zoes papers then she may have taken up funding the rebellion against charles in the west had he said too much anna smiled im sure she has something planned she agreed bitterly then go he argued while you can im byzantine and i should run while you a roman priest will stay she asked he did not answer perhaps in the end there was nothing else to say ninetytwo constantine was desperate it was three weeks since he had killed zoe chrysaphes and then a few days later conducted the funeral service for her in the hagia sophia he had offered the mass and given a eulogy almost fit for a saint now in the solitude of his courtyard the euphoria had passed and he was dogged by nightmares he fasted he prayed but still they haunted him of course it was the work of god that he had destroyed zoe he had only ever allied with her in her plot to overthrow michael so that bessarion a true son of the church could defy the union with rome and save the faith and then justinian lascaris had killed bessarion so it had never come to fruition should he have agreed with michael to help justinian escape death perhaps justinian had been right and bessarion would never have had the passion or the skill to defend them or on the other hand maybe justinian had intended to take the throne himself constantine had not pleaded for justinians life far from it he was afraid that if justinian had lived he might have betrayed them all but michael wanted to save him and had used constantines name to do it saying he had yielded to his pleas for mercy now zoe still plagued his dreams she lay on her back a lush fullbreasted woman thighs apart in a mockery of his own emptiness it was a humiliation an obscenity yet he could not look away everything was sliding out of control the emperor had betrayed the entire nation by selling out to rome and worse than that he had done it so publicly that there was hardly a man woman or even child in constantinople who did not know of it now was the time for a miracle another month two months and it would be too late yet constantine was startled when his servant informed him that bishop vicenze was here and wished to speak with him he disliked the man intensely not only for his calling to undermine the church in byzantium and the fact that he came from rome but personally as well vicenze lacked any kind of humility still constantine had prayed for a miracle and he must not stand in the way of its occurrence if in some way vicenze was part of it constantine set aside the text he was reading and stood up have him come in he instructed today vicenze was dressed very plainly almost as if he wished to pass unnoticed whereas usually he was selfimportant they exchanged formal greetings constantine guardedly vicenze with uncharacteristic ease as if keen to reach his purpose for having come constantine offered him wine fruit and nuts vicenze accepted his hospitality making light conversation of irrelevances until the servant had left then he turned straight to constantine his eyes brilliant with urgency the situation in the city is very serious he said his voice sharp fear is mounting every day and we are on the brink of civil unrest which could be disastrous for the wellbeing of the poor and the most vulnerable i know constantine agreed taking a handful of almonds from the exquisite porphyry bowl they are terrified of the army that charles of anjou will bring they grew up on tales of crusader murders and destruction he could not resist saying that reminding vicenze that because he was roman he was partisan in the atrocity vicenze bit his lip they need something to restore their faith in god and in the blessed virgin he said firmly faith is greater than all the fear in the world brave men giants in the cause of christ have faced crucifixion lions the fires of torture and not flinched they have gone to martyrdom because their faith was perfect we are not asking that of the people only belief so god can work the miracle that will save not only their souls but their bodies as well maybe even their homes their city has not the blessed virgin done it before when the people trusted in her in spite of his loathing for the man constantine was drawn into his vision he spoke the truth pure and lovely as the first light of dawn in a blemishless sky yes yes she has in the face of the impossible he agreed the invaders are coming by sea vicenze countered has not god power over the wind and the waves could christ not walk upon the water and calm the stormor cause one constantine felt his breath tighten but it would be a miracle we have not the passion of faith to bring such a thing to pass then we must gain it vicenze said his eyes gleaming the faith of the people could save them and surely there is nothing else left that will but what can we do constantine said in a whisper they are too frightened to believe anymore all they need is to see the hand of god in something and they will believe again vicenze replied you must perform a smaller miracle for them not only to the saving of their bodies and your city and all it has been in the world but to the saving of their souls they are your charge your holy responsibility i thought you wanted their loyalty to rome constantine said vicenze gave what passed for a smile dead they are lost to all of us and perhaps it has not occurred to you but i do not want the souls of the crusaders stained with christian blood either constantine believed him what can we do he asked vicenze took a deep breath and let it out softly there is a fine man a good man one who has helped his fellows given of his means to the poor and is deeply loved by all who know him he is a venetian living here by the name of andrea mocenigo he is aware of the situationthat we stand on the brink of destructionand he will help constantine was lost how what can he do everyone knows mocenigo is ill vicenze said he is prepared to take a poison which will make him collapse i will carry an antidote to it and when you come to bless him in the name of god and the holy virgin i will give it to him discreetly and he will recover people will see a miracle dramatic and unmistakable word will spread and faith will leap up again as a fire hope will be restored he did not add that constantine would be seen as a hero even a saint a sharp whisper of doubt stabbed constantines mind then why do you not do it yourself then the people would give rome the credit vicenzes mouth turned down at the corners the people mistrust me he said simply it must be someone they have seen in the service of god all their lives i know of no one else with that reputation in constantinople all this was true constantine knew this was what he had worked and waited for all his life who knows vicenze went on maybe god will grant you a real miracle is this not the purpose for which you have lived it was whatever vicenze did whatever that loathsome palombara said to him constantine would be unshakable without doubt or fear his mind as clear as a burning light he would not fail but he still would use his mind his experience and his own safeguards he would say nothing of them to vicenze who for all his unwitting usefulness was still the enemy i do not want a theological debate about it constantine said furiously to anastasius when asking for his help and receiving in return a passionate argument against the whole idea i want you there as a physician to attend mocenigo in case vicenze is not to be trusted of course he is not to be trusted anastasius said bitterly what on earth can i do carry another dose of the antidote constantine retorted you cannot refuse to do that if you do you are turning your back on mocenigo and on the people anastasius sighed he was caught and they both knew it if he spoke out against the plot or betrayed its nature to the people it would shatter the belief they were clinging to perhaps even provoke the final panic that could crush them all ninetythree anna entered the house of mocenigo with only a faint thought in the back of her mind that this was where giuliano had lived for so long all her conscious thought was for mocenigos distress she could feel the anxiety and the fear as soon as she entered there was that peculiar tense hush that comes with awareness of profound suffering that is expected to end in the death of someone who is deeply loved mocenigos wife teresa met her at the door of his room her face was pale and holloweyed from lack of sleep and her hair was pinned back simply to keep it out of the way with no thought for beauty i am glad you have come she said simply the last medicine seems to have made him worse we rely entirely upon bishop constantine god is our last refuge perhaps he should have been the first anna realized that mocenigo himself might be party to the miracle but his wife was not it was too late to matter now anna followed her into mocenigos room it was stifling the sun beat on the roofs and the windows were closed the air smelled of body fluids of pain and disease mocenigo himself was lying on top of the bed his face was scarlet and bloated sheened with sweat and there were blisters around his mouth the small vial of liquid in the pocket of annas robe did not seem much remedy for this terrible distress mocenigo opened his eyes and looked at her he smiled even through the pain that all but consumed him i think it will take a miracle to bring me back from this he said dry humor lighting his face for an instant then vanishing but even for a day or two it would be worth it if it strengthens the peoples faith byzantium has been good to me i would like to repay a little she said nothing the deceit of it saddened her and she hated constantine for forcing her to be part of it yet perhaps mocenigo was right and the people would be richer for it it was his last gift to those he loved there was a faint noise from outside as if the crowd were growing larger word had spread that mocenigo was dying and that constantine would shortly come to see him was it grief or hope that brought them or both there was a roar and then a cheer anna knew that constantine had arrived a moment later one of his servants came to the sickroom door and requested that mocenigo be brought out where his wellwishers could see him anna stepped forward to refuse him you cant but she was overridden constantines servant was giving orders and other people were coming in solemnfaced preparing to put him on a litter and lift him out no one was listening to anna she was merely a physician where constantine spoke for god she followed outside mocenigo was in such distress that he said nothing too weak to protest his wife ashenfaced simply obeyed constantines servant there were now more than two hundred people in the street and soon it would be three hundred and then four constantine stood on the top step holding up his hands for silence i have not come to give this good man the last rites or prepare him for death he said clearly youd better prepare us all a voice shouted were just as done for as he is there was a roar of agreement and several people waved their arms constantine raised his hands higher the threat is real and terrible he cried loudly but if the holy mother of god is with us what can it matter if all men are against us or the legions of darkness either the noise subsided several people crossed themselves i come to seek the will of god constantine went on and if he grants me to beseech the holy virgin to allow this man to be healed of his affliction as a sign that we too will be healed of ours and saved from the abominations of the invaders there was a moments incredulity people turned to one another puzzled daring to hope then the cheer went up even more loudly than before a little hysterical hundreds willing themselves to believe they knew the strength of faith to make such a miracle possible and all the wild hope that went with it constantine smiled lowered his hands and turned to mocenigo the sick man was now lying on the pallet in front of him breathing shallowly but seeming to be at ease the crowd fell into an almost paralyzed silence no one even shuffled a foot constantine lowered his hands and placed them on mocenigos head anna searched with increasing panic for sight of vicenze in the crowd then she saw him close by but not to the fore as if he were here only to witness better it were so constantines voice rose clear and charged with emotion he called on the holy virgin mary to heal andrea mocenigo as a blessing to him for his faith and as a sign to the people that she still watched over them and would keep and preserve them in the face of all adversity vicenze stepped forward and as constantine raised mocenigo up vicenze passed him water and together they ministered to him vicenze stepped back everyone waited the air seemed dense with the burden of hope and fear then mocenigo gave a terrible cry and clutched at his throat his body twisting in agony he tore at himself screaming anna ran forward pushing everyone out of her way even though she already knew it was too late the antidote vicenze had given mocenigo was poison perhaps hers would be poison to him as well she dared not use it in what would surely be a useless attempt now mocenigo was choking she got to him just as he writhed and fell off the litter vomiting blood there was nothing she could do but support him so he did not choke and drown even so it was only moments before he gave a last agonizing convulsion and his heart stopped the nearest man in the crowd howled with terror and rage then charged forward knocking constantine off his feet others followed shouting and lashing out they hauled constantine half up dragging him along all the time cursing him and beating his head and face and body with fists kicking him and hurling anything they could grasp it seemed as if they would tear him apart anna was appalled by the savagery of it and even as he was thrashed and hauled and half carried away she could see constantines terror then there was another face in the crowd she knew palombara their eyes met for an instant and she understood that he had foreseen it vicenzes plan the poison the violence she laid mocenigo down there was nothing anyone could do for him now except cover his face so his last agony was given some privacy then she lunged forward striking at those in her way shouting at them to leave constantine alone she screamed until her throat ached dont kill him it wont for the love of god stop it a blow landed on her back and shoulders sending her forward crashing into the man ahead of her then another blow drove her to her knees all around were faces distorted with hate and terror the noise was indescribable this must be what hell was likeblind insane rage anna clambered to her feet was almost knocked over again and started to move in the direction she thought they had dragged constantine she shouted pleading with them but nobody was listening someone howled in terror it was a mans voice shrill and unrecognizable it was hideous with the indignity of its nakedness was it constantine reduced to the least he could become she lunged forward again striking and shouting and kicking to make her way palombara saw her for an instant then lost her again he knew what she was doing he understood the horror and the pity in her that brief second when he met her eyes it was as clear to him as if he had felt it himself the passion for life the courage that could not deny whatever the cost she was vulnerable she could be so desperately hurt even killed and he could not bear that he would not live with that light gone he fought his way toward her his priests calling forgotten his robes torn his fists bleeding he ignored the blows that landed on him he knew they hated him to them he was roman a symbol of all that had accomplished their ruin time and time again still he must reach anna and get her out of this what happened after that was in the hands of god another blow knocked him almost senseless the pain was stunning taking his breath away it seemed like minutes before he could get his balance back but it must have been only seconds he lashed out shouting at the huge man in front of him palombara hit him it felt good to put all his weight behind it all the fury and frustration he had ever known for an instant that man was every cardinal who had lied and connived every pope who had failed his promises who had equivocated stuffed the vatican with his sycophants been a coward where he should have been brave arrogant where he should have been humble the man went down teeth broken on palombaras fist his mouth gushing blood hell but it hurt palombaras hand stabbed with pain right up to his shoulder and it was only then that he noticed the broken shard of tooth like bone embedded in his knuckles where was anna he plowed forward beating and flailing knocked sideways again and again by blows himself there was a gash in his shoulder bleeding badly and it hurt to breathe then she was there in front of him dust and blood on her clothes a bruise on her cheekbone there was too much noise for him to speak to her he simply grasped her arm and dragged her after him in the direction he thought would lead to escape he kept her in the shelter of his own body taking the blows meant for both of them one to his chest hurt so intensely that he stopped for seconds unable to draw any breath into his lungs he was aware of her holding him without realizing it he had sunk to his knees the crowd was parting a little he could see clear space ahead go he said hoarsely get away from here still she held him im not leaving you just breathe slowly dont gasp i cant his chest was tighter there was blood in his throat it was getting harder to concentrate to stay conscious go she bent down to him holding him closer as if she would give him her strength she was going to wait with him he did not want her to he wanted her to survive her passion with its cost had shown him that hell was worse and heaven far far more exquisite than he had dreamedand both were real for gods sake get out of here he rasped his mouth filling with blood i dont want to die for nothing dont dont do that to me give me something he could still feel her arms around him then just as the darkness had closed over him he felt her let him go and suddenly it was light he knew he was smiling he meant to anna staggered to her feet in a few moments there was a break in the crowd and she saw someone holding out a hand to her she took it and was pulled beyond the fury into a calm dusty space then a door was opened and she was inside a house she thanked the man he looked exhausted and frightened possibly no older than his twenties are you all right she asked him he was shaking embarrassed by his own weakness yes he assured her more or less i think they killed the bishop she knew palombara was dead but this young man was speaking of constantine to him palombara was a roman and of no importance the young man was wrong constantine was badly beaten but he was definitely alive and still conscious although in great pain his servant arms bloody face swollen with bruises came to anna and asked her help they had carried him into a nearby house and the owner had given up his own room so constantine could have the best bed the greatest comfort possible she went with the servant there was no alternative she could live with the owner of the house and his wife were waiting whitefaced horrified at the violence the tragedy and above all at what appeared to be a total collapse of sanity save him the wife pleaded as anna came in her eyes beseeched anna for some hope i will do all i can anna said then followed the servant up the narrow stairs constantine was lying on the bed his torn and bloody dalmatica removed his tunic was crumpled and filthy with dirt from the street but someone had done his best to straighten it and make him as comfortable as possible there was a ewer of water on the table and several bottles of wine and jars of perfumed unguent one look at constantines face told her that they would do little good his ribs were broken his collarbones and one hip he was certainly bleeding inside where no one could reach it she sat on the chair beside him to touch him would only cause greater pain god has left me he said his eyes were empty of all passion looking inward on an abyss from which there was no return christ had promised that in the resurrection every human being would be made whole again not a hair of the head would be lost that must mean that everything would be restored as it should have been without accident withering or mutilation should she tell him that would it be of any comfort now when it was his soul that had been squandered that was the inner self that remained into eternity she remembered constantine working so hard until his face was gray with exhaustion and he could barely keep his balance yet none of the poor the frightened or the sick were turned away what uncontrollable hunger had blurred his vision so badly that he had ended in twisting it all until nothing was honest anymore god doesnt leave people she said aloud we leave him her voice was shaking his eyes focused on her i served the church all my life he protested i know she agreed but thats not the same thing you created a god in your own image one of laws and rituals of office and observances because that requires only outward acts its simple to understand you dont have to feel or give of your heart you missed the grace and the passion the courage beyond anything we can imagine the hope even in absolute darkness the gentleness the laughter and the love that has no shadow the journey is longer and steeper than any of us can understand but then heaven is higher so it has to be steep and far he said nothing his eyes bottomless like pits dug out of his soul she reached for the towel wrung out the water and washed his face she hated him yet at this moment she would have taken his pain if she could a church can help she went on in order to fill the silence so he knew she was still there people can always help we need people theres nothing if we dont care but the real climb is made not because this person or that person told you what to do or lifted you on the way it is made because you hunger for it so much no one can stop you you have to want it so that you will pay what it costs didnt i save souls he pleaded how could she refuse him love forgave in all her anger and pain she must remember she walked beside not above she too needed grace if it was for a different sin it was no less necessary you have helped but christ redeemed them and they saved themselves by being the best they could and trusting in god to mend what was left theodosia he asked i gave her absolution she needed it wasnt i right no she said softly you forgave her without demanding penance because you wanted to please her you lied to her and it destroyed her faith perhaps it was fragile anyway but she couldnt trust a god who would permit what she did to joanna you would have known that if youd thought about it honestly no thats not true but there was no conviction in his voice yes it is you defaced your own truth he stared at her and very slowly something of what she had said became real to him and the abyss widened she saw it and was seized with pity and then remorse but it was too late to take it back she walked there willingly she touched the cloth to his face again very gently we all do she met his eyes whatever she would see there she had no right to look away now she took his hand in hers we all make mistakes you are right i have made some for which i have not yet repented and i need to but we are here to help not to judge only god can teach you how to do that not even the best of men not when the pain is beyond bearing be gentle reach out what gain is in it for you doesnt matter his face was ashen his lips dry as if he were already dead he said the words so softly she had to strain to hear i am become judas she bathed his face and hands his neck she wet his lips and touched his skin with the perfumed unguent it may have eased the pain for a while certainly he seemed calmer for it after a few moments longer she stood up and went out of the room to ask for water to wash some of the dust and blood off herself every part of her body hurt she had not realized it until now but her left arm was soaked with her own blood and her ribs were so badly bruised that it hurt to move one side of her face was painful and swelling up so that her eye was halfclosed and now that she moved she limped badly it was half an hour later when anna returned to the upper bedroom to sit with constantine again in case there was something she could do for him perhaps as much as anything it was so as not to leave him alone she stopped abruptly just beyond the door the candle was still burning although the flame was wavering the bed was empty even the sheet was gone then she realized that the window was open and it was the slight draft of air from it that was moving the candle flame she walked over to close the window and saw the torn end of linen tied around the central bar she leaned out slowly and stared downward constantines body hung about four feet below her the sheet tight around his neck his head lolling sideways it was not possible that he could still be alive his last words came back to her and the field of blood beyond jerusalem she should have known dizzy and sick she staggered back into the room and sat down hard on the bed she remained motionless for some time was she guilty of this should she have done more to prevent constantine from ever being involved in trying to create a miracle vicenze had designed it to fail they should have known that from the start palombara knew it and at the thought of palombara she leaned forward buried her face in the blanket and wept it was a kind of ease after all the horror and the fear to let the tears come and simply to grieve she had lost too much constantine was gone in a way that left only pain and a bitter grief palombara was different yet she felt an ache of loss for him too because she would miss him later anna went back to see teresa mocenigo and gave her whatever comfort she could when it was daylight she went with her to face the remnant of the crowd still left quietly and with the dignity of grief teresa asked them to honor mocenigos life by behaving now with the honor that was the best in them they must deal with vicenze according to the law guilty as he was to murder him would be to stain their own souls finally anna returned to her home to tend to her own wounds of heart and her bleeding aching body she wept for her own painful emptiness for giuliano for the loneliness that was at the back of everything ninetyfour in march of the vast fleet of charles of anjou anchored in the bay of messina in the north of sicily giuliano stood on the hillside above the harbor and stared at its size and power and his heart sank the force under charles was enormous and more ships were expected from venice maybe pietro contarini would be with them he had spoken of it the last time they had met before that final parting and it was final they would not meet as friends again pietro had made that clear his loyalty was always to venice first giuliano could no longer promise that he watched now as the fleet commanders walked along the quay and then up the broad streets to be welcomed by the royal vicar and governor of the island herbert of orleans he lived in the great fortress castle of mategriffon known as the terror of the greeks that was the thought uppermost in giulianos mind as he thought of the crusader forces pillaging the countryside for food and beasts in the name of christs war to recover the land of the saviors birth and set it again under christian rule giuliano set out to walk back over the rough terrain of the central mountains the cone of etna always on the skyline he wanted to be back in palermo before the french forces reached it if they were to make a stand he would do it with the people he cared for most with giuseppe and his friends not only did his legs achehis blistered feet remind him with each stepbut he was sick at heart at the senseless violence of it the hatred that drove ignorant men to plunder and destroy the loss would be immeasurable not only in life but in beauty and glories that took the breath away such as the palatine chapel with its great soaring saracen arches and exquisite byzantine mosaics centuries of profound and exquisite thought would be wiped out by men who could barely write their own names perhaps worst of all was the lie that this was done in the service of christ the blind belief that sins would be forgiven that this sea of human blood could wash anything clean how had the message of christ ever come to be twisted into this atrocity giuliano reached palermo tired and dirty and went quickly through the familiar streets in the clear early morning sun there was little sound but the music of the fountains the occasional hurrying footsteps then the breathless hush of waiting maria was already up and busy in the kitchen when she heard him at the door she whirled around carving knife in her hand then she saw him and her face flooded with relief she dropped the knife and ran to him throwing her arms around his body and hugging him to her so hard that he was afraid she would hurt her own soft flesh in doing it gently he disengaged himself and stepped back she looked him up and down food then clean clothes youre filthy she turned away and began to get out the bread oil cheese and wine frantic to do anything useful he saw over her shoulder how little there was in the cupboards when are they coming she asked finally when she set a generous plate of foodtoo generouson the table in front of him share it with me he asked ive already eaten she answered he knew it was a lie she never ate before her family did then eat some more he insisted it will make me feel at home not like a stranger it may be the last meal we can eat like this together he smiled tears prickling his eyes for all that would be lost she obeyed taking bread and a little wellwatered red wine theyll be here today she asked arent we going to fight giuliano probably tomorrow he answered and i dont know if were going to fight or not the whole island is angry but its just under the surface and i cant read it well enough its easter monday tomorrow she said very quietly the day our lord rose from the dead can we fight on easter day you fight on any day to save the people you love he replied maybe they wont fight she said hopefully maybe but he had seen them and knew otherwise easter monday was beautiful the justiciar john of saint remy celebrated the feast in the palace of the norman knights as if he and his men were unaware of the tension and hatred churning around them in the people they oppressed but then they had refused to learn the sicilian customs or even their language giuliano stood in the streets and gazed at the sicilians pouring into the open filling the alleys and squares with music dancing the womens skirts and bright scarves were like flowers in the wind was all this energy the joy at the risen lord the belief in life everlasting or just the breaking of unbearable tension as they waited for horsemen to arrive and take from them the last vestige of what they possessed not only food but dignity and hope half a dozen young men passed him arms around girls with swaying skirts laughing one of the girls held out a hand to him smiling he hesitated it was churlish not to join them and it set him apart when he hungered with something close to despair to belong at least emotionally he was part of their battle and he would be part of their victory or loss he stood up and ran the few paces after them taking the girls hand they reached an open square where music was playing and began to dance he danced with them until he was exhausted and out of breath a young man offered him wine and he took it it was rough and a little sharp to the taste but he drank it with pleasure passing the bottle back with a smile the girls began to sing and everyone else took up the chorus giuliano did not know the words but it did not matter he caught the tunes quickly no one else seemed to care the wine passed from hand to hand and he drank probably more than he should have the jokes were funny and silly but everyone laughed too easily and too loud now and again he caught someones eye a young man with curly hair a girl with a blue scarf and saw for an instant the grief they also knew was coming then someone started a song or told another joke and they all laughed arms around one another holding too tight he thanked them when he left to go he was tired and hope was fading raw on the edge of despair when he set out with giuseppe maria and their children to attend the vespers service at the church of the holy spirit half a mile or so to the southeast beyond the old city wall it was an austere building and its spare beauty exactly suited his mood the square was crowded with people as if half the countryside had chosen to come here for this most holy celebration they milled around excitement charging the air as if there were a storm to come in spite of the calm spring evening giuliano looked up at the columns and tower a dozen yards away a man began to sing and quickly others joined in it was beautiful totally appropriate as they waited for the vespers bell to ring and the service to begin yet to giuliano it seemed jarringly normal when nothing else was abruptly the singing stopped giuliano swung around and saw horsemen in the street to the north that opened into the square then to the east as well leading from the city walls there must have been a score of them or more a foraging party come to take what they could they looked happy and a little drunk the pounding of his heart almost choked him gradually the singing stopped as the frenchmen came forward apparently intending to join in they began singing loudly in french the man beside giuliano swore in the crowd people moved closer to one another men reaching a hand to clasp a child or a wife there was a low rumble of anger the frenchmen were laughing calling out to the pretty women as one or another caught their eye giuliano felt his muscles ache and his nails bite into the palms of his hands one of the frenchmen called out to a small boy and beckoned him over the child hesitated backing a little behind his mothers skirts she moved a little farther in front of the boy one frenchman shouted something another laughed giuliano heard a cry and saw an officer he held a young woman by the waist and drew her away from the crowd into the mouth of a quiet alley suddenly his hands were all over her body and she was struggling to avoid him turning her head this way and that as he tried to kiss her giuliano pushed his way forward past an old woman and several children but he was too late the young womans husband had already pulled his dagger the french officer lay sprawled on the stones his chest scarlet and blood pooling on the stones beneath him someone gasped and stifled a scream all around the square giuliano saw frenchmen draw their swords to avenge their comrade within seconds the sicilians had their knives drawn also and the fighting escalated there were curses shouting the sun bright on steel and blood on the stones above them all the bells of the church of the holy spirit began ringing the call to vespers and those were echoed by the bells of every other church in the city giuliano was surrounded where were giuseppe and maria he saw tino one of their children looking dazed his face white he lunged forward and seized the boys hand stay by me he ordered wheres your mother tino stared at him too terrified to speak ten feet away a french soldier swung his sword and a sicilian fell to the stones blood gushing from his arm a woman screamed a sicilian lunged at the man arm out holding a dagger the frenchman fell and giuliano dived forward to take his sword then whirled around and snatched the childs arm come giuliano shouted dragging him along he wanted to find giuseppe and maria and the other children but he could not afford to let go of this one all around the square and in the streets leading off it men were fighting and some women seeming just as good with the knives the french were badly outnumbered and already there were men on the ground some struggling to rise others lying still generations of oppression and abuse of poverty fear and humiliation were finding a passion of vengeance at last and the savagery was unstoppable they kept to shadows and narrow ways it was a risk in case they should find the way blocked but the fighting in the square was worse a few yards to the left they could hear the shouts of death to the french and the call on the men of palermo to unite and take back their freedom and their dignity at last giuliano started to run as fast as he could with the boy after covering the complete length of the alley they burst into the quiet courtyard of a dominican convent the scene that met their eyes was hideous a dozen sicilians held ten friars at knifepoint say ciceri one of the sicilians ordered it was the test of nationality no frenchman could pronounce the word the first friar obeyed and was let go staggering tripping over his torn habit almost numb with fear the second was given the same order he stumbled and failed there was a cry of french and giuliano grasped tino and swung him around just as the sicilians slit the friars throat and he fell forward gushing blood tino howled in fear giuliano picked him up and slung him over his shoulder then barged back out the way he had come he stood in the alley trying to draw the air into his lungs still clinging to the boys small body he had wanted the sicilians to rebel to cast off the yoke of oppression but he had never imagined this terrible violence had giuliano known the hatred was so close to the surface would he still have tried to waken it yes he would because the only alternative was worseendless subjection until the life and the heart were crushed out of them the same slow death awaited byzantium he carried tino the rest of the way men crazed with sudden power gorestained scarlet saw the child and let him pass and giuliano was ashamed of his own safety for that reason but he did not stop even when he heard men pleading for their lives women screaming fighting he felt tinos fingers gripping him and he kept moving when at last he reached giuseppe and marias house giuliano was exhausted and shivering fear that they would not be there turned his stomach to water he was still yards from it when the door opened and maria came out she saw him and choked back a cry as he put tino in her arms giuseppe was in the doorway tears running down his cheeks the candlelight yellow behind him a knife in his hand preparing to defend his remaining children if giuliano had been an enemy his face split in a smile and he ran forward dropping the knife and clasping giuliano so tightly that he all but cracked his ribs maria urged them inside and obediently they followed her giuseppe barred the door after them go back to gianni giuseppe said to maria as she left he looked at giuliano hes hurt he said simply she cant leave him the explanation was unnecessary but giuseppe could not take his eyes from tino for more than a few moments and he kept touching the boys head as if to assure himself that he was real and alive a little after first light one of the other fishermen came a man called angelo the children were asleep and maria was upstairs with them were going to meet in the town center angelo said gravely to giuliano and giuseppe his face was burned and there was a cut on his brow blood congealed and his left arm was in a makeshift sling he was filthy and he moved stiffly as if his limbs hurt we must decide what to do now there are hundreds dead maybe thousands the corpses of people block the alleys and the stones are red with blood therell be war giuliano warned angelo nodded we must prepare for it they have called for men from every district and trade so we can choose someone to represent us and ask the pope to recognize us as a commune and ask for his protection from charles of anjou giuliano said incredulously what the hell do you think the pope is going to do hes french for gods sake hes christian giuseppe replied he can give us his protection are you waiting on that giuliano was appalled giuseppe gave him a bleak smile a flash of the old humor in his eyes angelo nodded runners have already gone out to all the towns and villages closest ones first to tell them what has happened and to call on them to rise up with us the whole island will turn against the angevins we are going to march on vicari and give them all the choice of leaving with safe conduct to sail back to provence or what giuseppe asked or death angelo replied i imagine they will choose provence giuliano said dryly and you my friend giuseppe turned to giuliano his face puckered with anxiety his eyes gentle what do you choose these were frenchmen tonight but by next week or next month they may be venetians the fleet lies at messina you are not sicilian this is not your quarrel any hospitality we gave you you have more than repaid go now before you act against your own people still exhausted aching his clothes sticking to him with other mens blood giuliano realized how alone he was i dont have people of my own he said slowly i have friends i have debts and people i love that isnt the same thing i dont know what debts you have giuseppe answered none to me but you are my friend which is why i give you leave to go if honor pulls you i am going to corleone with angelo to tell them to rise also and then after that on to other towns and if i survive it to messina to the fleet yes maria and the children will be safe here now angelo and his family will protect them then im coming with you already in his mind he knew what he was going to do it surprised him he barely had time to be afraid or realize the enormity of it but now that it came to the moment there was no choice after all giuseppe grinned and held out his hand giuliano clasped it ninetyfive giuliano went with giuseppe and the other men leaving palermo and traveling hastily often by night by the middle of april the whole island of sicily was in revolt only one french overlord was spared because of the humanity he had shown in his rule every other garrison was taken and the occupants put to the sword by the end of the month giuliano stood beside giuseppe on the hillside overlooking the harbor of messina below him lay the massed fleet of charles of anjou ships of every size and rig he could name at least two hundred of them crowded together so they darkened the sea and there was barely room for others to swing at anchor without touching one another how many catapults did they carry how many siege towers to storm the city walls how much greek fire to ruin and burn they look deserted giuseppe said quietly squinting into the sun they probably are all but a watch giuliano replied two days earlier messina also had risen against the french who had retreated to the great granite castle of mategriffon but had not had the strength to hold it but they are still a threat to byzantium the venetian fleet is coming with more men more ships more armor the siege engines are still there and the horses can always be stolen again giuseppe stared at him what do you want to sink them giuliano knew that he would be breaking the oath he had made to tiepolo that he would never betray the interests of venice but the world was not the same as it had been when tiepolo was alive venice was not the same rome certainly wasnt burn them he said softly pitch small boats ones we can tow behind a rowing boat it must be when the wind is right and the current and you would do that you a venetian giuseppe said softly half venetian giuliano corrected him my mother was byzantine but that has nothing to do with it or not everything anyway its wrong to conquer byzantium is wrong theres nothing christian in it it doesnt matter who they are or what are their beliefs the point is that it should not ever be who we are giuseppe stared at him you are a strange man giuliano but im with you he held out his hand offering it giuliano took it and gripped it hard holding on to it they gathered allies among the sicilians who had lost relatives friends and brothers to the french they found the boats they needed and the pitch it was not as much as giuliano would have liked but they could not risk waiting any longer he stood alone on the quayside watching the sun set in the west sulfurous underlighting the clouds that would make it darker and obscure the moon he could never watch the sky now without a memory of anastasius stirring in his mind their quiet conversations haunted him when he least expected it and it was anastasius who had given him more than peace with his mother he had healed that deepest wound what part had that in the terrible thing giuliano was planning to do while others were helping him it was his moral decision there were so many ships some with men still aboard he wanted to destroy them all so they would never carry war to byzantium did it matter that they would also not recapture jerusalem would the crusading knights make anything better than it already was in that troubled city anything safer or kinder than now it was too late to change the decision even if he wanted to his mind was afraid of failure afraid of the horror he was about to unleash but he was not in doubt stefano the strongest rower and most familiar with the bay of messina set out first rowing one boat and towing the other with the pitch and oil in it giuseppe set out next when they judged stefano to be halfway across although they could not see him hidden by the forest of ships at anchor he would look as if he were some kind of supply boat with a second unmanned boat behind him he would not be mistaken for a fisherman good luck giuliano said quietly crouching low on the shore and pushing the stern away as giuseppe bent at the oar giuseppe saluted him silently and within moments he was twenty feet away oars dipping without sound rhythmically the waves slapping against the sides he had to work to keep from being carried inshore by the current giuliano waited until he could only just see him then he waded in climbed into his own boat and grasped the oars he was used to the open sea and to giving orders rather than bending his own back but urgency drove him now the emotion high in his chest almost in his throat as he felt the wind and the water begin to fight against him he had not rowed in a long time and his shoulders ached he would have blisters on his hands before the night was out he must be upward of the easternmost warship before he lit the pitch and cast off stefano would be first when he saw the fire start giuseppe in the second boat would light his then finally giuliano they would all have to row out to sea against the current and the wind to be sure of not getting caught in the flames themselves he looked over his shoulder straining in the darkness to see the spark as soon as it showed like the others he had tinder torches and oil to make sure the fire took hold before he cast off the burning boat if he cut it loose too soon and the flames died it would all have been for nothing he reached the point as closely as he could judge but had to keep his hands on the oars to avoid drifting into the fleet slowly he turned so the fireboat was behind him and he was looking westward across the bay where were the others the water was slapping hard against the hull of the boat he had to lean on the oars to keep his distance from the nearest warship the current was running fast and the wind rising his back ached and the muscles of his shoulders cracked he strained his eyes to see then suddenly there it was a wick of light growing a yellow flame bigger and bigger then another closer to him tiny at first but swelling billowing in the darkness he slipped the oars and grasped for the tinder taking a moment to find it in the darkness at the bottom of the boat then he had it he fumbled for the torch found the first one then the second and a third for safety the tinder refused to ignite he was drifting toward the warship the sea taking him faster and faster his fingers were clumsy he must steady himself he had one chance then the tinder caught and the spark lit the torch it flared up he touched it to the second they burned hard and hot he hurled the first one into the boat of oil and pitch the flame took a moment then roared up he lit the third torch from the second and threw them both also the flames were high and hot already he must cut the rope or it would take him with it away to the west the flames were mounting as the fireboats caught the seaward vessels the rope was thick and wet it seemed to take forever to saw through it why hadnt he brought a sharper blade patience at last it was cut through and fell into the sea he sat back on the thwart and grasped the oars throwing his weight into pulling one stroke and then two three he was too close to the warships he could hear men shouting panic in their voices to the west the flames were hard and bright the first ship was ablaze fire up to its masts leaping high he pulled as hard as he could digging the oars deep he must pull evenly tear a muscle now and he would burn with them he must get away then back to shore were giuseppe and stefano all right had they the strength to make shore he should have told giuseppe out in the middle of the bay to make for the farther shore not try to beat against the wind back to the east no that was stupid he wouldnt have to be told the light was growing stronger as the ship in the middle of the bay burned more strongly the canvas of the furled sails was on fire then the greek fire in the hold exploded white hot like the heart of a furnace pieces of flaming debris were sent high into the air giuliano leaned on the oars and caught his breath for a moment as a streamer of flame shot into the sky and landed on another ship catching immediately on the dry wood other pieces fell into the sea he stared at the beauty and horror as one ship after another burned until the whole bay was an inferno like the floor of some visionary hell another ship with greek fire exploded sending debris soaring into the air the roar of it was deafening and the heat seared giulianos skin even as far away as he was a blazing plank of wood splashed into the water only a few feet from him galvanized into action he grasped the oars and threw his body against the weight of them sending the boat hurtling forward fifteen minutes later he reached the eastern shore a hundred feet from where he had set out and stood to watch as one of the warships listed and dropped lower in the water by morning there would be little left of charless fleet the fact that giuliano a venetian had lit the fire that destroyed it was perhaps some small measure of redemption for venice from its ravage of byzantium seventy years ago he turned slowly and made his way toward the town he could see his way quite clearly in the light of the flames they roared up into the sky casting a glare over the drifting wreckage the water of the bay now showing brazen between the jagged black skeletons of the ruined ships it lit the fronts of the houses red and yellow and as giuliano came closer to the buildings he could see their windows brilliant panes of flat gold in the darker stones people were crowding out to watch in amazement and horror at the sight some clung to each other as each new explosion filled the air with sound and fury others stood paralyzed unbelieving giuliano increased his pace striding out giuseppe and stefano would go back into the hills up toward etna where the servants of charless men would never find them but he needed to go to byzantium he must carry the news the massive buttresses of mategriffon towered above him men on the battlements staring into the inferno on the sea their faces lit like effigies of copper giuliano looked up and for a moment saw charles himself his features twisted with rage and the dawning understanding of what had happened to the precious dreams of his lifetime for an instant he looked down perhaps saw something familiar in giulianos stride or the dark outline of his figure as he passed a wall pale in the reflected light charles stiffened with recognition giuliano lifted his arm in a salute in spite of his weariness and the ache in his body he quickened his pace he must be gone before archers could be summoned or soldiers called to hunt him down ninetysix zoe was dead and after the deaths of constantine and palombara anna felt a new constriction and grief even tighter inside her the fear in the city increased as people waited for more immediate news of the invasion rumors spread like brushfire leaping from street to street growing more distorted with each new telling people hoarded food weapons those near the walls stored pitch to light and pour on the enemy when they came every day more people left a constant bleeding away of those who had the means to travel and somewhere to go as always the poor the old and the sick remained fishermen still went out but they stayed close to the shore and were in by nightfall boats moored or pulled up the beach guards on watch against theft anna still treated the sick and found among them more injuries due to the clumsiness of fear and carelessness because muscles were clenched attention divided people sleepless with the constant watching and listening for news of disaster she could give some relief for the physical distress but the reality of what lay ahead she could not treat it was only by being constantly concerned with the small duties she could perform that she could ignore the greater truths there were few she cared for personally now nicephoras would stay as long as the emperor did for them to run away was unthinkable she spoke also to leo when the crusader fleet arrives it will be too late she said quietly to leo one evening after a supper of fish and vegetables we have done all we could for justinian i can look after myself i will feel better if i know you are safe leo put down his fork and looked at her with eyes filled with reproof is that what you expect of me he asked she looked down at her plate i care about you leo i want you to be safe i shall feel a terrible guilt if you suffer because i have brought you here i came willingly he told her she looked up meeting his eyes all right then i shall feel a bitter grief if something happens to you and simonis he asked quietly she still came two or three times a week but she chose times when anna was out it was almost as if she watched the street and waited for the opportunity in his face anna saw compassion and anxiety and felt ashamed that she had not thought of his loneliness before now he and simonis had lived and worked in the same house all their adult lives they had differed over many things and he deplored what she had said to anna over justinian he had always thought her favoring of justinian was wrong but owned that his of anna was just as much at fault leo must miss simonis even the familiarity of their quarrels more than that he was now afraid for her im sorry anna said quietly if there is an invasion when she should be with us please ask her if she will come back she stopped what is it he asked unless she is safer where she is anna finished the thought leo shook his head safety is being with your own people when you are old it is better to die with your family than escape and live with strangers without warning tears filled annas eyes ask her please simonis came back three days later nervous defiant determined that anna should speak first anna was startled by how much thinner she was the bruised look in her face it had been months but she seemed weary as if her joints were stiff anna had planned what to say to simonis but now that she saw a lonely old woman who had lost everyone she loved the prepared words vanished i know it is a great deal to ask you to stay anna said quietly and i will understand if you dont wish to when im staying simonis cut across her her black eyes fierce i do not desert because a battle is coming its not a battle anna pointed out its death simonis shrugged well i wasnt going to live forever anyway her voice trembled a little and that was the end of the conversation anna took a brief respite from attending the sick to go again to the hagia sophia not so much for the mass as to look at the unique beauty of it while it was still there as she walked through its outer aisles and saw the gold of the mosaics the exquisite brooding sloeeyed madonnas and somber figures of christ and his apostles she thought of zoe and was touched by grief far deeper than she would have expected byzantium was less without her life was grayer cant make up your mind whether to be on the floor of the men or the women anastasius she swung around and saw helena standing a few feet away she was magnificently dressed in a dark red tunic and a dalmatica of such a rich blue as to be almost purple or as close as anyone dared come who was not of the imperial house the gold borders on it and the reflection of the red made one look a second time to be certain anna wanted to answer with some cutting reply but all such thought was crowded out of her mind by the sight of a man behind helena anna knew his face although she had not seen him in at least two years it was esaias the only other man apart from demetrios who had survived the assassination plot unscathed why was he here in the hagia sophia with helena and she dressed almost in purple helena comnena zoes daughter to the emperor she had not married demetrios if all she wanted of him was his imperial name there was no point now in a matter of weeks the throne would be in the hands of charles of anjou to give to whomever he wishedsome puppet who would rule it at his behest nicephoras had assumed it would be charless soninlaw but perhaps it would not could he have something different in mind something to curb an ambitious daughter reward a more trustworthy lieutenant and at the same time buy from a troublesome people a degree of peace with a turncoat palaeologus queen what an exquisite betrayal she must not let helena see the thought in her eyes she must say something quickly not a polite reply which helena would know was masking another truth i was thinking of your mother anna said smiling slightly watching giuliano dandolo clean the tomb of his greatgrandfather that was the one vengeance she didnt achieve helenas expression froze that was all a waste of time she said coldly an old woman living in the past i live for the future but then i have one she hadnt what about you anastasiais that your name no helena shrugged well no matterwhatever it is you have no place here anymore i dont know what delusion ever brought you in the first place anna would have been stung had not her thoughts been racing as to what esaias was doing with helena she remembered his part in the original plot it was he who had courted the young andronicus with the intent of murdering him also if she was planning an alliance of some sort with charles of anjou then was esaias the one who carried word back and forth helena would never be fool enough to commit anything damning to paper nor would she travel herself and she would not have trusted any of zoes men helena was waiting for a response its over now anyway anna said quietly she knew justinian was guilty of bessarions death in an act of loyalty to byzantium and in a few weeks even days it would no longer matter anymore helena lifted her head a little higher and walked away in dark glowing reds esaias followed after her anna walked slowly into one of the small side chapels and bent her head in thought close to prayer she lifted her eyes to the somber face of the madonna above her surrounded in a million tiny bricks of gold if she could tell michael something he did not know something he believed still mattered she might persuade him to pardon justinian a letter from the emperor could still be law with the monks of sinai how much proof would it take for michael to believe in this darkening time might he be more willing than before to perform one last act of clemency perhaps she might yet succeed she closed her eyes mary mother of god forgive me for giving up too soon please perhaps you cant save the city we should have saved ourselves but help me free justinian please she looked up at the strong beautiful face i dont know whether we deserve your help maybe we dont but we need it then she swiveled around and walked quickly and silently after helena so she could follow esaias when the mass was over she needed to know everything about him that she could she told leo and simonis because she needed their help what do you want me to do he asked puzzled they were sitting over an early supper i need to know if hes traveled she replied i cant prove where to but i can gain some idea if i can find out which ships he sailed on ill find out when simonis interrupted they both turned to her in surprise servants know she said impatiently for heavens sake isnt it obvious enough food supplies packing clothes maybe closing off part of the house he might have brought treasures for himself for his house new clothes they will know where he went one of them will have gone with him and they will certainly know for how long leo looked at anna and when we know what are you going to do he asked grimly his face shadowed eyes filled with sadness tell the emperor she replied and he will execute helena simonis said with satisfaction more likely have her murdered in private leo said before turning to anna but not before she has told the emperor everything she knows about you including that you are a woman and have fooled him all these years that you have treated him personallyvery personally you will not walk away without paying for that perhaps with your life will you buy justinians freedom at the cost of your own he asked his voice no more than a whisper i am not sure if i am willing to help you do that simonis blinked hesitated looking first at anna then at leo neither am i she said at last dont you want to stop helena if that is what she plans to do anna asked receiving no response she tried again we may be killed when the city is taken anyway please find this for me you should live simonis said angrily the tears running down her face youre a physician think of all the trouble your father took to teach you find out or ill have to anna said and you would be better at it than i would are you ordering me to simonis responded would that make any difference because if it would then yes i am simonis said nothing but anna knew she would do it and do it with courage and dedication thank you she said with a smile simonis stood up and stalked out of the room it was a few days later that enough information was pieced together for anna to be certain that esaias had traveled to palermo and to naples on helenas behalf and that helena at least believed that she had a promise from the king of the two sicilies for her to rule byzantium as consort of the puppet emperor he would place on the throne her comnenos and palaeologus heritage would legitimize the succession in the eyes of the people she would be empressa feat zoe could never have achieved anna went to the blachernae palace to speak to nicephoras she would do it straightaway before she lost her nerve before she allowed leo or simonis to dissuade her she climbed the steps and went in through the huge entrance acknowledged by the varangian guard who knew her well how many more times would she do this could it even be the last this evening as the dusk settled purple over asia and the last light flickered on the waters of the bosphorus she asked to see nicephoras telling his servant that it was urgent he was used to her calls and did not question her ten minutes later she was alone with nicephoras in his room it looked exactly as it had the first time she was here only nicephoras himself was changed he looked tired and much older there were hollows around his eyes and blue veins in his hands have you come to say goodbye he asked making no attempt to smile you have no need to stay you know i will remain with the emperor the injuries we are about to receive cannot be healed except by god i would like to think you are safe that would be a gift you could give me perhaps this will be goodbye she found this meeting harder than she had been prepared for her voice wavered and she mastered it only with difficulty but that is not what i came for i came because i have news of helena comnena which you should know he gave a slight shrug does it matter now yes i have proof that she has been in communication with charles of anjou to make an agreement with him nicephoras was startled what could she possibly offer him a kind of legitimacy a palaeologa wife for whatever puppet he puts on the throne of byzantium none of michaels daughters would betray him by doing such a thing nicephorus replied instantly not a legitimate daughterillegitimate his eyes widened with incredulity then dawning horror are you sure he breathed yes eirene vatatzes told me gregory knew from zoe whether it is true or not hardly matters although i believe it the thing is that helena believes it and charles of anjou may choose to how was helena in communication with charles letters do you have them she wouldnt be so foolish words a signet ring a locket things whose meaning is clear only when you know it already all these through esaias glabas he was part of the original plot to murder the emperor which my brother justinian foiled he is the only one left apart from demetrios vatatzes for whom helena has no further use and you have come to tell the emperor her hands were clenched so tight her muscles ached and her breathing was ragged i want something in return because helena will denounce me to the emperor and he will not forgive me for having deceived him nicephoras bit his lip and his face was bleak that is true what do you want anna freedom for your brother yes a letter of pardon would still achieve that please nicephoras smiled i think that would be possible but you must not lie to him about anything it is too late for that now you must tell him that you are a woman and that you deceived him in order to learn the truth and prove justinians innocence she felt herself go cold she could not get enough air into her lungs i cant it would mean i had deceived you also he cant forgive you for that because you should have told him and had me imprisoned at the very least i should have he agreed but i dont think he will have us executed now these are the last days and i have served him since my childhood as much as it is possible we are friends i do not think he can afford to cast aside a friend in these last few months before the midnight of our empire then then we had best do it she said her voice cracking he looked at her steadily for several seconds then when she did not avert her eyes he reached for a small goldandenamel bell and rang it a member of the varangian guard appeared almost immediately nicephoras gave him an order to bring helena comnena to the emperor straightaway on pain of death startled palefaced the man withdrew to obey anna he said we have much to say before helena comes he led her along the familiar corridors with the ruined statues she found herself trembling ridiculously close to weeping as she thought how all this would soon be smashed again trodden through by people who did not love it did not even imagine the beauty of mind and heart it had once been too soon anna was in the formal room where the emperor received his subjects nicephoras went in ahead of her then returned to conduct her in she followed bowing low not meeting the emperors eyes until commanded to do so when he spoke she looked up what she saw chilled her michael palaeologus was not yet sixty but he was an old man he had the holloweyed look of one whose days were numbered what is it anastasius he asked searching her face slowly have you come to tell me anything i do not already know im not certain majesty she was trembling and her words stuck in her throat all but stopping her from breathing nicephoras plunged in for her majesty anastasius has word of an act of betrayal you may choose to allow or choose to prevent perhaps it will come to nothing in the end anyway what betrayal anastasius do you imagine it matters now yes majesty her voice was trembling her body was cold helena comnena has been in communication with charles of anjou really telling him what how to invade our city how to break its walls so the crusaders of the pope can put us to fire and the sword again in the name of christ no majesty so that when he has taken us and killed those loyal to you the empire and the church he can crown a new emperor in your place with a wife who can claim two royal names and an inheritance sufficient to give him some hold on the peoples obedience michael leaned forward a little in his chair his face pale the lamplight catching the white in his hair and beard what are you saying anastasius be careful whom you accuse we are not fallen yet it may be only a few days even hours but i still hold life and death in byzantium her body shook i know majesty helena is the widow of bessarion comnenos and and also she is your illegitimate daughter by zoe chrysaphes she did not know this until eirene vatatzes died her mother never told her he sat immobile for so long she was afraid he had had some kind of seizure how do you know this anastasius michael asked at length eirene told me she said in a whisper i cared for her at her death she wanted helena to know so she would take her own vengeance on zoe because gregory loved her and not eirene that i can believe michael said and why do you tell me now on the eve of ruin i did not know of helenas plan until i saw her in the hagia sophia wearing blue that was almost purple then i sought for the proof she swallowed now i have it may it please your majesty i would like a last act of mercy from you while you can give it because you have the power of death and also of life please give me a letter of pardon for my brother justinian lascaris who is imprisoned at st catherines in sinai for his part in the murder of bessarion comnenos he is in prison for his part in the plot to usurp the throne michael corrected her the plot failed because he could not dissuade them so he killed bessarion she argued she had little to lose now he spread his hands slightly so justinian was your brother why do you call yourself zarides is lascaris too dangerous a name for you or are you ashamed of it looking at michaels eyes she knew he would not forgive her it is not justinians fault she whispered he knew nothing of it of what michael was waiting in a few days they might all be dead and it would be too late she thought of giuliano whom she would never see again perhaps that was just as well he would not forgive her either i am a good physician majesty but i am not a eunuch anna said huskily the emperor did not understand i am a woman zarides was my husbands name so it is mine i was born anna lascaris and gave it up only reluctantly she could feel the hot tears stinging her eyes and her throat so tight that it ached almost too much to breathe there was such silence in the room that when one of the varangian guard at the far end shifted the position of his feet on the floor the rustle of it was audible michael sat back staring at anna then suddenly he burst into laughter a rich jubilant sound of sheer hilarious delight anna could not believe it then the varangian guard at the end of the room obedient as always laughed as well nicephoras joined in a note of relief near hysteria the tears spilled over annas eyes and she laughed as well although it was closer to sobbing she did it only because she had to if the emperor laughed then everyone must too then just as suddenly michael was sober again the sound cut off instantly he stared at nicephoras you knew this nicephoras nicephoras flushed deeply not in the beginning majesty by the time i did i also knew that she would not hurt you indeed i trusted her more than any other physician both for her skill which is great and for her loyalty which i knew i could rely on i imagine you could said michael you are highly fortunate that i have the humor of despair or i might not find this so amusing thank you majesty why tell me nicephoras if you had said nothing i would not have known why risk my anger helena comnena knows majesty and in revenge for anna lascaris telling you of her plan she will understandably in time betray annas secret to you i see he leaned back in his seat again of course she will michael turned to look at anna a look of fascination in his black eyes you would make a handsome woman i can imagine helena hates you zoe liked you you know did she know you are a woman yes majesty that explains much that i found curious how byzantine his voice choked suddenly in emotion and the words died in his throat anna looked away to watch him now was intrusive she stood still because she had not been excused but she kept her eyes downcast there was a disturbance outside and the door opened two of the varangian guard appeared with helena between them as in the hagia sophia she was dressed in blue that bordered on purple come michael ordered the varangian guard marched her forward half dragging her her feet stumbling they stopped in front of the emperor still holding helena by both wrists her face was flushed her hair half pulled undone from its elaborate coil as if she had struggled hard for once in her fury she had an echo of zoes magnificence one of the guards opened his fist and let fall in michaels lap a ring a locket and a small box the calm leached out of helenas face your pact with charles of anjou michael said quietly her face twisted in a sneer you believe that liar she jerked her head toward anna stopping short only as the bindings caught her wrist that physician of yours is a woman majesty did you know that a woman as much as i am poking and prying at your body without shame you take her word over mine michael looked anna up and down are you sure he is a woman he asked curiously helena gave a bark of laughter of course im sure rip off her tunic and youll see how long have you known he asked years and you did not think to tell me before today why is that helena palaeologa too late she realized her mistake her eyes were wild like those of an animal scenting blood and death michael continued she is anna lascaris of imperial blood like yoursor mine she told me herself but she is an excellent physician and that is what i required of her thatand loyalty helena drew in her breath as if to speak then understood that it would change nothing and she let it out again soundlessly michael made a small quick gesture with his hand and the varangian guard tightened their grip on helena and turned pulling her away she sagged a little as if the strength had left her legs and she had difficulty holding herself up i never trusted zoe michael said his voice soft with regret but i liked her she was a magnificent woman all fire and passion and within her own dreadful code a kind of honor he turned to anna you will have your letter you had best hurry while my word is good when the city falls it may mean nothing he smiled bleakly but helena has friends you would be advised to leave here as a woman it would be best for you that as far as they know both you and helena came into the palaceand neither of you left it was a moment before annas voice would come and even then it was husky a little tremulous yes majesty thank you nicephoras reached out his hand and took her elbow guiding her backward out of michaels presence as soon as they were alone in a corridor beyond the great hall she turned to him will they imprison helena what happens when the city falls the varangian guard will break her neck he told her with charless fleet on the horizon no one will care come i will find womens clothes for you and while you are changing i will write the letter and the emperor will sign it then you must go he smiled i will miss you she touched his hand i will miss you too there is no one else with whom i can talk as we have then she looked away in case he found the loneliness in her too much an echo of his own nicephoras went with her down to the quayside the summer night was brilliant with stars but it was too late for the water taxis instead there was one of the emperors barges waiting to take her across the golden horn to galata this was the last time she would set foot in constantinople she was glad it was too dark for him to see the grief in her face the love of all that was over and on the brink of destruction you cannot come back he warned i will send messages to your servants it is better if they stay here for a few days at the very least helenas friends and allies will be watching esaias and whoever else demetrios perhaps and others helena was like her mother in one thing come victory or despair triumph or ruin she never forgot a vengeance you do sometimes easily and zoe thought that was a weakness in you it kept you from being truly like her she was surprised like her she saw in you her own passion for life but weakened by the power to forgive but i think in the end she realized it was really your strength it made you whole where she was not a tide of guilt swept over anna that she was not worthy of this praise certainly she had forgiven many things small and unimportant but she had kept the greatest ones where the injury had wounded her where no healing was possible she had never forgiven her husband eustathius she had hidden the revulsion she had felt the guilt because she could not love him could not bear to carry his child or for the hunger that had burned inside her unanswered she had never let go of blaming him for her own act of provoking that terrible searing debasing fight she remembered the shame even more than the pain and the blood was she blaming him because he had allowed all his frustration his fury of helplessness confusion and defeat to explode in violence or was it her own guilt because she had half wanted him to descend so far yes he had been brutal but that was a burden on his soul that she could not reach or help now the time when perhaps she could have was past and she had wasted it that was something else for which she needed forgiveness she tried to think of what had been good in him it was difficult until she thought first of what had been wounded also and then the pity came scouring deep with the awareness that she should have been gentler if she had helped him instead of lashing out from her own hurt he might have found the best in himself she remembered his skill with animals how he spoke softly to his horses sat up all night with them when they were wounded or ill his total joy at the birth of a foal and how he had praised the mare stroked her loved her she found the tears wet on her own face with regret that she had let that slip away from him selfish with her own need she let go of her anger and in the darkness bowed her head im sorry she said the words in her mind humbly and passionately please god forgive me help me to be whole in spirit to give others the mercy i so desperately need myself slowly she felt the burden dissolve and absolution enfolded her like an embrace easing out all the old pain and washing it away the ache disappeared and a sweet warmth filled the emptiness inside they reached the edge of the water the barge was ready knocking gently against the steps as the ripples carried it it was time to go there was nothing more to say she was dressed as a woman again the only other time in nearly ten years had been in jerusalem with giuliano this was difficult she put her hand up and touched nicephorass face then kissed his cheek then as his arm tightened around her for a moment she slipped away and went down the steps into the boat it was dawn when she arrived at avram shachars house by now long familiar to her it was far too early to expect anyone to be up but she dared not wait in the streets a woman alone was more vulnerable than a eunuch would have been even with a fuller tunic and her figure unbound so the outline of her breasts and hips was clear she had to keep reminding herself that now she looked utterly different beneath the minimal veil of decency her bright chestnut hair was visible the heat was oppressive and would be worse when the sun rose the streets were parched and dusty with summer drought she knocked on shachars door and waited after several minutes had gone by she knocked again and almost immediately he appeared blinking a little obviously woken from sleep yes he looked her up and down puzzled but gentle as always is someone in your house ill youd better come in he stepped back and pulled the door wide for her she followed him through to the room where he kept his herbs treading softly to avoid disturbing the rest of the household he lit the candles and turned to look at her again his face anxious as if he knew he should know her and was embarrassed that he did not searching his memory anna zarides she said quietly his eyes widened in amazement when he realized who she was what has happened tell me what can i do i have the emperors pardon for my brother she replied i have to leave constantinople but i need to go to sinai anyway before the city falls so i can have justinian freed while the emperors word still counts can you help me i dont know how im going to do it i need to get a message back to leo and simonis and have them come with what money i can raise i dare not return to the city myself he nodded slowly beginning to smile and i must see that they are taken care of leo might come with me but simonis should go back to nicea of course he said softly of course i will see to it first you must eat then rest ninetyseven giuliano had left sicily in haste knowing that charles would search for him and execute him if he was found he had taken the first ship leaving and made his way east stopping at athens and abydos only to change ships and go on again as fast as possible now at sunrise he was in the harbor of constantinople at last he went ashore immediately after he had washed shaved and made himself as tidy as possible he had nothing but the clothes in which he had set fire to the fleet in the bay of messina and what he had bought in haste in athens he walked up the dockside into the narrow streets and made the climb up to the blachernae palace with a stab of grief he was aware of the pall of fear that hung over the city no one could fail to notice the empty shops and houses the unnatural silence the sense of abandonment it was as if they were already dying when he reached the palace he was stopped by the varangian guard they would be at their posts until they were mown down or hacked to pieces but never with their backs to the foe giuliano dandolo he said pulling himself to attention newly landed within the hour from messina i bring good news to his majesty please take me to nicephoras the first guard a huge man with pale hair and sea blue eyes looked amazed good news excellent news do you expect me to tell you before i tell the emperor they found nicephoras in his rooms alone bread and fruit lay on a small table he was standing in the center of the floor he looked older than when giuliano had last seen him and touched by a loneliness so sharp that even with good news bursting inside him giuliano could not be unaware of it may i offer you food drink nicephoras asked giuliano knew he must look exhausted even unkempt but he could not take the smile from his face he had such a gift to give the crusader fleet is sunk he said as if it were a reply burned in messina harbor charles of anjou will never sail in it to byzantium or jerusalem or anywhere it lies at the bottom of the sea nicephoras stared at him his face slowly filling with wonder are you sure he whispered perfectly his voice was vibrant cracking with excitement i saw it myself i was one of those who set the torches i shall never forget it as long as i live when the greek fire in the holds exploded the sea was like the floor of hell nicephoras put out his hand and grasped giulianos with a strength that almost crushed it a power giuliano would never have believed him to possess there were tears in his eyes we must tell the emperor this time there was no waiting for michael to receive them no formal admission to the throne room they strode in past the varangian guard as if it were any other room in the world michael was hastily dressed but wide awake his eyes burned black intensely alive in spite of his haggard face and the hollows where the bones of his head seemed to strain the parchmentthin skin majesty giuliano said quietly speak giuliano looked up and met michaels gaze as if they had been equals charles of anjou will never threaten byzantium again majesty his fleet lies burned at the bottom of the bay of messina he is a finished man even sicily will breathe free from his oppression michael stared you have seen this yourself captain dandolo set the torches majesty nicephoras offered you are venetian michael said incredulously half majesty my mother was byzantine he said it with pride michael nodded slowly the tension and pain easing out of his body the smile spreading over this face his eyes bright he waved at nicephoras still looking at giuliano give this man everything he wants give him food wine rest clean clothes he took the goldandemerald ring from his finger and held it out giuliano looked at its burning beauty take it michael told him now we will hear the city rejoice nicephoras have the good news spread let there be dancing in the streets wine and feasting music laughter put on our best clothes he stopped and looked again at giuliano zoe chrysaphes is dead its a pity how she would have laughed at the irony of this byzantium thanks you giuliano dandolo now go and eat drink take your ease you will be paid in gold giuliano bowed and withdrew dizzy with triumph but once in the corridor he could think only of telling the people he cared for in the city starting with anastasius he must tell him first all the others could hear afterward the news would be everywhere but he must tell anastasius himself see his joy his relief thank you but i must tell my friends the news he said to nicephoras beside him i want to do that myself i must be there when they hear nicephoras nodded of course you will find anastasius in galata in the house of avram shachar not here not in his own house a chill touched giuliano why is something wrong suddenly the news was hollow he realized how intensely he had been looking forward to telling anastasius you will find him much changed nicephoras replied but quite well changed how shachar lives in the street of the apothecaries it will all explain itself go before they leave for the south leo and simonis went from here yesterday already you have little time he smiled byzantium owes you much and we will not forget giuliano clasped his hand again the emperors ring digging into his flesh then he turned and left as soon as michael palaeologus equal of the apostles was alone he went to his own rooms and closed the doors he was tired the long battle had exhausted him and there was a weakness inside him that he knew would not heal he bent in front of the locked cabinet and took the key from around his neck he slipped it in the lock and opened it she was there as always her calm face in its sublime beauty the mother of god that st luke had painted and zoe chrysaphes had given him he knelt in front of her the tears sliding easily down his face thank you he said simply in spite of our weakness and our doubts you have saved us from our enemies and a greater miracle than that you have saved us from ourselves he crossed himself in the old greek way but he remained on his knees giuliano found the street of the apothecaries but it seemed to take an age and all the way down the hill from the palace into the docks and on the quayside waiting for the water taxi his mind was racing what had nicephoras meant what sort of change he did not want anastasius different from the passion and the courage the wit and the gentleness that he remembered he wanted the same warm clever and vulnerable person he had known and cared for so profoundly he strode up the street of the apothecaries in the hot summer sun past the empty shops and markets the deserted houses the news would be here any moment spreading like fire he wanted to be the first to tell anastasius where is the shop of avram shachar he called out to a man slowly opening his door and peering out the man pointed giuliano thanked him and increased his pace he found the right door and banged on it too hard and realized with embarrassment that he was being rude im sorry he said as soon as it was opened im looking for anastasius zarides is he here shachar nodded but he did not step aside or invite him in im giuliano dandolo a friend of anastasius i have great good news charles of anjou is fallen his fleet is sunkburned and at the bottom of the sea i want to be the one to tell him he realized he was gabbling and took a breath to steady himself please shachar nodded slowly his eyes searching giulianos face that is true yes i swear i have already told the emperor but i want to tell anastasius myselfand you shachars face split into a broad smile thank you you had better come in he pulled the door wide and pointed to a room at the farther end of the corridor the herb room is there anastasius will be working with them no one will disturb you he seemed about to add something more then changed his mind thank you giuliano brushed past him and went down to the door then apprehension swept over him what changes had nicephoras meant what had happened was anastasius ill injured he knocked hard on the door it opened and a woman stood just inside she was taller than average with a slender throat high cheekbones and bright chestnut hair there was something beautiful in her that tugged at him as if he had known her for as long as he could remember yet he had never seen her before the color swept up her skin in a burning tide giuliano her voice was husky as if she found it difficult to speak he did not know what to say he knew now he felt a rage of embarrassment burst open inside him for all the things he had said the emotions the stories shared about which he could recall not the words but the intense feeling of companionship almost intimacy as if nothing need be hidden then he remembered the awakening of physical hunger in himself and the shame and confusion that had all but crippled him he had struggled with such pain to stifle that it seared through him with shock what had she felt he averted his eyes and saw the herbs and ointments packed away as if to travel is shachar leaving he asked impulsively are you she smiled blinking rapidly as if to dispel tears the crusaders will come any day now when they do it will not be good for jews to be hereor muslims is that why he looked at her womans tunic it embarrassed him and pleased him to see how feminine her body was beneath it as rich as zoes no she said quickly helena was going to ally with the invaders to rule with them shes michaels illegitimate daughter i found proof of her plans and i told the emperor she told him i was a woman he caught the pain in her voice then looked up and saw it harsh and sad in her face he could only imagine how it hurt anas he stopped he did not know her name anna lascaris she whispered he reached out his hand not to touch her just in a gesture he thought of all his own disillusion the dreams and the friendships failed the long loneliness of it its over now she said quietly the emperor allowed me to go but i cannot stay in the city simonis will go home to nicea if that falls too it wont he cut across her urgently none if it will byzantium is safe at least from charles of anjou his whole fleet is at the bottom of messina harbor i saw it myself the crusade will never happen the joy and relief welled up inside him he wanted to take her in his arms and hug her so hard that he lifted her off her feet whirled her around he ached to do it with an almost physical pain but it would not end there you dont have to leave he said she met his gaze studying him yes i do helena had friends allies they will know i was responsible for her betrayal to michael they killed her in the palace broke her neck they wont forgive me for that he tried to imagine it the passion and violence and i have michaels letter of pardon for my brother she went on i must take it to jerusalem and then sinai if she was not here what use was byzantium without her are you going back to venice her voice caught on the words no he shook his head fractionally i was one of those who set the fleet on fire why the sudden modesty in front of her because boasting was shallow and in the end without meaning what he wanted above anything and everything else was to go with her to jerusalem not only the jerusalem of the world but the destination of the heart shachar doesnt have to leave byzantium he said softly hell be safe here ill go with youif i may the color swept up her face again but this time she did not look away im im not a eunuch anymore i know do you it was a question he saw the fear in her eyes something hurt her almost more than she could bear her body was stiff as if pain filled her and ran out of control what did she believe he meant as your husband he said quickly she wanted to look away but this was the moment when the last deceit must go whatever it cost i cannot have children she whispered its my own fault ive regretted it with all my time and my strength but it changes nothing i hated my husband and i provoked him until he beat me she stopped the grief inside choking her she wanted passion the giving and the taking with a fierceness that consumed her but the lie could destroy everything i can live without children he said quietly touching her cheek with his fingers but i cannot be fully alive without you i should be alone always alone and that is to be shut out of heaven marry me and we shall travel to jerusalem well find that pathway of the spirit that goes always upward or make it there will be people to defend and to heal she reached up and closed her hand over his putting it to his lips i will she promised i
