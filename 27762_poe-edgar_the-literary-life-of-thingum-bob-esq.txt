the literary life of thingum bob esq by edgar allan poe i am now growing in years andsince i understand that shakespeare and mr emmons are deceasedit is not impossible that i may even die it has occurred to me therefore that i may as well retire from the field of letters and repose upon my laurels but i am ambitious of signalizing my abdication of the literary sceptre by some important bequest to posterity and perhaps i cannot do a better thing than just pen for it an account of my earlier career my name indeed has been so long and so constantly before the public eye that i am not only willing to admit the naturalness of the interest which it has everywhere excited but ready to satisfy the extreme curiosity which it has inspired in fact it is no more than the duty of him who achieves greatness to leave behind him in his ascent such landmarks as may guide others to be great i propose therefore in the present paper which i had some idea of calling memoranda to serve for the literary history of america to give a detail of those important yet feeble and tottering first steps by which at length i attained the high road to the pinnacle of human renown of ones very remote ancestors it is superfluous to say much my father thomas bob esq stood for many years at the summit of his profession which was that of a merchantbarber in the city of smug his warehouse was the resort of all the principal people of the place and especially of the editorial corpsa body which inspires all about it with profound veneration and awe for my own part i regarded them as gods and drank in with avidity the rich wit and wisdom which continuously flowed from their august mouths during the process of what is styled lather my first moment of positive inspiration must be dated from that evermemorable epoch when the brilliant conductor of the gadfly in the intervals of the important process just mentioned recited aloud before a conclave of our apprentices an inimitable poem in honor of the only genuine oilofbob so called from its talented inventor my father and for which effusion the editor of the fly was remunerated with a regal liberality by the firm of thomas bob company merchantbarbers the genius of the stanzas to the oilofbob first breathed into me i say the divine afflatus i resolved at once to become a great man and to commence by becoming a great poet that very evening i fell upon my knees at the feet of my father father i said pardon mebut i have a soul above lather it is my firm intention to cut the shop i would be an editori would be a poeti would pen stanzas to the oilofbob pardon me and aid me to be great my dear thingum replied father i had been christened thingum after a wealthy relative so surnamed my dear thingum he said raising me from my knees by the earsthingum my boy youre a trump and take after your father in having a soul you have an immense head too and it must hold a great many brains this i have long seen and therefore had thoughts of making you a lawyer the business however has grown ungenteel and that of a politician dont pay upon the whole you judge wiselythe trade of editor is bestand if you can be a poet at the same timeas most of the editors are by the by why you will kill two birds with the one stone to encourage you in the beginning of things i will allow you a garret pen ink and paper a rhyming dictionary and a copy of the gadfly i suppose you would scarcely demand any more i would be an ungrateful villain if i did i replied with enthusiasm your generosity is boundless i will repay it by making you the father of a genius thus ended my conference with the best of men and immediately upon its termination i betook myself with zeal to my poetical labors as upon these chiefly i founded my hopes of ultimate elevation to the editorial chair in my first attempts at composition i found the stanzas to the oilofbob rather a drawback than otherwise their splendor more dazzled than enlightened me the contemplation of their excellence tended naturally to discourage me by comparison with my own abortions so that for a long time i labored in vain at length there came into my head one of those exquisitely original ideas which now and then will permeate the brain of a man of genius it was thisor rather thus was it carried into execution from the rubbish of an old bookstall in a very remote corner of the town i got together several antique and altogether unknown or forgotten volumes the bookseller sold them to me for a song from one of these which purported to be a translation of one dantes inferno i copied with remarkable neatness a long passage about a man named ugolino who had a parcel of brats from another which contained a good many old plays by some person whose name i forget i enacted in the same manner and with the same care a great number of lines about angels and ministers saying grace and goblins damned and more besides of that sort from a third which was the composition of some blind man or other either a greek or a choctawi cannot be at the pains of remembering every trifle exactlyi took about fifty verses beginning with achilles wrath and grease and something else from a fourth which i recollect was also the work of a blind man i selected a page or two all about hail and holy light and although a blind man has no business to write about light still the verses were sufficiently good in their way having made fair copies of these poems i signed every one of them oppodeldoc a fine sonorous name and doing each up nicely in a separate envelope i dispatched one to each of the four principal magazines with a request for speedy insertion and prompt pay the result of this wellconceived plan however the success of which would have saved me much trouble in afterlife served to convince me that some editors are not to be bamboozled and gave the coupdegrace as they say in france to my nascent hopes as they say in the city of the transcendentals the fact is that each and every one of the magazines in question gave mr oppodeldoc a complete usingup in the monthly notices to correspondents the humdrum gave him a dressing after this fashion oppodeldoc whoever he is has sent us a long tirade concerning a bedlamite whom he styles ugolino had a great many children that should have been all whipped and sent to bed without their suppers the whole affair is exceedingly tamenot to say flat oppodeldoc whoever he is is entirely devoid of imaginationand imagination in our humble opinion is not only the soul of poesy but also its very heart oppodeldoc whoever he is has the audacity to demand of us for his twattle a speedy insertion and prompt pay we neither insert nor purchase any stuff of the sort there can be no doubt however that he would meet with a ready sale for all the balderdash he can scribble at the office of either the rowdydow the lollipop or the goosetherumfoodle all this it must be acknowledged was very severe upon oppodeldocbut the unkindest cut was putting the word poesy in small caps in those five preeminent letters what a world of bitterness is there not involved but oppodeldoc was punished with equal severity in the rowdy dow which spoke thus we have received a most singular and insolent communication from a person whoever he is signing himself oppodeldocthus desecrating the greatness of the illustrious roman emperor so named accompanying the letter of oppodeldoc whoever he is we find sundry lines of most disgusting and unmeaning rant about angels and ministers of gracerant such as no madman short of a nat lee or an oppodeldoc could possibly perpetrate and for this trash of trash we are modestly requested to pay promptly no sirno we pay for nothing of that sort apply to the humdrum the lollipop or the goosetherumfoodle these periodicals will undoubtedly accept any literary offal you may send themand as undoubtedly promise to pay for it this was bitter indeed upon poor oppodeldoc but in this instance the weight of the satire falls upon the humdrum the lollipop and the goosetherumfoodle who are pungently styled periodicalsin italics tooa thing that must have cut them to the heart scarcely less savage was the lollipop which thus discoursed some individual who rejoices in the appellation oppodeldoc to what low uses are the names of the illustrious dead too often applied has enclosed us some fifty or sixty verses commencing after this fashion achilles wrath to greece the direful spring of woes unnumbered c c c c oppodeldoc whoever he is is respectfully informed that there is not a printers devil in our office who is not in the daily habit of composing better lines those of oppodeldoc will not scan oppodeldoc should learn to count but why he should have conceived the idea that we of all others we would disgrace our pages with his ineffable nonsense is utterly beyond comprehension why the absurd twattle is scarcely good enough for the humdrum the rowdydow the goosetherumfoodlethings that are in the practice of publishing mother gooses melodies as original lyrics and oppodeldoc whoever he is has even the assurance to demand pay for this drivel does oppodeldoc whoever he is knowis he aware that we could not be paid to insert it as i perused this i felt myself growing gradually smaller and smaller and when i came to the point at which the editor sneered at the poem as verses there was little more than an ounce of me left as for oppodeldoc i began to experience compassion for the poor fellow but the goosetherumfoodle showed if possible less mercy than the lollipop it was the goosetherumfoodle that said a wretched poetaster who signs himself oppodeldoc is silly enough to fancy that we will print and pay for a medley of incoherent and ungrammatical bombast which he has transmitted to us and which commences with the following most intelligible line hail holy light offspring of heaven first born we say most intelligible oppodeldoc whoever he is will be kind enough to tell us perhaps how hail can be holy light we always regarded it as frozen rain will he inform us also how frozen rain can be at one and the same time both holy light whatever that is and an offspringwhich latter term if we understand anything about english is only employed with propriety in reference to small babies of about six weeks old but it is preposterous to descant upon such absurdityalthough oppodeldoc whoever he is has the unparalled effrontery to suppose that we will not only insert his ignorant ravings but absolutely pay for them now this is fineit is richand we have half a mind to punish this young scribbler for his egotism by really publishing his effusion verbatim et literatim as he has written it we could inflict no punishment so severe and we would inflict it but for the boredom which we should cause our readers in so doing let oppodeldoc whoever he is send any future composition of like character to the humdrum the lollipop or the rowdydow they will insert it they insert every month just such stuff send it to them we are not to be insulted with impunity this made an end of me and as for the humdrum the rowdydow and the lollipop i never could comprehend how they survived it the putting them in the smallest possible minion that was the rubthereby insinuating their lownesstheir baseness while we stood looking upon them in gigantic capitalsoh it was too bitterit was wormwoodit was gall had i been either of these periodicals i would have spared no pains to have the goosetherumfoodle prosecuted it might have been done under the act for the prevention of cruelty to animals for oppodeldoc whoever he was i had by this time lost all patience with the fellow and sympathized with him no longer he was a fool beyond doubt whoever he was and got not a kick more than he deserved the result of my experiment with the old books convinced me in the first place that honesty is the best policy and in the second that if i could not write better than mr dante and the two blind men and the rest of the old set it would at least be a difficult matter to write worse i took heart therefore and determined to prosecute the entirely original as they say on the covers of the magazines at whatever cost of study and pains i again placed before my eyes as a model the brilliant stanzas on the oilofbob by the editor of the gadfly and resolved to construct an ode on the same sublime theme in rivalry of what had already been done with my first line i had no material difficulty it ran thus to pen an ode upon the oilofbob having carefully looked out however all the legitimate rhymes to bob i found it impossible to proceed in this dilemma i had recourse to paternal aid and after some hours of mature thought my father and myself thus constructed the poem to pen an ode upon the oilofbob is all sorts of a job signed snob to be sure this composition was of no very great lengthbut i have yet to learn as they say in the edinburgh review that the mere extent of a literary work has anything to do with its merit as for the quarterly cant about sustained effort it is impossible to see the sense of it upon the whole therefore i was satisfied with the success of my maiden attempt and now the only question regarded the disposal i should make of it my father suggested that i should send it to the gadflybut there were two reasons which operated to prevent me from so doing i dreaded the jealousy of the editorand i had ascertained that he did not pay for original contributions i therefore after due deliberation consigned the article to the more dignified pages of the lollipop and awaited the event in anxiety but with resignation in the very next published number i had the proud satisfaction of seeing my poem printed at length as the leading article with the following significant words prefixed in italics and between brackets we call the attention of our readers to the subjoined admirable on the oilofbob we need say nothing of their sublimity or of their pathosit is impossible to peruse them without tears those who have been nauseated with a sad dose on the same august topic from the goosequill of the editor of the gadfly will do well to compare the two compositions p swe are consumed with anxiety to probe the mystery which envelops the evident pseudonym snob may we hope for a personal interview all this was scarcely more than justice but it was i confess rather more than i had expectedi acknowledge this be it observed to the everlasting disgrace of my country and of mankind i lost no time however in calling upon the editor of the lollipop and had the good fortune to find this gentleman at home he saluted me with an air of profound respect slightly blended with a fatherly and patronizing admiration wrought in him no doubt by my appearance of extreme youth and inexperience begging me to be seated he entered at once upon the subject of my poembut modesty will ever forbid me to repeat the thousand compliments which he lavished upon me the eulogies of mr crab such was the editors name were however by no means fulsomely indiscriminate he analyzed my composition with much freedom and great abilitynot hesitating to point out a few trivial defectsa circumstance which elevated him highly in my esteem the gadfly was of course brought upon the tapis and i hope never to be subjected to a criticism so searching or to rebukes so withering as were bestowed by mr crab upon that unhappy effusion i had been accustomed to regard the editor of the gadfly as something superhuman but mr crab soon disabused me of that idea he set the literary as well as the personal character of the fly so mr c satirically designated the rival editor in its true light he the fly was very little better than he should be he had written infamous things he was a pennyaliner and a buffoon he was a villain he had composed a tragedy which set the whole country in a guffaw and a farce which deluged the universe in tears besides all this he had the impudence to pen what he meant for a lampoon upon himself mr crab and the temerity to style him an ass should i at any time wish to express my opinion of mr fly the pages of the lollipop mr crab assured me were at my unlimited disposal in the meantime as it was very certain that i would be attacked in the fly for my attempt at composing a rival poem on the oilofbob he mr crab would take it upon himself to attend pointedly to my private and personal interests if i were not made a man of at once it should not be the fault of himself mr crab mr crab having now paused in his discourse the latter portion of which i found it impossible to comprehend i ventured to suggest something about the remuneration which i had been taught to expect for my poem by an announcement on the cover of the lollipop declaring that it the lollipop insisted upon being permitted to pay exorbitant prices for all accepted contributionsfrequently expending more money for a single brief poem than the whole annual cost of the humdrum the rowdydow and the goosetherumfoodle combined as i mentioned the word remuneration mr crab first opened his eyes and then his mouth to quite a remarkable extent causing his personal appearance to resemble that of a highly agitated elderly duck in the act of quacking and in this condition he remained ever and anon pressing his hinds tightly to his forehead as if in a state of desperate bewilderment until i had nearly made an end of what i had to say upon my conclusion he sank back into his seat as if much overcome letting his arms fall lifelessly by his side but keeping his mouth still rigorously open after the fashion of the duck while i remained in speechless astonishment at behavior so alarming he suddenly leaped to his feet and made a rush at the bellrope but just as he reached this he appeared to have altered his intention whatever it was for he dived under a table and immediately reappeared with a cudgel this he was in the act of uplifting for what purpose i am at a loss to imagine when all at once there came a benign smile over his features and he sank placidly back in his chair mr bob he said for i had sent up my card before ascending myself mr bob you are a young man i presumevery i assented adding that i had not yet concluded my third lustrum ah he replied very good i see how it issay no more touching this matter of compensation what you observe is very justin fact it is excessively so but ahahthe first contributionthe first i sayit is never the magazine custom to pay foryou comprehend eh the truth is we are usually the recipients in such case mr crab smiled blandly as he emphasized the word recipients for the most part we are paid for the insertion of a maiden attempt especially in verse in the second place mr bob the magazine rule is never to disburse what we term in france the argent comptanti have no doubt you understand in a quarter or two after publication of the articleor in a year or twowe make no objection to giving our note at nine months provided always that we can so arrange our affairs as to be quite certain of a burst up in six i really do hope mr bob that you will look upon this explanation as satisfactory here mr crab concluded and the tears stood in his eyes grieved to the soul at having been however innocently the cause of pain to so eminent and so sensitive a man i hastened to apologize and to reassure him by expressing my perfect coincidence with his views as well as my entire appreciation of the delicacy of his position having done all this in a neat speech i took leave one fine morning very shortly afterwards i awoke and found myself famous the extent of my renown will be best estimated by reference to the editorial opinions of the day these opinions it will be seen were embodied in critical notices of the number of the lollipop containing my poem and are perfectly satisfactory conclusive and clear with the exception perhaps of the hieroglyphical marks sep t appended to each of the critiques the owl a journal of profound sagacity and well known for the deliberate gravity of its literary decisionsthe owl i say spoke as follows the lollipop the october number of this delicious magazine surpasses its predecessors and sets competition at defiance in the beauty of its typography and paperin the number and excellence of its steel platesas well as in the literary merit of its contributionsthe lollipop compares with its slowpaced rivals as hyperion with satyr the humdrum the rowdydow and the goosetherumfoodle excel it is true in braggadocio but in all other points give us the lollipop how this celebrated journal can sustain its evidently tremendous expenses is more than we can understand to be sure it has a circulation of and its subscription list has increased one fourth during the last month but on the other hand the sums it disburses constantly for contributions are inconceivable it is reported that mr slyass received no less than thirtyseven and a half cents for his inimitable paper on pigs with mr crab as editor and with such names upon the list of contributors as snob and slyass there can be no such word as fail for the lollipop go and subscribe sep t i must say that i was gratified with this hightoned notice from a paper so respectable as the owl the placing my namethat is to say my nom de guerrein priority of station to that of the great slyass was a compliment as happy as i felt it to be deserved my attention was next arrested by these paragraphs in the toadprint highly distinguished for its uprightness and independencefor its entire freedom from sycophancy and subservience to the givers of dinners the lollipop for october is out in advance of all its contemporaries and infinitely surpasses them of course in the splendor of its embellishments as well as in the richness of its contents the humdrum the rowdydow and the goosetherumfoodle excel we admit in braggadocio but in all other points give us the lollipop how this celebrated magazine can sustain its evidently tremendous expenses is more than we can understand to be sure it has a circulation of and its subscription list has increased one third during the last fortnight but on the other hand the sums it disburses monthly for contributions are fearfully great we learn that mr mumblethumb received no less than fifty cents for his late monody in a mudpuddle among the original contributors to the present number we notice besides the eminent editor mr crab such men as snob slyass and mumblethumb apart from the editorial matter the most valuable paper nevertheless is we think a poetical gem by snob on the oilofbobbut our readers must not suppose from the title of this incomparable bijou that it bears any similitude to some balderdash on the same subject by a certain contemptible individual whose name is unmentionable to ears polite the present poem on the oilofbob has excited universal anxiety and curiosity in respect to the owner of the evident pseudonym snoba curiosity which happily we have it in our power to satisfy snob is the nom de plume of mr thingum bob of this city a relative of the great mr thingum after whom he is named and otherwise connected with the most illustrious families of the state his father thomas bob esq is an opulent merchant in smug sep t this generous approbation touched me to the heartthe more especially as it emanated from a source so avowedlyso proverbially pure as the toad the word balderdash as applied to the oilofbob of the fly i considered singularly pungent and appropriate the words gem and bijou however used in reference to my composition struck me as being in some degree feeble they seemed to me to be deficient in force they were not sufficiently prononces as we have it in france i had hardly finished reading the toad when a friend placed in my hands a copy of the mole a daily enjoying high reputation for the keenness of its perception about matters in general and for the open honest aboveground style of its editorials the mole spoke of the lollypop as follows we have just received the lollipop for october and must say that never before have we perused any single number of any periodical which afforded us a felicity so supreme we speak advisedly the humdrum the rowdydow and the goosetherumfoodle must look well to their laurels these prints no doubt surpass everything in loudness of pretension but in all other points give us the lollipop how this celebrated magazine can sustain its evidently tremendous expenses is more than we can comprehend to be sure it has a circulation of and its subscription list has increased one half within the last week but then the sum it disburses monthly for contributions is astoundingly enormous we have it upon good authority that mr fatquack received no less than sixtytwo cents and a half for his late domestic nouvellette the dishclout the contributors to the number before us are mr crab the eminent editor snob mumblethumb fatquack and others but after the inimitable compositions of the editor himself we prefer a diamondlike effusion from the pen of a rising poet who writes over the signature snoba nom de guerre which we predict will one day extinguish the radiance of boz snob we learn is a mr thingum bob esq sole heir of a wealthy merchant of this city thomas bob esq and a near relative of the distinguished mr thingum the title of mr bs admirable poem is the oilofboba somewhat unfortunate name bythebye as some contemptible vagabond connected with the penny press has already disgusted the town with a great deal of drivel upon the same topic there will be no danger however of confounding the compositions sep t the generous approbation of so clearsighted a journal as the mole penetrated my soul with delight the only objection which occurred to me was that the terms contemptible vagabond might have been better written odious and contemptible wretch villain and vagabond this would have sounded more graceful i think diamondlike also was scarcely it will be admitted of sufficient intensity to express what the mole evidently thought of the brilliancy of the oilofbob on the same afternoon in which i saw these notices in the owl the toad and the mole i happened to meet with a copy of the daddylonglegs a periodical proverbial for the extreme extent of its understanding and it was the daddylonglegs which spoke thus the lollipop this gorgeous magazine is already before the public for october the question of preeminence is forever put to rest and hereafter it will be preposterous in the humdrum the rowdydow or the goosetherumfoodle to make any further spasmodic attempts at competition these journals may excel the lollipop in outcry but in all other points give us the lollipop how this celebrated magazine can sustain its evidently tremendous expenses is past comprehension to be sure it has a circulation of precisely half a million and its subscription list has increased seventyfive per cent within the last couple of days but then the sums it disburses monthly for contributions are scarcely credible we are cognizant of the fact that mademoiselle cribalittle received no less than eightyseven cents and a half for her late valuable revolutionary tale entitled the yorktown katydid and the bunkerhill katydidnt the most able papers in the present number are of course those furnished by the editor the eminent mr crab but there are numerous magnificent contributions from such names as snob mademoiselle cribalittle slyass mrs fibalittle mumblethumb mrs squibalittle and last though not least fatquack the world may well be challanged to produce so rich a galaxy of genius the poem over the signature snob is we find attracting universal commendation and we are constrained to say deserves if possible even more applause than it has received the oilofbob is the title of this masterpiece of eloquence and art one or two of our readers may have a very faint although sufficiently disgusting recollection of a poem similarly entitled the perpetration of a miserable pennyaliner mendicant and cutthroat connected in the capacity of scullion we believe with one of the indecent prints about the purlieus of the city we beg them for gods sake not to confound the compositions the author of the oilofbob is we hear thingum bob esq a gentleman of high genius and a scholar snob is merely a nom de guerre sep t i could scarcely restrain my indignation while i perused the concluding portions of this diatribe it was clear to me that the yeanay mannernot to say the gentlenessthe positive forbearancewith which the daddylonglegs spoke of that pig the editor of the gadflyit was evident to me i say that this gentleness of speech could proceed from nothing else than a partiality for the flywhom it was clearly the intention of the daddylonglegs to elevate into reputation at my expense any one indeed might perceive with half an eye that had the real design of the daddy been what it wished to appear it the daddy might have expressed itself in terms more direct more pungent and altogether more to the purpose the words pennyaliner mendicant scullion and cutthroat were epithets so intentionally inexpressive and equivocal as to be worse than nothing when applied to the author of the very worst stanzas ever penned by one of the human race we all know what is meant by damning with faint praise and on the other hand who could fail seeing through the covert purpose of the daddythat of glorifying with feeble abuse what the daddy chose to say to the fly however was no business of mine what it said of myself was after the noble manner in which the owl the toad the mole had expressed themselves in respect to my ability it was rather too much to be coolly spoken of by a thing like the daddylonglegs as merely a gentleman of high genius and scholar gentleman indeed i made up my mind at once either to get written apology from the daddylonglegs or to call it out full of this purpose i looked about me to find a friend whom i could entrust with a message to his daddyship and as the editor of the lollipop had given me marked tokens of regard i at length concluded to seek assistance upon the present occasion i have never yet been able to account in a manner satisfactory to my own understanding for the very peculiar countenance and demeanor with which mr crab listened to me as i unfolded to him my design he again went through the scene of the bellrope and cudgel and did not omit the duck at one period i thought he really intended to quack his fit nevertheless finally subsided as before and he began to act and speak in a rational way he declined bearing the cartel however and in fact dissuaded me from sending it at all but was candid enough to admit that the daddylonglegs had been disgracefully in the wrongmore especially in what related to the epithets gentleman and scholar toward the end of this interview with mr crab who really appeared to take a paternal interest in my welfare he suggested to me that i might turn an honest penny and at the same time advance my reputation by occasionally playing thomas hawk for the lollypop i begged mr crab to inform me who was mr thomas hawk and how it was expected that i should play him here mr crab again made great eyes as we say in germany but at length recovering himself from a profound attack of astonishment he assured me that he employed the words thomas hawk to avoid the colloquialism tommy which was lowbut that the true idea was tommy hawkor tomahawkand that by playing tomahawk he referred to scalping browbeating and otherwise usingup the herd of poordevil authors i assured my patron that if this was all i was perfectly resigned to the task of playing thomas hawk hereupon mr crab desired me to use up the editor of the gadfly forthwith in the fiercest style within the scope of my ability and as a specimen of my powers this i did upon the spot in a review of the original oilofbob occupying thirtysix pages of the lollipop i found playing thomas hawk indeed a far less onerous occupation than poetizing for i went upon system altogether and thus it was easy to do the thing thoroughly well my practice was this i bought auction copies cheap of lord broughams speeches cobbetts complete works the new slangsyllabus the whole art of snubbing prentices billingsgate folio edition and lewis g clarke on tongue these works i cut up thoroughly with a currycomb and then throwing the shreds into a sieve sifted out carefully all that might be thought decent a mere trifle reserving the hard phrases which i threw into a large tin peppercastor with longitudinal holes so that an entire sentence could get through without material injury the mixture was then ready for use when called upon to play thomas hawk i anointed a sheet of foolscap with the white of a ganders egg then shredding the thing to be reviewed as i had previously shredded the books only with more care so as to get every word separatei threw the latter shreds in with the former screwed on the lid of the castor gave it a shake and so dusted out the mixture upon the egged foolscap where it stuck the effect was beautiful to behold it was captivating indeed the reviews i brought to pass by this simple expedient have never been approached and were the wonder of the world at first through bashfulnessthe result of inexperiencei was a little put out by a certain inconsistencya certain air of the bizarre as we say in france worn by the composition as a whole all the phrases did not fit as we say in the anglosaxon many were quite awry some even were upsidedown and there were none of them which were not in some measure injured in regard to effect by this latter species of accident when it occurredwith the exception of mr lewis clarkes paragraphs which were so vigorous and altogether stout that they seemed not particularly disconcerted by any extreme of position but looked equally happy and satisfactory whether on their heads or on their heels what became of the editor of the gadfly after the publication of my criticism on his oilofbob it is somewhat difficult to determine the most reasonable conclusion is that he wept himself to death at all events he disappeared instantaneously from the face of the earth and no man has seen even the ghost of him since this matter having been properly accomplished and the furies appeased i grew at once into high favor with mr crab he took me into his confidence gave me a permanent situation as thomas hawk of the lollipop and as for the present he could afford me no salary allowed me to profit at discretion by his advice my dear thingum said he to me one day after dinner i respect your abilities and love you as a son you shall be my heir when i die i will bequeath you the lollipop in the meantime i will make a man of youi willprovided always that you follow my counsel the first thing to do is to get rid of the old bore boar said i inquiringlypig ehaper as we say in latinwhowhere your father said he precisely i repliedpig you have your fortune to make thingum resumed mr crab and that governor of yours is a millstone about your neck we must cut him at once here i took out my knife we must cut him continued mr crab decidedly and forever he wont dohe wont upon second thoughts you had better kick him or cane him or something of that kind what do you say i suggested modestly to my kicking him in the first instance caning him afterward and winding up by tweaking his nose mr crab looked at me musingly for some moments and then answered i think mr bob that what you propose would answer sufficiently wellindeed remarkably wellthat is to say as far as it wentbut barbers are exceedingly hard to cut and i think upon the whole that having performed upon thomas bob the operations you suggest it would be advisable to blacken with your fists both his eyes very carefully and thoroughly to prevent his ever seeing you again in fashionable promenades after doing this i really do not perceive that you can do any more howeverit might be just as well to roll him once or twice in the gutter and then put him in charge of the police any time the next morning you can call at the watchhouse and swear an assault i was much affected by the kindness of feeling toward me personally which was evinced in this excellent advice of mr crab and i did not fail to profit by it forthwith the result was that i got rid of the old bore and began to feel a little independent and gentlemanlike the want of money however was for a few weeks a source of some discomfort but at length by carefully putting to use my two eyes and observing how matters went just in front of my nose i perceived how the thing was to be brought about i say thingbe it observedfor they tell me in the latin for it is rem by the way talking of latin can any one tell me the meaning of quocunqueor what is the meaning of modo my plan was exceedingly simple i bought for a song a sixteenth of the snappingturtlethat was all the thing was done and i put money in my purse there were some trivial arrangements afterward to be sure but these formed no portion of the plan they were a consequencea result for example i bought pen ink and paper and put them into furious activity having thus completed a magazine article i gave it for appellation fol lol by the author of the oilofbob and enveloped it to the goosetherumfoodle that journal however having pronounced it twattle in the monthly notices to correspondents i reheaded the paper heydiddlediddle by thigum bob esq author of the ode on the oilofbob and editor of the snapping turtle with this amendment i reenclosed it to the goosetherumfoodle and while i awaited a reply published daily in the turtle six columns of what may be termed philosophical and analytical investigation of the literary merits of the goosetherumfoodle as well as of the personal character of the editor of the goosetherumfoodle at the end of a week the goosetherumfoodle discovered that it had by some odd mistake confounded a stupid article headed heydiddlediddle and composed by some unknown ignoramus with a gem of resplendent lustre similarly entitled the work of thingum bob esq the celebrated author of the oilofbob the goosetherumfoodle deeply regretted this very natural accident and promised moreover an insertion of the genuine heydiddlediddle in the very next number of the magazine the fact is i thoughti really thoughti thought at the timei thought thenand have no reason for thinking otherwise nowthat the goosetherumfoodle did make a mistake with the best intentions in the world i never knew any thing that made as many singular mistakes as the goosetherumfoodle from that day i took a liking to the goosetherumfoodle and the result was i soon saw into the very depths of its literary merits and did not fail to expatiate upon them in the turtle whenever a fitting opportunity occurred and it is to be regarded as a very peculiar coincidenceas one of those positively remarkable coincidences which set a man to serious thinkingthat just such a total revolution of opinionjust such entire bouleversement as we say in frenchjust such thorough topsiturviness if i may be permitted to employ a rather forcible term of the choctaws as happened pro and con between myself on the one part and the goosetherumfoodle on the
