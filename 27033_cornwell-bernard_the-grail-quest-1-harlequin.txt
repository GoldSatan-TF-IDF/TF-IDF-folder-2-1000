harlequin book of the grail quest by bernard cornwell prologue the treasure of hookton was stolen on easter morning it was a holy thing a relic that hung from the church rafters and it was extraordinary that so precious an object should have been kept in such an obscure village some folk said it had no business being there that it should have been enshrined in a cathedral or some great abbey while others many others said it was not genuine only fools denied that relics were faked glib men roamed the byways of england selling yellowed bones that were said to be from the fingers or toes or ribs of the blessed saints and sometimes the bones were human though more often they were from pigs or even deer but still folk bought and prayed to the bones a man might as well pray to saint guinefort father ralph said then snorted with mocking laughter theyre praying to ham bones ham bones the blessed pig it had been father ralph who had brought the treasure to hookton and he would not hear of it being taken away to a cathedral or abbey and so for eight years it hung in the small church gathering dust and growlng spider webs that shone silver when the sunlight slanted through the high window of the western tower sparrows perched on the treasure and some mornings there were bats hanging from its shaft it was rarely cleaned and hardly ever brought down though once in a while father ralph would demand that ladders be fetched and the treasure unhooked from its chains and he would pray over it and stroke it he never boasted of it other churches or monasteries possessing such a prize would have used it to attract pilgrims but father ralph turned visitors away it is nothing he would say if a stranger enquired after the relic a bauble nothing he became angry if the visitors persisted it is nothing nothing nothing father ralph was a frightening man even when he was not angry but in his temper he was a wildhaired fiend and his flaring anger protected the treasure though father ralph himself believed that ignorance was its best protection for if men did not know of it then god would guard it and so he did for a time hooktons obscurity was the treasures best protection the tiny village lay on englands south coast where the lipp a stream that was almost a river flowed to the sea across a shingle beach a halfdozen fishing boats worked from the village protected at night by the hook itself which was a tongue of shingle that curved around the lipps last reach though in the famous storm of the sea had roared across the hook and pounded the boats to splinters on the upper beach the village had never really recovered from that tragedy nineteen boats had sailed from the hook before the storm but twenty years later only six small craft worked the waves beyond the lipps treacherous bar the rest of the villagers worked in the saltpans or else herded sheep and cattle on the hills behind the huddle of thatched huts which clustered about the small stone church where the treasure hung from the blackened beams that was hookton a place of boats fish salt and livestock with green hills behind ignorance within and the wide sea beyond hookton like every place in christendom held a vigil on the eve of easter and in that solemn duty was performed by five men who watched as father ralph consecrated the easter sacraments and then laid the bread and wine on the whitedraped altar the wafers were in a simple clay bowl covered with a piece of bleached linen while the wine was in a silver cup that belonged to father ralph the silver cup was a part of his mystery he was very tall pious and much too learned to be a village priest it was rumoured that he could have been a bishop but that the devil had persecuted him with bad dreams and it was certain that in the years before he came to hookton he had been locked in a monasterys cell because he was possessed by demons then in the demons had left him and he was sent to hookton where he terrified the villagers by preaching to the gulls or pacing the beach weeping for his sins and striking his breast with sharpedged stones he howled like a dog when his wickedness weighed too heavily on his conscience but he also found a kind of peace in the remote village he built a large house of timber which he shared with his housekeeper and he made friends with sir giles marriott who was the lord of hookton and lived in a stone hall three miles to the north sir giles of course was a gentleman and so it seemed was father ralph despite his wild hair and angry voice he collected books which after the treasure he had brought to the church were the greatest marvels in hookton sometimes when he left his door open people would just gape at the seventeen books that were bound in leather and piled on a table most were in latin but a handful were in french which was father ralphs native tongue not the french of france but norman french the language of englands rulers and the villagers reckoned their priest must be nobly born though none dared ask him to his face they were all too scared of him but he did his duty by them he christened them churched them married them heard their confessions absolved them scolded them and buried them but he did not pass the time with them he walked alone grimfaced hair awry and eyes glowering but the villagers were still proud of him most country churches suffered ignorant puddingfaced priests who were scarce more educated than their parishioners but hookton in father ralph had a proper scholar too clever to be sociable perhaps a saint maybe of noble birth a selfconfessed sinner probably mad but undeniably a real priest father ralph blessed the sacraments then warned the five men that lucifer was abroad on the night before easter and that the devil wanted nothing so much as to snatch the holy sacraments from the altar and so the five men must guard the bread and wine diligently and for a short time after the priest had left they dutifully stayed on their knees gazing at the chalice which had an armorial badge engraved in its silver flank the badge showed a mythical beast a yale holding a grail and it was that noble device which suggested to the villagers that father ralph was indeed a highborn man who had fallen low through being possessed of devils the silver chalice seemed to shimmer in the light of two immensely tall candles which would burn through the whole long night most villages could not afford proper easter candles but father ralph purchased two from the monks at shaftesbury every year and the villagers would sidle into the church to stare at them but that night after dark only the five men saw the tall unwavering flames then john a fisherman farted reckon thats ripe enough to keep the old devil away he said and the other four laughed then they all abandoned the chancel steps and sat with their backs against the nave wall johns wife had provided a basket of bread cheese and smoked fish while edward who owned a saltworks on the beach had brought ale in the bigger churches of christendom knights kept this annual vigil they knelt in full armour their surcoats embroidered with prancing lions and stooping hawks and axe heads and spreadwing eagles and their helmets mounted with feathered crests but there were no knights in hookton and only the youngest man who was called thomas and who sat slightly apart from the other four had a weapon it was an ancient blunt and slightly rusted sword you reckon that old blade will scare the devil thomas john asked him my father said i had to bring it thomas said what does your father want with a sword he throws nothing away you know that thomas said hefting the old weapon it was heavy but he lifted it easily at eighteen he was tall and immensely strong he was well liked in hookton for despite being the son of the villages richest man he was a hardworking boy he loved nothing better than a day at sea hauling tarred nets that left his hands raw and bleeding he knew how to sail a boat had the strength to pull a good oar when the wind failed he could lay snares shoot a bow dig a grave geld a calf lay thatch or cut hay all day long he was a big bony blackhaired country boy but god had given him a father who wanted thomas to rise above common things he wanted the boy to be a priest which was why thomas had just finished his first term at oxford what do you do at oxford thomas edward asked him everything i shouldnt thomas said he pushed black hair away from his face that was bony like his fathers he had very blue eyes a long jaw slightly hooded eyes and a swift smile the girls in the village reckoned him handsome do they have girls at oxford john asked slyly more than enough thomas said dont tell your father that edward said or hell be whipping you again a good man with a whip your father theres none better thomas agreed he only wants the best for you john said cant blame a man for that thomas did blame his father he had always blamed his father he had fought his father for years and nothing so raised the anger between them as thomass obsession with bows his mothers father had been a bowyer in the weald and thomas had lived with his grandfather until he was nearly ten then his father had brought him to hookton where he had met sir giles marriotts huntsman another man skilled in archery and the huntsman had become his new tutor thomas had made his first bow at eleven but when his father found the elmwood weapon he had broken it across his knee and used the remnants to thrash his son you are not a common man his father had shouted beating the splintered staves on thomass back and head and legs but neither the words nor the thrashing did any good and as thomass father was usually preoccupied with other things thomas had plenty of time to pursue his obsession by fifteen he was as good a bowyer as his grandfather knowing instinctively how to shape a stave of yew so that the inner belly came from the dense heartwood while the front was made of the springier sapwood and when the bow was bent the heartwood was always trying to return to the straight and the sapwood was the muscle that made it possible to thomass quick mind there was something elegant simple and beautiful about a good bow smooth and strong a good bow was like a girls flat belly and that night keeping the easter vigil in hookton church thomas was reminded of jane who served in the villages small alehouse john edward and the other two men had been speaking of village things the price of lambs at dorchester fair the old fox up on lipp hill that had taken a whole flock of geese in one night and the angel who had been seen over the rooftops at lyme i reckon theys been drinking too much edward said i sees angels when i drink john said that be jane edward said looks like an angel she does dont behave like one john said lass is pregnant and all four men looked at thomas who stared innocently up at the treasure hanging from the rafters in truth thomas was frightened that the child was indeed his and terrified of what his father would say when he found out but he pretended ignorance of janes pregnancy that night he just looked at the treasure that was half obscured by a fishing net hung up to dry while the four older men gradually fell asleep a cold draught flickered the twin candle flames a dog howled somewhere in the village and always never ending thomas could hear the seas heartbeat as the waves thumped on the shingle then scraped back paused and thumped again he listened to the four men snoring and he prayed that his father would never find out about jane though that was unlikely for she was pressing thomas to marry her and he did not know what to do maybe he thought he should just run away take jane and his bow and run but he felt no certainty and so he just gazed at the relic in the church roof and prayed to its saint for help the treasure was a lance it was a huge thing with a shaft as thick as a mans forearm and twice the length of a mans height and probably made of ash though it was so old no one could really say and age had bent the blackened shaft out of true though not by much and its tip was not an iron or steel blade but a wedge of tarnished silver which tapered to a bodkins point the shaft did not swell to protect the handgrip but was smooth like a spear or a goad indeed the relic looked very like an oversized oxgoad but no farmer would ever tip an oxgoad with silver this was a weapon a lance but it was not any old lance this was the very lance which saint george had used to kill the dragon it was englands lance for saint george was englands saint and that made it a very great treasure even if it did hang in hooktons spidery church roof there were plenty of folk who said it could not have been saint georges lance but thomas believed it was and he liked to imagine the dust churned by the hooves of saint georges horse and the dragons breath streaming in hellish flame as the horse reared and the saint drew back the lance the sunlight bright as an angels wing would have been flaring about saint georges helmet and thomas imagined the dragons roar the thrash of its scalehooked tail the horse screaming in terror and he saw the saint stand in his stirrups before plunging the lances silver tip down through the monsters armoured hide straight to the heart the lance went and the dragons squeals would have rung to heaven as it writhed and bled and died then the dust would have settled and the dragons blood would have crusted on the desert sand and saint george must have hauled the lance free and somehow it ended up in father ralphs possession but how the priest would not say but there it hung a great dark lance heavy enough to shatter a dragons scales so that night thomas prayed to saint george while jane the blackhaired beauty whose belly was just rounding with her unborn child slept in the taproom of the alehouse and father ralph cried aloud in his nightmare for fear of the demons that circled in the dark and the vixens screamed on the hill as the endless waves clawed and sucked at the shingle on the hook it was the night before easter thomas woke to the sound of the village cockerels and saw that the expensive candles had burned down almost to their pewter holders a grey light filled the window above the whitefronted altar one day father ralph had promised the village that window would be a blaze of coloured glass showing saint george skewering the dragon with the silverheaded lance but for now the stone frame was filled with horn panes that turned the air within the church as yellow as urine thomas stood needing to piss and the first awful screams sounded from the village for easter had come christ was risen and the french were ashore the raiders came from normandy in four boats that had sailed the nights west wind their leader sir guillaume devecque the sieur devecque was a seasoned warrior who had fought the english in gascony and flanders and had twice led raids on englands southern coast both times he had brought his boats safe home with cargoes of wool silver livestock and women he lived in a fine stone house on caens ile saint jean where he was known as the knight of the sea and of the land he was thirty years old broad in the chest windburned and fairhaired a cheerful unreflective man who made his living by piracy at sea and knightservice on shore and now he had come to hookton it was an insignificant place hardly likely to yield any great reward but sir guillaume had been hired for the task and if he failed at hookton if he did not snatch so much as one single poor coin from a villager he would still make his profit for he had been promised one thousand livres for this expedition the contract was signed and sealed and it promised sir guillaume the one thousand livres together with any other plunder he could find in hookton one hundred livres had already been paid and the rest was in the keeping of brother martin in caens abbaye aux hommes and all sir guillaume had to do to earn the remaining nine hundred livres was bring his boats to hookton take what he wanted but leave the churchs contents to the man who had offered him such a generous contract that man now stood beside sir guillaume in the leading boat he was a young man not yet thirty tall and blackhaired who spoke rarely and smiled less he wore an expensive coat of mail that fell to his knees and over it a surcoat of deep black linen that bore no badge though sir guillaume guessed the man was nobly born for he had the arrogance of rank and the confidence of privilege he was certainly not a norman noble for sir guillaume knew all those men and sir guillaume doubted the young man came from nearby alencon or maine for he had ridden with those forces often enough but the sallow cast of the strangers skin suggested he came from one of the mediterranean provinces from languedoc perhaps or dauphine and they were all mad down there mad as dogs sir guillaume did not even know the mans name some men call me the harlequin the stranger had answered when sir guillaume had asked harlequin sir guillaume had repeated the name then made the sign of the cross for such a name was hardly a boast you mean like the hellequin hellequin in france the man had allowed but in italy they say harlequin it is all the same the man had smiled and something about that smile had suggested sir guillaume had best curb his curiosity if he wanted to receive the remaining nine hundred livres the man who called himself the harlequin now stared at the misty shore where a stumpy church tower a huddle of vague roofs and a smear of smoke from the smouldering fires of the saltpans just showed is that hookton he asked so he says sir guillaume answered jerking his head at the shipmaster then god have mercy on it the man said he drew his sword even though the four boats were still a halfmile from shore the genoese crossbowmen hired for the voyage made the sign of the cross then began winding their cords as sir guillaume ordered his banner raised to the masthead it was a blue flag decorated with three stooping yellow hawks that had outspread wings and claws hooked ready to savage their prey sir guillaume could smell the salt fires and hear the cockerels crowing ashore the cockerels were still crowing as the bows of his four ships ran onto the shingle sir guillaume and the harlequin were the first ashore but after them came a score of genoese crossbowmen who were professional soldiers and knew their business their leader took them up the beach and through the village to block the valley beyond where they would stop any of the villagers escaping with their valuables sir guillaumes remaining men would ransack the houses while the sailors stayed on the beach to guard their ships it had been a long cold and anxious night at sea but now came the reward forty menatarms invaded hookton they wore closefitting helmets and had mail shirts over leatherbacked hacquetons they carried swords axes or spears and they were released to plunder most were veterans of sir guillaumes other raids and knew just what to do kick in the flimsy doors and start killing the men let the women scream but kill the men for it was the men who would fight back hardest some women ran but the genoese crossbowmen were there to stop them once the men were dead the plunde ring could begin and that took time for peasants everywhere hid whatever was valuable and the hiding places had to be ferreted out thatch had to be pulled down wells explored floors probed but plenty of things were not hidden there were hams waiting for the first meal after lent racks of smoked or dried fish piles of nets good cooking pots distaffs and spindles eggs butter churns casks of salt all humble enough things but sufficiently valuable to take back to normandy some houses yielded small hoards of coins and one house the priests was a treasuretrove of silver plate candlesticks and jugs there were even some good bolts of woollen cloth in the priests house and a great carved bed and a decent horse in the stable sir guillaume looked at the seventeen books but decided they were worthless and so having wrenched the bronze locks from the leather covers he left them to burn when the houses were fired he had to kill the priests housekeeper he regretted that death sir guillaume was not squeamish about killing women but their deaths brought no honour and so he discouraged such slaughter unless the woman caused trouble and the priests housekeeper wanted to fight she slashed at sir guillaumes menatarms with a roasting spit called them sons of whores and devils grubs and in the end sir guillaume cut her down with his sword because she would not accept her fate stupid bitch sir guillaume said stepping over her body to peer into the hearth two fine hams were being smoked in the chimney pull them down he ordered one of his men then left them to search the house while he went to the church father ralph woken by the screams of his parishioners had pulled on a cassock and run to the church sir guillaumes men had left him alone out of respect but once inside the little church the priest had begun to hit the invaders until the harlequin arrived and snarled at the menatarms to hold the priest they seized his arms and held him in front of the altar with its white easter frontal the harlequin his sword in his hand bowed to father ralph my lord count he said father ralph closed his eyes perhaps in prayer though it looked more like exasperation he opened them and gazed into the harlequins handsome face you are my brothers son he said and did not sound mad at all merely full of regret true how is your father dead the harlequin said as is his father and yours god rest their souls father ralph said piously and when you are dead old man i shall be the count and our family will rise again father ralph half smiled then just shook his head and looked up at the lance it will do you no good he said for its power is reserved for virtuous men it will not work for evil filth like you then father ralph gave a curious mewing noise as the breath rushed from him and he stared down to where his nephew had run the sword into his belly he struggled to speak but no words came then he collapsed as the menatarms released him and he slumped by the altar with blood puddling in his lap the harlequin wiped his sword on the winestained altar cloth then ordered one of sir guillaumes men to find a ladder a ladder the manatarms asked in confusion they thatch their roofs dont they so they have a ladder find it the harlequin sheathed his sword then stared up at the lance of saint george i have put a curse on it father ralph spoke faintly he was palefaced dying but sounded oddly calm your curse my lord worries me as much as a tavern maids fart the harlequin tossed the pewter candlesticks to a manatarms then scooped the wafers from the clay bowl and crammed them into his mouth he picked up the bowl peered at its darkened surface and reckoned it was a thing of no value so left it on the altar wheres the wine he asked father ralph father ralph shook his head calix meus inebrians he said and the harlequin just laughed father ralph closed his eyes as the pain griped his belly oh god he moaned the harlequin crouched by his uncles side does it hurt like fire father ralph said you will burn in hell my lord the harlequin said and he saw how father ralph was clutching his wounded belly to staunch the flow of blood and so he pulled the priests hands away and then standing kicked him hard in the stomach father ralph gasped with pain and curled his body a gift from your family the harlequin said then turned away as a ladder was brought into the church the village was filled with screams for most of the women and children were still alive and their ordeal had scarcely begun all the younger women were briskly raped by sir guillaumes men and the prettiest of them including jane from the alehouse were taken to the boats so they could be carried back to normandy to become the whores or wives of sir guillaumes soldiers one of the women screamed because her baby was still in her house but the soldiers did not understand her and they struck her to silence then pushed her into the hands of the sailors who lay her on the shingle and lifted her skirts she wept inconsolably as her house burned geese pigs goats six cows and the priests good horse were herded towards the boats while the white gulls rode the sky crying the sun had scarcely risen above the eastern hills and the village had already yielded more than sir guillaume had dared hope for we could go inland the captain of his genoese crossbowmen suggested we have what we came for the blackdressed harlequin intervened he had placed the unwieldy lance of saint george on the graveyard grass and now stared at the ancient weapon as though he was trying to understand its power what is it the genoese crossbowman asked nothing that is of use to you sir guillaume grinned strike a blow with that he said and itll shatter like ivory the harlequin shrugged he had found what he wanted and sir guillaumes opinion was of no interest go inland the genoese captain suggested again a few miles maybe sir guillaume said he knew that the dreaded english archers would eventually come to hookton but probably not till midday and he wondered if there was another village close by that would be worth plundering he watched a terrified girl maybe eleven years old being carried towards the beach by a soldier how many dead he asked ours the genoese captain seemed surprised by the question none not ours theirs thirty men forty a few women and we havent taken a scratch sir guillaume exulted pity to stop now he looked at his employer but the man in black did not seem to care what they did while the genoese captain just grunted which surprised sir guillaume for he thought the man was eager to extend the raid but then he saw that the mans sullen grunt was not caused by any lack of enthusiasm but by a whitefeathered arrow that had buried itself in his breast the arrow had slit through the mail shirt and padded hacqueton like a bodkin sliding through linen killing the crossbowman almost instantly sir guillaume dropped flat and a heartbeat later another arrow whipped above him to thump into the turf the harlequin snatched up the lance and was running towards the beach while sir guillaume scrambled into the shelter of the church porch crossbows he shouted crossbows because someone was fighting back thomas had heard the screams and like the other four men in the church he had gone to the door to see what they meant but no sooner had they reached the porch than a band of armed men their mail and helmets dark grey in the dawn appeared in the graveyard edward slammed the church door dropped the bar into its brackets then crossed himself sweet jesus he said in astonishment then flinched as an axe thumped into the door give me that he seized the sword from thomas thomas let him take it the church door was shaking now as two or three axes attacked the old wood the villagers had always reckoned that hookton was much too small to be raided but the church door was splintering in front of thomass eyes and he knew it must be the french tales were told up and down the coast of such landings and prayers were said to keep folk from the raids but the enemy was here and the church echoed with the crash of their axe blows thomas was in panic but did not know it he just knew he had to escape from the church and so he ran and jumped onto the altar he crushed the silver chalice with his right foot and kicked it off the altar as he climbed onto the sill of the great east window where he beat at the yellow panes shattering the horn down into the churchyard he saw men in red and green jackets running past the alehouse but none looked his way as he jumped down into the churchyard and ran to the ditch where he ripped his clothes as he wriggled through the thorn hedge on the other side he crossed the lane jumped the fence of his fathers garden and hammered on the kitchen door but no one responded and a crossbow bolt smacked into the lintel just inches from his face thomas ducked and ran through the bean plants to the cattle shed where his father stabled a horse there was no time to rescue the beast so instead thomas climbed into the hay loft where he hid his bow and arrows a woman screamed close by dogs were howling the french were shouting as they kicked down doors thomas seized his bow and arrow bag ripped the thatch away from the rafters squeezed through the gap and dropped into the neighbours orchard he ran then as though the devil was on his heels a crossbow bolt thumped into the turf as he came to lipp hill and two of the genoese archers started to follow him but thomas was young and tall and strong and fast he ran uphill through a pasture bright with cowslips and daisies leaped a hurdle that blocked a gap in a hedge then twisted right towards the hills crest he went as far as the wood on the hills far side and there he dropped to catch his breath amidst a slope drifted with a haze of bluebells he lay there listening to the lambs in a nearby field he waited hearing nothing untoward the crossbowmen had abandoned their pursuit thomas lay in the bluebells for a long time but at last he crept cautiously back to the hilltop from where he could see a straggle of old women and children scattering on the further hill those folk had somehow evaded the crossbowmen and would doubtless flee north to warn sir giles marriott but thomas did not join them instead he worked his way down to a hazel copse where dogs mercury bloomed and from where he could see his village dying men were carrying plunder to the four strange boats that were grounded on the hooks shingle the first thatch was being fired two dogs lay dead in the street beside a woman quite naked who was being held down while frenchmen hitched up their mail shirts to take their turns with her thomas remembered how not long ago she had married a fisherman whose first wife had died in childbirth she had been so coy and happy but now when she tried to crawl off the road a frenchman kicked her in the head then bent with laughter thomas saw jane the girl he feared he had made pregnant being dragged towards the boats and was ashamed that he felt a sense of relief that he would not have to confront his father with her news more cottages were fired as frenchmen hurled burning straw onto their thatch and thomas watched the smoke curl and thicken then worked his way through the hazel saplings to a place where hawthorn blossom was thick white and concealing it was there he strung his bow it was the best bow he had ever made it had been cut from a stave that had washed ashore from a ship that had foundered in the channel a dozen staves had come to hooktons shingle on the south wind and sir giles marriotts huntsman reckoned they must have been italian yew for it was the most beautiful wood he had ever seen thomas had sold eleven of the tightgrained staves in dorchester but kept the best one hed carved it steamed the ends to give them a slight bend against the woods grain then painted the bow with a mix of soot and flaxseed oil he had boiled the mix in his mothers kitchen on days when his father was away and thomass father had never known what he was doing though sometimes he would complain of the smell and thomass mother would say she had been making a potion to poison the rats the bow had had to be painted to stop it from drying out for then the wood would become brittle and shatter under the stress of the taut string the paint had dried a deep golden colour just like the bows thomass grandfather used to make in the weald but thomas had wanted it to be darker and so he had rubbed more soot into the wood and smeared it with beeswax and hed gone on doing it for a fortnight until the bow was as black as the shaft of saint georges lance hed tipped the bow with two pieces of nocked horn to hold a cord that was made from woven hemp strands that had been soaked in hoofglue then hed whipped the cord where the arrow would rest with still more hemp hed stolen coins from his father to buy arrow heads in dorchester then made the shafts from ash and goose feathers and on that easter morning he had twentythree of those good arrows in his bag thomas strung the bow took a whitefledged arrow from the bag then looked at the three men beside the church they were a long way off but the black bow was as big a weapon as any ever made and the power in its yew belly was awesome one of the men had a simple mail coat another a plain black surcoat while the third had a red and green jacket over his mail shirt and thomas decided that the most gaudily dressed man must be the raids leader and so he should die thomass left hand shook as he drew the bow he was drymouthed frightened he knew he would shoot wild so he lowered his arm and released the cords tension remember he told himself remember everything you have ever been taught an archer does not aim he kills it is all in the head in the arms in the eyes and killing a man is no different from shooting a hind draw and loose that was all and that was why he had practised for over ten years so that the act of drawing and loosing was as natural as breathing and as fluent as water flowing from a spring look and loose do not think draw the string and let god guide the arrow smoke thickened above hookton and thomas felt an immense anger surge like a black humour and he pushed his left hand forward and drew back with the right and he never took his eyes off the red and green coat he drew till the cord was beside his right ear and then he loosed that was the first time thomas of hookton ever shot an arrow at a man and he knew it was good as soon as it leaped from the string for the bow did not quiver the arrow flew true and he watched it curve down sinking from the hill to strike the green and red coat hard and deep he let a second arrow fly but the man in the mail coat dropped and scurried to the church porch while the third man picked up the lance and ran towards the beach where he was hidden by the smoke thomas had twentyone arrows left one each for the holy trinity he thought and another for every year of his life and that life was threatened for a dozen crossbowmen were running towards the hill he loosed a third arrow then ran back through the hazels he was suddenly exultant filled with a sense of power and satisfaction in that one instant as the first arrow slid into the sky he knew he wanted nothing more from life he was an archer oxford could go to hell for all he cared for thomas had found his joy he whooped with delight as he ran uphill crossbow bolts ripped through the hazel leaves and he noted that they made a deep almost humming noise as they flew then he was over the hills crest where he ran west for a few yards before doubling back to the summit he paused long enough to loose another arrow then turned and ran again thomas led the genoese crossbowmen a dance of death from hill to hedgerow along paths he had known since childhood and like fools they followed him because their pride would not let them admit that they were beaten but beaten they were and two died before a trumpet sounded from the beach summoning the raiders to their boats the genoese turned away then stopping only to fetch the weapon pouches mail and coat of one of their dead but thomas killed another of them as they stooped over the body and this time the survivors just ran from him thomas followed them down to the smokepalled village he ran past the alehouse which was an inferno and so to the shingle where the four boats were being shoved into the seareach the sailors pushed off with long oars then pulled out to sea they towed the best three hookton boats and left the others burning the village was also burning its thatch whirling into the sky in sparks and smoke and flaming scraps thomas shot one last useless arrow from the beach and watched it plunge into the sea short of the escaping raiders then he turned away and went back through the stinking burning bloody village to the church which was the only building the raiders had not set alight the four companions of his vigil were dead but father ralph still lived he was sitting with his back against the altar the bottom of his gown was dark with fresh blood and his long face was unnaturally white thomas kneeled beside the priest father father ralph opened his eyes and saw the bow he grimaced though whether in pain or disapproval thomas could not tell did you kill any of them thomas the priest asked yes thomas said a lot father ralph grimaced and shuddered thomas reckoned the priest was one of the strongest men he had ever known flawed perhaps yet tough as a yew stave but he was dying now and there was a whimper in his voice you dont want to be a priest do you thomas he asked the question in french his mother tongue no thomas answered in the same language youre going to be a soldier the priest said like your grandfather he paused and whimpered as another bolt of pain ripped up from his belly thomas wanted to help him but in truth there was nothing to be done the harlequin had run his sword into father ralphs belly and only god could save the priest now i argued with my father the dying man said and he disowned me he disinherited me and i have refused to acknowledge him from that day to this but you thomas you are like him very like him and you have always argued with me yes father thomas said he took his fathers hand and the priest did not resist i loved your mother father ralph said and that was my sin and you are the fruit of that sin i thought if you became a priest you could rise above sin it floods us thomas it floods us it is everywhere i have seen the devil thomas seen him with my own eyes and we must fight him only the church can do that only the church the tears flowed down his hollow unshaven cheeks he looked past thomas into the roof of the nave they stole the lance he said sadly i know my greatgrandfather brought it from the holy land father ralph said and i stole it from my father and my brothers son stole it from us today he spoke softly he will do evil with it bring it home thomas bring it home i will thomas promised him smoke began to thicken in the church the raiders had not fired it but the thatch was catching the flames from the burning scraps that filled the air you say your brothers son stole it thomas asked your cousin father ralph whispered his eyes closed the one dressed in black he came and stole it who is he thomas asked evil father ralph said evil he moaned and shook his head who is he thomas insisted calix meus inebrians father ralph said in a voice scarce above a whisper thomas knew it was a line from a psalm and meant my cup makes me drunk and he reckoned his fathers mind was slipping as his soul hovered close to his bodys end tell me who your father was thomas demanded tell me who i am he wanted to say tell me who you are father but father ralphs eyes were closed though he still gripped thomass hand hard father thomas asked the smoke dipped in the church and sifted out through the window thomas had broken to make his escape father but his father never spoke again he died and thomas who had fought against him all his life wept like a child at times he had been ashamed of his father but in that smoky easter morning he learned that he loved him most priests disowned their children but father ralph had never hidden thomas he had let the world think what it wanted and he had freely confessed to being a man as well as a priest and if he sinned in loving his housekeeper then it was a sweet sin that he never denied even if he did say acts of contrition for it and feared that in the life hereafter he would be punished for it thomas pulled his father away from the altar he did not want the body to be burned when the roof collapsed the silver chalice that thomas had accidentally crushed was under the dead mans bloodsoaked robe and thomas pocketed it before dragging the corpse out into the graveyard he lay his father beside the body of the man in the red and green coat and thomas crouched there weeping knowing that he had failed in his first easter vigil the devil had stolen the sacraments and saint georges lance was gone and hookton was dead at midday sir giles marriott came to the village with a score of men armed with bows and billhooks sir giles himself wore mail and carried a sword but there was no enemy left to fight and thomas was the only person left in the village three yellow hawks on a blue field thomas told sir giles thomas sir giles asked puzzled he was the lord of the manor and an old man now though in his time he had carried a lance against both the scots and the french he had been a good friend to thomass father but he did not understand thomas whom he reckoned had grown wild as a wolf three yellow hawks on a blue field thomas said vengefully are the arms of the man who did this were they the arms of his cousin he did not know there were so many questions left by his father i dont know whose badge that is sir giles said but i shall pray by gods bowels he screams in hell for this work there was nothing to be done until the fires had burned themselves out and only then could the bodies be dragged from the ashes the burned dead had been blackened and grotesquely shrunk by the heat so that even the tallest men looked like children the dead villagers were taken to the graveyard for a proper burial but the bodies of the four crossbowmen were dragged down to the beach and there stripped naked did you do this sir giles asked thomas yes sir then i thank you my first dead frenchmen thomas said angrily no sir giles said and he lifted one of the mens tunics to show thomas the badge of a green chalice embroidered on its sleeve theyre from genoa sir giles said the french hire them as crossbowmen ive killed a few in my time but there are always more where they come from you know what the badge is a cup sir giles shook his head the holy grail they reckon they have it in their cathedral im told its a great green thing carved from an emerald and brought back from the crusades i should like to see it one day then i shall bring it to you thomas said bitterly just as i shall bring back our lance sir giles stared to sea the raiders boats were long gone and there was nothing out there but the sun on the waves why would they come here he asked for the lance i doubt it was even real sir giles said he was redfaced whitehaired and heavy now it was just an old spear nothing more its real thomas insisted and thats why they came sir giles did not argue your father he said instead would have wanted you to finish your studies my studies are done thomas said flatly im going to france sir giles nodded he reckoned the boy was far better suited to be a soldier than a priest will you go as an archer he asked looking at the great bow on thomass shoulder or do you want to join my house and train to be a manatarms he half smiled youre gently born you know im bastard born thomas insisted your father was of good birth you know what family thomas asked sir giles shrugged he would never tell me and if i pressed him he would just say that god was his father and his mother was the church and my mother thomas said was a priests housekeeper and the daughter of a bowyer i shall go to france as an archer theres more honour as a manatarms sir giles observed but thomas did not want honour he wanted revenge sir giles let him choose what he wanted from the enemys dead and thomas picked a mail coat a pair of long boots a knife a sword a belt and a helmet it was all plain gear but serviceable and only the mail coat needed mending for he had driven an arrow clean through its rings sir giles said he owed thomass father money which may or may not have been true but he paid it to thomas with the gift of a fouryearold gelding youll need a horse he said for nowadays all archers are mounted go to dorchester he advised thomas and like as not youll find someone recruiting bowmen the genoese corpses were beheaded and their bodies left to rot while their four heads were impaled on stakes and planted along the hooks shingle ridge the gulls fed on the dead mens eyes and pecked at their flesh until the heads were flensed down to bare bones that stared vacantly to the sea but thomas did not see the skulls he had gone across the water taken his black bow and joined the wars part one brittany it was winter a cold morning wind blew from the sea bringing a sour salt smell and a spitting rain that would inevitably sap the power of the bowstrings if it did not let up what it is jake said is a waste of goddamn time no one took any notice of him could have stayed in brest jake grumbled been sitting by a fire drinking ale again he was ignored funny name for a town sam said after a long while brest i like it though he looked at the archers maybe well see the blackbird again he suggested maybe shell put a bolt through your tongue will skeat growled and do us all a favour the blackbird was a woman who fought from the town walls every time the army made an assault she was young had black hair wore a black cloak and shot a crossbow in the first assault when will skeats archers had been in the vanguard of the attack and had lost four men they had been close enough to see the blackbird clearly and they had all thought her beautiful though after a winter campaign of failure cold mud and hunger almost any woman looked beautiful still there was something special about the blackbird she doesnt load that crossbow herself sam said unmoved by skeats surliness of course she bloody doesnt jake said there aint a woman born that can crank a crossbow dozy mary could another man said got muscles like a bullock she has and she closes her eyes when she shoots sam said still talking of the blackbird i noticed thats because you werent doing your goddamn job will skeat snarleds o shut your mouth sam sam was the youngest of skeats men he claimed to be eighteen though he was really not sure because he had lost count he was a drapers son had a cherubic face brown curls and a heart as dark as sin he was a good archer though no one could serve will skeat without being good right lads skeat said make ready he had seen the stir in the encampment behind them the enemy would notice it soon and the church bells would ring the alarm and the town walls would fill with defenders armed with crossbows the crossbows would rip their bolts into the attackers and skeats job today was to try to clear those crossbowmen off the wall with his arrows some chance he thought sourly the defenders would crouch behind their crenellations and so deny his men an opportunity to aim and doubtless this assault would end as the five other attacks had finished in failure it had been a whole campaign of failure william bohun the earl of northampton who led this small english army had launched the winter expedition in hope of capturing a stronghold in northern brittany but the assault on carhaix had been a humiliating failure the defenders of guingamp had laughed at the english and the walls of lannion had repulsed every attack they had captured treguler but as that town had no walls it was not much of an achievement and no place to make a fortress now at the bitter end of the year with nothing better to do the earls army had fetched up outside this small town which was scarcely more than a walled village but even this miserable place had defied the army the earl had launched attack after attack and all had been beaten back the english had been met by a storm of crossbow bolts the scaling ladders had been thrust from the ramparts and the defenders had exulted in each failure what is this goddamn place called skeat asked la rochederrien a tall archer answered you would know tom skeat said you know everything that is true will thomas said gravely quite literally true the other archers laughed so if you know so bloody much skeat said tell me what this goddamn town is called again la rochederrien daft bloody name skeat said he was greyhaired thinfaced and had known nearly thirty years of fighting he came from yorkshire and had begun his career as an archer fighting against the scots he had been as lucky as he was skilled and so he had taken plunder survived battles and risen in the ranks until he was wealthy enough to raise his own band of soldiers he now led seventy menatarms and as many archers whom he had contracted to the earl of northamptons service which was why he was crouching behind a wet hedge a hundred and fifty paces from the walls of a town whose name he still could not remember his menatarms were in the camp given a days rest after leading the last failed assault will skeat hated failure la roche what he asked thomas derrien what does that goddamn mean that i confess i do not know sweet christ skeat said in mock wonder he doesnt know everything it is however close to derriere which means arse thomas added the rock of the arse is my best translation skeat opened his mouth to say something but just then the first of la rochederriens church bells sounded the alarm it was the cracked bell the one that sounded so harsh and within seconds the other churches added their tolling so that the wet wind was filled with their clangour the noise was greeted by a subdued english cheer as the assault troops came from the camp and pounded up the road towards the towns southern gate the leading men carried ladders the rest had swords and axes the earl of northampton led the assault as he had led all the others conspicuous in his plate armour half covered by a surcoat showing his badge of the lions and stars you know what to do skeat bellowed the archers stood drew their bows and loosed there were no targets on the walls for the defenders were staying low but the rattle of the steeltipped arrows on the stones should keep them crouching the whitefeathered arrows hissed as they flew two other archer bands were adding their own shafts many of them firing high into the sky so that their missiles dropped vertically onto the walls top and to skeat it seemed impossible that anyone could live under that hail of feathertipped steel yet as soon as the earls attacking column came within a hundred paces the crossbow bolts began to spit from the walls there was a breach close to the gate it had been made by a catapult the only siege machine left in decent repair and it was a poor breach for only the top third of the wall had been dismantled by the big stones and the townsfolk had crammed timber and bundles of cloth into the gap but it was still a weakness in the wall and the ladder men ran towards it shouting as the crossbow bolts whipped into them men stumbled fell crawled and died but enough lived to throw two ladders against the breach and the first menatarms began to climb the archers were loosing as fast as they could overwhelming the top of the breach with arrows but then a shield appeared there a shield that was immediately stuck by a score of shafts and from behind the shield a crossbowman shot straight down one of the ladders killing the leading man another shield appeared another crossbow was loosed a pot was shoved onto the breachs top then toppled over and a gush of steaming liquid spilled down to make a man scream in agony defenders were hurling boulders over the breach and their crossbows were snapping closer skeat shouted and his archers pushed through the hedge and ran to within a hundred paces of the town ditch where they again loosed their long war bows and slashed their arrows into the embrasures some defenders were dying now for they had to show themselves to shoot their crossbows down into the crowd of men who jostled at the foot of the four ladders that had been laid against the breach or walls menatarms climbed a forked pole shoved one ladder back and thomas twitched his left hand to change his aim and released his fingers to drive an arrow into the breast of a man pushing on the pole the man had been covered by a shield held by a companion but the shield shifted for an instant and thomass arrow was the first through the small gap though two more followed before the dying mans last heartbeat ended other men succeeded in toppling the ladder saint george the english shouted but the saint must have been sleeping for he gave the attackers no help more stones were hurled from the ramparts then a great mass of flaming straw was heaved into the crowded attackers a man succeeded in reaching the top of the breach but was immediately killed by an axe that split his helmet and skull in two he slumped on the rungs blocking the ascent and the earl tried to haul him free but was struck on the head by one of the boulders and collapsed at the ladders foot two of his menatarms carried the stunned earl back to the camp and his departure took the spirit from the attackers they no longer shouted the arrows still flew and men still tried to climb the wall but the defenders sensed they had repelled this sixth attack and their crossbow bolts spat relentlessly it was then thomas saw the blackbird on the tower above the gate he laid the steel arrow tip on her breast raised the bow a fraction and then jerked his bow hand so that the arrow flew wild too pretty to kill he told himself and knew he was a fool for thinking it she shot her bolt and vanished a halfdozen arrows clattered onto the tower where she had been standing but thomas reckoned all six archers had let her shoot before they loosed jesus wept skeat said the attack had failed and the menatarms were running from the crossbow bolts one ladder still rested against the breach with the dead man entangled in its upper rungs back skeat shouted back the archers ran pursued by quarrels until they could push through the hedge and drop into the ditch the defenders were cheering and two men bared their backsides on the gate tower and briefly shoved their arses towards the defeated english bastards skeat said bastards he was not used to failure there has to be a bloody way in he growled thomas unlooped the string from his bow and placed it under his helmet i told you how to get in he told skeat told you at dawn skeat looked at thomas for a long time we tried it lad i got to the stakes will i promise i did i got through them so tell me again skeat said and thomas did he crouched in the ditch under the jeers of la rochederriens defenders and he told will skeat how to unlock the town and skeat listened because the yorkshireman had learned to trust thomas of hookton thomas had been in brittany for three years now and though brittany was not france its usurping duke brought a constant succession of frenchman to be killed and thomas had discovered he had a skill for killing it was not just that he was a good archer the army was full of men who were as good as he and there was a handful who were better but he had discovered he could sense what the enemy was doing he would watch them watch their eyes see where they were looking and as often as not he anticipated an enemy move and was ready to greet it with an arrow it was like a game but one where he knew the rules and they did not it helped that william skeat trusted him skeat had been unwilling to recruit thomas when they first met by the gaol in dorchester where skeat was testing a score of thieves and murderers to see how well they could shoot a bow he needed recruits and the king needed archers so men who would otherwise have faced the gallows were being pardoned if they would serve abroad and fully half of skeats men were such felons thomas skeat had reckoned would never fit in with such rogues he had taken thomass right hand seen the callouses on the two bow fingers which said he was an archer but then had tapped the boys soft palm what have you been doing skeat had asked my father wanted me to be a priest a priest eh skeat had been scornful well you can pray for us i suppose i can kill for you too skeat had eventually let thomas join the band not least because the boy brought his own horse at first skeat thought thomas of hookton was little more than another wild fool looking for adventure a clever fool to be sure but thomas had taken to the life of an archer in brittany with alacrity the real business of the civil war was plunder and day after day skeats men rode into land that gave fealty to the supporters of duke charles and they burned the farms stole the harvest and took the livestock a lord whose peasants cannot pay rent is a lord who cannot afford to hire soldiers so skeats menatarms and mounted archers were loosed on the enemys land like a plague and thomas loved the life he was young and his task was not just to fight the enemy but to ruin him he burned farms poisoned wells stole seedgrain broke ploughs fired the mills ringbarked the orchards and lived off his plunder skeats men were the lords of brittany a scourge from hell and the frenchspeaking villagers in the east of the duchy called them the hellequin which meant the devils horsemen once in a while an enemy war band would seek to trap them and thomas had learned that the english archer with his great long war bow was the king of those skirmishes the enemy hated the archers if they captured an english bowman they killed him a manatarms might be imprisoned a lord would be ransomed but an archer was always murdered tortured first then murdered thomas thrived on the life and skeat had learned the lad was clever certainly clever enough to know better than to fall asleep one night when he should have been standing guard and for that offence skeat had thumped the daylights out of him you were goddamn drunk he had accused thomas then beat him thoroughly using his fists like blacksmiths hammers he had broken thomass nose cracked a rib and called him a stinking piece of satans shit but at the end of it will skeat saw that the boy was still grinning and six months later he made thomas into a vintenar which meant he was in charge of twenty other archers those twenty were nearly all older than thomas but none seemed to mind his promotion for they reckoned he was different most archers wore their hair cropped short but thomass hair was flamboyantly long and wrapped with boweords so it fell in a long black plait to his waist he was cleanshaven and dressed only in black such affectations could have made him unpopular but he worked hard had a quick wit and was generous he was still odd though all archers wore talismans maybe a cheap metal pendant showing a saint or a dried hares foot but thomas had a desiccated dogs paw hanging round his neck which he claimed was the hand of saint guinefort and no one dared dispute him because he was the most learned man in skeats band he spoke french like a nobleman and latin like a priest and skeats archers were perversely proud of him because of those accomplishments now three years after joining will skeats band thomas was one of his chief archers skeat even asked his advice sometimes he rarely took it but he asked and thomas still had the dogs paw a crooked nose and an impudent grin and now he had an idea how to get into la rochederrien that afternoon when the dead manatarms with the split skull was still tangled in the abandoned ladder sir simon jekyll rode towards the town and there trotted his horse back and forth beside the small darkfeathered crossbow bolts that marked the furthest range of the defenders weapons his squire a daft boy with a slack jaw and puzzled eyes watched from a distance the squire held sir simons lance and should any warrior in the town accept the implicit challenge of sir simons mocking presence the squire would give his master the lance and the two horsemen would fight on the pasture until one or the other yielded and it would not be sir simon for he was as skilled a knight as any in the earl of northamptons army and the poorest his destrier was ten years old hardmouthed and swaybacked his saddle which was high in pommel and cantle so that it held him firm in its grip had belonged to his father while his hauberk a tunic of mail that covered him from neck to knees had belonged to his grandfather his sword was over a hundred years old heavy and would not keep its edge his lance had warped in the wet winter weather while his helmet which hung from his pommel was an old steel pot with a worn leather lining his shield with its escutcheon of a mailed fist clutching a warhammer was battered and faded his mail gauntlets like the rest of his armour were rusting which was why his squire had a thick reddened ear and a frightened face though the real reason for the rust was not that the squire did not try to clean the mail but that sir simon could not afford the vinegar and fine sand that was used to scour the steel he was poor poor and bitter and ambitious and good no one denied he was good he had won the tournament at tewkesbury and received a purse of forty pounds at gloucester his victory had been rewarded by a fine suit of armour at chelmsford it had been fifteen pounds and a fine saddle and at canterbury he had half hacked a frenchman to death before being given a gilded cup filled with coins and where were all those trophies now in the hands of the bankers and lawyers and merchants who had a lien on the berkshire estate that sir simon had inherited two years before though in truth his inheritance had been nothing but debt and the moment his father was buried the moneylenders had closed on sir simon like hounds on a wounded deer marry an heiress his mother had advised and she had paraded a dozen women for her sons inspection but sir simon was determined his wife should be as beautiful as he was handsome and he was handsome he knew that he would stare into his mothers mirror and admire his reflection he had thick fair hair a broad face and a short beard at chester where he had unhorsed three knights inside four minutes men had mistaken him for the king who was reputed to fight anonymously in tournaments and sir simon was not going to throw away his good royal looks on some wrinkled hag just because she had money he would marry a woman worthy of himself but that ambition would not pay the estates debts and so sir simon to defend himself against his creditors had sought a letter of protection from king edward iii that letter shielded sir simon from all legal proceedings so long as he served the king in a foreign war and when sir simon had crossed the channel taking six menatarms a dozen archers and a slackjawed squire from his encumbered estate he had left his creditors helpless in england sir simon had also brought with him a certainty that he would soon capture some french or breton nobleman whose ransom would be sufficient to pay all he owed but so far the winter campaign had not yielded a single prisoner of rank and so little plunder that the army was now on half rations and how many wellborn prisoners could he expect to take in a miserable town like la rochederrien it was a shit hole yet he rode up and down beneath its walls hoping some knight would take the challenge and ride from the towns southern gate that had so far resisted six english assaults but instead the defenders jeered him and called him a coward for staying out of their crossbows range and the insults piqued sir simons pride so that he rode closer to the walls his horses hoofs sometimes clattering on one of the fallen quarrels men shot at him but the bolts fell well short and it was sir simons turn to jeer hes just a bloody fool jake said watching from the english camp jake was one of william skeats felons a murderer who had been saved from the gallows at exeter he was crosseyed yet still managed to shoot straighter than most men now whats he doing sir simon had stopped his horse and was facing the gate so that the men who watched thought that perhaps a frenchman was coming to challenge the english knight who taunted them instead they saw that a lone crossbowman was standing on the gate turret and beckoning sir simon forward daring him to come within range only a fool would respond to such a dare and sir simon dutifully responded he was twentyfive years old bitter and brave and he reckoned a display of careless arrogance would dishearten the besieged garrison and encourage the dispirited english and so he spurred the destrier deep into the killing ground where the french bolts had torn the heart out of the english attacks no crossbowman fired now there was just the lone figure standing on the gate tower and sir simon riding to within a hundred yards saw it was the blackbird this was the first time sir simon had seen the woman every archer called the blackbird and he was close enough to perceive that she was indeed a beauty she stood straight slender and tall cloaked against the winter wind but with her long black hair loose like a young girls she offered him a mocking bow and sir simon responded bending awkwardly in the tight saddle then he watched as she picked up her crossbow and put it to her shoulder and when were inside the town sir simon thought ill make you pay for this youll be flat on your arse blackbird and ill be on top he stood his horse quite still a lone horseman in the french slaughter ground daring her to aim straight and knowing she would not and when she missed he would give her a mocking salute and the french would take it as a bad omen but what if she did aim straight sir simon was tempted to lift the awkward helmet from his saddles pommel but resisted the impulse he had dared the blackbird to do her worst and he could show no nerves in front of a woman and so he waited as she levelled the bow the towns defenders were watching her and doubtless praying or perhaps making wagers come on you bitch he said under his breath it was cold but there was sweat on his forehead she paused pushed the black hair from her face then rested the bow on a crenellation and aimed again sir simon kept his head up and his gaze straight just a woman he told himself probably could not hit a wagon at five paces his horse shivered and he reached out to pat its neck be going soon boy he told it the blackbird watched by a score of defenders closed her eyes and shot sir simon saw the quarrel as a small black blur against the grey sky and the grey stones of the church towers showing above la rochederriens walls he knew the quarrel would go wide knew it with an absolute certainty she was a woman for gods sake and that was why he did not move as he saw the blur coming straight for him he could not believe it he was waiting for the quarrel to slide to left or right or to plough into the frosthardened ground but instead it was coming unerringly towards his breast and at the very last instant he jerked up the heavy shield and ducked his head and felt a huge thump on his left arm as the bolt slammed home to throw him hard against the saddles cantle the bolt hit the shield so hard that it split through the willow boards and its point gouged a deep cut through the mail sleeve and into his forearm the french were cheering and sir simon knowing that other crossbowmen might now try to finish what the blackbird had begun pressed his knee into his destriers flank and the beast obediently turned and then responded to the spurs im alive he said aloud as if that would silence the french jubilation goddamn bitch he thought he would pay her right enough pay her till she squealed and he curbed his horse not wanting to look as though he fled an hour later after his squire had put a bandage over the slashed forearm sir simon had convinced himself that he had scored a victory he had dared he had survived it had been a demonstration of courage and he lived and for that he reckoned he was a hero and he expected a heros welcome as he walked toward the tent that housed the armys commander the earl of northampton the tent was made from two sails their linen yellow and patched and threadbare after years of service at sea they made a shabby shelter but that was typical of william bohun earl of northampton who though cousin to the king and as rich a man as any in england despised gaudiness the earl indeed looked as patched and threadbare as the sails that made his tent he was a short and squat man with a face men said like the backside of a bull but the face mirrored the earls soul which was blunt brave and straightforward the army liked william bohun earl of northampton because he was as tough as they were themselves now as sir simon ducked into the tent the earls curly brown hair was half covered with a bandage where the boulder thrown from la rochederriens wall had split his helmet and driven a ragged edge of steel into his scalp he greeted sir simon sourly tired of life the silly bitch shut her eyes when she pulled the trigger sir simon said oblivious to the earls tone she still aimed well the earl said angrily and that will put heart into the bastards god knows they need no encouragement im alive my lord sir simon said cheerfully she wanted to kill me she failed the bear lives and the dogs go hungry he waited for the earls companions to congratulate him but they avoided his eyes and he interpreted their sullen silence as jealousy sir simon was a bloody fool the earl thought and shivered he might not have minded the cold so much had the army been enjoying success but for two months the english and their breton allies had stumbled from failure to farce and the six assaults on la rochederrien had plumbed the depths of misery so now the earl had called a council of war to suggest one final assault this one to be made that same evening every other attack had been in the forenoon but perhaps a surprise escalade in the dying winter light would take the defenders by surprise only what small advantages that surprise might bring had been spoiled because sir simons foolhardiness must have given the townsfolk a new confidence and there was little confidence among the earls war captains who had gathered under the yellow sailcloth four of those captains were knights who like sir simon led their own men to war but the others were mercenary soldiers who had contracted their men to the earls service three were bretons who wore the white ermine badge of the duke of brittany and led men loyal to the de montfort duke while the others were english captains all of them commoners who had grown hard in war william skeat was there and next to him was richard totesham who had begun his service as a manatarms and now led a hundred and forty knights and ninety archers in the earls service neither man had ever fought in a tournament nor would they ever be invited yet both were wealthier than sir simon and that rankled my hounds of war the earl of northampton called the independent captains and the earl liked them but then the earl had a curious taste for vulgar company he might be cousin to englands king but william bohun happily drank with men like skeat and totesham ate with them spoke english with them hunted with them and trusted them and sir simon felt excluded from that friendship if any man in this army should have been an intimate of the earl it was sir simon a noted champion of tournaments but northampton would rather roll in the gutter with men like skeat hows the rain the earl asked starting again sir simon answered jerking his head at the tents roof against which the rain pattered fitfully itll clear skeat said dourly he rarely called the earl my lord addressing him instead as an equal which to sir simons amazement the earl seemed to like and its only spitting the earl said peering out from the tent and letting in a swirl of damp cold air bowstrings will pluck in this so will crossbow cords richard totesham interjected bastards he added what made the english failure so galling was that la rochederriens defenders were not soldiers but townsfolk fishermen and boatbuilders carpenters and masons and even the blackbird a woman and the rain might stop totesham went on but the ground will be slick itll be bad footing under the walls dont go tonight will skeat advised let my boys go in by the river tomorrow morning the earl rubbed the wound on his scalp for a week now he had assaulted la rochederriens southern wall and he still believed his men could take those ramparts yet he also sensed the pessimism among his hounds of war one more repulse with another twenty or thirty dead would leave his army dispirited and with the prospect of trailing back to finisterre with nothing accomplished tell me again he said skeat wiped his nose on his leather sleeve at low tide he said theres a way round the north wall one of my lads was down there last night we tried it three days ago one of the knights objected you tried the downriver side skeat said i want to go upriver that side has stakes just like the other the earl said loose skeat responded one of the breton captains translated the exchange for his companions my boy pulled a stake clean out skeat went on and he reckons half a dozen others will lift or break theyre old oak trunks he says instead of elm and theyre rotted through how deep is the mud the earl asked up to his knees la rochederriens wall encompassed the west south and east of the town while the northern side was defended by the river jaudy and where the semicircular wall met the river the townsfolk had planted huge stakes in the mud to block access at low tide skeat was now suggesting there was a way through those rotted stakes but when the earls men had tried to do the same thing at the eastern side of the town the attackers had got bogged down in the mud and the townsfolk had picked them off with bolts it had been a worse slaughter than the repulses in front of the southern gate but theres still a wall on the riverbank the earl pointed out aye skeat allowed but the silly bastards have broken it down in places theyve built quays there and theres one right close to the loose stakes so your men will have to remove the stakes and climb the quays all under the gaze of men on the wall the earl asked sceptically they can do it skeat said firmly the earl still reckoned his best chance of success was to close his archers on the south gate and pray that their arrows would keep the defenders cowering while his menatarms assaulted the breach yet that he conceded was the plan that had failed earlier in the day and on the day before that and he had he knew only a day or two left he possessed fewer than three thousand men and a third of those were sick and if he could not find them shelter he would have to march back west with his tail between his legs he needed a town any town even la rochederrien will skeat saw the worries on the earls broad face my lad was within fifteen paces of the quay last night he asserted he could have been inside the town and opened the gate so why didnt he sir simon could not resist asking christs bones he went on but id have been inside youre not an archer skeat said sourly then made the sign of the cross at guingamp one of skeats archers had been captured by the defenders who had stripped the hated bowman naked then cut him to pieces on the rampart where the besiegers could see his long death his two bow fingers had been severed first then his manhood and the man had screamed like a pig being gelded as he bled to death on the battlements the earl gestured for a servant to replenish the cups of mulled wine would you lead this attack will he asked not me skeat said im too old to wade through boggy mud ill let the lad who went past the stakes last night lead them in hes a good boy so he is hes a clever bastard but an odd one he was going to be a priest he was only he met me and came to his senses the earl was plainly tempted by the idea he toyed with the hilt of his sword then nodded i think we should meet your clever bastard is he near left him outside skeat said then twisted on his stool tom you savage come in here thomas stooped into the earls tent where the gathered captains saw a tall longlegged young man dressed entirely in black all but for his mail coat and the red cross sewn onto his tunic all the english troops wore that cross of saint george so that in a melee they would know who was a friend and who an enemy the young man bowed to the earl who realized he had noticed this archer before which was hardly surprising for thomas was a strikinglooking man he wore his black hair in a pigtail tied with boweord he had a long bony nose that was crooked a cleanshaven chin and watchful clever eyes though perhaps the most noticeable thing about him was that he was clean that and on his shoulder the great bow that was one of the longest the earl had seen and not only long but painted black while mounted on the outer belly of the bow was a curious silver plate which seemed to have a coat of arms engraved on it there was vanity here the earl thought vanity and pride and he approved of both things for a man who was up to his knees in river mud last night the earl said with a smile youre remarkably clean i washed my lord youll catch cold the earl warned him whats your name thomas of hookton my lord so tell me what you found last night thomas of hookton thomas told the same tale as will skeat how after dark and as the tide fell he had waded out into the jaudys mud he had found the fence of stakes illmaintained rotting and loose and he had lifted one out of its socket wriggled through the gap and gone a few paces towards the nearest quay i was close enough my lord to hear a woman singing he said the woman had been singing a song that his own mother had crooned to him when he was small and he had been struck by that oddity the earl frowned when thomas finished not because he disapproved of anything the archer had said but because the scalp wound that had left him unconscious for an hour was throbbing what were you doing at the river last night he asked mainly to give himself more time to think about the idea thomas said nothing another mans woman skeat eventually answered for thomas thats what he was doing my lord another mans woman the assembled men laughed all but sir simon jekyll who looked sourly at the blushing thomas the bastard was a mere archer yet he was wearing a better coat of mail than sir simon could afford and he had a confidence that stank of impudence sir simon shuddered there was an unfairness to life which he did not understand archers from the shires were capturing horses and weapons and armour while he a champion of tournaments had not managed anything more valuable than a pair of goddamned boots he felt an irresistible urge to deflate this tall composed archer one alert sentinel my lord sir simon spoke to the earl in norman french so that only the handful of wellborn men in the tent would understand him and this boy will be dead and our attack will be floundering in river mud thomas gave sir simon a very level look insolent in its lack of expression then answered in fluent french we should attack in the dark he said then turned back to the earl the tide will be low just before dawn tomorrow my lord the earl looked at him with surprise how did you learn french from my father my lord do we know him i doubt it my lord the earl did not pursue the subject he bit his lip and rubbed the pommel of his sword a habit when he was thinking all well and good if you get inside richard totesham seated on a milking stool next to will skeat growled at thomas totesham led the largest of the independent bands and had on that account a greater authority than the rest of the captains but what do you do when youre inside thomas nodded as though he had expected the question i doubt we can reach a gate he said but if i can put a score of archers onto the wall beside the river then they can protect it while ladders are placed and ive got two ladders skeat added theyll do the earl still rubbed the pommel of his sword when we tried to attack by the river before he said we got trapped in the mud itll be just as deep where you want to go hurdles my lord thomas said i found some in a farm hurdles were fence sections made of woven willow that could make a quick pen for sheep or could be laid flat on mud to provide men with footing i told you he was clever will skeat said proudly went to oxford didnt you tom when i was too young to know better thomas said drily the earl laughed he liked this boy and he could see why skeat had such faith in him tomorrow morning thomas he asked better than dusk tonight my lord theyll still be lively at dusk thomas gave sir simon an expressionless glance intimating that the knights display of stupid bravery would have quickened the defenders spirits then tomorrow morning it is the earl said he turned to totesham but keep your boys closed on the south gate today i want them to think were coming there again he looked back to thomas whats the badge on your bow boy just something i found my lord thomas lied handing the bow to the earl who had held out his hand in truth he had cut the silver badge out of the crushed chalice that he had found under his fathers robes then pinned the metal to the front of the bow where his left hand had worn the silver almost smooth the earl peered at the device a yale i think thats what the beast is called my lord thomas said pretending ignorance not the badge of anyone i know the earl said then tried to flex the bow and raised his eyebrows in surprise at its strength he gave the black shaft back to thomas then dismissed him i wish you godspeed in the morning thomas of hookton my lord thomas said and bowed ill go with him with your permission skeat said and the earl nodded then watched the two men leave if we do get inside he told his remaining captains then for gods sake dont let your men cry havoc hold their leashes tight i intend to keep this town and i dont want the townsfolk hating us kill when you must but i dont want an orgy of blood he looked at their sceptical faces ill be putting one of you in charge of the garrison here so make it easy for yourselves hold them tight the captains grunted knowing how hard it would be to keep their men from a full sack of the town but before any of them could respond to the earls hopeful wishes sir simon stood my lord a request the earl shrugged try me would you let me and my men lead the ladder party the earl seemed surprised at the request you think skeat cannot manage on his own i am sure he can my lord sir simon said humbly but i still beg the honour better sir simon jekyll dead than will skeat the earl thought he nodded of course of course the captains said nothing what honour was there in being first onto a wall that another man had captured no the bastard did not want honour he wanted to be well placed to find the richest plunder in town but none of them voiced his thought they were captains but sir simon was a knight even if a penniless one the earls army threatened an attack for the rest of that short winters day but it never came and the citizens of la rochederrien dared to hope that the worst of their ordeal was over but made preparations in case the english did try again the next day they counted their crossbow bolts stacked more boulders on the ramparts and fed the fires which boiled the pots of water that were poured onto the english heat the wretches up the towns priests had said and the townsfolk liked that jest they were winning they knew and they reckoned their ordeal must finish soon for the english would surely be running out of food all la rochederrien had to do was endure and then receive the praise and thanks of duke charles the small rain stopped at nightfall the townsfolk went to their beds but kept their weapons ready the sentries lit watch fires behind the walls and gazed into the dark it was night it was winter it was cold and the besiegers had one last chance the blackbird had been christened jeanette marie halevy and when she was fifteen her parents had taken her to guingamp for the annual tournament of the apples her father was not an aristocrat so the family could not sit in the enclosure beneath saint laurents tower but they found a place nearby and louis halevy made certain his daughter was visible by placing their chairs on the farm wagon which had carried them from la rochederrien jeanettes father was a prosperous shipmaster and wine merchant though his fortune in business had not been mirrored in life one son had died when a cut finger turned septic and his second son had drowned on a voyage to corunna jeanette was now his only child there was calculation in the visit to guingamp the nobility of brittany at least those who favoured an alliance with france assembled at the tournament where for four days in front of a crowd that came as much for the fair as for the fighting they displayed their talents with sword and lance jeanette found much of it tedious for the preambles to each fight were long and often out of earshot knights paraded endlessly their extravagant plumes nodding but after a while there would be a brief thunder of hoofs a clash of metal a cheer and one knight would be tumbled in the grass it was customary for every victorious knight to prick an apple with his lance and present it to whichever woman in the crowd attracted him and that was why her father had taken the farm wagon to guingamp after four days jeanette had eighteen apples i and the enmity of a score of betterborn girls her parents took her back to la rochederrien and waited they had displayed their wares and now the buyers could find their way to the lavish house beside the river jaudy from the front the house seemed small but go through the archway and a visitor found himself in a wide courtyard reaching down to a stone quay where monsieur halevys smaller boats could be moored at the top of the tide the courtyard shared a wall with the church of saint renan and because monsieur halevy had donated the tower to the church he had been permitted to drive an archway through the wall so that his family did not need to step into the street when they went to mass the house told any suitor that this was a wealthy family and the presence of the parish priest at the supper table told him it was a devout family jeanette was to be no aristocrats plaything she was to be a wife a dozen men condescended to visit the halevy house but it was henri chenier comte darmorique who won the apple he was a prime catch for he was nephew to charles of blois who was himself a nephew to king philip of france and it was charles whom the french recognized as duke and ruler of brittany the duke allowed henri chenier to present his fiancee but afterwards advised his nephew to discard her the girl was a merchants daughter scarce more than a peasant though even the duke admitted she was a beauty her hair was shining black her face was unflawed by the pox and she had all her teeth she was graceful so that a dominican friar in the dukes court clasped his hands and exclaimed that jeanette was the living image of the madonna the duke agreed she was beautiful but so what many women were beautiful any tavern in guingamp he said could throw up a twolivre whore who could make most wives look like hogs it was not the job of a wife to be beautiful but to be rich make the girl your mistress he advised his nephew and virtually ordered henri to marry an heiress from picardy but the heiress was a poxfaced slattern and the count of armorica was besotted by jeanettes beauty and so he defied his uncle he married the merchants daughter in the chapel of his castle at plabennec which lay in finisterre the worlds end the duke reckoned his nephew had listened to too many troubadours but the count and his new wife were happy and a year after their wedding when jeanette was sixteen their son was born they named him charles after the duke but if the duke was complimented he said nothing he refused to receive jeanette again and treated his nephew coldly later that same year the english came in force to support jean de montfort whom they recognized as the duke of brittany and the king of france sent reinforcements to his nephew charles whom he recognized as the real duke and so the civil war began in earnest the count of armorica insisted that his wife and baby son went back to her fathers house in la rochederrien because the castle at plabennec was small in ill repair and too close to the invaders forces that summer the castle fell to the english just as jeanettes husband had feared and the following year the king of england spent the campaigning season in brittany and his army pushed back the forces of charles duke of brittany there was no one great battle but a series of bloody skirmishes and in one of them a ragged affair fought between the hedgerows of a steep valley jeanettes husband was wounded he had lifted the facepiece of his helmet to shout encouragement to his men and an arrow had gone clean through his mouth his servants brought the count to the house beside the river jaudy where he took five days to die five days of constant pain during which he was unable to eat and scarce able to breathe as the wound festered and the blood congealed in his gullet he was twentyeight years old a champion of tournaments and he wept like a child at the end he choked to death and jeanette screamed in frustrated anger and grief then began jeanettes time of sorrow she was a widow la veuve chenier and not six months after her husbands death she became an orphan when both her parents died of the bloody flux she was just eighteen and her son the count of armorica was two but jeanette had inherited her fathers wealth and she determined to use itto strike back at the hated english who had killed her husband and so she began outfitting two ships that could prey on english shipping monsieur belas who had been her fathers lawyer advised against spending money on the ships jeanettes fortune would not last for ever the lawyer said and nothing soaked up cash like outfitting warships that rarely made money unless by luck better he said to use the ships for trade the merchants in lannion are making a fine profit on spanish wine he suggested he had a cold for it was winter and he sneezed a very fine profit he said wistfully he spoke in breton though both he and jeanette could if needs be speak french i do not want spanish wine jeanette said coldly but english souls no profit in those my lady belas said he found it strange to call jeanette my lady he had known her since she was a child and she had always been little jeanette to him but she had married and become an aristocratic widow and a widow moreover with a temper you cannot sell english souls belas pointed out mildly except to the devil jeanette said crossing herself but i dont need spanish wine belas we have the rents the rents belas said mockingly he was tall thin scantyhaired and clever he had served jeanettes father well and long and was resentful that the merchant had left him nothing in his will everything had gone to jeanette except for a small bequest to the monks at pontrieux so they would say masses for the dead mans soul belas hid his resentment nothing comes from plabennec he told jeanette the english are there and how long do you think the rents will come from your fathers farms the english will take them soon an english army had occupied unwalled treguler which was only an hours walk northwards and they had pulled down the cathedral tower there because some crossbowmen had shot at them from its summit belas hoped the english would retreat soon for it was deep in the winter and their supplies must be running low but he feared they might ravage the countryside about la rochederrien before they left and if they did jeanettes farms would be left worthless how much rent can you get from a burned farm he asked her i dont care she snapped i shall sell everything if i have to everything except for her husbands armour and weapons they were precious and would go to her son one day belas sighed for her foolishness then huddled in his black cloak and leaned close to the small fire which spat in the hearth a cold wind came from the nearby sea making the chimney smoke you will permit me madame to offer you advice first the business belas paused to wipe his nose on his long black sleeve it ails but i can find you a good man to run it as your father did and i would draw up a contract which would ensure the man would pay you well from the profits second madame you should think of marriage he paused half expecting a protest but jeanette said nothing belas sighed she was so lovely there were a dozen men in town who would marry her but marriage to an aristocrat had turned her head and she would settle for nothing less than another titled man you are madame the lawyer continued carefully a widow who possesses at the moment a considerable fortune but i have seen such fortunes drain away like snow in april find a man who can look after you your possessions and your son jeanette turned and stared at him i married the finest man in christendom she said and where do you think i will find another like him men like the count of armorica the lawyer thought were found everywhere more was the pity for what were they but brute fools in armour who believed war was a sport jeanette he thought should marry a prudent merchant perhaps a widower who had a fortune but he suspected such advice would be wasted remember the old saying my lady he said slyly put a cat to watch a flock and the wolves eat well jeanette shuddered with anger at the words you go beyond yourself monsieur belas she spoke idly then dismissed him and the next day the english came to la rochederrien and jeanette took her dead husbands crossbow from the place where she hid her wealth and she joined the defenders on the walls damn belass advice she would fight like a man and duke charles who despised her would learn to admire her to support her and restore her dead husbands estates to her son so jeanette had become the blackbird and the english had died in front of her walls and belass advice was forgotten and now jeanette reckoned the towns defenders had so rattled the english that the siege would surely be lifted all would be well in which belief for the first time in a week the blackbird slept well thomas crouched beside the river he had broken through a stand of alders to reach the bank where he now pulled off his boots and hose best to go barelegged he reckoned so the boots did not get stuck in the river mud it was going to be cold freezing cold but he could not remember a time when he had been happier he liked this life and his memories of hookton oxford and his father had almost faded take your boots off he told the twenty archers who would accompany him and hang your arrow bags round your necks why someone challenged him from the dark so it bloody throttles you thomas growled so your arrows dont get wet another man explained helpfully thomas tied his own bag round his neck archers did not carry the quivers that hunters used for quivers were open at the top and their arrows could fall out when a man ran or stumbled or clambered through a hedge arrows in quivers got wet when it rained and wet feathers made arrows fly crooked so real archers used linen bags that were waterproofed with wax and sealed by laces the bags were bolstered by withy frames that spread the linen so the feathers were not crushed will skeat edged down the bank where a dozen men were stacking the hurdles he shivered in the cold wind that came from the water the sky to the east was still dark but some light came from the watch fires that burned within la rochederrien theyre nice and quiet in there skeat said nodding towards the town pray theyre sleeping thomas said in beds too ive forgotten what a beds like skeat said then edged aside to let another man through to the riverbank thomas was surprised to see it was sir simon jekyll who had been so scornful of him in the earls tent sir simon will skeat said barely bothering to disguise his own scorn wants a word with thee sir simon wrinkled his nose at the stench of the river mud much of it he supposed was the towns sewage and he was glad he was not wading barelegged through the muck you are confident of passing the stakes he asked thomas i wouldnt be going otherwise thomas said not bothering to sound respectful thomass tone made sir simon bridle but he controlled his temper the earl he said distantly has given me the honour of leading the attack on the walls he stopped abruptly and thomas waited expecting more but sir simon merely looked at him with an irritated face so thomas takes the walls skeat finally spoke to make it safe for your ladders what i do not want sir simon ignored skeat and spoke to thomas is for you to take your men ahead of mine into the town itself we see armed men were likely to kill them you understand thomas almost spat in derision his men would be armed with bows and no enemy carried a longstave bow like the english so there was hardly any chance of being mistaken for the towns defenders but he held his tongue he just nodded you and your archers can join our attack sir simon went on but you will be under my command thomas nodded again and sir simon irritated by the implied insolence turned on his heel and walked away goddamn bastard thomas said he just wants to get his nose into the trough ahead of the rest of us skeat said youre letting the bastard use our ladders thomas asked if he wants to be first up let him ladders are green wood tom and if they break id rather it was him tumbling than me besides i reckon well be better off following you through the river but i aint telling sir simon that skeat grinned then swore as a crash sounded from the darkness south of the river those bloody white rats skeat said and vanished into the shadows the white rats were the bretons loyal to duke john men who wore his badge of a white ermine and some sixty breton crossbowmen had been attached to skeats soldiers their job to rattle the walls with their bolts as the ladders were placed against the ramparts it was those men who had startled the night with their noise and now the noise grew even louder some fool had tripped in the dark and thumped a crossbowman with a pavise the huge shield behind which the crossbows were laboriously reloaded and the crossbowman struck back and suddenly the white rats were having a brawl in the dark the defenders naturally heard them and started to hurl burning bales of straw over the ramparts and then a church bell began to toll then another and all this long before thomas had even started across the mud sir simon jekyll alarmed by the bells and the burning straw shouted that the attack must go in now carry the ladders forward he bellowed defenders were running onto la rochederriens walls and the first crossbow bolts were spitting off the ramparts that were lit bright by the burning bales hold those goddamn ladders will skeat snarled at his men then looked at thomas what do you reckon i think the bastards are distracted thomas said so youll go got nothing better to do will bloody white rats thomas led his men onto the mud the hurdles were some help but not as much as he had hoped so that they still slipped and struggled their way towards the great stakes and thomas reckoned the noise they made was enough to wake king arthur and his knights but the defenders were making even more noise every church bell was clanging a trumpet was screaming men were shouting dogs barking cockerels were crowing and the crossbows were creaking and banging as their cords were inched back and released the walls loomed to thomass right he wondered if the blackbird was up there he had seen her twice now and been captivated by the fierceness of her face and her wild black hair a score of other archers had seen her too and all of them men who could thread an arrow through a bracelet at a hundred paces yet the woman still lived amazing thomas thought what a pretty face could do he threw down the last hurdle and so reached the wooden stakes each one a whole tree trunk sunk into the mud his men joined him and they heaved against the timber until the rotted wood split like straw the stakes made a terrible noise as they fell but it was drowned by the uproar in the town jake the crosseyed murderer from exeter gaol pulled himself alongside thomas to their right now was a wooden quay with a rough ladder at one end dawn was coming and a feeble thin grey light was seeping from the east to outline the bridge across the jaudy it was a handsome stone bridge with a barbican at its further end and thomas feared the garrison of that tower might see them but no one called an alarm and no crossbow bolts thumped across the river thomas and jake were first up the quay ladder then came sam the youngest of skeats archers the wooden landing stage served a timberyard and a dog began barking frantically among the stacked trunks but sam slipped into the blackness with his knife and the barking suddenly stopped good doggy sam said as he came back string your bows thomas said he had looped the hemp cord onto his own black weapon and now untied the laces of his arrow bag i hate bloody dogs sam said one bit my mother when she was pregnant with me thats why youre daft jake said shut your goddamn faces thomas ordered more archers were climbing the quay which was swaying alarmingly but he could see that the walls he was supposed to capture were thick with defenders now english arrows their white goose feathers bright in the flamelight of the defenders fires flickered over the wall and thumped into the towns thatched roofs maybe we should open the south gate thomas suggested go through the town jake asked in alarm its a small town thomas said youre mad jake said but he was grinning and he meant the words as a compliment im going anyway thomas said it would be dark in the streets and their long bows would be hidden he reckoned it would be safe enough a dozen men followed thomas while the rest started plundering the nearer buildings more and more men were coming through the broken stakes now as will skeat sent them down the riverbank rather than wait for the wall to be captured the defenders had seen the men in the mud and were shooting down from the end of the town wall but the first attackers were already loose in the streets thomas blundered through the town it was pitchblack in the alleys and hard to tell where he was going though by climbing the hill on which the town was built he reckoned he must eventually go over the summit and so down to the southern gate men ran past him but no one could see that he and his companions were english the church bells were deafening children were crying dogs howling gulls screaming and the noise was making thomas terrified this was a daft idea he thought maybe sir simon had already climbed the walls maybe he was wasting his time yet whitefeathered arrows still thumped into the town roofs suggesting the walls were untaken and so he forced himself to keep going twice he found himself in a blind alley and the second time doubling back into a wider street he almost ran into a priest who had come from his church to fix a flaming torch in a wall bracket go to the ramparts the priest said sternly then saw the long bows in the mens hands and opened his mouth to shout the alarm he never had time to shout for thomass bow stave slammed pointfirst into his belly he bent over gasping and jake casually slit his throat the priest gurgled as he sank to the cobbles and jake frowned when the noise stopped ill go to hell for that he said youre going to hell anyway sam said we all are were all going to heaven thomas said but not if we dawdle he suddenly felt much less frightened as though the priests death had taken his fear an arrow struck the church tower and dropped into the alley as thomas led his men past the church and found himself on la rochederriens main street which dropped down to where a watch fire burned by the southern gate thomas shrank back into the alley beside the church for the street was thick with men but they were all running to the threatened side of the town and when thomas next looked the hill was empty he could only see two sentinels on the ramparts above the gate arch he told his men about the two sentries theyre going to be scared as hell he said we kill the bastards and open the gate there might be others sam said therell be a guard house then kill them too thomas said now come on they stepped into the street ran down a few yards and there drew their bows the arrows flew and the two guards on the arch fell a man stepped out of the guard house built into the gate turret and gawped at the archers but before any could draw their bows he stepped back inside and barred the door its ours thomas shouted and led his men in a wild rush to the arch the guard house stayed locked so there was no one to stop the archers from lifting the bar and pushing open the two great gates the earls men saw the gates open saw the english archers outlined against the watch fire and gave a great roar from the darkness that told thomas a torrent of vengeful troops was coming towards him which meant la rochederriens time of weeping could begin for the english had taken the town jeanette woke to a church bell ringing as though it was the worlds doom when the dead were rising from their graves and the gates of hell were yawning wide for sinners her first instinct was to cross to her sons bed but little charles was safe she could just see his eyes in the dark that was scarcely alleviated by the glowing embers of the fire mama he cried reaching up to her quiet she hushed the boy then ran to throw open the shutters a faint grey light showed above the eastern roofs then steps sounded in the street and she leaned from the window to see men running from their houses with swords crossbows and spears a trumpet was calling from the town centre then more church bells began tolling the alarm into a dying night the bell of the church of the virgin was cracked and made a harsh anvillike noise that was all the more terrifying madame a servant cried as she ran into the room the english must be attacking jeanette forced herself to speak calmly she was wearing nothing but a linen shift and was suddenly cold she snatched up a cloak tied it about her neck then took her son into her arms you will be all right charles she tried to console him the english are attacking again that is all except she was not sure the bells were sounding so wild it was not the measured tolling that was the usual signal of attack but a panicked clangour as though the men hauling the ropes were trying to repel an attack by their own efforts she looked from the window again and saw the english arrows hitting across the roofs she could hear them thumping into the thatch the children of the town thought it was a fine sport to retrieve the enemy arrows and two had injured themselves sliding from the roofs jeanette thought about getting dressed but decided she must find out what was happening first so she gave charles to the servant then ran downstairs one of the kitchen servants met her at the back door whats happening madame another attack that is all she unbarred the door to the yard then ran to the private entrance to renans church just as an arrow struck the church tower and clattered down into the yard she pulled open the tower door then groped up the steep ladders that her father had built it had not been mere piety that had inspired louis halevy to construct the tower but also the opportunity to look downriver to see if his boats were approaching and the high stone parapet offered one of the best views in la rochederrien jeanette was deafened by the church bell that swung in the gloom each clapper stroke thumping her ears like a physical blow she climbed past the bell pushed open the trapdoor at the top of the ladders and clambered onto the leads the english had come she could see a torrent of men flowing about the river edge of the wall they waded through the mud and swarmed over the broken stakes like a torrent of rats sweet mother of christ she thought sweet mother of christ but they were in the town she hurried down the ladders theyre here she called to the priest who hauled the bell rope theyre in the town havoc havoc the english shouted the call that encouraged them to plunder jeanette ran across the yard and up the stairs she pulled her clothes from the cupboard then turned when the voices shouted havoc beneath her window she forgot her clothes and took charles back into her arms mother of god she prayed look after us now look after us sweet mother of god keep us safe she wept not knowing what to do charles cried because she was holding him too tight and she tried to soothe him cheers sounded in the street and she ran back to the window and saw what looked like a dark river studded with steel flowing towards the town centre she collapsed by the window sobbing charles was screaming two more servants were in the room somehow thinking that jeanette could shelter them but there was no shelter now the english had come one of the servants shot the bolt on the bedroom door but what good would that do jeanette thought of her husbands hidden weapons and of the spanish swords sharp edge and wondered if she would have the courage to place the point against her breast and heave her body onto the blade it would be better to die than be dishonoured she thought but then what would happen to her son she wept helplessly then heard someone beating on the big gate which led to her courtyard an axe she supposed and she listened to its crunching blows that seemed to shake the whole house a woman screamed in the town then another and the english voices cheered rampantly one by one the church bells fell silent until only the cracked bell hammered its fear across the roofs the axe still bit at the door would they recognize her she wondered she had exulted in standing on the ramparts shooting her husbands crossbow at the besiegers and her right shoulder was bruised because of it but she had welcomed the pain believing that every bolt fired made it less likely that the english would break into the town no one had thought they could and why besiege la rochederrien anyway it had nothing to offer as a port it was almost useless for the largest ships could not make it up the river even at the top of the tide the english the townspeople had believed were making a petulant demonstration and would soon give up and slink away but now they were here and jeanette screamed as the sound of the axe blows changed they had broken through and doubtless were trying to lift the bar she closed her eyes shaking as she heard the gate scrape on the cobbles it was open it was open oh mother of god she prayed be with us now the screams sounded downstairs feet thumped on the stairs mens voices shouted in a strange tongue be with us now and at the hour of our death for the english had come sir simon jekyll was annoyed he had been prepared to climb the ladders if skeats archers ever gained the walls which he doubted but if the ramparts were captured then he intended to be first into the town he foresaw cutting down a few panicked defenders then finding some great house to plunder but nothing happened as he had imagined it the town was awake the wall manned and the ladders never went forward but skeats men still got inside by simply wading through the mud at the rivers edge then a cheer at the southern side of the town suggested that gate was open which meant that the whole damned army was getting into la rochederrien ahead of sir simon he swore there would be nothing left my lord one of his menatarms prompted sir simon wanting a decision as to how they were to reach the women and valuables beyond the walls which were emptying of their defenders as men ran to protect their homes and families it would have been quicker far quicker to have waded through the mud but sir simon did not want to dirty his new boots and so he ordered the ladders forward the ladders were made of green wood and the rungs bent alarmingly as sir simon climbed but there were no defenders to oppose him and the ladder held he clambered into an embrasure and drew his sword a halfdozen defenders lay spitted with arrows on the rampart two were still alive and sir simon stabbed the nearest one the man had been roused from his bed and had no mail not even a leather coat yet still the old sword made hard work of the killing stroke it was not designed for stabbing but for cutting the new swords made from the finest southern european steel were renowned for their ability to pierce mail and leather but this ancient blade required all sir simons brute force to penetrate a rib cage and what chance he wondered sourly would there be of finding a better weapon in this sorry excuse for a town there was a flight of stone steps down into a street that was thronged by english archers and menatarms smeared with mud to their thighs they were breaking into houses one man was carrying a dead goose another had a bolt of cloth the plundering had begun and sir simon was still on the ramparts he shouted at his men to hurry and when enough of them had gathered on the walls top he led them down into the street an archer was rolling a barrel from a cellar door another dragged a girl by an arm where to go that was sir simons problem the nearest houses were all being sacked and the cheers from the south suggested the earls main army was descending on that part of the town some townsfolk realizing all was lost were fleeing in front of the archers to cross the bridge and escape into the countryside sir simon decided to strike east the earls men were to the south skeats were staying close to the west wall so the eastern quarter offered the best hope of plunder he pushed past skeats muddy archers and led his men towards the bridge frightened people ran past him ignoring him and hoping he would ignore them he crossed the main street which led to the bridge and saw a roadway running alongside the big houses that fronted the river merchants sir simon thought fat merchants with fat profits and then in the growlng light he saw an archway that was surmounted by a coat of arms a nobles house who has an axe he asked his men one of the menatarms stepped forward and sir simon indicated the heavy gate the house had windows on the ground floor but they were covered by heavy iron bars which seemed a good sign sir simon stepped back to let his man start work on the gate the axeman knew his business he chopped a hole where he guessed the locking bar was and when he had broken through he put a hand inside and pushed the bar up and out of its brackets so that sir simon and his archers could heave the gates open sir simon left two men to guard the gate ordering them to keep every other plunderer out of the property then led the rest into the yard the first things he saw were two boats tied at the rivers quay they were not large ships but all hulls were valuable and he ordered four of his archers to go aboard tell anyone who comes that theyre mine you understand mine he had a choice now storerooms or house and a stable he told two menatarms to find the stable and stand guard on whatever horses were there then he kicked in the house door and led his six remaining men into the kitchen two women screamed he ignored them they were old ugly servants and he was after richer things a door led from the back of the kitchen and he pointed one of his archers towards it then holding his sword ahead of him he went through a small dark hall into a front room a tapestry showing bacchus the god of wine hung on one wall and sir simon had an idea that valuables were sometimes hidden behind such wallcoverings so he hacked at it with his blade then hauled it down from its hooks but there was only a plaster wall behind he kicked the chairs then saw a chest that had a huge dark padlock get it open he ordered two of his archers and whatevers inside is mine then ignoring two books which were of no use to man or beast he went back into the hall and ran up a flight of dark wooden stairs sir simon found a door leading to a room at the front of the house it was bolted and a woman screamed from the other side when he tried to force the door he stood back and used the heel of his boot smashing the bolt on the far side and slamming the door back on its hinges then he stalked inside his old sword glittering in the dawns wan light and he saw a blackhaired woman sir simon considered himself a practical man his father quite sensibly had not wanted his son to waste time on education though sir simon had learned to read and could at a pinch write a letter he liked useful things hounds and weapons horses and armour and he despised the fashionable cult of gentility his mother was a great one for troubadours and was forever listening to songs of knights so gentle that sir simon reckoned they would not have lasted two minutes in a tourneys melee the songs and poems celebrated love as though it was some rare thing that gave a life enchantment but sir simon did not need poets to define love which to him was tumbling a peasant girl in a harvest field or thrusting at some alereeking whore in a tavern but when he saw the blackhaired woman he suddenly understood what the troubadours had been celebrating it did not matter that the woman was shaking with fear or that her hair was wildly awry or that her face was streaked with tears sir simon recognized beauty and it struck him like an arrow it took his breath away so this then was love it was the realization that he could never be happy until this woman was his and that was convenient for she was an enemy the town was being sacked and sir simon clad in mail and fury had found her first get out he snarled at the servants in the room get out the servants fled in tears and sir simon booted the broken door shut then advanced on the woman who crouched beside her sons bed with the boy in her arms who are you sir simon asked in french the woman tried to sound brave i am the countess of armorica she said and you monsieur sir simon was tempted to award himself a peerage to impress jeanette but he was too slowwitted and so heard himself uttering his proper name he was slowly becoming aware that the room betrayed wealth the bed hangings were thickly embroidered the candlesticks were of heavy silver and the walls either side of the stone hearth were expensively panelled in beautifully carved wood he pushed the smaller bed against the door reckoning that should ensure some privacy then went to warm himself at the fire he tipped more seacoal onto the small flames and held his chilled gloves close to the heat this is your house madame it is not your husbands i am a widow jeanette said a wealthy widow sir simon almost crossed himself out of gratitude the widows he had met in england had been rouged hags but this one this one was different this one was a woman worthy of a tournaments champion and seemed rich enough to save him from the ignominy of losing his estate and knightly rank she might even have enough cash to buy a baronage maybe an earldom he turned from the fire and smiled at her are those your boats at the quay yes monsieur by the rules of war madame they are now mine everything here is mine jeanette frowned at that what rules the law of the sword madame but i think you are fortunate i shall offer you my protection jeanette sat on the edge of her curtained bed clutching charles the rules of chivalry my lord she said ensure my protection she flinched as a woman screamed in a nearby house chivalry sir simon asked chivairy i have heard it mentioned in songs madame but this is a war our task is to punish the followers of charles of blois for rebelling against their lawful lord punishment and chivalry do not mix he frowned at her youre the blackbird he said suddenly recognizing her in the light of the revived fire the blackbird jeanette did not understand you fought us from the walls you scratched my arm sir simon did not sound angry but astonished he had expected to be furious when he met the blackbird but her reality was too overpowering for rage he grinned you closed your eyes when you shot the crossbow thats why you missed i did not miss jeanette said indignantly a scratch sir simon said showing her the rent in his mail sleeve but why madame do you fight for the false duke my husband she said stiffly was nephew to duke charles sweet god sir simon thought sweet god a prize indeed he bowed to her so your son he said nodding at charles who was peering anxiously from his mothers arms is the present count he is jeanette confirmed a fine boy sir simon forced himself to the flattery in truth he thought charles was a puddingfaced nuisance whose presence inhibited him from a natural urge to thrust the blackbird onto her back and thus show her the realities of war but he was acutely aware that this widow was an aristocrat a beauty and related to charles of blois who was nephew to the king of france this woman meant riches and sir simons present necessity was to make her see that her best interest lay in sharing his ambitions a fine boy madame he went on who needs a father jeanette just stared at him sir simon had a blunt face it was bulbousnosed firmchinned and showed not the slightest sign of intelligence or wit he had confidence though enough to have persuaded himself that she would marry him did he really mean that she gaped then gave a startled cry as angry shouting erupted beneath her window some archers were trying to get past the men guarding the gate sir simon pushed open the window this place is mine he snarled in english go find your own chickens to pluck he turned back to jeanette you see madame how i protect you so there is chivalry in war there is opportunity in war madame you are wealthy you are a widow you need a man she gazed at him with disturbingly large eyes hardly daring to believe his temerity why she asked simply why sir simon was astonished by the question he gestured at the window listen to the screams woman what do you think happens to women when a town falls but you said you would protect me she pointed out so i will he was getting lost in this conversation the woman he thought though beautiful was remarkably stupid i will protect you he said and you will look after me how sir simon sighed you have money jeanette shrugged there is a little downstairs my lord hidden in the kitchen sir simon frowned angrily did she think he was a fool that he would take that bait and go downstairs leaving her to climb out of the window i know one thing about money madame he said and that is that you never hide it where the servants can find it you hide it in the private rooms in a bedchamber he pulled open a chest and emptied its linens onto the floor but there was nothing hidden there and then on an inspiration he began rapping the wooden panelling he had heard that such panels often concealed a hiding place and he was rewarded almost instantly by a satisfyingly hollow sound no monsieur jeanette said sir simon ignored her drawing his sword and hacking at the limewood panels that splintered and pulled away from their beams he sheathed the blade and tugged with his gloved hands at the shattered wood no jeanette wailed sir simon stared money was concealed behind the panelling a whole barrel of coins but that was not the prize the prize was a suit of armour and a set of weapons such as sir simon had only ever dreamed of a shining suit of plate armour each piece chased with subtle engravings and inlaid with gold italian work and the sword when he drew it from the scabbard it was like holding excalibur itself there was a blue sheen to the blade which was not nearly as heavy as his own sword but felt miraculously balanced a blade from the famous swordsmiths of poitiers perhaps or even better spanish they belonged to my husband jeanette appealed to him and it is all i have of his they must go to charles sir simon ignored her he traced his gloved finger down the gold inlay on the breastplate that piece alone was worth an estate they are all he has of his fathers jeanette pleaded sir simon unbuckled his sword belt and let the old weapon drop to the floor then fastened the count of armoricas sword about his waist he turned and stared at jeanette marvelling at her smooth unscarred face these were the spoils of war that he had dreamed about and had begun to fear would never come his way a barrel of cash a suit of armour fit for a king a blade made for a champion and a woman that would be the envy of england the armour is mine he said as is the sword no monsieur please what will you do buy them from me if i must jeanette said nodding at the barrel that too is mine madame sir simon said and to prove it he strode to the door unblocked it and shouted for two of his archers to come up the stairs he gestured at the barrel and the suit of armour take them down he said and keep them safe and dont think i havent counted the cash because i have now go jeanette watched the theft she wanted to weep for pity but forced herself to stay calm if you steal everything i own she said to sir simon how can i buy the armour back sir simon shoved the boys bed against the door again then favoured her with a smile there is something you can use to buy the armour my dear he said winningly you have what all women have you can use that jeanette closed her eyes for a few heartbeats are all the gentlemen of england like you she asked few are so skilled in arms sir simon said proudly he was about to tell her of his tournament triumphs sure that she would be impressed but she interrupted him i meant she said icily to discover whether the knights of england are all thieves poltroons and bullies sir simon was genuinely puzzled by the insult the woman simply did not seem to appreciate her good fortune a failing he could only ascribe to innate stupidity you forget madame he explained that the winners of war get the prizes i am your prize she was worse than stupid sir simon thought but who wanted cleverness in a woman madame he said i am your protector if i leave you if i take away my protection then there will be a line of men on the stairs waiting to plough you now do you understand i think she said coldly that the earl of northampton will offer me better protection sweet christ sir simon thought but the bitch was obtuse it was pointless trying to reason with her for she was too dull to understand so he must force the breach he crossed the room fast snatched charles from her arms and threw the boy onto the smaller bed jeanette cried out and tried to hit him but sir simon caught her arm and slapped her face with his gloved hand and when she went immobile with pain and astonishment he tore her cloaks cords apart and then with his big hands ripped the shift down the front of her body she screamed and tried to clutch her hands over her nakedness but sir simon forced her arms apart and stared in astonishment flawless no jeanette wept sir simon shoved her hard back onto the bed you want your son to inherit your traitorous husbands armour he asked or his sword then madame you had better be kind to their new owner i am prepared to be kind to you he unbuckled the sword dropped it on the floor then hitched up his mail coat and fumbled with the strings of his hose no jeanette wailed and tried to scramble off the bed but sir simon caught hold of her shift and yanked the linen so that it came down to her waist the boy was screaming and sir simon was fumbling with his rusted gauntlets and jeanette felt the devil had come into her house she tried to cover her nakedness but the englishman slapped her face again then once more hauled up his mail coat outside the window the cracked bell of the virgins church was at last silent for the english had come jeanette had a suitor and the town wept thomass first thought after opening the gate was not plunder but somewhere to wash the river muck off his legs which he did with a barrel of ale in the first tavern he encountered the tavernkeeper was a big bald man who stupidly attacked the english archers with a club so jake tripped him with his bowstave then slit his belly silly bastard jake said i wasnt going to hurt him much the dead mans boots fitted thomas which was a welcome surprize for very few did and once they had found his cache of coins they went in search of other amusement the earl of northampton was spurring his horse up and down the main street shouting at wildeyed men not to set the town alight he wanted to keep la rochederrien as a fortress and it was less useful to him as a heap of ashes not everyone plundered some of the older men even a few of the younger were disgusted by the whole business and attempted to curb the wilder excesses but they were wildly outnumbered by men who saw nothing but opportunity in the fallen town father hobbe an english priest who had a fondness for will skeats men tried to persuade thomas and his group to guard a church but they had other pleasures in mind dont spoil your soul tom father hobbe said in a reminder that thomas like all the men had said mass the day before but thomas reckoned his soul was going to be spoiled anyway so it might as well happen sooner than later he was looking for a girl any girl really for most of wills men had a woman in camp thomas had been living with a sweet little breton but she had caught a fever just before the beginning of the winter campaign and father hobbe had said a funeral mass for her thomas had watched as the girls unshrouded body had thumped into the shallow grave and he had thought of the graves at hookton and of the promise he had made to his dying father but then he had pushed the promise away he was young and had no appetite for burdens on his conscience la rochederrien now crouched under the english fury men tore down thatch and wrecked furniture in their search for money any townsman who tried to protect his women was killed while any woman who tried to protect herself was beaten into submission some folk had escaped the sack by crossing the bridge but the small garrison of the barbican fled from the inevitable attack and now the earls menatarms manned the small tower and that meant la rochederrien was sealed to its fate some women took refuge in the churches and the lucky ones found protectors there but most were not lucky thomas jake and sam finally discovered an unplundered house that belonged to a tanner a stinking fellow with an ugly wife and three small children sam whose innocent face made strangers trust him on sight held his knife at the throat of the youngest child and the tanner suddenly remembered where he had hidden his cash thomas had watched sam fearing he really would slit the boys throat for sam despite his ruddy cheeks and cheerful eyes was as evil as any man in will skeats band jake was not much better though thomas counted both as friends the mans as poor as we are jake said in wonderment as he raked through the tanners coins he pushed a third of the pile towards thomas you want his wife jake offered generously christ no shes crosseyed like you is she thomas left jake and sam to their games and went to find a tavern where there would be food drink and warmth he reckoned any girl worth pursuing had been caught already so he unstrung his bow pushed past a group of men tearing the contents from a parked wagon and found an inn where a motherly widow had sensibly protected both her property and her daughters by welcoming the first menatarms showering them with free food and ale then scolding them for dirtying her floor with their muddy feet she was shouting at them now though few understood what she said and one of the men growled at thomas that she and her daughters were to be left alone thomas held up his hands to show he meant no harm then took a plate of bread eggs and cheese now pay her one of the menatarms growled and thomas dutifully put the tanners few coins on the counter hes a goodlooking one the widow said to her daughters who giggled thomas turned and pretended to inspect the daughters they are the most beautiful girls in brittany he said to the widow in french because they take after you madame that compliment though patently untrue raised squeals of laughter beyond the tavern were screams and tears but inside it was warm and friendly thomas ate the food hungrily then tried to hide himself in a window bay when father hobbe came bustling in from the street the priest saw thomas anyway im still looking for men to guard the churches thomas im going to get drunk father thomas said happily so goddamn drunk that one of those two girls will look attractive he jerked his head at the widows daughters father hobbe inspected them critically then sighed youll kill yourself if you drink that much thomas he sat at the table waved at the girls and pointed at thomass pot ill have a drink with you the priest said what about the churches everyone will be drunk soon enough father hobbe said and the horror will end it always does ale and wine god knows are great causes of sin but they make it shortlived gods bones but its cold out there he smiled at thomas so hows your black soul tom thomas contemplated the priest he liked father hobbe who was small and wiry with a mass of untamed black hair about a cheerful face that was thickscarred from a childhood pox he was low born the son of a sussex wheelwright and like any country lad he could draw a bow with the best of them he sometimes accompanied skeats men on their forays into duke charless country and he willingly joined the archers when they dismounted to form a battleline church law forbade a priest from wielding an edged weapon but father hobbe always claimed he used blunt arrows though they seemed to pierce enemy mail as efficiently as any other father hobbe in short was a good man whose only fault was an excessive interest in thomass soul my soul thomas said is soluble in ale now theres a good word father hobbe said soluble eh he picked up the big black bow and prodded the silver badge with a dirty finger youve discovered anything about that no or who stole the lance no do you not care any more thomas leaned back in the chair and stretched his long legs im doing a good job of work father were winning this war and this time next year who knows we might be giving the king of france a bloody nose father hobbe nodded agreement though his face suggested thomass words were irrelevant he traced his finger through a puddle of ale on the table top you made a promise to your father thomas and you made it in a church isnt that what you told me a solemn promise thomas that you would retrieve the lance god listens to such vows thomas smiled outside this tavern father theres so much rape and murder and theft going on that all the quills in heaven cant keep up with the list of sins and you worry about me yes thomas i do some souls are better than others i must look after them all but if you have a prize ram in the flock then you do well to guard it thomas sighed one day father ill find the man who stole that goddamn lance and ill ram it up his arse until it tickles the hollow of his skull one day will that do father hobbe smiled beatifically itll do thomas but for now theres a small church that could do with an extra man by the door its full of women some of them are so beautiful that your heart will break just to gaze at them you can get drunk afterwards are the women really beautiful what do you think thomas most of them look like bats and smell like goats but they still need protection so thomas helped guard a church and afterwards when the army was so drunk it could do no more damage he went back to the widows tavern where he drank himself into oblivion he had taken a town he had served his lord well and he was content thomas was woken by a kick a pause then a second kick and a cup of cold water in his face jesus thats me will skeat said father hobbe told me youd be here oh jesus thomas said again his head was sore his belly sour and he felt sick he blinked feebly at the daylight then frowned at skeat its you it must be grand to be so clever skeat said he grinned at thomas who was naked in the straw of the tavern stables that he was sharing with one of the widows daughters you must have been drunk as a lord to sheathe your sword in that skeat added looking at the girl who was pulling a blanket over herself i was drunk thomas groaned still am he staggered to his feet and put on his shirt the earl wants to see you skeat said with amusement me thomas looked alarmed why perhaps he wants you to marry his daughter skeat said christs bones tom but look at the state of you thomas pulled on his boots and mail coat then retrieved his hose from the baggage camp and donned a cloth jacket over his mail the jacket bore the earl of northamptons badge of three green and red stars being pounced on by a trio of lions he splashed water on his face then scraped at his stubble with a sharp knife grow a beard lad skeat said it saves trouble why does billy want to see me thomas asked using the earls nickname after what happened in the town yesterday skeat suggested thoughtfully he reckons hes got to hang someone as an example so he asked me if i had any useless bastards i wanted to be rid of and i thought of you the way i feel thomas said he might as well hang me he retched drily then gulped down some water he and will skeat went back into the town to find the earl of northampton sitting in state the building where his banner hung was supposed to be a guildhall though it was probably smaller than the guardroom in the earls own castle but the earl was sitting at one end as a succession of petitioners pleaded for justice they were complaining about being robbed which was pointless considering they had refused to surrender the town but the earl listened politely enough then a lawyer a weaselsnouted fellow called belas bowed to the earl and declaimed a long moan about the treatment offered to the countess of armorica thomas had been letting the words slide past him but the insistence in belass voice made him take notice if your lordship belas said smirking at the earl had not intervened then the countess would have been raped by sir simon jekyll sir simon stood to one side of the hall that is a lie he protested in french the earl sighed so why were your breeches round your ankles when i came into the house sir simon reddened as the men in the hall laughed thomas had to translate for will skeat who nodded for he had already heard the tale the bastard was about to roger some titled widow he explained to thomas when the earl came in heard her scream see and hed seen a coat of arms on the house the aristocracy look after each other the lawyer now laid a long list of charges against sir simon it seemed he was claiming the widow and her son as prisoners who must be held for ransom he had also stolen the widows two ships her husbands armour his sword and all the countesss money belas made the complaints indignantly then bowed to the earl you have a reputation as ajust man my lord he said obsequiously and i place the widows fate in your hands the earl of northampton looked surprised to be told his reputation for fairness what is it you want he asked belas preened the return of the stolen items my lord and the protection of the king of england for a widow and her noble son the earl drummed his fingers on the arm of the chair then frowned at sir simon you cant ransom a threeyearold he said hes a count sir simon protested a boy of rank the earl sighed sir simon he had come to realize had a mind as simple as a bullock seeking food he could see no point of view but his own and was singleminded about pursuing his appetites that perhaps was why he was such a formidable soldier but he was still a fool we do not hold threeyearold children to ransom the earl said firmly and we dont hold women as prisoners not unless there is an advantage which outweighs the courtesy and i see no advantage here the earl turned to the clerks behind his chair who did armorica support charles of blois my lord one of the clerks a tall breton cleric answered is it a rich fief very small my lord the clerk whose nose was running spoke from memory there is a holding in finisterre which is already in our hands some houses in guingamp i believe but nothing else there the earl said turning back to sir simon what advantages will we make from a penniless threeyearold not penniless sir simon protested i took a rich armour there which the boys father doubtless took in battle and the house is wealthy sir simon was getting angry there are ships storehouses stables the house the clerk sounded bored belonged to the counts fatherinlaw a dealer in wine i believe the earl raised a quizzical eyebrow at sir simon who was shaking his head at the clerks obstinacy the boy my lord sir simon responded with an elaborate courtesy which bordered on insolence is kin to charles of blois but being penniless the earl said i doubt he provokes fondness more of a burden wouldnt you think besides what would you have me do make the child give fealty to the real duke of brittany the real duke sir simon is a fiveyearold child in london itll be a nursery farce a threeyearold bobbing down to a fiveyearold do their wet nurses attend them shall we feast on milk and pennycakes after or maybe we can enjoy a game of hunt the slipper when the ceremony is over the countess fought us from the walls sir simon attempted a last protest do not dispute me the earl shouted thumping the arm of his chair you forget that i am the kings deputy and have his powers the earl leaned back taut with anger and sir simon swallowed his own fury but could not resist muttering that the countess had used a crossbow against the english is she the blackbird thomas asked skeat the countess aye thats what they say shes a beauty after what i found you prodding this morning skeat said how can you tell the earl gave an irritated glance at skeat and thomas then looked back to sir simon if the countess did fight us from the walls he said then i admire her spirit as for the other matters he paused and sighed belas looked expectant and sir simon wary the two ships the earl decreed are prizes and they will be sold in england or else taken into royal service and you sir simon will be awarded onethird of their value that ruling was according to the law the king would take a third the earl another and the last portion went to the man who had captured the prize as to the sword and armour the earl paused again he had rescued jeanette from rape and he had liked her and he had seen the anguish on her face and listened to her impassioned plea that she owned nothing that had belonged to her husband except the precious armour and the beautiful sword but such things by their very nature were the legitimate plunder of war the armour and weapons and horses are yours sir simon the earl said regretting the judgement but knowing it was fair as to the child i decree he is under the protection of the crown of england and when he is of age he can decide his own fealty he glanced at the clerks to make sure they were noting down his decisions you tell me you wish to billet yourself in the widows house he asked sir simon i took it sir simon said curtly and stripped it bare i hear the earl observed icily the countess claims you stole money from her she lies sir simon looked indignant lies my lord lies the earl doubted it but he could hardly accuse a gentleman of perjury without provoking a duel and though william bohun feared no man except his king he did not want to fight over so petty a matter he let it drop however he went on i did promise the lady protection against harassment he stared at sir simon as he spoke then looked at will skeat and changed to english youd like to keep your men together will i would my lord then youll have the widows house and she is to be treated honourably you hear me honourably tell your men that will skeat nodded ill cut their ears off if they touch her my lord not their ears will slice something more suitable away sir simon will show you the house and you sir simon the earl spoke french again will find a bed elsewhere sir simon opened his mouth to protest but one look from the earl quietened him another petitioner came forward wanting redress for a cellar full of wine that had been stolen but the earl diverted him to a clerk who would record the mans complaints on a parchment which the earl doubted he would ever find time to read then he beckoned to thomas i have to thank you thomas of hookton thank me my lord the earl smiled you found a way into the town when everything else wed tried had failed thomas reddened it was a pleasure my lord you can claim a reward of me the earl said its customary thomas shrugged im happy my lord then youre a lucky man thomas but i shall remember the debt and thank you will will skeat grinned if this lump of a daft fool dont want a reward my lord ill take it the earl liked that my reward to you will is to leave you here im giving you a whole new stretch of countryside to lay waste gods teeth youll soon be richer than me he stood sir simon will guide you to your quarters sir simon might have bridled at the curt order to be a mere guide but surprisingly he obeyed without showing any resentment perhaps because he wanted another chance to meet jeanette and so at midday he led will skeat and his men through the streets to the big house beside the river sir simon had put on his new armour and wore it without any surcoat so that the polished plate and gold embossment shone bright in the feeble winter sun he ducked his helmeted head under the yards archway and immediately jeanette came running from the kitchen door which lay just to the gates left get out she shouted in french get out thomas riding close behind sir simon stared at her she was indeed the blackbird and she was as beautiful at close range as she had been when he had glimpsed her on the walls get out all of you she stood hands on her hips bareheaded shouting sir simon pushed up the pigsnout visor of the helmet this house is commandeered my lady he said happily the earl ordered it the earl promised i would be left alone jeanette protested hotly then his lordship has changed his mind sir simon said she spat at him you have already stolen everything else of mine now you would take the house too yes madame sir simon said and he spurred the horse forward so that it crowded her yes madame he said again then wrenched the reins so that the horse twisted and thumped into jeanette throwing her onto the ground ill take your house sir simon said and anything else i want madame the watching archers cheered at the sight of jeanettes long bare legs she snatched her skirts down and tried to stand but sir simon edged his horse forward to force her into an undignified scramble across the yard let the lass up will skeat shouted angrily she and i are old friends master skeat sir simon answered still threatening jeanette with the horses heavy hoofs i said let her up and leave her be will snarled sir simon offended at being ordered by a commoner and in front of archers turned angrily but there was a competence about will skeat that gave the knight pause skeat was twice sir simons age and all those years had been spent in fighting and sir simon retained just enough sense not to make a confrontation the house is yours master skeat he said condescendingly but look after its mistress i have plans for her he backed the horse from jeanette who was in tears of shame then spurred out of the yard jeanette did not understand english but she recognized that will skeat had intervened on her behalf and so she stood and appealed to him he has stolen everything from me she said pointing at the retreating horseman everything you know what the lass is saying tom skeat asked she doesnt like sir simon thomas said laconically he was leaning on his saddle pommel watching jeanette calm the girl down for christs sake skeat pleaded then turned in his saddle jake make sure theres water and hay for horses peter kill two of them heifers so we can sup before the light goes rest of you stop gawping at the lass and get yourselves settled thief jeanette called after sir simon then turned on thomas who are you my name is thomas madame he slid out of the saddle and threw his reins to sam the earl has ordered us to live here thomas went on and to protect you protect me jeanette blazed at him you are all thieves how can you protect me there is a place in hell for thieves like you and it is just like england you are thieves every one of you now go go were not going thomas said flatly how can you stay here jeanette demanded i am a widow it is not proper to have you here were here madame thomas said and you and us will have to make the best of it well not encroach just show me where your private rooms are and ill make sure no man trespasses you make sure ha jeanette turned away then immediately turned back you want me to show you my rooms yes so you know where my valuable properties are is that it you want me to show you where you can thieve from me why dont i just give you everything thomas smiled i thought you said sir simon had already stolen everything he has taken everything everything he is no gentleman he is a pig he is jeanette paused wanting to contrive a crushing insult he is english jeanette spat at thomass feet and pulled open the kitchen door you see this door englishman everything beyond this door is private everything she went inside slammed the door then immediately opened it again and the duke is coming the proper duke not your snivelling puppet child so you will all die good the door slammed again will skeat chuckled she dont like you either tom what was the lass saying that were all going to die aye thats true enough but in our beds by gods grace and she says were not to go past that door plenty of room out here skeat said placidly watching as one of his men swung an axe to kill a heifer the blood flowed over the yard attracting a rush of dogs to lap at it while two archers began butchering the still twitching animal listen skeat had climbed a mounting block beside the stables and now shouted at all his men the earl has given orders that the lass who was spitting at tom is not to be molested you understand that you whoresons you keep your britches laced up when shes around and if you dont ill geld you you treat her proper and you dont go through that door youve had your frolic so now you can knuckle down to a proper bit of soldiering the earl of northampton left after a week taking most of his army back to the fortresses in finisterre which was the heartland of duke johns supporters he left richard totesham as commander of the new garrison but he also left sir simon jekyll as toteshams deputy the earl doesnt want the bastard will skeat told thomass o hes foisted him on us as skeat and totesham were both independent captains there could have been jealousy between them but the two men respected each other and while totesham and his men stayed in la rochederrien and strengthened its defences skeat rode out into the country to punish the folk who paid their rents and owed their allegiance to duke charles the hellequin were thus released to be a curse on northern brittany it was a simple business to ruin a land the houses and barns might be made of stone but their roofs would burn the livestock was captured and if there were too many beasts to herd home then the animals were slaughtered and their carcasses tipped down wells to poison the water skeats men burned what would burn broke what would break and stole what could be sold they killed raped and plundered fear of them drove men away from their farms leaving the land desolate they were the devils horsemen and they did king edwards will by harrowing his enemys land they wrecked village after village kervec and lanvellec saint laurent and les sept saints tonquedec and berhet and a score of other places whose names they never learned it was christmas time and back home the yule logs were being dragged across frosthardened fields to highbeamed halls where troubadours sang of arthur and his knights of chivalrous warriors who allied pity to strength but in brittany the hellequin fought the real war soldiers were not paragons they were scarred vicious men who took delight in destruction they hurled burning torches onto thatch and tore down what had taken generations to build places too small to have names died and only the farms in the wide peninsula between the two rivers north of la rochederrien were spared because they were needed to feed the garrison some of the serfs who were torn from their land were put to work heightening la rochederriens walls clearing a wider killing ground in front of the ramparts and making new barriers at the rivers edge it was a winter of utter misery for the bretons cold rains whipped from the wild atlantic and the english scoured the farmlands once in a while there would be some resistance a brave man would shoot a crossbow from a woods edge but skeats men were experts in trapping and killing such enemies a dozen archers would dismount and stalk the enemy from the front while a score of others galloped about his rear and in a short while there would be a scream and another crossbow was added to the plunder the crossbows owner would be stripped mutilated and hanged from a tree as a warning to other men to leave the hellequin alone and the lessons worked for such ambushes became fewer it was the wrecking time and skeats men became rich there were days of misery days of slogging through cold rain with chapped hands and wet clothes and thomas always hated it when his men fetched the duty of leading the spare horses and then driving the captured livestock home geese were easy their necks were wrung and the dead birds hung from the saddles but cows were slow goats wayward sheep stupid and pigs obstinate there were however enough farmbred boys in the ranks to ensure that the animals reached la rochederrien safely once there they were taken to a small square that had become a slaughteryard and stank of blood will skeat also sent cartloads of plunder back to the town and most of that was shipped home to england it was usually humble stuff pots knives ploughblades harrowspikes stools pails spindles anything that could be sold until it was said that there was not a house in southern england which did not possess at least one object plundered from brittany in england they sang of arthur and lancelot of gawain and perceval but in brittany the hellequin were loose and thomas was a happy man jeanette was loath to admit it but the presence of will skeats men was an advantage to her so long as they were in the courtyard she felt safe in the house and she began to dread the long periods they spent away from the town for it was then that sir simon jekyll would haunt her she had begun to think of him as the devil a stupid devil to be sure but still a remorseless unfeeling but who had convinced himself jeanette must wish nothing so much as to be his wife at times he would force himself to a clumsy courtesy though usually he was bumptious and crude and always he stared at her like a dog gazing at a haunch of beef he took mass in the church of saint renan so he could woo her and it seemed to jeanette she could not walk in the town without meeting him once encountering jeanette in the alley beside the church of the virgin he crowded her against the wall and slid his strong fingers up to her breasts i think madame you and i are suited he told her in all earnestness you need a wife with money she told him for she had learned from others in the town the state of sir simons finances i have your money he pointed out and that has settled half my debts and the prize money from the ships will pay much of the rest but it is not your money i want sweet one but you jeanette tried to wrench away but he had her trapped against the wall you need a protector my dear he said and kissed her tenderly on the forehead he had a curiously full mouth biglipped and always wet as though his tongue was too large and the kiss was wet and stank of stale wine he pushed a hand down her belly and she struggled harder but he just pressed his body against hers and took hold of her hair beneath her cap you would like berkshire my dear i would rather live in hell he fumbled at the laces of her bodice and jeanette vainly tried to push him away but she was only saved when a troop of men rode into the alley and their leader called a greeting to sir simon who had to turn away to respond and that allowed jeanette to wrench herself free she left her cap in his grasp as she ran home where she barred the doors then sat weeping and angry and helpless she hated him she hated all the english yet as the weeks passed she watched the townsfolk come to approve of their occupiers who spent good money in la rochederrien english silver was dependable unlike the french which was debased with lead or tin the presence of the english had cut the town off from its usual trade with rennes and guingamp but the shipowners were now free to trade with both gascony and england and so their profits rose local ships were chartered to import arrows for the english troops and some of the shipmasters brought back bales of english wool that they resold in other breton ports that were still loyal to duke charles few folk were willing to travel far from la rochedernen by land for they needed to secure a pass from richard totesham the commander of the garrison and though the scrap of parchment protected them from the hellequin it was no defence against the outlaws who lived in the farms emptied by skeats men but boats from la rochederrien and treguler could still sail east to paimpol or west to lannion and so trade with englands enemies that was how letters were sent out of la rochederrien and jeanette wrote almost weekly to duke charles with news of the changes the english were making to the towns defences she never received a reply but she persuaded herself that her letters were useful la rochederrien prospered but jeanette suffered her fathers business still existed but the profits mysteriously vanished the larger ships had always sailed from the quays of treguler which lay an hour upriver and though jeanette sent them to gascony to fetch wine for the english market they never returned they had either been taken by french ships or more likely their captains had gone into business for themselves the family farms lay south of la rochederrien in the countryside laid waste by will skeats men and so those rents disappeared plabennec her husbands estate was in englishheld finisterre and jeanette had not seen a penny from that land in three years so by the early weeks of she was desperate and thus summoned the lawyer belas to the house belas took a perverse pleasure in telling her how she had ignored his advice and how she should never have equipped the two boats for war jeanette suffered his pomposity then asked him to draw up a petition of redress which she could send to the english court the petition begged for the rents of plabennec which the invaders had been taking for themselves it irked jeanette that she must plead for money from king edward iii of england but what choice did she have sir simon jekyll had impoverished her belas sat at her table and made notes on a scrap of parchment how many mills at plabennec he asked there were two two he said noting the figure you do know he added cautiously that the duke has made a claim for those rents the duke jeanette asked in astonishment for plabennec duke charles claims it is his fief belas said it might be but my son is the count the duke considers himself the boys guardian belas observed how do you know these things jeanette asked belas shrugged i have had correspondence from the dukes men of business in paris what correspondence jeanette demanded sharply about another matter belas said dismissively another matter entirely plabennecs rents were collected quarterly i assume jeanette watched the lawyer suspiciously why would the dukes men of business mention plabennec to you they asked if i knew the family naturally i revealed nothing he was lying jeanette thought she owed belas money indeed she was in debt to half of la rochederriens tradesmen doubtless belas thought his bill was unlikely to be paid by her and so he was looking to duke charles for eventual settlement monsieur belas she said coldly you will tell me exactly what you have been telling the duke and why belas shrugged i have nothing to tell how is your wife jeanette asked sweetly her aches are passing as winter ends thank god she is well madame then she will not be well jeanette said tartly when she learns what you do with your clerks daughter how old is she belas twelve madame dont madame me jeanette thumped the table almost upsetting the flask of ink so what has passed between you and the dukes men of business belas sighed he put the cap on the ink flask laid down the quill and rubbed his thin cheeks i have always he said looked after the legal matters of this family it is my duty madame and sometimes i must do things that i would rather not but such things are also a part of my duty he half smiled you are in debt madame you could rescue your finances easily enough by marrying a man of substance but you seem reluctant to follow that course and so i see nothing but ruin in your future ruin you wish some advice sell this house and you will have money enough to live for two or three years and in that time the duke will surely drive the english from brittany and you and your son will be restored to plabennec jeanette flinched you think the devils will be defeated that easily she heard hoofs in the street and saw that skeats men were returning to her courtyard they were laughing as they rode they did not look like men who would be defeated soon indeed she feared they were unbeatable for they had a blithe confidence that galled her i think madame belas said that you must make up your mind what you are are you louis halevys daughter or henri cheniers widow are you a merchant or an aristocrat if you are a merchant madame then marry here and be content if you are an aristocrat then raise what money you can and go to the duke and find yourself a new husband with a title jeanette considered the advice impertinent but did not bridle how much would we make on this house she asked instead i shall enquire madame belas said he knew the answer already and knew that jeanette would hate it for a house in a town occupied by an enemy would fetch only a fraction of its proper value so now was not the time to give jeanette that news better the lawyer thought to wait until she was truly desperate then he could buy the house and its ruined farms for a pittance is there a bridge across the stream at plabennec he asked drawing the parchment towards him forget the petition jeanette said if you wish madame i shall think about your advice belas you will not regret it he said earnestly she was lost he thought lost and defeated he would take her house and farms the duke would claim plabennec and she would be left with nothing which was what she deserved for she was a stubborn and proud creature who had risen far above her proper station i am always belas said humbly at your ladyships service from adversity he thought a clever man could always profit and jeanette was ripe for plucking put a cat to guard the sheep and the wolves would eat well jeanette did not know what to do she was loath to sell the house for she feared it would fetch a low price but nor did she know how else she could raise money would duke charles welcome her he had never shown any sign of it not since he had opposed her marriage to his nephew but perhaps he had softened since then perhaps he would protect her she decided she would pray for guidance so she wrapped a shawl around her shoulders crossed the yard ignoring the newly returned soldiers and went into saint renans church there was a statue of the virgin there sadly shorn of her gilded halo which had been ripped away by the english and jeanette often prayed to the image of christs mother whom she believed had a special care for all women in trouble she thought at first that the dimly lit church was empty then she saw an english bow propped against a pillar and an archer kneeling at the altar it was the goodlooking man the one who wore his hair in a long pigtail bound with boweord it was she thought an irritating sign of vanity most of the english wore their hair cropped but a few grew it extravagantly long and they were the ones who seemed most flamboyantly confident she wished he would leave the church then she was intrigued by his abandoned bow and so she picked it up and was astonished by its weight the string hung loose and she wondered how much strength would be needed to bend the bow and hook the strings free loop on the empty horn tip she pressed one end of the bow on the stone floor trying to bend it and just then an arrow span across the flagstones to lodge against her foot if you can string the bow thomas said still on his knees at the altar you can have a free shot jeanette was too proud to be seen to fail and too angry not to try though she attempted to disguise her effort which barely flexed the black yew stave she kicked the arrow away my husband was killed by one of these bows she said bitterly ive often wondered thomas said why you bretons or the french dont learn to shoot them start your son at seven or eight years madame and in ten years hell be lethal hell fight as a knight like his father thomas laughed we kill knights they havent made an armour strong enough to resist an english arrow jeanette shuddered what are you praying for englishman she asked forgiveness thomas smiled i am giving thanks madame for the fact that we rode six days in enemy country and did not lose one man he climbed from his knees and pointed to a pretty silver box that sat on the altar it was a reliquary and had a small crystal window that was rimmed with drops of coloured glass thomas had peered through the window and seen nothing more than a small black lump about the size of a mans thumb what is it he asked the tongue of saint renan jeanette said defiantly it was stolen when you came to our town but god was good and the thief died next day and the relic was recovered god is indeed good thomas said drily and who was saint renan he was a great preacher she said who banished the nains and gorics from our farmlands they still live in the wild places but a prayer to saint renan will scare them away nains and gorics thomas asked they are spirits she said evil ones they once haunted the whole land and i pray daily to the saint that he will banish the hellequin as he drove out the nains you know what the hellequin are we are thomas said proudly she grimaced at his tone the hellequin she said icily are the dead who have no souls the dead who were so wicked in life that the devil loves them too much to punish them in hell and so he gives them his horses and releases them on the living she hefted his black bow and pointed to the silver plate tacked to its belly you even have the devils picture on your bow its a yale thomas said it is a devil she insisted and threw the bow at him thomas caught it and because he was too young to resist showing off casually strung it he made it appear effortless you pray to saint renan he said and i shall pray to saint guinefort we shall see which saint is the stronger guinefort ive not heard of her him thomas corrected her and he lived in the lyonnaise you pray to a french saint jeanette asked intrigued all the time thomas said touching the desiccated dogs paw that hung about his neck he did not tell jeanette anything more about the saint who had been a favourite of his fathers who in his better moments would laugh at the story guinefort had been a dog and so far as thomass father knew the only animal ever to be canonized the beast had saved a baby from a wolf then been martyred by his owner who thought the dog had eaten the baby when in truth he had hidden it beneath the cot pray to the blessed guinefort had been father ralphs reaction to every domestic crisis and thomas had adopted the saint as his own he sometimes wondered whether the saint was an efficient intercessor in heaven though perhaps guine forts whining and barking were as effective as the pleas of any other saint but thomas was sure that few other folk used the dog as their representative to god and perhaps that meant he received special protection father hobbe had been shocked to hear of a holy dog but thomas though he shared his fathers amusement now genuinely thought of the animal as his guardian jeanette wanted to know more about the blessed saint guinefort but she did not want to encourage an intimacy with any of skeats men and so she forgot her curiosity and made her voice cold again i have been wanting to see you she said to tell you that your men and their women must not use the yard as a latrine i see them from the window it is disgusting maybe you behave like that in england but this is brittany you can use the river thomas nodded but said nothing instead he carried his bow down the nave which had one of its long sides obscured by fishing nets hung up for mending he went to the churchs western end which was gloomily decorated by a painting of the doom the righteous were vanishing into the rafters while the condemned sinners were tumbling to a fiery hell cheered on by angels and saints thomas stopped in front of the painting have you ever noticed he said how the prettiest women are always falling down to hell and the ugly ones are going up to heaven jeanette almost smiled for she had often wondered about that same question but she bit her tongue and said nothing as thomas walked back up the nave beside a painting of christ walking on a sea that was grey and whitecrested like the ocean off brittany a shoal of mackerel were poking their heads from the water to watch the miracle what you must understand madame thomas said gazing up at the curious mackerel is that our men do not like being unwelcome you wont even let them use the kitchen why not its big enough and theyd be glad of a place to dry their boots after a wet nights riding why should i have you english in my kitchen so you can use that as a latrine as well thomas turned and looked at her you have no respect for us madame so why should we have respect for your house respect she mocked the word how can i respect you everything that is precious to me was stolen stolen by you by sir simon jekyll thomas said you or sir simon jeanette asked what is the difference thomas picked up the arrow and dropped it into his bag the difference madame is that once in a while i talk to god while sir simon thinks he is god i shall ask the lads to piss in the river but i doubt theyll want to please you much he smiled at her then was gone spring was greening the land giving a haze to the trees and filling the twisting laneways with bright flowers new green moss grew on thatch there was white stitchwort in the hedge rows and kingfishers whipped between the new yellow leaves of the riverside sallows skeats men were having to go further from la rochederrien to find new plunder and their long rides took them dangerously close to guingamp which was duke charless headquarters though the towns garrison rarely came out to challenge the raiders guingamp lay to the south while to the west was lannion a much smaller town with a far more belligerent garrison that was inspired by sir geoffrey de pont blanc a knight who had sworn an oath that he would lead skeats raiders back to lannion in chains he announced that the englishmen would be burned in lannions marketplace because they were heretics the devils men will skeat was not worried by such a threat i might lose a wink of sleep if the silly bastard had proper archers he told tom but he aint so he can blunder about as much as he likes is that his real name geoffrey of the white bridge daft bastard is he breton or french im told hes french have to teach him a lesson then wont we sir geoffrey proved an unwilling pupil will skeat dragged his coat closer and closer to lannion burning houses within sight of its walls in an effort to lure sir geoffrey out into an ambush of archers but sir geoffrey had seen what english arrows could do to mounted knights and so he refused to lead his men in a wild charge that would inevitably finish as a pile of screaming horses and bleeding men he stalked skeat instead looking for some place where he could ambush the englishmen but skeat was no more of a fool than sir geoffrey and for three weeks the two war bands circled and skirted each other sir geoffreys presence slowed skeat but did not stop the destruction the two forces clashed twice and both times sir geoffrey threw his crossbowmen forward on foot hoping they could finish off skeats archers but both times the longer arrows won and sir geoffrey drew off without forcing a fight he knew he must lose after the second inconclusive clash he even tried appealing to will skeats honour he rode forward all alone dressed in an armour as beautiful as sir simon jekylls though sir geoffreys helmet was an oldfashioned pot with perforated eye holes his surcoat and his horses trapper were dark blue on which white bridges were embroidered and the same device was blazoned on his shield he carried a bluepainted lance from which he had hung a white scarf to show he came in peace skeat rode forward to meet him with thomas as interpreter sir geoffrey lifted off his helmet and pushed a hand through his sweatflattened hair he was a young fellow goldenhaired and blueeyed with a broad goodhumoured face and thomas felt he would probably have liked the man if he had not been an enemy sir geoffrey smiled as the two englishmen curbed their horses it is a dull thing he said to shoot arrows at each others shadows i suggest you bring your menatarms into the fields centre and meet us there on equal terms thomas did not even bother to translate for he knew what skeats answer would be i have a better idea he said you bring your menatarms and well bring our archers sir geoffrey looked puzzled do you command he asked thomas he had thought that the older and grizzled skeat was the captain but skeat stayed silent he lost his tongue fighting the scots thomas saids o i speak for him then tell him i want an honourable fight sir geoffrey said spiritedly let me pit my horsemen against yours he smiled as if to suggest his suggestion was as reasonable as it was chivalrous as it was ridiculous thomas translated for skeat who twisted in his saddle and spat into the clover he says thomas said that our archers will meet your men a dozen of our archers against a score of your menatarms sir geoffrey shook his head sadly you have no sense of sport you english he said then put his leatherlined pot back on his head and rode away thomas told skeat what had passed between them silly goddamn bastard skeat said what did he want a tournament who does he think we are the knights of the round bloody table i dont know what happens to some folk they put a sir in front of their names and their brains get addled fighting fair whoever heard of anything so daft fight fair and you lose bloody fool sir geoffrey of the white bridge continued to haunt the hellequin but skeat gave him no chance for a fight there was always a large band of archers watching the frenchmans forces and whenever the men from lannion became too bold they were likely to have the goosefeathered arrows thumping into their horses so sir geoffrey was reduced to a shadow but he was an irritating and persistent shadow following skeats men almost back to the gates of la rochederrien the trouble occurred the third time that he trailed skeat and so came close to the town sir simon jekyll had heard of sir geoffrey and warned by a sentinel on the highest church tower that skeats men were in sight he led out a score of the garrisons menatarms to meet the hellequin skeat was just over a mile from the town and sir geoffrey with fifty menatarms and as many mounted crossbowmen was just another halfmile behind the frenchman had caused no great problems to skeat and if sir geoffrey wanted to ride home to lannion and claim that he had chased the hellequin back to their lair then skeat was quite happy to give the frenchman that satisfaction then sir simon came and it was all suddenly display and arrogance the english lances went up the helmet visors clanged shut and their horses were prancing sir simon rode towards the french and breton horsemen bellowing a challenge will skeat followed sir simon and advised him to let the bastards be but the yorkshireman was wasting his breath skeats menatarms were at the front of the column escorting the captured livestock and three wagons filled with plunder while the rearguard was formed by sixty mounted archers those sixty men had just reached the big woods where the army had camped during the siege of la rochederrien and at a signal from skeat they split into two groups and rode into the trees either side of the road they dismounted in the woods tied their horses reins to branches then carried their bows to the edge of the trees the road ran between the two groups edged by wide grassy verges sir simon wheeled his horse to confront will skeat i want thirty of your menatarms skeat he demanded peremptorily you can want them will skeat said but youll not have them good christ man i outrank you sir simon was incredulous at skeats refusal i outrank you skeat im not asking you fool im ordering skeat looked up at the sky looks like rain dont you think and we could do with a drop fields are right dry and streams are low sir simon reached out and gripped skeats arm forcing the older man to turn to him he has fifty knights sir simon spoke of sir geoffrey de pont blanc and i have twenty give me thirty men and ill take him prisoner just give me twenty he was pleading all arrogance gone for this was a chance for sir simon to fight a proper skirmish horseman against horseman and the winner would have renown and the prize of captured men and horses but will skeat knew everything about men horses and renown im not out here to play games he said shaking his arm free and you can order me till the cows sprout wings but youll not have a man of mine sir simon looked anguished but then sir geoffrey de pont blanc decided the matter he saw how his menatarms outnumbered the english horsemen and so he ordered thirty of his followers to ride back and join the crossbowmen now the two troops of horsemen were evenly matched and sir geoffrey rode forward on his big black stallion that was swathed in its blue and white trapper and had a boiled leather mask for face armour a chanfron sir simon rode to meet him in his new armour but his horse had no padded trapper and no chanfron and he wanted both just as he wanted this fight all winter he had endured the misery of a peasants war all muck and murder and now the enemy was offering honour glory and the chance to capture some fine horses armour and good weapons the two men saluted each other by dipping their lances then exchanged names and compliments will skeat had joined thomas in the woods you might be a woollyheaded fool tom skeat said but theres plenty more stupid than you look at the daft bastards not a brain between either of them you could shake them by the heels and nothing would drop out of their ears but dried muck he spat sir geoffrey and sir simon agreed on the rules of the fight tournament rules really only with death to give the sport spice an unhorsed man was out of the fight they agreed and would be spared though such a man could be taken prisoner they wished each other well then turned and rode back to their men skeat tied his horse to a tree and strung his bow theres a place in york he said where you can watch the mad folk they keep them caged up and you pay a farthing to go and laugh at them they should put those two silly bastards in with them my father was mad for a time thomas said dont surprise me lad dont surprise me at all skeat said he looped his boweord onto a stave that had been carved with crosses his archers watched the menatarms from the edge of the woods as a spectacle it was wondrous like a tournament only on this spring meadow there were no marshals to save a mans life the two groups of horsemen readied themselves squires tightened girths men hefted lances and made sure their shield straps were tight visors clanged shut turning the horsemens world into a dark place slashed with slitted daylight they dropped their reins for from now on the welltrained destriers wo d be guided by the touch of spur and the pressure of knees the horsemen needed both hands for their shields and weapons some men wore two swords a heavy one for slashing and a thinner blade for stabbing and they made certain the weapons slid easily from their scabbards some gave their lances to squires to leave a hand free to make the sign of the cross then took the lances back the horses stamped on the pasture then sir geoffrey lowered his lance in a signal that he was ready and sir simon did the same and the forty men spurred their big horses forward these were not the lightboned mares and geldings that the archers rode but the heavy destriers stallions all and big enough to carry a man and his armour the beasts snorted tossed their heads and lumbered into a trot as the riders lowered their long lances one of sir geoffreys men made the beginners mistake of lowering the lance too much so that the point struck the dry turf and he was lucky not to be unhorsed he left the lance behind and drew his sword the horsemen spurred into the canter and one of sir simons men swerved to the left probably because his horse was ill trained and it bumped the next horse and the ripple of colliding horses went down the line as the spurs rowelled back to demand the gallop then they struck the sound of the wooden lances striking shields and mail was a crunch like splintering bones two horsemen were rammed back out of their high saddles but most of the lance thrusts had been parried by shields and now the horsemen dropped the shivered weapons as they galloped past their opponents they sawed on the reins and drew their swords but it was plain to the watching archers that the enemy had gained an advantage both of the unhorsed riders were english and sir geoffreys men were much more closely aligned so that when they turned to bring their swords to the melee they came as a disciplined group that struck sir simons men in a clangour of sword against sword an englishman reeled from the melee with a missing hand dust and turf spewed up from hoofs a riderless horse limped away the swords clashed like hammers on anvils men grunted as they swung a huge breton with no device on his plain shield was wielding a falchion a weapon that was half sword and half axe and he used the broad blade with a terrible skill an english manatarms had his helmet split open and his skull with it so that he rode wavering from the fight blood pouring down his mail coat his horse stopped a few paces from the turmoil and the manatarms slowly so slowly bent forward and then slumped down from the saddle one foot was trapped in a stirrup as he died but his horse did not seem to notice it just went on cropping the grass two of sir simons men yielded and were sent back to be taken prisoner by the french and breton squires sir simon himself was fighting savagely turning his horse to beat off two opponents he sent one reeling out of the fight with a useless arm then battered the other with swift cuts from his stolen sword the french had fifteen men still fighting but the english were down to ten when the great brute with the falchion decided to finish sir simon off he roared as he charged and sir simon caught the falchion on his shield and lunged his sword into the mail under the bretons armpit he yanked the sword free and there was blood pouring from the rent in the enemys mail and leather tunic the big man twitched in the saddle and sir simon hammered the sword onto the back of his head then turned his horse to beat off another assailant before wheeling back to drive his heavy weapon in a crushing blow against the big bretons adams apple the man dropped his falchion and clutched his throat as he rode away hes good isnt he skeat said flatly got suet for brains but he knows how to fight but despite sir simons prowess the enemy was winning and thomas wanted to advance the archers they only needed to run about thirty paces and then would have been in easy range of the rampaging enemy horsemen but will skeat shook his head never kill two frenchmen when you can kill a dozen tom he said reprovingly our men are getting beat thomas protested then thatll teach em not to be bloody fools wont it skeat said he grinned just wait lad just wait and well skin the cat proper the english menatarms were being beaten back and only sir simon was fighting with spirit he was indeed good he had driven the huge breton from the fight and was now holding off four of the enemy and doing it with a ferocious skill but the rest of his men seeing that their battle was lost and that they could not reach sir simon because there were too many enemy horsemen around him turned and fled sam will shouted across the road when i give you the word take a dozen men and run away you hear me sam ill run away sam shouted back the english menatarms some bleeding and one half falling from his tall saddle thundered back down the road towards la rochederrien the french and bretons had surrounded sir simon but sir geoffrey of the white bridge was a romantic fellow and refused to take the life of a brave opponent and so he ordered his men to spare the english knight sir simon sweating like a pig under the leather and iron plate pushed up the snoutlike visor of his helmet i dont yield he told sir geoffrey his new armour was scarred and his sword edge chipped but the quality of both had helped him in the fight i dont yield he said agains o fight on sir geoffrey bowed in his saddle i salute your bravery sir simon he said magnanimously and you are free to go with all honour he waved his menatarms aside and sir simon miraculously alive and free rode away with his head held high he had led his men into disaster and death but he had emerged with honour sir geoffrey could see past sir simon down the long road that was thick with fleeing menatarms and beyond them the captured livestock and the heaped carts of plunder that were being escorted by skeats men then will skeat shouted at sam and suddenly sir geoffrey could see a bunch of panicked archers riding northwards as hard as they could hell fall for it skeat said knowingly you just see if he dont sir geoffrey had proved in the last few weeks that he was no fool but he lost his wits that day he saw a chance to cut down the hated hellequin archers and recapture three carts of plunder and so he ordered his remaining thirty menatarms to join him and leaving his four prisoners and nine captured horses in the care of his crossbowmen waved his knights forward will skeat had been waiting weeks for this sir simon turned in alarm as he heard the sound of hooves nearly fifty armoured men on big destriers charged towards him and for a moment he thought they were trying to capture him and so he spurred his horse towards the woods only to see the french and breton horsemen crash past him at full gallop sir simon ducked under branches and swore at will skeat who ignored him he was watching the enemy sir geoffrey de pont blanc led the charge and saw only glory he had forgotten the archers in the woods or else believed they had all fled after the defeat of sir simons men sir geoffrey was on the cusp of a great victory he would take back the plunder and even better lead the dreaded hellequin to a fiery fate in lannions marketplace now skeat shouted through cupped hands now there were archers on both sides of the road and they stepped out from the new spring foliage and loosed their bowstrings thomass second arrow was in the air before the first even struck look and loose he thought do not think and there was no need to aim for the enemy was a tight group and all the archers did was pour their long arrows into the horsemen so that in an eyeblink the charge was reduced to a tangle of rearing stallions fallen men screaming horses and splashing blood the enemy had no chance a few at the back managed to turn and gallop away but the majority were trapped in a closing ring of bowmen who drove their arrows mercilessly through mail and leather any man who even twitched invited three or four arrows the pile of iron and flesh was spiked with feathers and still the arrows came cutting through mail and driving deep into horseflesh only the handful of men at the rear and a single man at the very front of the charge survived that man was sir geoffrey himself he had been ten paces in front of his men and maybe that was why he was spared or perhaps the archers had been impressed by the manner in which he had treated sir simon but for whatever reason he rode ahead of the carnage like a charmed soul not an arrow flew close but he heard the screams and clatter behind and he slowed his horse then turned to see the horror he watched with disbelief for an instant then walked his stallion back towards the arrowstuck pile that had been his men skeat shouted at some of his bowmen to turn and face the enemys crossbowmen but they seeing the fate of their menatarms were in no mood to face the english arrows they retreated southwards there was a curious stillness then fallen horses twitched and some beat at the road with their hooves a man groaned another called on christ and some just whimpered thomas an arrow still on his bowstring could hear larks the call of plovers and the whisper of wind in the leaves a drop of rain fell splashing the dust on the road but it was a lone outrider of a shower that went to the west sir geoffrey stood his horse beside his dead and dying men as if inviting the archers to add his corpse to the heap that was streaked with blood and flecked with goose feathers see what i mean tom skeat said wait long enough and the bloody fools will always oblige you right lads finish the bastards off men dropped their bows drew their knives and ran to the shuddering heap but skeat held thomas back go and tell that stupid white bridge bastard to make himself scarce thomas walked to the frenchman who must have thought he was expected to surrender for he pulled off his helmet and extended his sword handle my family cannot pay a great ransom he said apologetically youre not a prisoner thomas said sir geoffrey seemed perplexed by the words you release me we dont want you thomas said you might think about going to spain he suggested or the holy land not too many hellequin in either place sir geoffrey sheathed his sword i must fight against the enemies of my king so i shall fight here but i thank you he gathered his reins and just at that moment sir simon jekyll rode out of the trees pointing his drawn sword at sir geoffrey hes my prisoner he called to thomas my prisoner hes no ones prisoner thomas said were letting him go youre letting him go sir simon sneered do you know who commands here what i know thomas said is that this man is no prisoner he thumped the trappercovered rump of sir geoffreys horse to send it on its way spain or the holy land he called after sir geoffrey sir simon turned his horse to follow sir geoffrey then saw that will skeat was ready to intervene and stop any such pursuit so he turned back to thomas you had no right to release him no right he released you thomas said then he was a fool and because he is a fool i must be sir simon was quivering with anger sir geoffrey might have declared himself a poor man hardly able to raise a ransom but his horse alone was worth at least fifty pounds and skeat and thomas had just sent that money trotting southwards sir simon watched him go then lowered the sword blade so that it threatened thomass throat from the moment i first saw you he said you have been insolent i am the highestborn man on this field and it is i who decides the fate of prisoners you understand that he yielded to me thomas said not to you so it dont matter what bed you were born in youre a pup sir simon spat skeat i want recompense for that prisoner you hear me skeat ignored sir simon but thomas did not have enough sense to do the same jesus he said in disgust that man spared you and youd not return the favour youre not a bloody knight youre just a bully go and boil your arse the sword rose and so did thomass bow sir simon looked at the glittering arrow point its edges feathered white through sharpening and he had just enough wit not to strike with his sword he sheathed it instead slamming the blade into the scabbard then wheeled his destrier and spurred away which left skeats men to sort out the enemys dead there were eighteen of them and another twentythree grievously wounded there were also sixteen bleeding horses and twentyfour dead destriers and that as will skeat remarked was a wicked waste of good horseflesh and sir geoffrey had been taught his lesson there was a fuss back in la rochederrien sir simon jekyll complained to richard totesham that will skeat had failed to support him in battle then also claimed to have been responsible for the death or wounding of fortyone enemy menatarms he boasted he had won the skirmish then returned to his theme of skeats perfidy but richard totesham was in no mood to endure sir simons querulousness did you win the fight or not of course we won sir simon blinked indignantly theyre dead aint they so why did you need wills menatarms totesham asked sir simon searched for an answer and found none he was impertinent he complained thats for you and him to settle not me totesham said in abrupt dismissal but he was thinking about the conversation and that night he talked with skeat fortyone dead or wounded he wondered aloud that must be a third of lannions menatarms near as maybe aye toteshams quarters were near the river and from his window he could watch the water slide under the bridge arches bats flittered about the barbican tower that guarded the bridges further side while the cottages beyond the river were lit by a sharpedged moon theyll be shorthanded will totesham said theyll not be happy thats for sure and the place will be stuffed with valuables like as not skeat agreed many folk fearing the hellequin had taken their belongings to the nearby fortresses and lannion must be filled with their goods more to the point totesham would find food there his garrison received some food from the farms north of la rochederrien and more was brought across the channel from england but the hellequins wastage of the countryside had brought hunger perilously close leave fifty men here totesham was still thinking aloud but he had no need to explain his thoughts to an old soldier like skeat well need new ladders skeat said what happened to the old ones firewood it were a cold winter a night attack totesham suggested full moon in five or six days five days from now then totesham decided and ill want your men will if theyre sober by then they deserve their drink after what they did today totesham said warmly then gave skeat a smile sir simon was complaining about you says you were impertinent that werent me dick it was my lad tom told the bastard to go and boil his arse i fear sir simon was never one for taking good advice totesham said gravely nor were skeats men he had let them loose in the town but warned them that they would feel rotten in the morning if they drank too much and they ignored that advice to make celebration in la rochederriens taverns thomas had gone with a score of his friends and their women to an inn where they sang danced and tried to pick a fight with a group of duke johns white rats who were too sensible to rise to the provocation and slipped quietly into the night a moment later two menatarms walked in both wearing jackets with the earl of northamptons badge of the lions and the stars their arrival was jeered but they endured it with patience and asked if thomas was present hes the ugly bastard over there jake said pointing to thomas who was dancing to the music of a flute and drum the menatarms waited till he had finished his dance then explained that will skeat was with the garrisons commander and wanted to talk with him thomas drained his ale what it is he told the other archers is that they cant make a decision without me indispensable thats me the archers mocked that but cheered goodnaturedly as thomas left with the two menatarms one of them came from dorset and had actually heard of hookton didnt the french land there he asked bastards wrecked it i doubt theres anything left thomas said so why does will want me god knows and he aint telling one of the men said he had led thomas towards richard toteshams quarters but now he pointed down a dark alley theyre in a tavern at the end there place with the anchor hanging over the door good for them thomas said if he had not been half drunk he might have realized that totesham and skeat were unlikely to summon him to a tavern let alone the smallest one in town at the river end of the darkest alley but thomas suspected nothing until he was halfway down the narrow passage and two men stepped from a gateway the first he knew of them was when a blow landed on the back of his head he pitched forward onto his knees and the second man kicked him in the face then both men rained kicks and blows on him until he offered no more resistance and they could seize his arms and drag him through the gate into a small smithy there was blood in thomass mouth his nose had been broken again a rib was cracked and his belly was churning with ale a fire burned in the smithy thomas through halfclosed eyes could see an anvil then more men surrounded him and gave him a second kicking so that he rolled into a ball in a vain attempt to protect himself enough a voice said and thomas opened his eyes to see sir simon jekyll the two men who had fetched him from the tavern and who had seemed so friendly now came through the smithy gate and stripped off their borrowed tunics showing the earl of northamptons badge well done sir simon told them then looked at thomas mere archers sir simon said do not tell knights to boil their arse a tall man a huge brute with lank yellow hair and blackened teeth was standing beside thomas wanting to kick him if he offered an insolent reply so thomas held his tongue instead he offered a silent prayer to saint sebastian the patron saint of archers this plight he reckoned was too serious to be left to a dog take his breeches down colley sir simon ordered and turned back to the fire thomas saw there was a great threelegged pot standing in the redhot charcoal he swore under his breath realizing that he was the one who was to get a boiled arse sir simon peered into the pot you are to be taught a lesson in courtesy he told thomas who whimpered as the yellowhaired brute cut through his belt then dragged his breeches down the other men searched thomass pockets taking what coins they found and a good knife then they turned him onto his belly so that his naked arse was ready for the boiling water sir simon saw the first wisps of steam float from the pot take it to him he ordered his men three of sir simons soldiers were holding thomas down and he was too hurt and too weak to fight them so he did the only thing he could he screamed murder he filled his lungs and bellowed as loud as he could he reckoned he was in a small town that was crowded with men and someone must hear and so he shrieked the alarm murder murder a man kicked his belly but thomas went on shouting for christs sake silence him sir simon snarled and colley the yellowhaired man kneeled beside thomas and tried to stuff straw into his mouth but thomas managed to spit it out murder he screamed murder colley swore took a handful of filthy mud and slapped it into thomass mouth muffling his noise bastard colley said and thumped thomass skull bastard thomas gagged on the mud but he could not spit it out sir simon was standing over him now you are to be taught good manners he said and watched as the steaming pot was carried across the smithy yard then the gate opened and a neweomer stepped into the yard what in gods name is happening here the man asked and thomas could have sung a te deum in praise of saint sebastian if his mouth had not been crammed with mud for his rescuer was father hobbe who must have heard the frantic shouting and come running down the alley to investigate what are you doing the priest demanded of sir simon it is not your business father sir simon said thomas is it you he turned back to the knight by god it is my business father hobbe had a temper and he lost it now who the devil do you think you are be careful priest sir simon snarled be careful me i will have your soul in hell if you dont leave the small priest snatched up the smiths huge poker and wielded it like a sword ill have all your souls in hell leave all of you out of here out in the name of god get out get out sir simon backed down it was one thing to torture an archer but quite another to get into a fight with a priest whose voice was loud enough to attract still more attention sir simon snarled that father hobbe was an interfering bastard but he retreated all the same father hobbe knelt beside thomas and hooked some of the mud from his mouth along with tendrils of thick blood and a broken tooth you poor lad father hobbe said then helped thomas stand ill take you home tom take you home and clean you up thomas had to vomit first but then holding his breeches up he staggered back to jeanettes house supported all the way by the priest a dozen archers greeted him wanting to know what had happened but father hobbe brushed them aside wheres the kitchen he demanded she wont let us in there thomas said his voice indistinct because of his swollen mouth and bleeding gums where is it father hobbe insisted one of the archers nodded at the door and the priest just pushed it open and half carried thomas inside he sat him on a chair and pulled the rush lights to the tables edge so he could see thomass face dear god he said what have they done to you he patted thomass hand then went to find water jeanette came into the kitchen full of fury you are not supposed to be here you will get out then she saw thomass face and her voice trailed away if someone had told her that she would see a badly beaten english archer she would have been cheered but to her surprise she felt a pang of sympathy what happened sir simon jekyll did this thomas managed to say sir simon hes an evil man father hobbe had heard the name and came from the scullery with a big bowl of water hes an evil thing evil he spoke in english you have some cloths he asked jeanette she doesnt speak english thomas said blood was trickling down his face sir simon attacked you jeanette asked why because i told him to boil his arse thomas said and was rewarded with a smile good jeanette said she did not invite thomas to stay in the kitchen but nor did she order him to leave instead she stood and watched as the priest washed his face then took off thomass shirt to bind up the cracked rib tell her she could help me father hobbe said shes too proud to help thomas said its a sinful sad world father hobbe declared then knelt down hold still tom he said for this will hurt like the very devil he took hold of the broken nose and there was the sound of cartilage scraping before thomas shouted in pain father hobbe put a cold wet cloth over his nose hold that there tom and the pain will go well it wont really but youll get used to it he sat on an empty salt barrel shaking his head sweet jesus tom what are we going to do with you youve done it thomas said and im grateful a day or two and ill be leaping about like a spring lamb youve been doing that for too long tom father hobbe said earnestly jeanette not understanding a word just watched the two men god gave you a good head the priest went on but you waste your wits tom you do waste them you want me to be a priest father hobbe smiled i doubt youd be much credit to the church tom youd like as not end up as an archbishop because youre clever and devious enough but i think youd be happier as a soldier but you have debts to god tom remember that promise you made to your father you made it in a church and it would be good for your soul to keep that promise tom thomas laughed and immediately wished he had not for the pain whipped through his ribs he swore apologized to jeanette then looked back to the priest and how in the name of god father am i supposed to keep that promise i dont even know what bastard stole the lance what bastard jeanette asked for she had picked up that one word sir simon he is a bastard thomas said but hes not the only one and he told her about the lance about the day his village had been murdered about his father dying and about the man who carried a banner showing three yellow hawks on a blue field he told the story slowly through bloody lips and when he had finished jeanette shrugged so you want to kill this man yes one day he deserves to be killed jeanette said thomas stared at her through halfclosed eyes astonished by those words you know him he is called sir guillaume devecque jeanette said whats she saying father hobbe asked i know him jeanette said grimly in caen where he comes from he is sometimes called the lord of the sea and of the land because he fights on both thomas guessed he is a knight jeanette said but he is also a searaider a pirate my father owned sixteen ships and guillaume devecque stole three of them he fought against you thomas sounded surprised jeanette shrugged he thinks any ship that is not french is an enemy we are bretons thomas looked at father hobbe there you are father he said lightly to keep my promise all i must do is fight the knight of the sea and of the land father hobbe had not followed the french but he shook his head sadly how you keep the promise thomas is your business but god knows you made it and i know you are doing nothing about it he fingered the wooden cross he wore on a leather lace about his neck and what shall i do about sir simon nothing thomas said i must tell totesham at least the priest insisted nothing father thomas was just as insistent promise me father hobbe looked suspiciously at thomas youre not thinking of taking your own revenge are you thomas crossed himself and hissed because of the pain in his rib doesnt our mother church tell us to turn the other cheek he asked it does father hobbe said dubiously but it wouldnt condone what sir simon did tonight we shall turn away his wrath with a soft answer thomas said and father hobbe impressed by this display of genuine christianity nodded his acceptance of thomass decision jeanette had been following the conversation as best she could and had at least gathered the gist of their words are you discussing what to do to sir simon she asked thomas im going to murder the bastard thomas said in french she offered him a sour grimace that is a very clever idea englishman so you will be a murderer and they will hang you then thanks be to god there will be two dead englishmen whats she saying thomas father hobbe asked shes agreeing that i ought to forgive my enemies father good woman good woman father hobbe said do you really want to kill him jeanette demanded coldly thomas shuddered with the pain but he was not so hurt that he could not appreciate jeanettes closeness she was a hard woman he reckoned but still as lovely as the spring and like the rest of will skeats men he had harboured impossible dreams of knowing her better her question gave him that chance ill kill him he assured her and in killing him my lady ill fetch you your husbands armour and sword jeanette frowned at him you can do that if you help me she grimaced how so thomas told her and to his astonishment she did not dismiss the idea in horror but instead nodded a grudging acceptance it might really work she said after a while it really might work which meant that sir simon had united his enemies and thomas had found himself an ally jeanettes life was encompassed by enemies she had her son but everyone else she loved was dead and those who were left she hated there were the english of course occupying her town but there was also belas the lawyer and the shipmasters who had cheated her and the tenants who used the presence of the english to default on their rent and the towns merchants who dunned her for money she did not have she was a countess yet her rank counted for nothing at night brooding on her plight she would dream of meeting a great champion a duke perhaps who would come to la rochederrien and punish her enemies one by one she saw them whimpering with terror pleading for mercy and receiving none but in each dawn there was no duke and her enemies did not cringe and jeanettes troubles were unrelieved until thomas promised to help her kill the one enemy she hated above the rest to which end early in the morning after her conversation with thomas jeanette went to richard toteshams headquarters she went early because she hoped sir simon jekyll would still be in bed and though it was essential he knew the purpose of her visit she did not want to meet him let him learn from others what she planned the headquarters like her own house fronted the river jaudy and the waterfront yard despite the early hour already held a score of petitioners seeking favours from the english jeanette was told to wait with the other petitioners i am the countess of armorica she told the clerk you must wait like the rest the clerk answered in poor french then cut another notch in a tally stick on which he was counting arrow sheaves that were being unloaded from a lighter that had come upriver from the deepwater harbour at treguler a second lighter held barrels of red herrings and the stench of the fish made jeanette shudder english food they did not even gut the herrings before smoking them and the red fish came from the barrels covered in yellowgreen mould yet the archers ate them with relish she tried to escape the reeking fish by crossing the yard to where a dozen local men trimmed great lengths of timber propped on sawhorses one of the carpenters was a man who had sometimes worked for jeanettes father though he was usually too drunk to hold a job for more than a few days he was barefoot ragged humpbacked and harelipped though when he was sober he was as good a labourer as any in the town jacques jeanette called what are you doing she spoke in breton jacques tugged his forelock and bobbed down youre looking well my lady only a few folk could understand his speech for his split lip mangled the sounds your father always said you were his angel i asked what you are doing ladders my lady ladders jacques cuffed a stream of mucus from his nose there was a weeping ulcer on his neck and the stink of it was as bad as the red herrings they want six ever so long ladders why jacques looked left and right to make sure no one could overhear him what he says he jerked his head at the englishman who was supposedly supervising the work what he says is that theyre taking them to lannion and theyre long enough for that big wall aint they lannion he likes his ale he does jacques said explaining the englishmans indiscretion hey handsome the supervisor shouted at jacques get to work jacques with a grin to jeanette picked up his tools make the rungs loose jeanette advised jacques in breton then turned because her name had been called from the house sir simon jekyll looking heavyeyed and sleepy was standing in the doorway and jeanettes heart sank at the sight of him my lady sir simon offered jeanette a bow you should not be waiting with common folk tell that to the clerk jeanette said coldly the clerk tallying the arrow sheaves squealed when sir simon caught him by the ear this clerk he asked he told me to wait out here sir simon cuffed the man across the face shes a lady you bastard you treat her like a lady he kicked the man away then pulled the door fully open come my lady he invited her jeanette went to the door and was relieved to see four more clerks busy at tables inside the house the army sir simon said as she brushed past him has almost as many clerks as archers clerks farriers masons cooks herdsmen butchers anything else on two legs that can take the kings coin he smiled at her then brushed a hand down his threadbare wool robe that was trimmed with fur if i had known you were gracing us with a visit my lady i would have dressed sir simon jeanette noted gladly was in a puppy mood this morning he was always either boorish or clumsily polite and she hated him in either mood but at least he was easier to deal with when he tried to impress her with his manners i came she told him to request a pass from monsieur totesham the clerks watched her surreptitiously their quills scratching and spluttering on the scraped parchment i can give you a pass sir simon said gallantly though i trust you are not leaving la rochederrien permanently i just wish to visit louannec jeanette said and where dear lady is louannec it is on the coast jeanette said north of lannion lannion eh he perched on a tables edge his bare leg swinging cant have you wandering near lannion not this week next maybe but only if you can persuade me that you have good reason to travel he smoothed his fair moustache and i can be very persuadable i wish to pray at the shrine there jeanette said i would not keep you from your prayers sir simon said he was thinking that he should have invited her through into the parlour but in truth he had small appetite for loves games this morning he had consoled himself for his failure to boil thomas of hooktons backside by drinking deep into the darkness and his belly felt liquid his throat was dry and his head was banging like a kettledrum which saint will have the pleasure of hearing your voice he asked the shrine is dedicated to yves who protects the sick my son has a fever poor boy sir simon said in mock sympathy then peremptorily ordered a clerk to write the pass for her ladyship you will not travel alone madame he asked i shall take servants you would be better with soldiers there are bandits everywhere i do not fear my own countrymen sir simon then you should he said tartly how many servants two sir simon told the clerk to note two companions on the pass then looked back to jeanette you really would be much safer with soldiers as escort god will preserve me jeanette said sir simon watched as the ink on the pass was sanded dry and a blob of hot wax was dropped onto the parchment he pressed a seal into the wax then held the document to jeanette maybe i should come with you madame i would rather not travel at all jeanette said refusing to take the pass then i shall relinquish my duties to god sir simon said jeanette took the pass forced herself to thank him then fled she half expected that sir simon would follow her but he let her go unmolested she felt dirty but also triumphant because the trap was baited now well and truly baited she did not go straight home but went instead to the house of the lawyer belas who was still eating a breakfast of blood sausage and bread the aroma of the sausage put an edge to jeanettes hunger but she refused his offer of a plate she was a countess and he was a mere lawyer and she would not demean herself by eating with him belas straightened his robe apologized that the parlour was cold and asked whether she had at last decided to sell the house it is the sensible thing to do madame your debts mount i shall let you know my decision she said but i have come on other business belas opened the parlour shutters business costs money madame and your debts forgive me are mounting it is duke charless business jeanette said do you still write to his men of business from time to time belas said guardedly how do you reach them jeanette demanded belas was suspicious of the question but finally saw no harm in giving an answer the messages go by boat to paimpol he said then overland to guingamp how long does it take two days three it depends if the english are riding the country between paimpol and guingamp then write to the duke jeanette said and tell him from me that the english will attack lannion at the end of this week they are making ladders to scale the wall she had decided to send the message through belas for her own couriers were two fishermen who only came to sell their wares in la rochederrien on a thursday and any message sent through them must arrive too late belass couriers on the other hand could reach guingamp in good time to thwart the english plans belas dabbed egg from his thin beard you are sure madame of course im sure she told him about jacques and the ladders and about the indiscreet english supervisor and how sir simon had forced her to wait a week before venturing near lannion on her expedition to the shrine at louannec the duke belas said as he ushered jeanette to the house door will be grateful belas sent the message that day though he did not say it came from the countess but instead claimed all the credit for himself he gave the letter to a shipmaster who sailed that same afternoon and next morning a horseman rode south from paimpol there were no hellequin in the wasted country between the port and the dukes capital so the message arrived safely and in guingamp which was duke charless headquarters the farriers checked the war horses shoes the crossbowmen greased their weapons squires scrubbed mail till it shone and a thousand swords were sharpened the english raid on lannion had been betrayed jeanettes unlikely alliance with thomas had soothed the hostility in her house skeats men now used the river as their lavatory instead of the courtyard and jeanette allowed them into the kitchen which proved useful for they brought their rations with them and so her household ate better than it had since the town had fallen though she still could not bring herself to try the smoked herrings with their bright red mouldcovered skins best of all was the treatment given to two importunate merchants who arrived demanding payment from jeanette and were so badly manhandled by a score of archers that both men left hatless limping unpaid and bloody i will pay them when i can she told thomas sir simons likely to have money on him he told her he is only a fool leaves cash where a servant can find it he said four days after the beating his face was still swollen and his lips black with blood clots his rib hurt and his body was a mass of bruises but he had insisted to skeat that he was well enough to ride to lannion they would leave that afternoon at midday jeanette found him in saint renans church why are you praying she asked him i always do before a fight there will be a fight today i thought you were not riding till tomorrow i love a wellkept secret thomas said amused were going a day early everythings ready why wait going where jeanette asked though she already knew to wherever they take us thomas said jeanette grimaced and prayed silently that her message had reached duke charles be careful she said to thomas not because she cared for him but because he was her agent for taking revenge on sir simon jekyll perhaps sir simon will be killed she suggested god will save him for me thomas said perhaps he wont follow me to louannec hell follow you like a dog thomas said but it will be dangerous for you i shall get the armour back jeanette said and that is all that matters are you praying to saint renan to saint sebastian thomas said and to saint guinefort i asked the priest about guinefort jeanette said accusingly and he said he had never heard of him he probably hasnt heard of saint wilgefortis either thomas said wilgefortis jeanette stumbled over the unfamiliar name who is he she thomas said and she was a very pious virgin who lived in flanders and grew a long beard she prayed every day that god would keep her ugly so that she could stay chaste jeanette could not resist laughing that isnt true it is true my lady thomas assured her my father was once offered a hair of her holy beard but he refused to buy it then i shall pray to the bearded saint that you survive your raid jeanette said but only so you can help me against sir simon other than that i hope you all die the garrison at guingamp had the same wish and to make it come true they assembled a strong force of crossbowmen and menatarms to ambush the englishmen on their way to lannion but they like jeanette were convinced that la rochederriens garrison would make their sally on the friday and so they did not leave till late on thursday by which time toteshams force was already within five miles of lannion the shrunken garrison did not know the english were coming because duke charless war captains who commanded his forces in guingamp while the duke was in paris decided not to warn the town if too many people knew that the english had been betrayed then the english themselves might hear of it abandon their plans and so deny the dukes men the chance of a rare and complete victory the english expected victory themselves it was a dry night and near midnight a full moon slid out from behind a silveredged cloud to cast lannions walls in sharp relief the raiders were hidden in woods from where they watched the few sentinels on the ramparts those sentinels grew sleepy and after a time went to the bastions where fires burned and so they did not see the six ladder parties creep across the night fields nor the hundred archers following the ladders and still they slept as the archers climbed the rungs and toteshams main force erupted from the woods ready to burst through the eastern gate that the archers would open the sentinels died the first dogs awoke in the town then a church bell began to ring and lannions garrison came awake but too late for the gate was open and toteshams mailclad soldiers were crying havoc in the dark alleys while still more menatarms and archers were pouring through the narrow gate skeats men were the rearguard and so waited outside the town as the sack began church bells were clanging wildly as the towns parishes woke to nightmare but gradually the clangour ceased will skeat stared at the moonglossed fields south of lannion i hear it was sir simon jekyll who improved your looks he said to thomas it was because you told him to boil his arse skeat grinned you cant blame him for thumping you skeat said but he should have talked to me first what would you have done made sure he didnt thump you too much of course skeat said his gaze moving steadily across the landscape thomas had acquired the same habit of watchfulness but all the land beyond the town was still a mist rose from the low ground so what do you plan to do about it skeat asked talk to you i dont fight your goddamn battles boy skeat growled what i do you plan to do about it ask you to lend me jake and sam on saturday and i want three crossbows crossbows eh skeat asked flatly he saw that the rest of toteshams force had now entered the town so he put two fingers to his lips and sounded a piercing whistle to signal that his own men could follow onto the walls he shouted as the hellequin rode forward onto the walls that was the rearguards job to man the fallen towns defences half the bloody bastards will still get drunk skeat growleds o you stay with me tom most of skeats men did their duty and climbed the stone steps to the towns ramparts but a few slipped away in search of plunder and drink so skeat thomas and a halfdozen archers scoured the town to find those laggards and drive them back to the walls a score of toteshams menatarms were doing much the same dragging men out of taverns and setting them to loading the many wagons that had been stored in the town to keep them from the hellequin totesham particularly wanted food for his garrison and his more reliable menatarms did their best to keep the english soldiers from drink women or anything else that would slow the plunder the towns garrison woken and surprised had done their best to fight back but they had responded much too late and their bodies now lay in the moonlit streets but in the western part of the town close to the quays which fronted the river leguer the battle still went on and skeat was drawn to the sound most men were ignoring it too intent on kicking down house doors and ransacking warehouses but skeat reckoned no one in town was safe until all the defenders were dead thomas followed him to find a group of toteshams menatarms who had just retreated from a narrow street theres a mad bastard down there one of them told skeat and hes got a dozen crossbowmen the mad bastard and his crossbowmen had already killed their share of englishmen for the redcrossed bodies lay where the street bent sharply towards the river burn them out one of the menatarms suggested not before weve searched the buildings skeat said then sent two of his archers to fetch one of the ladders that had been used to scale the ramparts once the ladder was fetched he propped it against the nearest house and looked at thomas who grinned climbed the rungs and then clambered up the steep thatch his broken rib hurt but he gained the ridge and there took the bow from his shoulder and fitted an arrow onto the cord he walked along the rooftop his mooncast shadow long on the sloping straw the roof ended just above the place where the enemy waited and so before reaching the ridges peak he drew the bow to its full extent then took two steps forward the enemy saw him and a dozen crossbows jerked up but so did the unhelmeted face of a fairhaired man who had a long sword in his hand thomas recognized him it was sir geoffrey de pont blanc and thomas hesitated because he admired the man but then the first bolt whipped so close to his face that he felt the wind of its passing on his cheek and so he loosed and he knew the arrow would go straight into the open mouth of sir geoffreys upturned face he did not see it strike though for he had stepped back as the other crossbows twanged and their bolts seared up towards the moon hes dead thomas shouted there was a tramp of feet as the menatarms charged before the crossbowmen could reload their clumsy weapons thomas stepped back to the ridges end and saw the swords and axes rise and fall he saw the blood splash up onto the plastered house fronts saw the men hacking at sir geoffreys corpse just to make certain he was really dead a woman shrieked in the house that sir geoffrey had been defending thomas slithered down the thatch and jumped into the street where sir geoffrey had died and there he picked up three of the crossbows and a bag of bolts that he carried back to will skeat the yorkshireman grinned crossbows eh that means youll be pretending to be the enemy and you cant do that in la rochederrien so youre waylaying sir simon somewhere outside the town am i right something like that i could read you like a bloody book boy if i could read which i cant on account of having too much sense skeat walked on towards the river where three ships were being plundered and another two their holds already emptied were burning fiercely but how do you get the bastard out of town skeat asked hes not a complete fool he is when it comes to the countess ah skeat grinned and the countess shes suddenly being nice to us all so its you and her is it it is not her and me no soon will be though wont it skeat said i doubt it why because shes a countess still a woman boy but id be careful of her careful hard bitch that one looks lovely on the outside but its all flint inside shell break your heart boy skeat had stopped on the wide stone quays where men were emptying warehouses of leather grain smoked fish wine and bolts of cloth sir simon was among them shouting at his men to commandeer more wagons the town was yielding a vast fortune it was a much bigger place than la rochederrien and because it had successfully fought off the earl of northamptons winter siege it had been reckoned a safe place for bretons to store their valuables now it was being gutted a man staggered past thomas with an armload of silver plate another man was dragging a halfnaked woman by the shreds of her nightdress one group of archers had broken open a vat and were dipping their faces to drink the wine it was easy enough getting in here skeat said but itll be the devils own job to get these sodden bastards back out again sir simon beat his sword on the backs of two drunks who were getting in the way of his men emptying a storehouse of its bolts of cloth he saw thomas and looked surprised but he was too wary of will skeat to say anything he just turned away bastard must have paid off his debts by now skeat said still staring at sir simons back wars a good way to get rich so long as you aint taken prisoner and ransomed not that theyd ransom you or me boy slit our bellies and prick our eyes out more like have you ever shot a crossbow no aint quite as easy as it looks not as hard as shooting a real bow of course but it still takes practice goddamn things can pitch a bit high if youre not used to them do jake and sam want to help you they say so of course they do evil bastards that they are skeat still stared at sir simon who was wearing his new shining armour i reckon the bastard will carry his cash with him i would think so yes half mine tom and ill ask no questions come saturday thanks will but do it proper tom skeat said savagely do it proper i dont want to watch you hang i dont mind watching most fools doing the rope dance with the piss running down their legs but itd be a shame to watch you twitching your way to the devil they went back to the walls neither man had collected any plunder but they had already taken more than enough from their raids on the north breton farms and it was now the turn of toteshams men to gorge themselves on a captured town one by one the houses were searched and the tavern barrels were drained richard totesham wanted his force to leave lannion at dawn but there were too many captured carts waiting to get through the narrow eastern gate and not nearly enough horses to pull the carts so men were harnessing themselves to the shafts rather than leave their pickings behind other men were drunk and senseless and toteshams menatarms scoured the town to find them but it was fire that drove most of the drunks from their refuges the townsfolk fled south as the english set the thatched roofs alight the smoke thickened into a vast dirty pillar that drifted south on the small sea wind the pillar glowed a lurid red on its underside and it must have been that sight which first told the approaching force from guingamp that they had arrived too late to save the town they had marched through the night expecting to find some place where they could lay an ambush for toteshams men but the damage was already done lannion was burning and its wealth was piled on carts that were still being manhandled through the gate but if the hated english could not be ambushed on their way to the town then they could be surprised as they left and so the enemy commanders swung their forces eastwards towards the road which led back to la rochederrien crosseyed jake saw the enemy first he was gazing south through the pearly mist that lay over the flat land and he saw the shadows in the vapour at first he thought it was a herd of cows then he decided it had to be refugees from the town but then he saw a banner and a lance and the dull grey of a mail coat and he shouted to skeat that there were horsemen in sight skeat peered over the ramparts can you see anything tom it was just before dawn proper and the countryside was suffused with greyness and streaked with mist thomas stared he could see a thick wood a mile or more to the south and a low ridge showing dark above the mist then he saw the banners and the grey mail in the grey light and a thicket of lances menatarms he said a lot of the bastards skeat swore toteshams men were either still in the town or else strung along the road to la rochederrien and strung so far that there could be no hope of pulling them back behind lannions walls though even if that had been possible it was not practical for the whole western side of the town was burning furiously and the flames were spreading fast to retreat behind the walls was to risk being roasted alive but toteshams men were hardly in a fit condition to fight many were drunk and all were laden with plunder hedgerow skeat said curtly pointing to a ragged line of blackthorn and elder that ran parallel to the road where the carts rumbled archers to the hedge tom well look after your horses christ knows how well stop the bastards he made the sign of the cross but we aint got much choice thomas bullied a passage at the crowded gate and led forty archers across a soggy pasture to the hedgerow that seemed a flimsy barrier against the enemy massing in the silvery mist there were at least three hundred horsemen there they were not advancing yet but instead grouping themselves for a charge and thomas had only forty men to stop them spread out he shouted spread out he briefly went onto one knee and made the sign of the cross saint sebastian he prayed be with us now saint guinefort protect me he touched the desiccated dogs paw then made the sign of the cross again a dozen more archers joined his force but it was still far too small a score of pageboys mounted on ponies and armed with toy swords could have massacred the men on the road for thomass hedge did not provide a complete screen but rather straggled into nothingness about half a mile from the town the horsemen only had to ride round that open end and there would be nothing to stop them thomas could take his archers into the open ground but fifty men could not stop three hundred archers were at their best when they were massed together so that their arrows made a hard steeltipped rain fifty men could make a shower but they would still be overrun and massacred by the horsemen crossbowmen jake grunted and thomas saw the men in green and red jackets emerging from the woods behind the enemy menatarms the new dawn light reflected cold from mail swords and helmets bastards are taking their time jake said nervously he had planted a dozen arrows in the base of the hedge which was just thick enough to stop the horsemen but not nearly dense enough to slow a crossbow bolt will skeat had gathered sixty of his menatarms beside the road ready to countercharge the enemy whose numbers increased every minute duke charless men and their french allies were riding eastwards now looking to advance about the open end of the hedge where there was an inviting swathe of green and open land leading all the way to the road thomas wondered why the hell they were waiting he wondered if he would die here dear god he thought but there were not nearly enough men to stop this enemy the fires continued to burn in lannion pouring smoke into the pale sky he ran to the left of the line where he found father hobbe holding a bow you shouldnt be here father he said god will forgive me the priest said he had tucked his cassock into his belt and had a small stand of arrows stuck into the hedgebank thomas gazed at the open land wondering how long his men would last in that immensity of grass just what the enemy wanted he thought a stretch of bare flat land on which their horses could run hard and straight only the land was not entirely flat for it was dotted with grassy hummocks through which two grey herons walked stifflegged as they hunted for frogs or ducklings frogs thomas thought and ducklings sweet god it was a marsh the spring had been unusually dry yet his boots were soaking from the damp field he had crossed to reach the hedgerow the realization burst on thomas like the rising sun the open land was marsh no wonder the enemy was waiting they could see toteshams men strung out for slaughter but they could see no way across the swampy ground this way thomas shouted at the archers this way hurry hurry come on you bastards he led them round the end of the hedge into the swamp where they leaped and splashed through a maze of marsh tussocks and streamlets they went south towards the enemy and once in range thomas spread his men out and told them to indulge in target practice his fear had gone replaced by exaltation the enemy was balked by the marsh their horses could not advance but thomass light archers could leap across the tussocks like demons like hellequin kill the bastards he shouted the whitefledged arrows hissed across the wetland to strike horses and men some of the enemy tried to charge the archers but their horses floundered in the soft ground and became targets for volleys of arrows the crossbowmen dismounted and advanced but the archers switched their aim to them and now more archers were arriving dispatched by skeat and totesham so that the marsh was suddenly swarming with english and welsh bowmen who poured a steeltipped hell on the befuddled enemy it became a game men wagered on whether or not they could strike a particular target the sun rose higher casting shadows from the dead horses the enemy was edging back to the trees one brave group tried a last charge hoping to skirt the marsh but their horses stumbled in the soft ground and the arrows spitted and sliced at them so that men and beasts screamed as they fell one horseman struggled on flailing his beast with the flat of his sword thomas put an arrow into the horses neck and jake skewered its haunch and the animal screeched piteously as it thrashed in pain and collapsed into the swamp the man somehow extricated his feet from his stirrups and stumbled cursing towards the archers with his sword held low and shield high but sam buried an arrow in his groin and then a dozen more bowmen added their arrows before swarming over the fallen enemy knives were drawn throats cut then the business of plunder could begin the corpses were stripped of their mail and weapons and the horses of their bridles and saddles then father hobbe prayed over the dead while the archers counted their spoils the enemy was gone by midmorning they left two score of dead men and twice that number had been wounded but not a single welsh or english archer had died duke charless men slunk back to guingamp lannion had been destroyed they had been humiliated and will skeats men celebrated in la rochederrien they were the hellequin they were the best and they could not be beaten the following morning thomas sam and jake left la rochederrien before daybreak they rode west towards lannion but once in the woods they swerved off the road and picketed their horses deep among the trees then moving like poachers they worked their way back to the woods edge each had his own bow slung on his shoulder and carried a crossbow too and they practised with the unfamiliar weapons as they waited in a swa the of bluebells at the woods margin from where they could see la rochederriens western gate thomas had only brought a dozen bolts short and stubfeathered so each of them shot just two times will skeat had been right the weapons did kick up as the archers loosed so that their first bolts went high on the trunk that was their target thomass second shot was more accurate but nothing like as true as an arrow shot from a proper bow the near miss made him apprehensive of the mornings risks but jake and sam were both cheerful at the prospect of larceny and murder cant really miss sam said after his second shot had also gone high might not catch the bastard in the belly but well hit him somewhere he levered the cord back grunting with the effort no man alive could haul a crossbows string by armpower alone and so a mechanism had to be employed the most expensive crossbows those with the longest range used a jackscrew the archer would place a cranked handle on the screws end and wind the cord back inch by creaking inch until the pawl above the trigger engaged the string some crossbowmen used their bodies as a lever they wore thick leather belts to which a hook was attached and by bending down attaching the hook to the cord and then straightening they could pull the twisted strings back but the crossbows thomas had brought from lannion used a lever shaped like a goats hind leg that forced the cord and bent the short bow shaft which was a layered thing of horn wood and glue the lever was probably the fastest way of cocking the weapon though it did not offer the power of a screwcocked bow and was still slow compared to a yew shaft in truth there was nothing to compare with the english bow and skeats men debated endlessly why the enemy did not adopt the weapon because theyre daft was sams curt judgement though the truth thomas knew was that other nations simply did not start their sons early enough to be an archer meant starting as a boy then practising and practising until the chest was broad the arm muscles huge and the arrow seemed to fly without the archer giving its aim any thought jake shot his second bolt into the oak and swore horribly when it missed the mark he looked at the bow piece of shit he said how close are we going to be close as we can get thomas said jake sniffed if i can poke the bloody bow into the bastards belly i might not miss thirty forty feet should be all right sam reckoned aim at his crotch thomas encouraged them and we should gut him itll be all right jake said three of us one of us has got to skewer the bastard in the shadows lads thomas said gesturing them deeper into the trees he had seen jeanette coming from the gate where the guards had inspected her pass then waved her on she sat sideways on a small horse that will skeat had lent her and was accompanied by two greyhaired servants a man and a woman both of whom had grown old in her fathers service and now walked beside their mistresss horse if jeanette had truly planned to ride to louannec then such a feeble and aged escort would have been an invitation for trouble but trouble of course was what she intended and no sooner had she reached the trees than the trouble appeared as sir simon jekyll emerged from the archways shadow riding with two other men what if those two bastards stay close to him sam asked they wont thomas said he was certain of that just as he and jeanette had been certain that sir simon would follow her and that he would wear the expensive suit of plate he had stolen from her shes a brave lass jake grunted shes got spirit thomas said knows how to hate someone jake tested the point of a quarrel you and her he asked thomas doing it are you no but youd like to i would i dont know thomas said he thought jeanette beautiful but skeat was right there was a hardness in her that repelled him i suppose so he admitted of course you would jake said be daft not to once jeanette was among the trees thomas and his companions trailed her staying hidden and always conscious that sir simon and his two henchmen were closing quickly those three horsemen trotted once they reached the wood and succeeded in catching up with jeanette in a place that was almost perfect for thomass ambush the road ran within yards of a clearing where a meandering stream had undercut the roots of a willow the fallen trunk was rotted and thick with disclike fungi jeanette pretending to make way for the three armoured horsemen turned into the clearing and waited beside the dead tree best of all there was a stand of young alders close to the willows trunk that offered cover to thomas sir simon turned off the road ducked under the branches and curbed his horse close to jeanette one of his companions was henry colley the brutal yellowhaired man who had hurt thomas so badly while the other was sir simons slackjawed squire who grinned in expectation of the coming entertainment sir simon pulled off the snouted helmet and hung it on his saddles pommel then smiled triumphantly it is not safe madame he said to travel without an armed escort i am perfectly safe jeanette declared her two servants cowered beside her horse as colley and the squire hemmed jeanette in place with their horses sir simon dismounted with a clank of armour i had hoped dear lady he said approaching her that we could talk on our way to louannec you wish to pray to the holy yves jeanette asked what will you beg of him that he grants you courtesy i would just talk with you madame sir simon said talk of what of the complaint you made to the earl of northampton you fouled my honour lady your honour jeanette laughed what honour do you have that could be fouled do you even know the meaning of the word thomas hidden behind the straggle of alders was whispering a translation to jake and sam all three crossbows were cocked and had their wicked little bolts lying in the troughs if you will not talk to me on the road madame then we must have our conversation here sir simon declared i have nothing to say to you then you will find it easy enough to listen he said and reached up to haul her out of the saddle she beat at his armoured gauntlets but no resistance of hers could prevent him from dragging her to the ground the two servants shrieked protests but colley and the squire silenced them by grabbing their hair then pulling them out of the clearing to leave jeanette and sir simon alone jeanette had scrabbled backwards and was now standing beside the fallen tree thomas had raised his crossbow but jake pushed it down for sir simons escort was still too near sir simon pushed jeanette hard so that she sat down on the rotting trunk then he took a long dagger from his sword belt and drove its narrow blade hard through jeanettes skirts so that she was pinned to the fallen willow he hammered the knife hilt with his steelshod foot to make sure it was deep in the trunk colley and the squire had vanished now and the noise of their horses hooves had faded among the leaves sir simon smiled then stepped forward and plucked the cloak from jeanettes shoulders when i first saw you my lady he said i confess i thought of marriage but you have been perverse so i have changed my mind he put his hands at her bodices neckline and ripped it apart tearing the laces from their embroidered holes jeanette screamed as she tried to cover herself and jake again held thomass arm down wait till he gets the armour off jake whispered they knew the bolts could pierce mail but none of the three knew how strong the plate armour would prove sir simon slapped jeanettes hands away there madame he said gazing at her breasts now we can have discourse sir simon stepped back and began to strip himself of the armour he pulled off the plated gauntlets first unbuckled the sword belt then lifted the shoulder pieces on their leather harness over his head he fumbled with the side buckles of the breast and back plates that were attached to a leather coat that also supported the rerebraces and vambraces that protected his arms the coat had a chain skirt which because of the weight of the plate and ring mail made it a struggle for sir simon to drag over his head he staggered as he pulled at the heavy armour and thomas again raised the crossbow but sir simon was stepping back and forward as he tried to steady himself and thomas could not be sure of his aim and so kept his finger off the trigger the armourladen coat thumped onto the ground leaving sir simon tousle haired and barechested and thomas again put the crossbow stock into his shoulder but now sir simon sat down to strip off the cuisses greaves poleyns and boots and he sat in such a way that his armoured legs were towards the ambush and kept getting in the way of thomass aim jeanette was struggling with the knife scared out of her wits that thomas had not stayed close but tug as she might the dagger would not move sir simon pulled off the sollerets that covered his feet then wriggled out of the leather breeches to which the leg plates were attached now madame he said standing whitely naked we can talk properly jeanette heaved a last time at the dagger hoping to plunge it into sir simons pale belly and just then thomas pulled his trigger the bolt scraped across sir simons chest thomas had aimed at the knights groin hoping to send the short arrow deep into his belly but the bolt had grazed one of the whiplike alder boughs and been deflected blood streaked on sir simons skin and he dropped to the ground so fast that jakes bolt whipped over his head sir simon scrambled away going first to his discarded armour then he realized he had no time to save the plate and so he ran for his horse and it was then that sams bolt caught him in the flesh of his right thigh so that he yelped half fell and decided there was no time to rescue his horse either and just limped naked and bleeding into the woods thomas loosed a second bolt that rattled past sir simon to whack into a tree and then the naked man vanished thomas swore he had meant to kill but sir simon was all too alive i thought you werent here jeanette said as thomas appeared she was clutching her torn clothing to her breasts we missed the bastard thomas said angrily he heaved the dagger free of her skirts while jake and sam thrust the armour into two sacks thomas threw down the crossbow and took his own black bow from his shoulder what he should do now he thought was track sir simon through the trees and kill the bastard he could pull out the whitefeathered arrow and put a crossbow bolt into the wound so that whoever found him would believe that bandits or the enemy had killed the knight search the bastards saddle pouches he told jake and sam jeanette had tied the cloak round her neck and her eyes widened as she saw the gold pour from the pouches youre going to stay here with jake and sam thomas told her where are you going she asked to finish the job thomas said grimly he loosed the laces of his arrow bag and dropped one crossbow bolt in among the longer arrows wait here he told jake and sam ill help you sam said no thomas insisted wait here and look after the countess he was angry with himself he should have used his own bow from the start and simply removed the telitale arrow and shot a bolt into sir simons corpse but he had fumbled the ambush but at least sir simon had fled westwards away from his two menatarms and he was naked bleeding and unarmed easy prey thomas told himself as he followed the blood drops among the trees the trail went west and then as the blood thinned southwards sir simon was obviously working his way back towards his companions and thomas abandoned caution and just ran hoping to cut the fugitive off then bursting through some hazels he saw sir simon limping and bent thomas pulled the bow back and just then colley and the squire came into view both with swords drawn and both spurring their horses at thomas he switched his aim to the nearest and loosed without thinking he loosed as a good archer should and the arrow went true and fast smack into the mailed chest of the squire who was thrown back in his saddle his sword dropped to the ground as his horse swerved hard to its left going in front of sir simon colley wrenched his reins and reached for sir simon who clutched at his outstretched hand and then half ran and was half carried away into the trees thomas had dragged a second arrow from the bag but by the time he loosed it the two men were half hidden by trees and the arrow glanced off a branch and was lost among the leaves thomas swore colley had stared straight at thomas for an instant sir simon had also seen him and thomas a third arrow on his string just stared at the trees as he understood that everything had just fallen apart in one instant everything he ran back to the clearing by the stream youre to take the countess to the town he told jake and sam but for christs sake go carefully theyll be searching for us soon youll have to sneak back they stared at him not understanding and thomas told them what had happened how he had killed sir simons squire and how that made him both a murderer and a fugitive he had been seen by sir simon and by the yellowhaired colley and they would both be witnesses at his trial and celebrants at his execution he told jeanette the same in french you can trust jake and sam he told her but you mustnt be caught going home you have to go carefully jake and sam argued but thomas knew well enough what the consequences of the killing arrow were tell will what happened he told them blame it all on me and say ill wait for him at quatre vents that was a village the hellequin had laid waste south of la rochederrien tell him id like his advice jeanette tried to persuade him that his panic was unnecessary perhaps they did not recognize you she suggested they recognized me my lady thomas said grimly he smiled ruefully i am sorry but at least you have your armour and sword hide them well he pulled himself into sir simons saddle quatre vents he told jake and sam then spurred southwards through the trees he was a murderer a wanted man and a fugitive and that meant he was any mans prey alone in the wilderness made by the hellequin he had no idea what he should do or where he could go only that if he was to survive then he must ride like the devils horseman that he was so he did quatre vents had been a small village scarce larger than hookton with a gaunt barnlike church a cluster of cottages where cows and people had shared the same thatched roofs a water mill and some outlying farms crouched in sheltered valleys only the stone walls of the church and mill were left now the rest was just ashes dust and weeds the blossom was blowing from the untended orchards when thomas arrived on a horse sweated white by its long journey he released the stallion to graze in a wellhedged and overgrown pasture then took himself into the woods above the church he was shaken nervous and frightened for what had seemed like a game had twisted his life into darkness not a few hours before he had been an archer in englands army and though his future might not have appealed to the young men with whom he had rioted in oxford thomas had been certain he would at least rise as high as will skeat he had imagined himself leading a band of soldiers becoming wealthy following his black bow to fortune and even rank but now he was a hunted man he was in such panic that he began to doubt will skeats reaction fearing that skeat would be so disgusted at the failure of the ambush that he would arrest thomas and lead him back to a ropedancing end in la rochederriens marketplace he worried that jeanette would have been caught going back to the town would they charge her with murder too he shivered as night fell he was twentytwo years old he had failed utterly he was alone and he was lost he woke in a cold drizzling dawn hares raced across the pasture where sir simon jekylls destrier cropped the grass thomas opened the purse he kept under his mail coat and counted his coins there was the gold from sir simons saddle pouch and his own few coins so he was not poor but like most of the hellequin he left the bulk of his money in will skeats keeping even when they were out raiding there were always some men left in la rochederrien to keep an eye on the hoard what would he do he had a bow and some arrows and perhaps he could walk to gascony though he had no idea how far that was but at least he knew there were english garrisons there who would surely welcome another trained archer or perhaps he could find a way to cross the channel go home find another name start again except he had no home what he must never do was find himself within a hanging ropes distance of sir simon jekyll the hellequin arrived shortly after midday the archers rode into the village first followed by the menatarms who were escorting a onehorse wagon that had wooden hoops supporting a flapping cover of brown cloth father hobbe and will skeat rode beside the wagon which puzzled thomas for he had never known the hellequin use such a vehicle before but then skeat and the priest broke away from the menatarms and spurred their horses towards the field where the stallion grazed the two men stopped by the hedge and skeat cupped his hands and shouted towards the woods come on out you daft bastard thomas emerged very sheepishly to be greeted with an ironic cheer from the archers skeat regarded him sourly gods bones tom he said but the devil did a bad thing when he humped your mother father hobbe tutted at wills blasphemy then raised a hand in blessing you missed a fine sight tom he said cheerfully sir simon coming home to la roche half naked and bleeding like a stuck pig ill hear your confession before we go dont grin you stupid bastard skeat snapped sweet christ tom but if you do a job do it proper do it proper why did you leave the bastard alive i missed then you go and kill some poor bastard squire instead sweet christ but youre a goddamn bloody fool i suppose they want to hang me thomas asked oh no skeat said in feigned surprise of course not they want to feast you hang garlands round your neck and give you a dozen virgins to warm your bed what the hell do you think they want to do with you of course they want you dead and i swore on my mothers life id bring you back if i found you alive does he look alive to you father father hobbe examined thomas he looks very dead to me master skeat he bloody deserves to be dead the daft bastard did the countess get safe home thomas asked she got home if thats what you mean skeat said but what do you think sir simon wanted the moment hed covered up his shrivelled prick to have her house searched tom for some armour and a sword that were legitimately his hes not such a daft fool he knows you and she were together thomas cursed and skeat repeated the blasphemy so they pressed her two servants and they admitted the countess planned everything they did what thomas asked they pressed them skeat repeated which meant that the old couple had been put flat on the ground and had stones piled on their chests the old girl squealed everything at the first stone so they were hardly hurt skeat went on and now sir simon wants to charge her ladyship with murder and naturally he had her house searched for the sword and armour but they found nowt because i had them and her hidden well away but shes still as deep in the shit as you are you cant just go about sticking crossbow bolts into knights and slaughtering squires tom it upsets the order of things im sorry will thomas said so the long and the brief of it skeat said is that the countess is seeking the protection of her husbands uncle he jerked a thumb at the cart shes in that together with her bairn two bruised servants a suit of armour and a sword sweet jesus thomas said staring at the cart you put her there skeat growled not him and i had the devils own business keeping her hid from sir simon dick totesham suspects im up to no good and he dont approve though he took my word in the end but i still had to promise to drag you back by the scruff of your miserable neck but i havent seen you tom im sorry will thomas said again you bloody well should be sorry skeat said though he was exuding a quiet satisfaction that he had managed to clean up thomass mess so efficiently jake and sam had not been seen by sir simon or his surviving manatarms so they were safe thomas was a fugitive and jeanette had been safely smuggled out of la rochederrien before sir simon could make her life into utter misery shes travelling to guingamp skeat went on and im sending a dozen men to escort her and god only knows if the enemy will respect their flag of truce if i had a lick of bloody sense id skin you alive and make a bowcover out of your hide yes will thomas said meekly dont bloody yes will me skeat said what are you going to do with the few days youve got left to live i dont know skeat sniffed you could grow up for a start though theres probably scant chance of that happening right lad he braced himself taking charge i took your money from the chest so here it is he handed thomas a leather pouch and ive put three sheaves of arrows in the ladys cart and thatll keep you for a few days if youve got any sense which you aint then youd go south or north you could go to gascony but its a hell of a long walk flanders is closer and has plenty of english troops wholl probably take you in if theyre desperate thats my advice lad go north and hope sir simon never goes to flanders thank you thomas said but how do you get to flanders skeat asked walk thomas suggested gods bones will said but youre a useless wormeaten piece of lousy meat walk dressed like that and carrying a bow and you might just as well just cut your own throat itll be quicker than letting the french do it you might find this useful father hobbe intervened and offered thomas a black cloth bundle which on unrolling proved to be the robe of a dominican friar you speak latin tom the priest said so you could pass for a wandering preacher if anyone challenges you say youre travelling from avignon to aachen thomas thanked him do many dominicans travel with a bow he asked lad father hobbe said sadly i can unbutton your breeches and i can point you down wind but even with the good lords help i cant piss for you in other words skeat said work it out for yourself you got yourself in this bloody mess tom so you get yourself out i enjoyed your company lad thought youd be useless when i first saw you and you werent but you are now but be lucky boy he held out his hand and thomas shook it you might as well go to guingamp with the countess skeat finished and then find your own way but father hobbe wants to save your soul first god knows why father hobbe dismounted and led thomas into the roofless church where grass and weeds now grew between the flagstones he insisted on hearing a confession and thomas was feeling abject enough to sound contrite father hobbe sighed when it was done you killed a man tom he said heavily and it is a great sin father thomas began no no tom no excuses the church says that to kill in battle is a duty a man owes to his lord but you killed outside the law that poor squire what offence did he give you and he had a mother tom think of her no youve sinned grievously and i must give you a grievous penance thomas on his knees looked up to see a buzzard sliding between the thinning clouds above the churchs scorched walls then father hobbe stepped closer looming above him ill not have you muttering paternosters tom the priest said but something hard something very hard he put his hand on thomass hair your penance is to keep the promise you made to your father he paused to hear thomass response but the young man was silent you hear me father hobbe demanded fiercely yes father you will find the lance of saint george thomas and return it to england that is your penance and now he changed into execrable latin in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit i absolve you he made the sign of the cross dont waste your life tom i think i already have father youre just young it seems like that when youre young lifes nothing but joy or misery when youre young he helped thomas up from his knees youre not hanging from a gibbet are you youre alive tom and theres a deal of life in you yet he smiled i have a feeling we shall meet again thomas made his farewells then watched as will skeat collected sir simon jekylls horse and led the hellequin eastwards leaving the wagon and its small escort in the ruined village the leader of the escort was called hugh boltby one of skeats better menatarms and he reckoned they would likely meet the enemy the next day somewhere close to guingamp he would hand the countess over then ride back to join skeat and youd best not be dressed as an archer tom he added thomas walked beside the wagon that was driven by pierre the old man who had been pressed by sir simon jeanette did not invite thomas inside indeed she pretended he did not exist though next morning after they had camped in an abandoned farm she laughed at the sight of him dressed in the friars robe im sorry about what happened thomas said to her jeanette shrugged it may be for the best i probably should have gone to duke charles last year why didnt you my lady he hasnt always been kind to me she said wistfully but i think that might have changed by now she had persuaded herself that the dukes attitude might have altered because of the letters she had sent to him letters that would help him when he led his troops against the garrison at la rochederrien she also needed to believe the duke would welcome her for she desperately needed a safe home for her son charles who was enjoying the adventure of riding in a swaying creaking wagon together they would both start a new life in guingamp and jeanette had woken with optimism about that new life she had been forced to leave la rochederrien in a frantic hurry putting into the cart just the retrieved armour the sword and some clothes though she had some money that thomas suspected will had given to her but her real hopes were pinned on duke charles who she told thomas would surely find her a house and lend her money in advance of the missing rents from plabennec he is sure to like charles dont you think she asked thomas im sure thomas said glancing at jeanettes son who was shaking the wagons reins and clicking his tongue in a vain effort to make the horse go quicker but what will you do jeanette asked ill survive thomas said unwilling to admit that he did not know what he would do go to flanders probably if he could ever reach there join another troop of archers and pray nightly that sir simon jekyll never came his way again as for his penance the lance he had no idea how he was to find it or having found it retrieve it jeanette on that second day of the journey decided thomas was a friend after all when we get to guingamp she told him you find somewhere to stay and i shall persuade the duke to give you a pass even a wandering friar will be helped by a pass from the duke of brittany but no friar ever carried a bow let alone a long english war bow and thomas did not know what to do with the weapon he was loath to abandon it but the sight of some charred timbers in the abandoned farmhouse gave him an idea he broke off a short length of blackened timber and lashed it crosswise to the unstrung bowstave so that it resembled a pilgrims crossstaff he remembered a dominican visiting hookton with just such a staff the friar his hair cropped so short he looked bald had preached a fiery sermon outside the church until thomass father became tired of his ranting and sent him on his way and thomas now reckoned he would have to pose as just such a man jeanette suggested he tied flowers to the staff to disguise it further and so he wrapped it with clovers that grew tall and ragged in the abandoned fields the wagon hauled by a bony horse that had been plundered from lannion lurched and lumbered southwards the menatarms became ever more cautious as they neared guingamp fearing an ambush of crossbow bolts from the woods that pressed close to the deserted road one of the men had a hunting horn that he sounded constantly to warn the enemy of their approach and to signal that they came in peace while boltby had a strip of white cloth hanging from the tip of his lance there was no ambush but a few miles short of guingamp they came in sight of a ford where a band of enemy soldiers waited two menatarms and a dozen crossbowmen ran forward their weapons cocked and boltby summoned thomas from the wagon talk to them he ordered thomas was nervous what do i say give them a bloody blessing for christs sake boltby said disgusted and tell them were here in peace so with a beating heart and a dry mouth thomas walked down the road the black gown flapped awkwardly about his ankles as he waved his hands at the crossbowmen lower your weapons he called in french lower your weapons the englishmen come in peace one of the horsemen spurred forward his shield bore the same white ermine badge that duke johns men carried though these supporters of duke charles had surrounded the ermine with a blue wreath on which fleursdelis had been painted who are you father the horseman demanded thomas opened his mouth to answer but no words came he gaped up at the horseman who had a reddish moustache and oddly yellow eyes a hardlooking bastard thomas thought and he raised a hand to touch saint guineforts paw perhaps the saint inspired him for he was suddenly possessed of devilment and began to enjoy playing a priests role i am merely one of gods humbler children my son he answered unctuously are you english the manatarms demanded suspiciously thomass french was near perfect but it was the french spoken by englands rulers rather than the language of france itself thomas again felt panic fluttering in his breast but he bought time by making the sign of the cross and as his hand moved so inspiration came to him i am a scotsman my son he said and that allayed the yelloweyed mans suspicions the scots had ever been frances ally thomas knew nothing of scotland but doubted many frenchmen or bretons did either for it was far away and by all accounts a most uninviting place skeat always said it was a country of bog rock and heathen bastards who were twice as difficult to kill as any frenchman i am a scotsman thomas repeated who brings a kinswoman of the duke out of the hands of the english the manatarms glanced at the wagon a kinswoman of duke charles is there another duke thomas asked innocently she is the countess of armorica he went on and her son who is with her is the dukes grandnephew and a count in his own right the english have held them prisoner these six months but by gods good grace they have relented and set her free the duke i know will want to welcome her thomas laid on jeanettes rank and relationship to the duke as thick as newly skimmed cream and the enemy swallowed it whole they allowed the wagon to continue and thomas watched as hugh boltby led his men away at a swift trot eager to put as much distance as possible between themselves and the crossbowmen the leader of the enemys menatarms talked with jeanette and seemed impressed by her hauteur he would he said be honoured to escort the countess to guingamp though he warned her that the duke was not there but was still returning from paris he was said to be at rennes now a city that lay a good days journey to the east you will take me as far as rennes jeanette asked thomas you want me to my lady a young man is useful she said pierre is old she gestured at the servant and has lost his strength besides if youre going to flanders then you will need to cross the river at rennes so thomas kept her company for the three days that it took the painfully slow wagon to make the journey they needed no escort beyond guingamp for there was small danger of any english raiders this far east in brittany and the road was well patrolled by the dukes forces the countryside looked strange to thomas for he had become accustomed to rank fields untended orchards and deserted villages but here the farms were busy and prosperous the churches were bigger and had stained glass and fewer and fewer folk spoke breton this was still brittany but the language was french they stayed in country taverns that had fleas in the straw jeanette and her son were given what passed for the best room while thomas shared the stables with the two servants they met two priests on the road but neither suspected that thomas was an imposter he greeted them in latin which he spoke better than they did and both men wished him a good day and a fervent godspeed thomas could almost feel their relief when he did not engage them in further conversation the dominicans were not popular with parish priests the friars were priests themselves but were charged with the suppression of heresy so a visitation by the dominicans suggested that a parish priest has not been doing his duty and even a rough wild and young friar like thomas was unwelcome they reached rennes in the afternoon there were dark clouds in the east against which the city loomed larger than any place thomas had ever seen the walls were twice as high as those at lannion or la rochederrien and had towers with pointed roofs every few yards to serve as buttresses from which crossbowmen could pour bolts on any attacking force above the walls higher even than the turrets the church towers or the cathedral was the citadel a stronghold of pale stone hung with banners the smell of the city wafted westwards on a chill wind a stink of sewage tanneries and smoke the guards at the western gate became excited when they discovered the arrows in the wagon but jeanette persuaded them that they were trophies she was taking to the duke then they wanted to levy a customs duty on the fine armour and jeanette harangued them again using her title and the dukes name liberally the soldiers eventually gave in and allowed the wagon into the narrow streets where shopwares protruded onto the roadway beggars ran beside the wagon and soldiers jostled thomas who was leading the horse the city was crammed with soldiers most of the menatarms were wearing the wreathed white ermine badge but many had the green grail of genoa on their tunics and the presence of so many troops confirmed that the duke was indeed in the city and readying himself for the campaign that would eject the english from brittany they found a tavern beneath the cathedrals looming twin towers jeanette wanted to ready herself for her audience with the duke and demanded a private room though all she got for her cash was a spiderhaunted space beneath the taverns eaves the innkeeper a sallow fellow with a twitch suggested thomas would be happier in the dominican friary that lay by the church of saint germain north of the cathedral but thomas declared his mission was to be among sinners not saints and so the innkeeper grudgingly said he could sleep in jeanettes wagon that was parked in the inn yard but no preaching father the man added no preaching theres enough of that in the city without spoiling the three keys jeanettes maid brushed her mistresss hair then coiled and pinned the black tresses into rams horns that covered her ears jeanette put on a red velvet dress that had escaped the sack of her house and which had a skirt that fell from just beneath her breasts to the floor while the bodice intricately embroidered with cornflowers and daisies hooked tight up to her neck its sleeves were full trimmed with fox fur and dropped to her red shoes which had horn buckles her hat matched the dress and was trimmed with the same fur and a blueblack veil of lace she spat on her sons face and rubbed off the dirt then led him down to the tavern yard do you think the veil is right she asked thomas anxiously thomas shrugged it looks right to me no the colour is it right with the red he nodded hiding his astonishment he had never seen her dressed so fashionably she looked like a countess now while her son was in a clean smock and had his hair wetted and smoothed youre to meet your greatuncle jeanette told charles licking a finger and rubbing at some more dirt on his cheek and hes nephew to the king of france which means youre related to the king yes you are arent you a lucky boy charles recoiled from his mothers fussing but she did not notice for she was busy instructing pierre her manservant to stow the armour and sword in a great sack she wanted the duke to see the armour i want him to know she told thomas that when my son comes of age he will fight for him pierre who claimed to be seventy years old lifted the sack and almost fell over with the weight thomas offered to carry it to the citadel instead but jeanette would not hear of it you might pass for a scotsman among the common folk but the dukes entourage will have men who may have visited the place she smoothed wrinkles from the red velvet skirt you wait here she told thomas and ill send pierre back with a message maybe even some money im sure the duke is going to be generous i shall demand a pass for you what name shall i use a scots name just thomas the friar as soon as he sees you she was now talking to her son hell open his purse wont he of course he will pierre managed to hoist the armour onto his shoulder without falling over and jeanette took her sons hand i shall send you a message she promised thomas gods blessing my child thomas said and may the blessed saint guinefort watch over you jeanette wrinkled her nose at that mention of saint guinefort who she had learned from thomas was really a dog i shall put my trust in saint renan she said reprovingly and with those words she left pierre and his wife followed her and thomas waited in the yard offering blessings to ostlers stray cats and tapmen be mad enough his father had once said and they will either lock you away or make you a saint the night fell damp and cold with a gusting wind sighing in the cathedrals towers and rustling the taverns thatch thomas thought of the penance that father hobbe had demanded was the lance real had it truly smashed through a dragons scales pierced the ribs and riven a heart in which cold blood flowed he thought it was real his father had believed and his father though he might have been mad had been no fool and the lance had looked old so very old thomas had used to pray to saint george but he no longer did and that made him feel guilty so that he dropped to his knees beside the wagon and asked the saint to forgive him his sins to forgive him for the squires murder and for impersonating a friar i do not mean to be a bad person he told the dragon killer but it is so easy to forget heaven and the saints and if you wish he prayed i will find the lance but you must tell me what to do with it should he restore it to hookton that so far as thomas knew no longer existed or should he return it to whoever had owned it before his grandfather stole it and who was his grandfather and why had his father hidden from his family and why had the family sought him out to take the lance back thomas did not know and for the past three years he had not cared but suddenly in the tavern yard he found himself consumed by curiosity he did have a family somewhere his grandfather had been a soldier and a thief but who was he he added a prayer to saint george to allow him to discover them praying for rain father one of the ostlers suggested i reckon were going to get it we need it thomas could have eaten in the tavern but he was suddenly nervous of the crowded room where the dukes soldiers and their women sang boasted and brawled nor could he face the landlords sly suspicions the man was curious why thomas did not go to the friary and even more curious why a friar should travel with a beautiful woman she is my cousin thomas had told the man who had pretended to believe the lie but thomas had no desire to face more questions and so he stayed in the yard and made a poor meal from the dry bread sour onions and hard cheese that was the only food left in the wagon it began to rain and he retreated into the wagon and listened to the drops patter on the canvas cover he thought of jeanette and her little son being fed sugared delicacies on silver plates before sleeping between clean linen sheets in some tapestryhung bedchamber and then began to feel sorry for himself he was a fugitive jeanette was his only ally and she was too high and mighty for him bells announced the shutting of the citys gates watchmen walked the streets looking for fires that could destroy a city in a few hours sentries shivered on the walls and duke charless banners flew from the citadels summit thomas was among his enemies protected by nothing more than wit and a dominicans robe and he was alone jeanette became increasingly nervous as she approached the citadel but she had persuaded herself that charles of blois would accept her as a dependant once he met her son who was named for him and jeanettes husband had always said that the duke would like jeanette if only he could get to know her better it was true that the duke had been cold in the past but her letters must have convinced him of her allegiance and at the very least she was certain he would possess the chivalry to look after a woman in distress to her surprise it was easier to enter the citadel than it had been to negotiate the city gate the sentries waved her across the drawbridge beneath the arch and so into a great courtyard ringed with stables mews and storehouses a score of menatarms were practising with their swords which in the gloom of the late afternoon generated bright sparks more sparks flowed from a smithy where a horse was being shoed and jeanette caught the whiff of burning hoof mingling with the stink of a dungheap and the reek of a decomposing corpse which hung in chains high on the courtyard wall a laconic and misspelled placard pronounced the man to have been a thief a steward guided her through a second arch and so into a great cold chamber where a score of petitioners waited to see the duke a clerk took her name raising an eyebrow in silent surprise when she announced herself his grace will be told of your presence the man said in a bored voice then dismissed jeanette to a stone bench that ran along one of the halls high walls pierre lowered the armour to the floor and squatted beside it while jeanette sat some of the petitioners paced up and down clutching scrolls and silently mouthing the words they would use when they saw the duke while others complained to the clerks that they had already been waiting three four or even five days how much longer a dog lifted its leg against a pillar then two small boys six or seven years old ran into the hall with mock wooden swords they gazed at the petitioners for a second then ran up some stairs that were guarded by menatarms were they the dukes sons jeanette wondered and she imagined charles making friends with the boys youre going to be happy here she told him im hungry mama we shall eat soon she waited two women strolled along the gallery at the head of the stairs wearing pale dresses made of expensive linen that seemed to float as they walked and jeanette suddenly felt shabby in her wrinkled red velvet you must be polite to the duke she told charles who was getting fretful from hunger you kneel to him can you do that show me how you kneel i want to go home charles said just for mama show me how you kneel thats good jeanette ruffled her sons hair in praise then immediately tried to stroke it back into place from upstairs came the sound of a sweet harp and a breathy flute and jeanette thought longingly of the life she wanted a life fit for a countess edged with music and handsome men elegance and power she would rebuild plabennec though with what she did not know but she would make the tower larger and have a staircase like the one in this hall an hour passed then another it was dark now and the hall was dimly lit by two burning torches that sent smoke into the fan tracery of the high roof charles became ever more petulant so jeanette took him in her arms and tried to rock him to sleep two priests arm in arm came slowly down the stairs laughing and then a servant in the dukes livery ran down and all the petitioners straightened and looked at the man expectantly he crossed to the clerks table spoke there for a moment then turned and bowed to jeanette she stood you will wait here she told her two servants the other petitioners stared at her resentfully she had been the last to enter the hall yet she was the first to be summoned charles dragged his feet and jeanette struck him lightly on the head to remind him of his manners the servant walked silently beside her his grace is in good health jeanette asked nervously the servant did not reply but just led her up the stairs then turned right down the gallery where rain spat through open windows they went under an arch and up a further flight of steps at the top of which the servant threw open a high door the count of armorica he announced and his mother the room was evidently in one of the citadels turrets for it was circular a great fireplace was built into one side while cruciform arrow slits opened onto the grey wet darkness beyond the walls the circular chamber itself was brilliantly lit by forty or fifty candles that cast their light over hanging tapestries a great polished table a chair a priedieu carved with scenes from christs passion and a furcovered couch the floor was soft with deerskins two clerks worked at a smaller table while the duke gorgeous in a deep blue robe edged with ermine and with a cap to match sat at the great table a middleaged priest gaunt whitehaired and narrow faced stood beside the priedieu and watched jeanette with an expression of distaste jeanette curtsied to the duke and nudged charles kneel she whispered charles began crying and hid his face in his mothers skirts the duke flinched at the childs noise but said nothing he was still young though closer to thirty than to twenty and had a pale watchful face he was thin had a fair beard and moustache and long bony white hands that were clasped in front of his downturned mouth his reputation was that of a learned and pious man but there was a petulance in his expression that made jeanette wary she wished he would speak but all four men in the room just watched her in silence i have the honour of presenting your graces grandnephew jeanette said pushing her crying son forward the count of armorica the duke looked at the boy his face betrayed nothing he is named charles jeanette said but she might as well have stayed silent for the duke still said nothing the silence was broken only by the childs whimpering and the crackle of flames in the great hearth i trust your grace received my letters jeanette said nervously the priest suddenly spoke making jeanette jump with surprise you came here he said in a high voice with a servant carrying a burden what is in it jeanette realized they must have thought she had brought the duke a gift and she blushed for she had not thought to bring one even a small token would have been a tactful gesture but she had simply not remembered that courtesy it contains my dead husbands armour and sword she said which i rescued from the english who have otherwise left me with nothing nothing i am keeping the armour and sword for my son so that one day he can use them to fight for his liege lord she bowed her head to the duke the duke steepled his fingers to jeanette it seemed he never blinked and that was as unsettling as his silence his grace would like to see the armour the priest announced though the duke had shown no sign of wishing anything at all the priest snapped his fingers and one of the clerks left the room the second clerk armed with a small pair of scissors went round the big chamber trimming the wicks of the many candles in their tall iron holders the duke and the priest ignored him you say the priest spoke again that you wrote letters to his grace concerning what i wrote about the new defences at la rochederrien father and i warned his grace of the english attack on lannion so you say the priest saids o you say charles was still crying and jeanette jerked his hand hard in the hope of stilling him but he just whined more the clerk head averted from the duke went from candle to candle the scissors snipped a puff of smoke would writhe for a heartbeat then the flame would brighten and settle charles began crying louder his grace the priest said does not like snivelling infants he is hungry father jeanette explained nervously you came with two servants yes father jeanette said they can eat with the boy in the kitchens the priest said and snapped his fingers towards the candletrimming clerk who abandoning his scissors on a rug took the frightened charles by the hand the boy did not want to leave his mother but he was dragged away and jean ette flinched as the sound of his crying receded down the stairs the duke other than steepling his fingers had not moved he just watched jeanette with an unreadable expression you say the priest took up the questioning again that the english left you with nothing they stole all i had the priest flinched at the passion in her voice if they left you destitute madame then why did you not come for our help earlier i did not wish to be a burden father but now you do wish to become a burden jeanette frowned i have brought his graces nephew the lord of plabennec or would you rather that he grew up among the english do not be impertinent child the priest said placidly the first clerk reentered the room carrying the sack which he emptied on the deerskins in front of the dukes table the duke gazed at the armour for a few seconds then settled back in his high carved chair it is very fine the priest declared it is most precious jeanette agreed the duke peered again at the armour not a muscle of his face moved his grace approves the priest said then gestured with a long white hand and the clerk who seemed to understand what was wanted without words gathered up the sword and armour and carried them from the room i am glad your grace approves jeanette said and dropped another curtsy she had a confused idea that the duke despite her earlier words had assumed the armour and sword were a gift but she did not want to enquire it could all be cleared up later a gust of cold wind came through the arrow slits to bring spots of rain and to flicker the candles in wild shudders so what the priest asked do you require of us my son needs shelter father jeanette said nervously he needs a house a place to grow and learn to be a warrior his grace is pleased to grant that request the priest said jeanette felt a great wash of relief the atmosphere in the room was so unfriendly that she had feared she would be thrown out as destitute as she had arrived but the priests words though coldly stated told her that she need not have worried the duke was taking his responsibility and she curtsied for a third time i am grateful your grace the priest was about to respond but to jeanettes surprise the duke held up one long white hand and the priest bowed it is our pleasure the duke said in an oddly highpitched voice for your son is dear to us and it is our desire that he grows to become a warrior like his father he turned to the priest and inclined his head and the priest gave another stately bow then left the room the duke stood and walked to the fire where he held his hands to the small flames it has come to our notice he said distantly that the rents of plabennec have not been paid these twelve quarters the english are in possession of the domain your grace and you are in debt to me the duke said frowning at the flames if you protect my son your grace then i shall be for ever in your debt jeanette said humbly the duke took off his cap and ran a hand through his fair hair jeanette thought he looked younger and kinder without the hat but his next words chilled her i did not want henri to marry you he stopped abruptly for a heartbeat jeanette was struck dumb by his frankness my husband regretted your graces disapproval she finally said in a small voice the duke ignored jeanettes words he should have married lisette of picard she had money lands tenants she would have brought our family great wealth in times of trouble wealth is a he paused trying to find the right word it is a cushion you madame have no cushion only your graces kindness jeanette said your son is my charge the duke said he will be raised in my household and trained in the arts of war and civilization as befits his rank i am grateful jeanette was tired of grovelling she wanted some sign of affection from the duke but ever since he had walked to the hearth he would not meet her eyes now suddenly he turned on her there is a lawyer called belas in la rochederrien indeed your grace he tells me your mother was a jewess he spat the last word jeanette gaped at him for a few heartbeats she was unable to speak her mind was reeling with disbelief that belas would say such a thing but at last she managed to shake her head she was not she protested he tells us too the duke went on that you petitioned edward of england for the rents of plabennec what choice did i have and that your son was made a ward of edwards the duke asked pointedly jeanette opened and closed her mouth the accusations were coming so thick and fast she did not know how to defend herself it was true that her son had been named a ward of king edwards but it had not been jeanettes doing indeed she had not even been present when the earl of northampton made that decision but before she could protest or explain the duke spoke again belas tells us he said that many in the town of la rochederrien have expressed satisfaction with the english occupiers some have jeanette admitted and that you madame have english soldiers in your own house guarding you they forced themselves on my house she said indignantly your grace must believe me i did not want them there the duke shook his head it seems to us madame that you have given a welcome to our enemies your father was a vintner was he not jeanette was too astonished to say anything it was slowly dawning on her that belas had betrayed her utterly yet she still clung to the hope that the duke would be convinced of her innocence i offered them no welcome she insisted i fought against them merchants the duke said have no loyalties other than to money they have no honour honour is not learned madame it is bred just as you breed a horse for bravery and speed or a hound for agility and ferocity so you breed a nobleman for honour you cannot turn a ploughhorse into a destrier nor a merchant into a gentleman it is against nature and the laws of god he made the sign of the cross your son is count of armorica and we shall raise him in honour but you madame are the daughter of a merchant and a jewess it is not true jeanette protested do not shout at me madame the duke said icily you are a burden on me you dare to come here tricked out in fox fur expecting me to give you shelter what else money i will give your son a home but you madame i shall give you a husband he walked towards her his feet silent on the deerskin rugs you are not fit to be the count of armoricas mother you have offered comfort to the enemy you have no honour i jeanette began to protest again but the duke slapped her hard across the cheek you will be silent madame he commandeds ilent he pulled at the laces of her bodice and when she dared to resist he slapped her again you are a whore madame the duke said then lost patience with the intricate crosslaces retrieved the discarded scissors from the rug and used them to cut through the laces to expose jeanettes breasts she was so astonished stunned and horrified that she made no attempt to protect herself this was not sir simon jekyll but her liege lord the kings nephew and her husbands uncle you are a pretty whore madame the duke said with a sneer how did you enchant henri was it jewish witcheraft no jeanette whimpered please no the duke unhooked his gown and jeanette saw he was naked beneath no she said again please no the duke pushed her hard so that she fell on the bed his face still showed no emotion not lust not pleasure not anger he hauled her skirts up then knelt on the bed and raped her with no sign of enjoyment he seemed if anything angry and when he was done he collapsed on her then shuddered jeanette was weeping he wiped himself on her velvet skirt i shall take that experience he said as payment of the missing rents from plabennec he crawled off her stood and hooked the ermine edges of his gown you will be placed in a chamber here madame and tomorrow i shall give you in marriage to one of my menatarms your son will stay here but you will go wherever your new husband is posted jeanette was whimpering on the bed the duke grimaced with distaste then crossed the room and kneeled on the priedieu arrange your gown madame he said coldly and compose yourself jeanette rescued enough of the cut laces to tie her bodice into place then looked at the duke through the candle flames you have no honour she hissed you have no honour the duke ignored her he rang a small handbell then clasped his hands and closed his eyes in prayer he was still praying when the priest and a servant came and without a word took jeanette by her arms and walked her to a small room on the floor beneath the dukes chamber they thrust her inside shut the door and she heard a bolt slide into place on the far side there was a strawfilled mattress and a stack of brooms in the makeshift cell but no other furnishing she lay on the mattress and sobbed till her broken heart was raw the wind howled at the window and rain beat on its shutters and jeanette wished she was dead the citys cockerels woke thomas to a brisk wind and pouring rain that beat on the carts leaking cover he opened the flap and sat watching the puddles spread across the cobbles of the inn yard no message had come from jeanette nor he thought would there be one will skeat had been right she was as hard as mail and now she was in her proper place which in this cold wet dawn was probably a deep bed in a room warmed by a fire tended by the dukes servants she would have forgotten thomas and what message thomas asked himself had he been expecting a declaration of affection he knew that was what he wanted but he persuaded himself he merely waited so jeanette could send him the pass signed by the duke yet he knew he did not need a pass he must just walk east and north and trust that the dominicans robe protected him he had little idea how to reach flanders but had a notion that paris lay somewhere close to that region so he reckoned he would start by following the river seine which would lead him from rennes to paris his biggest worry was that he would meet some real dominican on the road who would quickly discover thomas had only the haziest notion of the brotherhoods rules and no knowledge at all of their hierarchy but he consoled himself that scottish dominicans were probably so far from civilization that such ignorance would be expected of them he would survive he told himself he stared at the rain spattering in the puddles expect nothing from jeanette he told himself and to prove that he believed that bleak prophecy he readied his small baggage it irked him to leave the mail coat behind but it weighed too much so he stowed it in the wagon then put the three sheaves of arrows into a sack the seventytwo arrows were heavy and their points threatened to tear open the sack but he was reluctant to travel without the sheaves that were wrapped in hempen bowstring cord and he used one cord to tie his knife to his left leg where like his money pouch it was hidden by the black robe he was ready to go but the rain was now hammering the city like an arrow storm thunder crackled to the west the rain pelted on the thatch poured off the roofs and overflowed the water butts to wash the inns nightsoil out of the yard midday came heralded by the citys rainmuffled bells and still the city drowned winddriven dark clouds wreathed the cathedrals towers and thomas told himself he would leave the moment the rain slackened but the storm just became fiercer lightning flickered above the cathedral and a clap of thunder rocked the city thomas shivered awed by the skys fury he watched the lightning reflected in the cathedrals great west window and was amazed by the sight so much glass still it rained and he began to fear that he would be trapped in the cart till the next day and then just after a peal of thunder seemed to stun the whole city with its violence he saw jeanette he did not know her at first he just saw a woman standing in the arched entrance to the inns yard with the water flowing about her shoes everyone else in rennes was huddling in shelter but this woman suddenly appeared soaked and miserable her hair which had been looped so carefully over her ears hung lank and black down the sopping red velvet dress and it was that dress that thomas recognized then he saw the grief on her face he clambered out of the wagon jeanette she was weeping her mouth distorted by grief she seemed incapable of speaking but just stood and cried my lady thomas said jeanette we must go she managed to say we must go she had used soot as a cosmetic about her eyes and it had run to make grey streaks down her face we cant go in this thomas said we must go she screamed at him angrily we must go ill get the horse thomas said theres no time theres no time she plucked at his robe we must go now she tried to tug him through the arch into the street thomas pulled away from her and ran to the wagon where he retrieved his disguised bow and the heavy sack there was a cloak of jeanettes there and he took that too and wrapped it about her shoulders though she did not seem to notice whats happening thomas demanded theyll find me here theyll find me jeanette declared in a panic and she pulled him blindly out of the taverns archway thomas turned her eastwards onto a crooked street that led to a fine stone bridge across the seine and then to a city gate the big gates were barred but a small door in one of the gates was open and the guards in the tower did not care if some fool of a drenched friar wanted to take a madly sobbing woman out of the city jeanette kept looking back fearing pursuit but still did not explain her panic or her tears to thomas she just hurried eastwards insensible to the rain wind and thunder the storm eased towards dusk by which time they were close to a village that had a poor excuse for a tavern thomas ducked under the low doorway and asked for shelter he put coins on a table i need shelter for my sister he said reckoning that anyone would be suspicious of a friar travelling with a woman shelter food and a fire he said adding another coin your sister the tavernkeeper a small man with a face scarred by the pox and bulbous with wens peered at jeanette who was crouched in the taverns porch thomas touched his head suggesting she was mad i am taking her to the shrine of saint guinefort he explained the tavernkeeper looked at the coins glanced again at jeanette then decided the strange pair could have the use of an empty cattle byre you can put a fire there he said grudgingly but dont burn the thatch thomas lit a fire with embers from the taverns kitchen then fetched food and ale he forced jeanette to eat some of the soup and bread then made her go close to the fire it took over two hours of coaxing before she would tell him the story and telling it only made her cry again thomas listened appalled so how did you escape he asked when she was finished a woman had unbolted the room jeanette said to fetch a broom the woman had been astonished to see jeanette there and even more astonished when jeanette ran past her jeanette had fled the citadel fearing the soldiers would stop her but no one had taken any notice of her and now she was running away like thomas she was a fugitive but she had lost far more than he she had lost her son her honour and her future i hate men she said she shivered for the miserable fire of damp straw and rotted wood had scarcely dried her clothes i hate men she said again then looked at thomas what are we going to do you must sleep he said and tomorrow well go north she nodded but he did not think she had understood his words she was in despair the wheel of fortune that had once raised her so high had taken her into the utter depths she slept for a time but when thomas woke in the grey dawn he saw she was crying softly and he did not know what to do or say so he just lay in the straw until he heard the tavern door creak open then went to fetch some food and water the tavernkeepers wife cut some bread and cheese while her husband asked thomas how far he had to walk saint guineforts shrine is in flanders thomas said flanders the man said as though it was on the far side of the moon the family doesnt know what else to do with her thomas explained and i dont know how to reach flanders i thought to go to paris first not paris the tavernkeepers wife said scornfully you must go to fougeres her father she said had often traded with the north countries and she was sure that thomass route lay through fougeres and rouen she did not know the roads beyond rouen but was certain he must go that far though to begin she said he must take a small road that went north from the village it went through woods her husband added and he must be careful for the trees were hiding places for terrible men escaping justice but after a few miles he would come to the fougeres highway which was patrolled by the dukes men thomas thanked her offered a blessing to the house then took the food to jeanette who refused to eat she seemed drained of tears almost of life but she followed thomas willingly enough as he walked north the road deep rutted by wagons and slick with mud from the previous days rain twisted into deep woods that dripped with water jeanette stumbled for a few miles then began to cry i must go back to rennes she insisted i want to go back to my son thomas argued but she would not be moved he finally gave in but when he turned to walk south she just began to cry even harder the duke had said she was not a fit mother she kept repeating the words not fit not fit she screamed at the sky he made me his whore then she sank onto her knees beside the road and sobbed uncontrollably she was shivering again and thomas thought that if she did not die of an ague then the grief would surely kill her were going back to rennes thomas said trying to encourage her i cant she wailed hell just whore me whore me she shouted the words then began rocking back and forwards and shrieking in a terrible high voice thomas tried to raise her up tried to make her walk but she fought him she wanted to die she said she just wanted to die a whore she screamed and tore at the foxfur trimmings of her red dress a whore he said i shouldnt wear fur he made me a whore she threw the tattered fur into the undergrowth it had been a dry morning but the rain clouds were heaping in the east again and thomas was nervously watching as jeanettes soul unravelled before his eyes she refused to walk so he picked her up and carried her until he saw a welltrodden path going into the trees he followed it to find a cottage so low and with its thatch so covered with moss that at first he thought it was just a mound among the trees until he saw bluegrey woodsmoke seeping from a hole at its top thomas was worried about the outlaws who were said to haunt these woods but it was beginning to rain again and the cottage was the only refuge in sight so thomas lowered jeanette to the ground and shouted through the burrowlike entrance an old man whitehaired redeyed and with skin blackened by smoke peered back at thomas the man spoke a french so thick with local words and accent that thomas could scarcely understand him but he gathered the man was a forester and lived here with his wife and the forester looked greedily at the coins thomas offered then said that thomas and his woman could use an empty pig shelter the place stank of rotted straw and shit but the thatch was almost ramproof and jeanette did not seem to care thomas raked out the old straw then cut jeanette a bed of bracken the forester once the money was in his hands seemed little interested in his guests but in the middle of the afternoon when the rain had stopped thomas heard the foresters wife hissing at him and a few moments later the old man left and walked towards the road but without any of the tools of his trade no axe billhook or saw jeanette was sleeping exhausted so thomas stripped the dead clover plants from his black bow unlashed the crosspiece and put back the horn tips he strung the yew thrust half a dozen arrows into his belt and followed the old man as far as the road and there he waited in a thicket the forester returned towards evening with two young men whom thomas presumed were the outlaws of whom he had been warned the old man must have reckoned that thomas and his woman were fugitives for though they carried bags and money they had sought a hiding place and that was enough to raise anyones suspicions a friar did not need to skulk in the trees and women wearing dresses trimmed with torn remnants of fur did not seek a foresters hospitality so doubtless the two young men had been fetched to help slit thomass throat and then divide whatever coins they found on his body jeanettes fate would be similar but delayed thomas put his first arrow into the ground between the old mans feet and the second into a tree close by the next arrow kills he said though they could not see him for he was in the thickets shadows they just stared wideeyed at the bushes where he was hiding and thomas made his voice deep and slow you come with murder in your souls he said but i can raise the hellequin from the deeps of hell i can make the devils claws cut to your heart and have the dead haunt your daylight you will leave the friar and his sister alone the old man dropped to his knees his superstitions were as old as time and scarcely touched by christianity he believed there were trolls in the forest and giants in the mist he knew there were dragons he had heard of blackskinned men who lived on the moon and who dropped to earth when their home shrank to a sickle he understood there were ghosts who hunted among the trees all this he knew as well as he knew ash and larch oak and beech and he did not doubt that it was a demon who had spat the strangely long arrow from the thicket you must go he told his companions you must go the two fled and the old man touched his forehead to the leaf mould i meant no harm go home thomas said he waited till the old man had gone then he dug the arrow out of the tree and that night he went to the foresters cottage crawled through the low doorway and sat on the earthen floor facing the old couple i shall stay here he told them until my sisters wits are recovered we wish to hide her shame from the world that is all when we go we shall reward you but if you try to kill us again i shall summon demons to torment you and i will leave your corpses as a feast for the wild things that lurk in the trees he put another small coin on the earth floor you will bring us food each night he told the woman and you will thank god that though i can read your hearts i still forgive you they had no more trouble after that every day the old man went off into the trees with his billhook and axe and every night his wife brought her visitors gruel or bread thomas took milk from their cow shot a deer and thought jeanette would die for days she refused to eat and sometimes he would find her rocking back and forth in the noxious shed and making a keening noise thomas feared she had gone mad for ever his father would sometimes tell him how the mad were treated how he himself had been treated how starvation and beating were the only cures the devil gets into the soul father ralph had said and he can be starved out or he can be thrashed out but there is no way he will be coaxed out beat and starve boy beat and starve it is the only treatment the devil understands but thomas could neither starve nor beat jeanette so he did his best by her he kept her dry he persuaded her to take some warm milk fresh from the cow he talked with her through the nights he combed her hair and washed her face and sometimes when she was sleeping and he was sitting by the shed and staring at the stars through the tangled trees he would wonder whether he and the hellequin had left other women as broken as jeanette he prayed for forgiveness he prayed a lot in those days and not to saint guinefort but to the virgin and to saint george the prayers must have worked for he woke one dawn to see jeanette sitting in the sheds doorway with her thin body outlined by the bright new day she turned to him and he saw there was no madness in her face any more just a profound sorrow she looked at him a long time before she spoke did god send you to me thomas he showed me great favour if he did thomas replied she smiled at that the first smile he had seen on her face since rennes i have to be content she said very earnestly because my son is alive and he will be properly cared for and one day i shall find him we both shall thomas said both he grimaced i have kept none of my promises he said the lance is still in normandy sir simon lives and how i shall find your son for you i do not know i think my promises are worthless but i shall do my best she held out her hand so he could take it and she let it stay there we have been punished you and i she said probably for the sin of pride the duke was right i am no aristocrat i am a merchants daughter but thought i was higher now look at me thinner thomas said but beautiful she shuddered at that compliment where are we just a day outside rennes is that all in a pig shed thomas said a day out of rennes four years ago i lived in a castle she said wistfully plabennec wasnt large but it was beautiful it had a tower and a courtyard and two mills and a stream and an orchard that grew very red apples you will see them again thomas said you and your son he regretted mentioning her son for tears came to her eyes but she cuffed them away it was the lawyer she said lawyer belas he lied to the duke there was a kind of wonderment in her voice that belas had proved so traitorous he told the duke i was supporting duke jean then i will thomas i will i will support your duke if that is the only way to regain plabennec and find my son then i shall support duke jean she squeezed thomass hand im hungry they spent another week in the forest while jeanette recovered her strength for a while like a beast struggling to escape a trap she devised schemes that would give her instant revenge on duke charles and restore her son but the schemes were wild and hopeless and as the days passed she accepted her fate i have no friends she said to thomas one night you have me my lady they died she said ignoring him my family died my husband died do you think i am a curse on those i love i think thomas said that we must go north she was irritated by his practicality im not sure i want to go north i do thomas said stubbornly jeanette knew that the further north she went the further she went from her son but she did not know what else to do and that night as if accepting that she would now be guided by thomas she came to his bracken bed and they were lovers she wept afterwards but then made love to him again this time fiercely as though she could slake her misery in the consolations of the flesh next morning they left going north summer had come clothing the countryside in thick green thomas had disguised the bow again lashing the crosspiece to the stave and hanging it with bindweed and willowherb instead of clover his black robe had become ragged and no one would have taken him for a friar while jeanette had stripped the remains of the fox fur from the red velvet which was dirty creased and threadbare they looked like vagabonds which they were and they moved like fugitives skirting the towns and bigger villages to avoid trouble they bathed in streams slept beneath the trees and only ventured into the smallest villages when hunger demanded they buy a meal and cider in some slattemly tavern if they were challenged they claimed to be bretons brother and sister going to join their uncle who was a butcher in flanders and if anyone disbelieved the tale they were unwilling to cross thomas who was tall and strong and always kept his knife visible by preference though they avoided villages and stayed in the woods where thomas taught jeanette how to tickle the trout out of their streams they would light fires cook their fish and cut bracken for a bed they kept close to the road though they were forced to a long detour to avoid the drumlike fortress of staubinducormier and another to skirt the city of fougeres and somewhere north of that city they entered normandy they milked cows in their pastures stole a great cheese from a wagon parked outside a church and slept under the stars they had no idea what day of the week it was nor even what month it was any more both were browned by the sun and made ragged by travelling jeanettes misery was dissolved in a new happiness and nowhere more than when they discovered an abandoned cottage merely cob walls of mud and straw that were decaying without a roof in a spinney of hazel trees they cleared away the nettles and brambles and lived in the cottage for more than a week seeing no one wanting to see no one delaying their future because the present was so blissful jeanette could still weep for her son and spent hours devising exquisite revenges to be taken against the duke against belas and against sir simon jekyll but she also revelled in that summers freedom thomas had fitted his bow again so he could hunt and jeanette growlng ever stronger had learned to pull it back almost to her chin neither knew where they were and did not much care thomass mother used to tell him a tale of children who ran away into the forest and were reared by the beasts they grow hair all over their bodies she would tell him and have claws and horns and teeth and now thomas would sometimes examine his hands to see if claws were coming he saw none yet if he was becoming a beast then he was happy he had rarely been happier but he knew that the winter even though far of was nevertheless coming and so perhaps a week after midsummer they moved gently north again in search of something that neither of them could quite imagine thomas knew he had promised to retrieve a lance and restore jeanettes son but he did not know how he was to do either of those things he only knew he must go to a place where a man like will skeat would employ him though he could not talk of such a future with jeanette she did not want to hear about archers or armies or of men and mail coats but she like him knew they could not stay for ever in their refuge i shall go to england she told him and appeal to your king out of all the schemes she had dreamed of this was the only one that made sense the earl of northampton had placed her son under the king of englands protection so she must appeal to edward and hope he would support her they walked north still keeping the road to rouen in sight they forded a river and climbed into a broken country of small fields deep woods and abrupt hills and somewhere in that green land unheard by either of them the wheel of fortune creaked again thomas knew that the great wheel governed mankind it turned in the dark to determine good or evil high or low sickness or health happiness or misery thomas reckoned god must have made the wheel to be the mechanism by which he ruled the world while he was busy in heaven and in that midsummer when the harvest was being flailed on the threshing floors and the swifts were gathering in the high trees and the rowan trees were in scarlet berry and the pastures were white with oxeye daisies the wheel lurched for thomas and jeanette they walked to the woods edge one day to check that the road was still in view they usually saw little more than a man driving some cows to market a group of women following with eggs and vegetables to sell a priest might pass on a poor horse and once they had seen a knight with his retinue of servants and menatarms but most days the road lay white dusty and empty under the summer sun yet this day it was full folk were walking southwards driving cows and pigs and sheep and goats and geese some pushed handcarts others had wagons drawn by oxen or horses and all the carts were loaded high with stools tables benches and beds thomas knew he was seeing fugitives they waited till it was dark then thomas beat the worst dirt off the dominicans gown and leaving jeanette in the trees walked down to the road where some of the travellers were camping beside small smoky fires gods peace be on you thomas said to one group we have no food to spare father a man answered eyeing the stranger suspiciously i am fed my son thomas said and squatted near their fire are you a priest or a vagabond the man asked he had an axe and he drew it towards him protectively for thomass tangled hair was wildly long and his face as dark as any outlaws i am both thomas said with a smile i have walked from avignon he explained to do penance at the shrine of saint guinefort none of the refugees had ever heard of the blessed guinefort but thomass words convinced them for the idea of pilgrimage explained his woebegone condition while their own sad condition they made clear was caused by war they had come from the coast of normandy only a days journey away and in the morning they must be up early and travelling again to escape the enemy thomas made the sign of the cross what enemy he asked expecting to hear that two norman lords had fallen out and were ravaging each others estates but the ponderous wheel of fortune had turned unexpectedly king edward iii of england had crossed the channel such an expedition had long been expected but the king had not gone to his lands in gascony as many had thought he would nor to flanders where other englishmen fought but had come to normandy his army was just a day away and at the news thomass mouth dropped open you should flee them father one of the women advised thomas they know no pity not even for friars thomas assured them he would thanked them for their news then walked back up the hill to where jeanette waited all had changed his king had come to normandy they argued that night jeanette was suddenly convinced they should turn back to brittany and thomas could only stare at her in astonishment brittany he asked faintly she would not meet his eyes but stubbornly stared at the campfires that burned all along the road while further north on the nights horizon great red glows showed where larger fires burned and thomas knew that english soldiers must have been ravaging the fields of normandy just as the hellequin had harrowed brittany i can be near charles if im in brittany jeanette said thomas shook his head he was dimly aware that the sight of the armys destruction had forced them both into a reality from which they had been escaping in these last weeks of freedom but he could not connect that with her sudden wish to head back to brittanny you can be near charles he said carefully but can you see him will the duke let you near him maybe he will change his mind jeanette said without much conviction and maybe hell rape you again thomas said brutally and if i dont go she said vehemently maybe i will never see charles again never then why come this far i dont know i dont know she was angry as she used to be when thomas first met her in la rochederrien because i was mad she said sullenly you say you want to appeal to the king thomas said and hes here he flung a hand towards the livid glow of the fires so appeal to him here maybe he wont believe me jeanette said stubbornly and what will we do in brittany thomas asked but jeanette would not answer she looked sulky and still avoided his gaze you can marry one of the dukes menatarms thomas went on thats what he wanted isnt it a pliant wife of a pliant follower so that when he feels like taking his pleasure he can isnt that what you do she challenged him looking him in the face at last i love you thomas said jeanette said nothing i do love you thomas said and felt foolish for she had never said the same to him jeanette looked at the glowing horizon that was tangled by the leaves of the forest will your king believe me she asked him how can he not do i look like a countess she looked ragged poor and beautiful you speak like a countess thomas said and the kings clerks will make enquiries of the earl of northampton he did not know if that was true but he wanted to encourage her jeanette sat with her head bowed do you know what the duke told me that my mother was a jewess she looked up at him expecting him to share her indignation thomas frowned ive never met a jew he said jeanette almost exploded you think i have you need to meet the devil to know he is bad a pig to discover he stinks she began to weep i dont know what to do we shall go to the king thomas said and next morning he walked north and after a few heartbeats jeanette followed him she had tried to clean her dress though it was so filthy that all she could manage was to brush the twigs and leaf mould from the velvet she coiled her hair and pinned it with slivers of wood what kind of man is the king she asked thomas they say hes a good man who says everyone hes straightforward hes still english jeanette said softly and thomas pretended not to hear is he kind she asked him no one says hes cruel thomas said then held up a hand to silence jeanette he had seen horsemen in mail thomas had often found it strange that when the monks and scriveners made their books they painted warfare as gaudy their squirrelhair brushes showed men in brightly coloured surcoats or jupons and their horses in brilliantly patterned trappers yet for most of the time war was grey until the arrows bit when it became shot through with red grey was the colour of a mail coat and thomas was seeing grey among the green leaves he did not know if they were frenchmen or englishmen but he feared both the french were his enemy but so were the english until they were convinced that he was english too and convinced moreover that he was not a deserter from their army more horsemen came from the distant trees and these men were carrying bows so they had to be english still thomas hesitated reluctant to face the problems of persuading his own side that he was not a deserter beyond the horsemen hidden by the trees a building must have been set on fire for smoke began to thicken above the summer leaves the horsemen were looking towards thomas and jeanette but the pair were hidden by a bank of gorse and after a while satisfied that no enemy threatened the troops turned and rode eastwards thomas waited till they were out of sight then led jean ette across the open land into the trees and out to where a farm burned the flames were pale in the bright sun no one was in sight there was just a farm blazing and a dog lying next to a duck pond that was surrounded by feathers the dog was whimpering and jeanette cried out for it had been stabbed in the belly thomas stooped beside the beast stroked its head and fondled its ears and the dying dog licked his hand and tried to wag its tail and thomas rammed his knife deep into its heart so that it died swiftly it would not have lived he told jeanette she said nothing just stared at the burning thatch and rafters thomas pulled out the knife and patted the dogs head go to saint guinefort he said cleaning the blade i always wanted a dog when i was a child he told jeanette but my father couldnt abide them why because he was strange he sheathed the knife and stood a track imprinted with hoofmarks led north from the farm and they followed it cautiously between hedges thick with cornflowers oxeye and dogwood they were in a country of small fields high banks sudden woods and lumpy hills a country for ambush but they saw no one until from the top of a low hill they glimpsed a squat stone church tower in a valley and then the unburned roofs of a village and after that the soldiers there were hundreds of them camped in the fields beyond the cottages and more in the village itself some large tents had been raised close to the church and they had the banners of nobles planted by their entrances thomas still hesitated reluctant to finish these good days with jeanette yet he knew there was no choice and so bow on his shoulder he took her down to the village men saw them coming and a dozen archers led by a burly man in a mail hauberk came to meet them what the hell are you was the burly mans first question his archers grinned wolfishly at the sight of jeanettes ragged dress youre either a bleeding priest who stole a bow the man went on or an archer who filched a priests robe im english thomas said the big man seemed unimpressed serving who i was with will skeat in brittany thomas said brittany the big man frowned not certain whether or not to believe thomas tell them im a countess jeanette urged thomas in french whats she saying nothing thomas said so what are you doing here the big man asked i got cut off from my troop in brittany thomas said weakly he could hardly tell the truth that he was a fugitive from justice but he had no other tale prepared i just walked it was a lame explanation and the big man treated it with the scorn it deserved what you mean lad he said is that youre a bloody deserter id hardly come here if i was would i thomas asked defiantly youd hardly come here from brittany if you just got lost the man pointed out he spat youll have to go to scoresby let him decide what you are scoresby thomas asked youve heard of him the big man asked belligerently thomas had heard of walter scoresby who like skeat was a man who led his own band of menatarms and archers but scoresby did not have skeats good reputation he was said to be a darkhumoured man but he was evidently to decide thomass fate for the archers closed around him and walked the pair towards the village she your woman one of them asked thomas shes the countess of armorica thomas said and im the bloody earl of london the archer retorted jeanette clung to thomass arm terrified of the unfriendly faces thomas was equally unhappy when things had been at their worst in brittany when the hellequin were grumbling and it was cold wet and miserable skeat liked to say be happy youre not with scoresby and now it seemed thomas was we hang deserters the big man said with relish thomas noted that the archers like all the troops he could see in the village wore the red cross of saint george on their tunics a great crowd of them were gathered in a pasture that lay between the small village church and a cistercian monastery or priory that had somehow escaped destruction for the whiterobed monks were assisting a priest who said mass for the soldiers is it sunday thomas asked one of the archers tuesday the man said taking off his hat in honour of the sacraments saint jamess day they waited at the pastures edge close to the village church where a row of new graves suggested that some villagers had died when the army came but most had probably fled south or west one or two remained an old man bent double from work and with a white beard that almost reached the ground mumbled along with the distant priest while a small boy perhaps six or seven years old tried to draw an english bow to the amusement of its owner the mass ended and the mailclad men climbed from their knees and walked towards the tents and houses one of the archers from thomass escort had gone into the dispersing crowd and he now reappeared with a group of men one stood out because he was taller than the others and had a new coat of mail that had been polished so it seemed to shine he had long boots a green cloak and a goldhilted sword with a scabbard wrapped in red cloth the finery seemed at odds with the mans face which was pinched and gloomy he was bald but had a forked beard which he had twisted into plaits thats scoresby one of the archers muttered and thomas had no need to guess which of the approaching soldiers he meant scoresby stopped a few paces away and the big archer who had arrested thomas smirked a deserter he announced proudly says he walked here from brittany scoresby gave thomas a hard glance and jeanette a much longer look her ragged dress revealed a length of thigh and a ripped neckline and scoresby clearly wanted to see more like will skeat he had begun his military life as an archer and had risen by dint of shrewdness and thomas guessed there was not much mercy in his souls mix scoresby shrugged if hes a deserter he said then hang the bastard he smiled but well keep his woman im not a deserter thomas said and the woman is the countess of armorica who is related to the count of blois nephew to the king of france most of the archers jeered at this outrageous claim but scoresby was a cautious man and he was aware of a small crowd that had gathered at the churchyards edge two priests and some menatarms wearing noblemens escutcheons were among the spectators and thomass confidence had put just enough doubt in scoresbys mind he frowned at jeanette seeing a girl who looked at first glance like a peasant but despite her tanned face she was undoubtedly beautiful and the remnants of her dress suggested she had once known elegance shes who scoresby demanded i told you who she was thomas said belligerently and i will tell you more her son has been stolen from her and her son is a ward of our kings she has come for his majestys help thomas hastily told jeanette what he had said and to his relief she nodded her agreement scoresby gazed at jeanette and something about her increased his doubt why are you with her he asked thomas i rescued her thomas said he says a voice spoke in french from the crowd and thomas could not see the speaker who was evidently surrounded by menatarms all wearing a green and white livery he says that he rescued you madame is that true yes jeanette said she frowned unable to see who was questioning her tell us who you are the unseen man demanded i am jeanette dowager countess of armorica your husband was who the voice suggested a young man but a very confident young man jeanette bridled at the tone of the question but answered it henri chenier comte darmorique and why are you here madame because charles of blois has kidnapped my child jeanette answered angrily a child who was placed under the protection of the king of england the young man said nothing for a while some in the crowd were edging nervously away from the liveried menatarms who surrounded him and scoresby was looking apprehensive who placed him under that protection he eventually asked william bohun jeanette said earl of northampton i believe her the voice said and the menatarms stepped aside so that thomas and jeanette could see the speaker who proved to be scarce more than a boy indeed thomas doubted he had even begun to shave though he was surely full grown for he was tall taller even than thomas and had only stayed hidden because his menatarms had been wearing green and white plumes in their helmets the young man was fairhaired had a face slightly burned by the sun was dressed in a green cloak plain breeches and a linen shirt and nothing except his height explained why men were suddenly kneeling on the grass down scoresby hissed at thomas who perplexed went on one knee now only jeanette the boy and his escort of eight tall menatarms were standing the boy looked at thomas did you really walk here from brittany he asked in english though like many noblemen his english was touched with a french accent we both did sire thomas said in french why he demanded harshly to seek the protection of the king of england thomas said who is the guardian of my ladys son who has been treacherously taken prisoner by englands enemies the boy looked at jeanette with much the same wolfish appreciation that scoresby had shown he might not shave but he knew a beautiful woman when he saw one he smiled you are most welcome madame he said i knew of your husbands reputation i admired him and i regret that i will never have a chance to meet him in combat he bowed to jeanette then untied his cloak and walked to her he placed the green cape over her shoulders to cover the torn dress i shall ensure madame he said that you are treated with the courtesy your rank demands and will vow to keep whatever promises england made on your sons behalf he bowed again jeanette astonished and pleased by the young mans manner put the question that thomas had been wanting answered who are you my lord she asked offering a curtsey i am edward of woodstock madame he said offering her his arm it meant nothing to jeanette but it astonished thomas he is the kings eldest son he whispered to her she dropped to one knee but the smoothcheeked boy raised her and walked her towards the priory he was edward of woodstock earl of chester duke of cornwall and prince of wales and the wheel of fate had once again spun jeanette high the wheel seemed indifferent towards thomas he was left alone abandoned jeanette walked away on the princes arm and did not so much as glance back at thomas he heard her laugh he watched her he had nursed her fed her carried her and loved her and now without a thought she had discarded him no one else was interested in him scoresby and his men cheated of a hanging had gone to the village and thomas wondered just what he was supposed to do goddamn he said aloud he felt conspicuously foolish in his tattered robe goddamn he said again anger thick as the black humour that could make a man sick rose in him but what he could do he was a fool in a ragged robe and the prince was the son of a king the prince had taken jeanette to the low grassy ridge where the big tents stood in a colourful row each tent had a flagpole and the tallest flew the quartered banner of the prince of wales which showed the golden lions of england on the two red quarters and golden fleurdelis on the two blue the fleurdelis were there to show the kings claim to the french throne while the whole flag which was that of englands king was crossed with a whitetoothed bar to show that this was the banner of the kings eldest son thomas was tempted to follow jeanette to demand the princes help but then one of the lower banners the one furthest away from him caught the small warm wind and sluggishly lifted its folds he stared at it the banner had a blue field and was slashed diagonally with a white band three rampant yellow lions were emblazoned on either side of the bar which was decorated with three red stars that had green centres it was a flag thomas knew well but he scarcely dared believe that he was seeing it here in normandy for the arms were those of william bohun earl of northampton northampton was the kings deputy in brittany yet his flag was unmistakable and thomas walked towards it fearing that the windrippled flag would turn out to be a different coat of arms similar to the earls but not the same but it was the earls banner and the earls tent in contrast to the other stately pavilions on the low ridge was still the grubby shelter made from two wornout sails a halfdozen menatarms wearing the earls livery barred thomass way as he neared the tent have you come to hear his lordships confession or put an arrow in his belly one asked i would speak to his lordship thomas said barely suppressing the anger provoked by jeanettes abandonment of him but will he talk to you the man asked amused at the ragged archers pretensions he will thomas said with a confidence he did not entirely feel tell him the man who gave him la rochederrien is here he added the manatarms looked startled he frowned but just then the tent flap was thrown back and the earl himself appeared stripped to the waist to reveal a muscled chest covered in tight red curls he was chewing on a goosebone and peered up at the sky as though fearing rain the manatarms turned to him indicated thomas then shrugged as if to say he was not responsible for a madman showing up unannounced the earl stared at thomas good god he said after a while have you taken orders no my lord the earl stripped a piece of flesh from the bone with his teeth thomas aint that right yes my lord never forget a face the earl said and i have cause to remember yours though i hardly expected you to fetch up here did you walk thomas nodded i did my lord something about the earls demeanour was puzzling almost as though he was not really surprised to see thomas in normandy will told me about you the earl said told me all about you so thomas my modest hero from la rochederrien is a murderer eh he spoke grimly yes my lord thomas said humbly the earl threw away the stripped bone then snapped his fingers and a servant tossed him a shirt from within the tent he pulled it on and tucked it into his hose gods teeth boy do you expect me to save you from sir simons vengeance you know hes here thomas gaped at the earl said nothing sir simon jekyll was here and thomas had just brought jeanette to normandy sir simon could hardly hurt her so long as she was under the princes protection but sir simon could harm thomas well enough and delight in it the earl saw thomas blanch and he nodded hes with the kings men because i didnt want him but he insisted on travelling because he reckons theres more plunder to be had in normandy than in brittany and i dare say hes right but what will truly put a smile on his face is the sight of you ever been hanged thomas hanged my lord thomas asked vaguely he was still reeling from the news that sir simon had sailed to normandy he had just walked all this way to find his enemy waiting sir simon will hang you the earl said with indecent relish hell let you strangle on the rope and therell be no kindly soul tugging on your ankles to make it quick you could last an hour two hours in utter agony you could choke for even longer one fellow i hanged lasted from matins till prime and still managed to curse me so i suppose you want my help yes thomas belatedly went onto one knee you offered me a reward after la rochederrien my lord can i claim it now the servant brought a stool from the tent and the earl sat his legs set wide murder is murder he said picking his teeth with a sliver of wood half will skeats men are murderers my lord thomas pointed out the earl thought about that then reluctantly nodded but theyre pardoned murderers he answered he sighed i wish will was here he said evading thomass demand i wanted him to come but he cant come until charles of blois is put back into his cage he scowled at thomas if i give you a pardon the earl went on then i make an enemy out of sir simon not that hes a friend now but still why spare you for la rochederrien thomas said which is a great debt the earl agreed a very great debt wed have looked bloody fools if we hadnt taken that town miserable goddamn place though it be gods teeth boy but why didnt you just walk south plenty of bastards to kill in gascony he looked at thomas for a while plainly irritated by the undeniable debt he owed the archer and the nuisance of paying it he finally shrugged ill talk to sir simon offer him money and if its enough hell pretend youre not here as for you he paused frowning as he remembered his earlier meetings with thomas youre the one who wouldnt tell me who your father was aint i right i didnt tell you my lord because he was a priest the earl thought that was a fine jest gods teeth a priest so youre a devils whelp are you thats what they say in guyenne that the children of priests are the devils whelps he looked thomas up and down amused again at the ragged robe they say the devils whelps make good soldiers he said good soldiers and better whores i suppose youve lost your horse yes my lord all my archers are mounted the earl said then turned to one of his menatarms find the bastard a swaybacked nag till he can filch something better then give him a tunic and offer him to john armstrong he looked back to thomas youre joining my archers which means youll wear my badge youre my man devils wheip and perhaps that will protect you if sir simon wants too much money for your miserable soul i shall try to repay your lordship thomas said pay me boy by getting us into caen you got us into la rochederrien but that little place is nothing compared to caen caen is a true bastard we go there tomorrow but i doubt well see the backside of its walls for a month or more if ever get us into caen thomas and ill forgive you a score of murders he stood nodded a dismissal and went back into the tent thomas did not move caen he thought caen caen was the city where sir guillaume devecque lived and he made the sign of the cross for he knew fate had arranged all this fate had determined that his crossbow arrow would miss sir simon jekyll and it had brought him to the edge of caen because fate wanted him to do the penance that father hobbe had demanded god thomas decided had taken jeanette from him because he had been slow to keep his promise but now the time for the keeping of promises had come for god had brought thomas to caen part two normandy the earl of northampton had been summoned from brittany to be one of the prince of waless advisers the prince was just sixteen though john armstrong reckoned the boy was as good as any grown man aint nothing wrong with young edward he told thomas knows his weapons headstrong maybe but brave that in john armstrongs world was high praise he was a fortyyearold manatarms who led the earls personal archers and was one of those hard common men that the earl liked so much armstrong like skeat came from the north country and was said to have been fighting the scots since he had been weaned his personal weapon was a falchion a curved sword with a heavy blade as broad as an axe though he could draw a bow with the best of his troop he also commanded three score of hobelars light horsemen mounted on shaggy ponies and carrying spears they dont look up to much he said to thomas who was gazing at the small horsemen who all had long shaggy hair and bent legs but theyre rare at scouting we send swarms of yon bastards into the scottish hills to find the enemy be dead else armstrong had been at la rochederrien and remembered thomass achievement in turning the towns river flank and because of that he accepted thomas readily enough he gave him a liceridden hacqueton a padded jacket that might stop a feeble sword cut and a short surcoat a jupon that had the earls stars and lions on its breast and bore the cross of saint george on its right sleeve the hacqueton and jupon like the breeches and arrow bag that completed thomass outfit had belonged to an archer who had died of the fever shortly after reaching normandy you can find yourself better stuff in caen armstrong told him if we ever get into caen thomas was given a swaybacked grey mare that had a hard mouth and an awkward gait he watered the beast rubbed her down with straw then ate red herrings and dry beans with armstrongs men he found a stream and washed his hair then twisted the boweord round the wet pigtail he borrowed a razor and scraped off his beard tossing the stiff hairs into the stream so that no one could work a spell on them it seemed strange to spend the night in a soldiers encampment and to sleep without jeanette he still felt bitter about her and that bitterness was like a sliver of iron in his soul when he was roused in the nights dark heart he felt lonely chill and unwanted as the archers began their march he thought of ette in the princes tent and remembered the jealousy he had felt in rennes when she had gone to the citadel to meet duke charles she was like a moth he thought flying to the brightest candle in the room her wings had been scorched once but the flame drew her still the army advanced on caen in three battles each of about four thousand men the king commanded one the prince of wales the second while the third was under the orders of the bishop of durham who much preferred slaughter to sanctity the prince had left the encampment early to stand his horse beside the road where he could watch his men pass in the summer dawn he was in black armour with a lion crest on his helm and escorted by a dozen priests and fifty knights as thomas approached he saw jeanette was among those greenandwhiteblazoned horsemen she was wearing the same colours a dress of pale green cloth with white cuffs hems and bodice and was mounted on a palfrey that had silver curb chains green and white ribbons plaited into its mane and a white saddle cloth embroidered with the lions of england her hair had been washed brushed and coiled then decorated with cornflowers and as thomas came nearer he thought how ravishing she looked there was a radiant happiness on her face and her eyes were bright she was just to one side of the prince and a pace or so behind him and thomas noted how often the boy turned to speak to her the men in front of thomas were pulling off their helmets or caps to salute the prince who looked from jeanette to them sometimes nodding or calling out to a knight he recognized thomas riding his borrowed horse that was so small his long legs hung almost to the ground raised a hand to greet jeanette she stared into his smiling face then looked away without showing any expression she spoke with a priest who was evidently the princes chaplain thomas let his hand drop if youre a bloody prince the man beside thomas said you get the cream dont you we get lice and he gets that thomas said nothing jeanettes dismissal had left him embarrassed had the last weeks been a dream he twisted in his saddle to look at her and saw she was laughing at some comment of the princes you are a fool thomas told himself a fool and he wondered why he felt so hurt jeanette had never declared any love for him yet her abandonment bit his heart like a snake the road dropped into a hollow where sycamore and ash grew thick and thomas turning again could not see jeanette therell be plenty of women in caen an archer said with relish if we ever get in another commented using the five words that were always spoken whenever the city was named the previous night thomas had listened to the campfire talk that had all been about caen it was he gathered a huge city one of the biggest in france and protected by a massive castle and a great wall the french it seemed had adopted a strategy of retreating into such citadels rather than face englands bowmen in the open fields and the archers feared they could be stranded in front of caen for weeks the city could not be ignored for if it was left untaken its huge garrison would threaten the english supply lines so caen had to fall and no one believed it would be easy though some men reckoned the new guns that the king had fetched to france would knock down the citys ramparts as easily as joshuas trumpets had felled the walls of jericho the king himself must have been sceptical of the guns power for he had decided to scare the city into surrender by the sheer numbers of his army the three english battles moved eastward on every road track or stretch of meadow that offered a path but an hour or two after dawn the menatarms who served as marshals began halting the various contingents sweaty horsemen galloped up and down the masses of men shouting at them to move into a rough line thomas wrestling with his stubborn mare understood that the whole army was being formed into a huge crescent a low hill lay in front and a hazy smear beyond the hill betrayed the thousands of cooking fires in caen when the signal was given the whole clumsy crescent of mailed men would be advanced to the hilltop so that the defenders instead of seeing a few english scouts trickle from the woods would be presented with an overwhelming host and to make the army seem double its real size the marshals were pushing and shouting the camp followers into the curved line cooks clerks women masons farriers carpenters scullions anyone who could walk crawl ride or stand was being added to the crescent and a host of bright flags were raised over those bemused masses it was a hot morning and the leather and mail made men and horses sweat dust blew in the wind the earl of warwick marshal of the host was galloping up and down the crescent redfaced and cursing but slowly the cumbersome line formed to his satisfaction when the trumpet sounds a knight shouted at armstrongs men advance to the hilltop when the trumpet sounds not before that army of england must have looked like twenty thousand men when the trumpets tore the summer sky with their massed defiance to caens defenders it was a nightmare one moment the horizon was empty even though the sky beyond had long been blanched by the dust kicked up by hoofs and boots and then there was a sudden host a horde a swarm of men glinting ironhard in the sun and topped by a forest of raised lances and flags the whole north and east of the city was ringed with men who when they saw caen gave a great roar of incoherent scorn there was plunder ahead of them a whole rich city waiting to be taken it was a fine and famous city bigger even than london and that was the biggest city in england caen indeed was one of the great cities of france the conqueror had endowed it with the wealth he stole from england and it still showed within the city walls the church spires and towers stood as close as the lances and flags in edwards army while on either side of the city were two vast abbeys the castle lay to the north its ramparts like the pale stone of the citys high walls hung with war banners the english roar was answered with a defiant cheer from the defenders who clustered thick on the ramparts so many crossbows thomas thought remembering the heavy bolts thumping from la rochederriens embras res the city had spread beyond its walls but instead of placing the new houses beside the ramparts as most towns did here they had been built on a sprawling island that lay to the south of the old city formed by a mazelike tangle of tributaries that fed the two main rivers which flowed by caen the island had no walls for it was protected by the waterways it needed such protection for even from the hilltop thomas could see that the island was where the wealth of caen lay the old city within its high walls would be a labyrinth of narrow alleys and cramped houses but the island was filled with large mansions big churches and wide gardens but even though it appeared to be the wealthiest part of caen it did not seem to be defended no troops were visible there instead they were all on the ramparts of the old city the towns boats had been moored on the islands bank opposite the city wall and thomas wondered if any of them belonged to sir guillaume devecque the earl of northampton released from the princes entourage joined john armstrong at the head the islands named for you the earl said glibly for me armstrong sounded suspicious its the ile st the earl said then pointed to the nearer of the two abbeys a great monastery that was surrounded by its own ramparts which were joined to the citys higher walls the abbaye aux hommes the earl said you know what happened when they buried the conqueror there they left him in the abbey for too long and when the time came to put him in the vault he was rotted and swollen his body burst and they reckon the stench of it drove the congregation out of the abbey gods vengeance my lord armstrong said stoically the earl gave him a quizzical look maybe he said uncertainly theres no love of william in the north country armstrong said long time ago john not so long that i wont spit on his grave armstrong declared then explained himself he might have been our king my lord but he were no englishman i suppose he wasnt the earl allowed time for revenge armstrong said loudly enough for the nearest archers to hear well take him well take his city and well take his goddamn women the archers cheered though thomas did not see how the army could possibly take caen the walls were huge and wellbuttressed with towers and the ramparts were thick with defenders who looked as confident as the attackers thomas was searching the banners for the one showing three yellow hawks on a blue field but there were so many flags and the wind was stirring them so briskly that he could not pick sir guillaume devecques three hawks from the other gaudy ripples that swirled beneath the embrasures so what are you thomas the earl had dropped back to ride beside him his horse was a big destrier so that the earl despite being much shorter than thomas towered above him he spoke in french english or norman thomas grimaced english my lord right to my sore arse it had been so long since he had ridden that his thighs were chafed raw were all english now arent we the earl sounded mildly surprised would you want to be anything else thomas asked and looked around at the archers god knows my lord i wouldnt want to fight them nor me the earl grunted and ive saved you a fight with sir simon or rather ive saved your miserable life i talked to him last night i cant say he was very willing to spare you a throttling and i cant blame him for that the earl slapped at a horsefly but in the end his greed overcame his hatred of you youve cost me my share of the prize money for the countesss two ships young thomas one ship for his dead squire and the other for the hole you put in his leg thank you my lord thomas said effusively he felt the relief surge through him thank you he said again so youre a free man the earl said sir simon shook on it a clerk made a note of it and a priest witnessed it now for gods sake dont go and kill another of his fellows i wont sir thomas promised and youre in my debt now the earl said i acknowledge it my lord the earl made a dismissive noise suggesting it was unlikely thomas could ever pay such a debt then he shot the archer a suspicious look and speaking of the countess he went on you never mentioned that you brought her north it didnt seem important my lord and last night the earl continued after id growled at jekyll for you i met her ladyship in the princes quarters she says you treated her with complete chivalry it seems you behaved with discretion and respect is that really true thomas reddened if she says so my lord it must be true the earl laughed then touched his spurs to his destrier ive bought your soul he said cheerfullys o fight well for me he curved away to rejoin his menatarms hes all right our billy an archer said nodding at the earl a good one if only they were all like him thomas agreed how come you talk french the archer asked suspiciously picked it up in brittany thomas said vaguely the armys vanguard had now reached the cleared space in front of the walls and a crossbow bolt slammed into the turf as a warning the camp followers who had helped give the illusion of overwhelming force were pitching tents on the hills to the north while the fighting men spread out in the plain that surrounded the city marshals were galloping between the units shouting that the princes men were to go clear about the walls to the abbaye aux dames on the citys further side it was still early about midmorning and the wind brought the smell of caens cooking fires as the earls men marched past deserted farms the castle loomed above them they went to the western side of the town the prince of wales mounted on a big black horse and followed by a standardbearer and a troop of menatarms galloped to the convent which because it lay well outside the city walls had been abandoned he would make it his home for the duration of the siege and thomas dismounting where armstrongs men would camp saw jeanette following the prince following him like a puppy he thought sourly then chided himself for jealousy why be jealous of a prince a man might as well resent the sun or curse the ocean there are other women he told himself as he hobbled his horse in one of the abbey pastures a group of archers was exploring the deserted buildings that lay close to the convent most were cottages but one had been a carpenters workshop and was piled with woodshavings and sawdust while beyond it was a tannery still stinking of the urine lime and dung that cured the leather beyond the tannery was nothing but a waste ground of thistles and nettles that ran clear to the citys great wall and thomas saw that dozens of archers were venturing into the weeds to stare at the ramparts it was a hot day so that the air in front of the walls seemed to shiver a small north win drifted some high clouds and rippled the long grass that grew in the ditch at the base of the battlements about a hundred archers were in the waste ground now and some were within long crossbow range though no frenchman shot at them a score of the inquisitive bowmen were carrying axes to cut firewood but morbid curiosity had driven them towards the ramparts instead of outwards to the woods and thomas now followed them wanting to judge for himself what horrors the besiegers faced the screeching sound of ungreased axles made him turn to see two farm wagons being dragged towards the convent they both held guns great bulbous things with swollen metal bellies and gaping mouths he wondered if the guns magic could blast a hole through the citys ramparts but even if it did then men would still have to fight through the breach he made the sign of the cross maybe he would find a woman inside the city he had almost everything a man needed he had a horse he had a hacqueton he had his bow and arrow bag he just needed a woman yet he did not see how an army twice the size could cross caens great walls they reared up from their boggy ditch like cliffs and every fifty paces there was a conical roofed bastion that would give the garrisons crossbowmen the chance to slash their quarrels into the flanks of the attackers it would be carnage thomas thought far worse than the slaughter that had occurred each time the earl of northamptons men had assailed the southern wall at la rochederrien more and more archers came into the waste ground to stare at the city most were just inside crossbow range but the french still ignored them instead the defenders began hauling in the gaudy banners that hung from the embrasures thomas looked for sir guillaumes three hawks but could not see them most of the banners were decorated with crosses or the figures of saints one showed the keys of heaven another the lion of saint mark and a third had a winged angel scything down english troops with a flaming sword that banner disappeared what the hell are the goddamn bastards doing an archer asked the bastards are running away another man said he was staring at the stone bridge that led from the old city to the ile saint jean that bridge was thronged with soldiers some mounted most on foot and all of them streaming out of the walled city onto the island of big houses churches and gardens thomas walked a few paces southwards to get a better view and saw crossbowmen and menatarms appear in the alleys between the islands houses theyre going to defend the island he said to anyone in earshot by now carts were being pushed over the bridge and he could see women and children being chivvied on their way by menatarms more defenders crossed the bridge and still more banners vanished from the walls until there was only a handful left the big flags of the great lords still flew from the castles topmost towers and pious banners hung down the keeps long walls but the city ramparts were almost bare and there must have been a thousand archers from the prince of waless battle watching those walls now they should have been cutting firewood building shelters or digging latrines but a slow suspicion was dawning on them that the french were not planning to defend both the city and the island but only the island which meant the city had been abandoned that seemed so unlikely that no one even dared mention it they just watched the citys inhabitants and defenders crowd across the stone bridge and then as the last banner was hauled from the ramparts someone began walking towards the nearest gate no one gave any orders no prince earl constable or knight ordered the archers forward they simply decided to approach the city themselves most wore the prince of waless green and white livery but a good few like thomas had the earl of northamptons stars and lions thomas half expected crossbowmen to appear and greet the straggling advance with a terrible volley of spitting quarrels but the embrasures stayed empty and that emboldened the archers who saw birds settling on the crenellations a sure sign that the defenders had abandoned the wall the men with axes ran to the gate and started to hack at its timbers and no crossbow bolts flew from the flanking bastions the great walled city of william the conqueror had been left unguarded the axemen broke through the ironstudded planks lifted the bar and pulled the big gates open to reveal an empty street a handcart with one broken wheel was abandoned on the cobbles but no frenchmen were visible there was a pause as the archers stared in disbelief then the shouting began havoc havoc the first thought was plunder and men eagerly broke into the houses but found little except chairs tables and cupboards everything of real value like every person in the city was gone to the island still more archers were coming into the city a few climbed towards the open ground surrounding the castle where two died from crossbow bolts spat from the high ramparts but the rest spread through the city to find it bare and so more and more men were drawn towards the bridge that spanned the river odon and led to the ile saint jean at the bridges southern end where it reached the island there was a barbican tower that was thick with crossbows but the french did not want the english getting close to the barbican and so they had hastily thrown up a barricade on the bridges northern side out of a great heap of wagons and furniture and they had garrisoned the barrier with a score of menatarms reinforced by as many crossbowmen there was another bridge at the islands further side but the archers did not know of its existence and besides it was a long way off and the barricaded bridge was the quickest route to the enemys riches the first whitefledged arrows began to fly then came the harder sounds of the enemys crossbows discharging and the crack of bolts striking the stones of the church beside the bridge the first men died there were still no orders no man of rank was inside the city yet just a mass of archers as mindless as wolves smelling blood they poured arrows at the barricade forcing its defenders to crouch behind the overturned wagons then the first group of english gave a cheer and charged at the barricade with swords axes and spears more men followed as the first tried to climb the ungainly pile the crossbows banged from the barbican and men were thrown back by the heavy bolts the french menatarms stood to repel the survivors and swords clashed on axes blood was slick on the bridge approach and one archer slipped and was trampled underfoot by his colleagues going to the fight the english were howling the french were shouting a trumpet was calling from the barbican and every church bell on the ile saint jean was tolling the alarm thomas having no sword of his own was standing in the porch of a church which stood hard beside the bridge from where he was shooting arrows up at the barbican tower but his aim was obscured because a thatch in the old city was on fire and the smoke was curling over the river like a low cloud the french held all the advantages their crossbowmen could shoot from the barbican and from the shelter of the barricade and to attack them the english had to funnel onto the narrow bridge approach which was littered with bodies blood and bolts still more enemy crossbowmen were stationed in the line of boats that was moored along the islands bank stranded there by the falling tide and the defenders of those boats sheltered by the stout wooden gunwales could shoot up at any archer foolish enough to show himself on those parts of the city wall that were not smokeshrouded more and more crossbowmen were coming to the bridge until it seemed as if the air above the river was as thick with quarrels as a flock of starlings another rush of arch ers charged from the alleys to fill the narrow street leading to the barricade they screamed as they charged they were not fighting with their bows but rather with axes swords billhooks and spears the spears were mostly carried by the hobelars many of them welshmen who uttered a highshrieked howl as they ran with the archers a dozen of the new attackers must have fallen to crossbow bolts but the survivors leaped the bodies and closed right up to the barricade that was now defended by at least thirty menatarms and as many crossbowmen thomas ran and picked up the arrow bag of a dead man the attackers were crammed up against the arrowstuck barricade with little room to wield their axes swords and spears the french menatarms stabbed with lances hacked with swords and flailed with maces and as the front rank of archers died the next rank was pushed onto the enemy weapons and all the time the crossbow quarrels thumped down from the barbicans crenellated tower and flew up from the grounded ships in the river thomas saw a man reeling from the bridge with a crossbow bolt buried in his helmet blood poured down his face as he made a strange incoherent mewing before falling to his knees and then slowly collapsing on the road where he was trampled by another rush of attackers a few english archers found their way onto the roof of the church and they killed a halfdozen of the barricades defenders before the crossbowmen on the barbican swept them away with stinging volleys the bridge approach was thick with bodies now so many corpses that they obstructed the charging english and a halfdozen men began heaving the dead over the parapet a tall archer armed with a longhandled axe managed to reach the barricades summit where he chopped the heavy blade again and again beating down at a frenchman who had ribbons on his helmet but then he was struck by two crossbow bolts and he folded over letting the axe fall and clutching at his belly and the french hauled him down to their side of the barricade where three men hacked at him with swords then used the archers own axe to sever his head they thrust the bloody trophy onto a spear and waved it above the barricade to taunt their attackers a mounted manatarms wearing the earl of warwicks badge of a bear and ragged staff shouted at the archers to retreat the earl himself was in the city now sent by the king to pull his bowmen back from their unequal fight but the archers were not willing to listen the french were jeering them killing them but still the archers wanted to break through the bridges defences and slake themselves on caens wealth and so still more bloodmaddened men charged at the barricade so many that they filled the road as the bolts whipped down from the smoky sky the attackers at the back heaved forward and the men at the front died on french lances and blades the french were winning their crossbow bolts were smacking into the crush of men and those at the front began to push backwards to escape the slaughter while those at the back still shoved forward and the ones in between threatened with a crushing death broke through a stout wooden fence that let them spill off the bridges approach onto a narrow strip of ground that lay between the river and the city walls more men followed them thomas was still crouching in the church porch he sent an occasional arrow up towards the barbican but the thickening smoke hung like fog and he could scarcely see his targets he watched the men streaming off the bridge onto the narrow riverbank but did not follow for that seemed just another way of committing suicide they were trapped there with the high city wall at their backs and the swirling river in front and the far bank of the river was lined with boats from which crossbowmen poured quarrels into these new and inviting targets the spillage of men off the bridge opened the roadway to the barricade again and newly arrived men who had not experienced the carnage of the first attacks took up the fight a hobelar managed to climb onto an overturned wagon and stabbed down with his short spear there were crossbow bolts sticking from his chest but still he screeched and stabbed and tried to go on fighting even when a french manatarms disembowelled him his guts spilled out but somehow he found the strength to raise the spear and give one last lunge before he fell into the defenders a halfdozen archers were trying to dismantle the barricade while others were throwing the dead off the bridge to clear the roadway at least one living man wounded was thrown into the river he screamed as he fell get back you dogs get back the earl of warwick had come to the chaos and he flailed at men with his marshals staff he had a trumpeter sounding the four falling notes of the retreat while the french trumpeter was blasting out the attack signal brisk couplets of rising notes that stirred the blood and the english and welsh were obeying the french rather than the english trumpet more men hundreds of them were streaming into the old city dodging the earl of warwicks constables and closing on the bridge where unable to get past the barricade they followed the men down to the riverbank from where they shot their arrows at the crossbowmen in the barges the earl of warwicks men started pulling archers away from the street that led to the bridge but for every one they hauled away another two slipped past a crowd of caens menfolk some armed with nothing more than staves waited beyond the barbican promising yet another fight if the barricade was ever overcome a madness had gripped the english army a madness to attack a bridge that was too well defended men went screaming to their deaths and still more followed the earl of warwick was bellowing at them to pull back but they were deaf to him then a great roar of defiance sounded from the riverbank and thomas stepped out from the porch to see that groups of men were now trying to wade the river odon and they were succeeding it had been a dry summer the river was low and the falling tide made it lower still so that at its deepest the water only came up to a mans chest scores of men were now plunging into the river thomas dodging two of the earls constables leaped the remnants of the fence and slithered down the bank which was studded with embedded crossbow quarrels the place stank of shit for this was where the city emptied its nightsoil a dozen welsh hobelars waded into the river and thomas joined them holding his bow high above his head to keep its string dry the crossbowmen had to stand up from their shelter behind the barge gunwales to shoot down at the attackers in the river and once they were standing they made easy targets for those archers who had stayed on the city bank the current was strong and thomas could only take short steps bolts splashed about him a man just in front was hit in the throat and was snatched down by the weight of his mail coat to leave nothing but a swirl of bloody water the ships gunwales were stuck with whitefeathered arrows a frenchman was draped over the side of one boat and his body twitched whenever an arrow hit his corpse blood trickled from a scupper kill the bastards kill the bastards a man muttered next to thomas who saw it was one of the earl of warwicks constables finding he could not stop the attack he had decided to join it the man was carrying a curved falchion half sword and half butchers cleaver the wind flattened the smoke from the burning houses dipping it close to the river and filling the air with scraps of burning straw some of those scraps had lodged in the furled sails of two of the ships that were now burning fiercely their defenders had scrambled ashore other enemy bowmen were retreating from the first mudstreaked english and welsh soldiers who clambered up the bank between the grounded boats the air was filled with the quickfluttering hiss of arrows flying overhead the islands bells still clamoured a frenchman was shouting from the barbicans tower ordering men to spread along the river and attack the groups of welsh and english who struggled and slithered in the river mud thomas kept wading the water reached his chest then began to recede he fought the clinging mud of the riverbed and ignored the crossbow bolts that drove into the water about him a crossbowmen stood up from behind a boats gunwale and aimed straight at thomass chest but then two arrows struck the man and he fell backwards thomas pushed on climbing now then suddenly he was out of the river and he stumbled up the slick mud into the shelter of the overhanging stern of the closest barge he could see that men were still fighting at the barricade but he could also see that the river was now swarming with archers and hobelars who mudspattered and soaking began to haul themselves onto the boats the remaining defenders had few weapons other than their crossbows while most of the archers had swords or axes the fight on the moored boats was onesided the slaughter brief and then the disorganized and leaderless mass of attackers surged off the bloodsoaked decks and up from the river onto the island the earl of warwicks manatarms went ahead of thomas he clambered up the steep grassy bank and was immediately hit in the face by a crossbow bolt so that he jerked backwards with a fine mist of blood encircling his helmet the bolt had driven clean through the bridge of his nose killing him instantly and leaving him with an offended expression his falchion landed in the mud at thomass feet so he slung his bow and picked the weapon up it was surprisingly heavy there was nothing sophisticated about a falchion it was simply a killing tool with an edge designed to cut deep because of the weight of the broad blade it was a good weapon for a melee will skeat had once told thomas how he had seen a scottish horse decapitated with a single blow of a falchion and just to see one of the brutal blades was to feel terror in the gut the welsh hobelars were on the barge finishing off its defenders then they gave a shout in their strange language and leaped ashore and thomas followed them to find himself in a loose rank of crazed attackers who ran towards a row of tall and wealthy houses defended by the men who had escaped from the barges and by the citizens of caen the crossbowmen had time to loose one bolt apiece but they were nervous and most shot wide and then the attackers were onto them like hounds onto a wounded deer thomas wielded the falchion twohanded a crossbowman tried to defend himself with his bow but the heavy blade sliced through the weapons stock as if it had been made of ivory then buried itself in the frenchmans neck a spurt of blood jetted over thomass head as he wrenched the heavy sword free and kicked the crossbowman between the legs a welshman was grinding a spear blade into a frenchmans ribs thomas stumbled on the man he had struck down caught his balance and shouted the english war cry saint george he swung the blade again chopping through the forearm of a man wielding a club he was close enough to smell the mans breath and the stink of his clothes a frenchman was swinging a sword while another was beating at the welsh with an ironstudded mace this was tavern fighting outlaw fighting and thomas was screaming like a fiend god damn them all he was spattered with blood as he kicked and clawed and slashed his way down the alley the air seemed unnaturally thick moist and warm it stank of blood the ironstudded mace missed his head by a fingers breadth and struck the wall instead and thomas swung the falchion upwards so it cut into the mans groin the man yelled out and thomas kicked the back of the blade to drive it home bastard he said kicking the blade again bastard a welshman speared the man and two more leaped his body and their long hair and beards smeared with blood lunged their redbladed spears at the next rank of defenders there must have been twenty or more enemy in the alley and thomas and his companions were fewer than a dozen but the french were nervous and the attackers were confident and so they ripped into them with spear and sword and falchion just hacking and stabbing slicing and cursing them killing in a welter of summer hatred more and more english and welsh were swarming up from the river and the sound they made was a keening noise a howl for blood and a wail of derision for a wealthy enemy these were the hounds of war that had escaped from their kennels and they were taking this great city that the lords of the army had supposed would hold the english advance for a month the defenders in the alley broke and ran thomas hacked a man down from behind and wrenched the blade free with a scraping noise of steel on bone the hobelars kicked in a door claiming the house beyond as their property a rush of archers in the prince of waless green and white livery poured down the alley following thomas into a long and pretty garden where pear trees grew about neat plots of herbs thomas was struck by the incongruity of such a beautiful place under a sky filled with smoke and terrible with screams the garden had a border of sweet rocket waliflowers and peonies and seats under a vine trellis and for an instant it looked like a scrap of heaven but then the archers trampled the herbs threw down the grape arbour and ran across the flowers a group of frenchmen tried to drive the invaders out of the garden they approached from the east from out of the mass of men waiting behind the bridges barbican they were led by three mounted menatarms who all wore blue surcoats decorated with yellow stars they jumped their horses over the low fences and shouted as they raised their long swords ready to strike the arrows smacked into the horses thomas had not unslung his bow but some of the princes archers had arrows on their cords and they aimed at the horses instead of the riders the arrows bit deep the horses screamed reared and fell and the archers swarmed over the fallen men with axes and swords thomas went to the right heading off the frenchmen on foot most of whom seemed to be townsfolk armed with anything from small axes to thatchhooks to ancient twohanded swords he cut the falchion through a leather coat kicked the blade free swung it so that blood streamed in droplets from the blade then hacked again the french wavered saw more archers coming from the alley and fled back to the barbican the archers were hacking at the unsaddled horsemen one of the fallen men screamed as the blades chopped at his arms and trunk the blue and yellow surcoats were soaked in blood then thomas saw that it was not yellow stars on a blue field but hawks hawks with their wings raised and their claws outstretched sir guillaume devecques men maybe sir guillaume himself but when he looked at the grimacing bloodspattered faces thomas saw that all three had been young men but sir guillaume was here in caen and the lance thomas thought must be near he broke through the fence and headed down another alley behind him in the house that the hobelars had commandeered a woman cried the first of many the church bells were falling silent edward the third by the grace of god king of england led close to twelve thousand fighting men and by now a fifth of them were on the island and still more were coming no one had led them there the only orders they had received were to retreat but they had disobeyed and so they had captured caen though the enemy still held the bridge barbican from where they were spitting crossbow bolts thomas emerged from the alley into the main street where he joined a group of archers who swamped the crenellated tower with arrows and under their cover a howling mob of welsh and english overwhelmed the frenchmen cowering under the barbicans arch before charging the defenders of the bridge barricade who were now assailed on both sides the frenchmen seeing their doom threw down their weapons and shouted that they yielded but the archers were in no mood for quarter they just howled and attacked frenchmen were tossed into the river and then scores of men hauled the barricade apart tipping its furniture and wagons over the parapet the great mass of frenchmen who had been waiting behind the barbican scattered into the island most thomas assumed going to rescue their wives and daughters they were pursued by the vengeful archers who had been waiting at the bridges far side and the grim crowd went past thomas going into the heart of the ile saint jean where the screams were now constant the cry of havoc was everywhere the barbican tower was still held by the french though they were no longer using their crossbows for fear of retaliation by the english arrows no one tried to take the tower though a small group of archers stood in the bridges centre and stared up at the banners hanging from the ramparts thomas was about to go into the islands centre when he heard the clash of hooves on stone and he looked back to see a dozen french knights who must have been concealed behind the barbican those men now erupted from a gate and with visors closed and lances couched spurred their horses towards the bridge they plainly wanted to charge clean through the old city to reach the greater safety of the castle thomas took a few steps towards the frenchmen then thought better of it no one wanted to resist a dozen fully armoured knights but he saw the blue and yellow surcoat saw the hawks on a knights shield and he unslung his bow and took an arrow from the bag he hauled the cord back the frenchmen were just spurring onto the bridge and thomas shouted fvecque evecque he wanted sir guillaume if it was he to see his killer and the man in the blue and yellow surcoat did half turn in the saddle though thomas could not see his enemys face because the visor was down he loosed but even as he let the cord snap he saw that the arrow was warped it flew low smacking into the mans left leg instead of the small of his back where thomas had aimed he pulled a second arrow out but the dozen knights were on the bridge now their horses hooves striking sparks from the cobbles and the leading men lowered their lances to batter the handful of archers aside and then they were through and galloping up the further streets towards the castle the whitefledged arrow still jutted from the knights thigh where it had sunk deep and thomas sent a second arrow after it but that one vanished in the smoke as the french fugitives disappeared in the old citys tight streets the castle had not fallen but the city and the island belonged to the english they did not belong to the king yet because the great lords the earls and the barons had not captured either place they belonged to the archers and the hobelars and they now set about plundering the wealth of caen the ile saint jean was other than paris itself the fairest plumpest and most elegant city in northern france its houses were beautiful its gardens fragrant its streets wide its churches wealthy and its citizens as they should be civilized into that pleasant place came a savage horde of muddy bloody men who found riches beyond their dreams what the hellequin had done to countless breton villages was now visited on a great city it was a time for killing for rape and wanton cruelty any frenchman was an enemy and every enemy was cut down the leaders of the city garrison magnates of france were safe in the upper floors of the barbican tower and they stayed there until they recognized some english lords to whom they could safely surrender while a dozen knights had escaped to the castle a few other lords and knights managed to outgallop the invading english and flee across the islands southern bridge but at least a dozen titled men whose ransoms could have made a hundred archers rich as princelings were cut down like dogs and reduced to mangled meat and weltering blood knights and menatarms who could have paid a hundred or two hundred pounds for their freedom were shot with arrows or dubbed down in the mad rage which possessed the army as for the humbler men the citizens armed with lengths of timber mattocks or mere knives they were just slaughtered caen the city of the conqueror that had become rich on english plunder was killed that day and the wealth of it was given back to englishmen and not just its wealth its women too to be a woman in caen that day was to be given a foretaste of hell there was little fire for men wanted the houses to be plundered rather than burned but there were devils aplenty men begged for the honour of their wives and daughters then were forced to watch that honour being trampled many women hid but they were found soon enough by men accustomed to riddling out hiding places in attics or under stairs the women were driven to the streets stripped bare and paraded as trophies one merchants wife monstrously fat was harnessed to a small cart and whipped naked up and down the main street which ran the length of the island for an hour or more the archers made her run some men laughing themselves to tears at the sight of her massive rolls of fat and when they were bored with her they tossed her into the river where she crouched weeping and calling for her children until an archer who had been trying out a captured crossbow on a pair of swans put a quarrel through her throat men laden with silver plate were staggering over the bridge others were still searching for riches and instead found ale cider or wine and so the excesses grew worse a priest was hanged from a tavern sign after he tried to stop a rape some menatarms very few tried to stem the horror but they were hugely outnumbered and driven back to the bridge the church of saint jean which was said to contain the fingerbones of saint john the divine a hoof of the horse saint paul was riding to damascus and one of the baskets that had held the miraculous loaves and fishes was turned into a brothel where the women who had fled to the church for sanctuary were sold to grinning soldiers men paraded in silks and lace and threw dice for the women from whom they had stolen the finery thomas took no part what happened could not be stopped not by one man nor even by a hundred men another army could have quelled the mass rape but in the end thomas knew it would be the stupor of drunkenness that would finish it instead he searched for his enemys house wandering from street to street until he found a dying frenchman and gave him a drink of water before asking where sir guillaume devecque lived the man rolled his eyes gasped for breath and stammered that the house was in the southern part of the island you cannot miss it the man said it is stone all stone and has three hawks carved above the door thomas walked south bands of the earl of warwicks menatarms were coming in force to the island to restore order but they were still struggling with the archers close to the bridge and thomas was going to the southern part of the island which had not suffered as badly as the streets and alleys closer to the bridge he saw the stone house above the roofs of some plundered shops most other buildings were halftimbered and strawroofed but sir guillaume devecques twostorey mansion was almost a fortress its walls were stone its roof tiled and its windows small but still some archers had got inside for thomas could hear screams he crossed a small square where a large oak grew through the cobbles strode up the house steps and under an arch that was surmounted by the three carved hawks he was surprised by the depth of anger that the sight of the escutcheon gave him this was revenge he told himself for hookton he went through the hallway to find a group of archers and hobelars squabbling over the kitchen pots two menservants lay dead by the hearth in which a fire still smouldered one of the archers snarled at thomas that they had reached the house first and its contents were theirs but before thomas could answer he heard a scream from the upper floor and he turned and ran up the big wooden stairway two rooms opened from the upper hallway and thomas pushed open one of the doors to see an archer in the prince of waless livery struggling with a girl the man had half torn off her pale blue dress but she was fighting back like a vixen clawing at his face and kicking his shins then just as thomas came into the room the man managed to subdue her with a great clout to the head the girl gasped and fell back into the wide and empty hearth as the archer turned on thomas shes mine he said curtly go and find your own thomas looked at the girl she was fairhaired thin and weeping he remembered jeanettes anguish after the duke had raped her and he could not stomach seeing such pain inflicted on another girl not even a girl in sir guillaume devecques mansion i think youve hurt her enough he said he crossed himself remembering his sins in brittany let her go he added the archer a bearded man a dozen years older than thomas drew his sword it was an old weapon broadbladed and sturdy and the man hefted it confidently listen boy he said im going to watch you go through that door and if you dont ill string your goddamn guts from wall to wall thomas hefted the falchion ive sworn an oath to saint guinefort he told the man to protect all women goddamn fool the man leaped at thomas lunged and thomas stepped back and parried so that the blades struck sparks as they rang together the bearded man was quick to recover lunged again and thomas took another backwards step and swept the sword aside with the falchion the girl was watching from the hearth with wide blue eyes thomas swung his broad blade missed and was almost skewered by the sword but he stepped aside just in time then kicked the bearded man in the knee so that he hissed with pain then thomas swept the falchion in a great haymaking blow that cut into the bearded mans neck blood arced across the room as the man without a sound dropped to the floor the falchion had very nearly severed his head and the blood still pulsed from the open wound as thomas knelt beside his victim if anyone asks he said to the girl in french your father did this then ran away he had got into too much trouble after murdering a squire in brittany and did not want to compound the crime by the death of an archer he took four small coins from the archers pouch then smiled at the girl who had remained remarkably calm while a man was almost decapitated in front of her eyes im not going to hurt you thomas said i promise she watched him from the hearth you wont not today he said gently she stood shaking the dizziness from her head she pulled her dress close at her neck and tied the torn parts together with loose threads you may not hurt me she said but others will not if you stay with me thomas said here he took the big black bow from his shoulder unstrung it and tossed it to her carry that he said and everyone will know youre an archers woman no one will touch you then she frowned at the weight of the bow no one will hurt me not if you carry that thomas promised her again is this your house i work here she said for sir guillaume devecque he asked and she nodded is he here she shook her head i dont know where he is thomas reckoned his enemy was in the castle where he would be trying to extricate an arrow from his thigh did he keep a lance here he asked a great black lance with a silver blade she shook her head quickly thomas frowned the girl he could see was trembling she had shown bravery but perhaps the blood seeping from the dead mans neck was unsettling her he also noted she was a pretty girl despite the bruises on her face and the dirt in her tangle of fair hair she had a long face made solemn by big eyes do you have family here thomas asked her my mother died i have no one except sir guillaume and he left you here alone thomas asked scornfully no she protested he thought wed be safe in the city but then when your army came the men decided to defend the island instead they left the city because all the good houses are here she sounded indignant so what do you do for sir guillaume thomas asked her i clean she said and milk the cows on the other side of the river she flinched as men shouted angrily from the square outside thomas smiled its all right no one will hurt you hold on to the bow if anyone looks at you say i am an archers woman he repeated it slowly then made her say the phrase over and over till he was satisfied good he smiled at her whats your name eleanor he doubted it would serve much purpose to search the house though he did but there was no lance of saint george hidden in any of the rooms there was no furniture no tapestries nothing of any value except the spits and pots and dishes in the kitchen everything precious eleanor said had gone to the castle a week before thomas looked at the shattered dishes on the kitchen flagstones how long have you worked for him he asked all my life eleanor said then added shyly im fifteen and you never saw a great lance that he brought back from england no she said eyes wide but something about her expression made thomas think she was lying though he did not challenge her he decided he would question her later when she had learned to trust him youd better stay with me he told eleanor then you wont get hurt ill take you to the encampment and when our army moves on you can come back here what he really meant was that she could stay with him and become a true archers woman but that like the lance could wait a day or two she nodded accepting that fate with equanimity she must have prayed to be spared the rape that tortured caen and thomas was her prayers answer he gave her his arrow bag so that she looked even more like an archers woman well have to go through the city he told eleanor as he led her down the staircases o stay close he went down the houses outer steps the small square was now crowded with mounted menatarms wearing the badge of the bear and ragged staff they had been sent by the earl of warwick to stop the slaughter and robbery and they stared hard at thomas but he lifted his hands to show he was carrying nothing then threaded between the horses he had gone perhaps a dozen paces when he realized that eleanor was not with him she was terrified of the horsemen in dirty mail their grim faces framed in steel and so she had hesitated at the house door thomas opened his mouth to call her and just then a horseman spurred at him from under the branches of the oak thomas looked up then the flat of a sword blade hammered into the side of his head and he was pitched forward his ear bleeding onto the cobblestones the falchion fell from his hand then the mans horse stepped on his forehead and thomass vision was seared with lightning the man climbed from the saddle and stamped his armoured foot on thomass head thomas felt the pain heard the protests from the other menatarms then felt nothing as he was kicked a second time but in the few heartbeats before he lost consciousness he had recognized his assailant sir simon jekyll despite his agreement with the earl wanted revenge perhaps thomas was lucky perhaps his guardian saint whether dog or man was looking after him for if he had been conscious he would have suffered torture sir simon might have put his signature to the agreement with the earl the previous night but the sight of thomas had driven any mercy from his mind he remembered the humiliation of being hunted naked through the trees and he recalled the pain of the crossbow bolt in his leg a wound that still made him limp and those memories provoked nothing except a wish to give thomas a long slow hurting that would leave the archer screaming but thomas had been stunned by the flat of the sword and by the kicks to his head and he did not know a thing as two menatarms dragged him towards the oak at first the earl of warwicks men had tried to protect thomas from sir simon but when he assured them that the man was a deserter a thief and a murderer they had changed their minds they would hang him and sir simon would let them if these men hanged thomas as a deserter then no one could accuse sir simon of executing the archer he would have kept his word and the earl of northampton would still have to forfeit his share of the prize money thomas would be dead and sir simon would be both richer and happier the menatarms were willing enough once they heard thomas was a murderous thief they had orders to hang enough rioters thieves and rapists to cool the armys ardour but this quarter of the island being furthest from the old city had not seen the same atrocities as the northern half and so these menatarms had been denied the opportunity to use the ropes which the earl had issued now they had a victim and so one man tossed the rope over an oak branch thomas was aware of little of it he felt nothing as sir simon searched him and cut away the money pouch from under his tunic he did not know a thing when the rope was knotted about his neck but then he was dimly aware of the stench of horse urine and suddenly there was a tightening at his gullet and his slowly recovering sight was sheeted with red he felt himself hauled into the air then tried to gasp because of a dreadful gripping pain in his throat but he could not gasp and he could scarcely breathe he could only feel a burning and choking as the smoky air scraped in his windpipe he wanted to scream in terror but his lungs could do nothing except give him agony he had an instants lucidity as he realized he was dangling and jerking and twitching and though he scrabbled at his neck with his hooked fingers he could not loosen the ropes strangling grip then in terror he pissed himself yellow bastard sir simon sneered and he struck at thomass body with his sword though the blow did little more than slice the flesh at thomass waist and swing his body on the rope leave him be one of the menatarms said hes a dead un and they watched until thomass movements became spasmodic then they mounted and rode on a group of archers also watched from one of the houses in the square and their presence scared sir simon who feared they might be friends of thomas and so when the earls men left the square he rode with them his own followers were searching the nearby church of saint michael and sir simon had only come to the square because he had seen the tall stone house and wondered if it contained plunder instead he had found thomas and now thomas was hanged it was not the revenge sir simon had dreamed of but there had been pleasure in it and that was a compensation thomas felt nothing now it was all darkness and no pain he was dancing the rope to hell his head to one side body still swinging slightly legs twitching hands curling and feet dripping the army stayed five days in caen some three hundred frenchmen of rank all of whom could yield ransoms had been taken prisoner and they were escorted north to where they could take ship for england the injured english and welsh soldiers were carried to the abbaye aux dames where they lay in the cloisters their wounds stinking so high that the prince and his entourage moved to the abbaye aux hommes where the king had his quarters the bodies of the massacred citizens were cleared from the streets a priest of the kings household tried to bury the dead decently as befitted christians but when a common grave was dug in the churchyard of saint jean it could hold only five hundred bodies and no one had time or spades enough to bury the rest so four and a half thousand corpses were tipped into the rivers the citys survivors creeping out of their hiding places when the madness of the sack was over wandered along the riverbanks to search for their relatives among the corpses that were stranded by the falling tide their searches disturbed the wild dogs and the screeching flocks of ravens and gulls that squabbled as they feasted on the bloated dead the castle was still in french hands its walls were high and thick and no ladder could scale them the king sent a herald to demand the garrisons surrender but the french lords in the great keep politely refused and then invited the english to do their worst confident that no mangonel or catapult could hurl a stone high enough to breach their lofty walls the king reckoned they were right so instead ordered his gunners to break down the castles stones and the armys five largest cannon were trundled through the old city on their wagons three of the guns were long tubes made from wroughtiron strips bound by steel hoops while two had been cast in brass by bellfounders and looked like bulbous jars with swollen oval bellies narrow necks and flaring mouths all were around five feet long and needed shearlegs to be swung from their wagons onto wooden cradles the cradles were set on planks of wood the ground under the gun carriages had been graded so that the guns could point up towards the castles gate bring down the gate the king had ordered and he could release his archers and menatarms in an assault so the gunners most of them men from flanders or italy who were skilled in this work mixed their gunpowder it was made from saltpetre sulphur and charcoal but the saltpetre was heavier than the other ingredients and always settled to the bottom of the barrels while the charcoal rose to the top so the gunners had to stir the mix thoroughly before they ladled the deadly powder into the bellies of the jars they placed a shovelful of loam made from water and clay soil in the narrow part of each guns neck before loading the crudely sculpted stone balls that were the missiles the loam was to seal the firing chamber so that the power of the explosion did not leak away before all the powder had caught the fire still more loam was packed about the stone balls to fill the space between the missiles and the barrels then the gunners had to wait while the loam hardened to make a firmer seal the other three guns were quicker to load each iron tube was lashed to a massive wooden cradle that ran the length of the gun then turned in a right angle so that the guns breech rested against a baulk of solid oak that breech a quarter of the guns length was separate from the barrel and was lifted clean out of the cradle and set upright on the ground where it was filled with the precious black powder once the three breech chambers were filled they were sealed by willow plugs to contain the explosion then slotted back into their cradles the three tube barrels had already been loaded two with stone balls and the third with a yardlong garro a giant arrow made of iron the three breech chambers had to be worked firmly against the barrels so that the force of the explosion did not escape through the joint between the guns two parts the gunners used wooden wedges that they hammered between the breech and the oak at the back of the cradle and every blow of the mauls sealed the joints imperceptibly tighter other gunners were ladling powder into the spare breech chambers that would fire the next shots it all took time well over an hour for the loam in the two bulbous guns to set firm enough and the work attracted a huge crowd of curious onlookers who stood a judicious distance away to be safe from fragments should any of the strange machines explode the french just as curious watched from the castle battlements once in a while a defender would shoot a crossbow quarrel but the range was too long one bolt came within a dozen yards of the guns but the rest fell well short and each failure provoked a jeer from the watching archers finally the french abandoned the provocation and just watched the three tube guns could have been fired first for they had no loam to set but the king wanted the first volley to be simultaneous he envisaged a mighty blow in which the five missiles would shatter the castle gate and once the gate was down he would have his gunners gnaw at the gates arch the master gunner a tall and lugubrious italian finally declared the weapons ready and so the fuses were fetched these were short lengths of hollow straw filled with gunpowder their ends sealed with clay and the fuses were pushed down through the narrow touchholes the master gunner pinched the clay seal from each fuses upper end then made the sign of the cross a priest had already blessed the guns sprinkling them with holy water and now the master gunner knelt and looked at the king who was mounted on a tall grey stallion the king yellowbearded and blueeyed looked up at the castle a new banner had been hung from the ramparts showing god holding a hand in blessing over a fleurdelis it was time he thought to show the french whose side god was really on you may fire he said solemnly five gunners armed themselves with linstocks long wands that each held a length of glowing linen they stood well to the side of the guns and at a signal from the italian they touched the fire to the exposed fuses there was a brief fizzing a puff of smoke from the touchholes then the five mouths vanished in a cloud of greywhite smoke in which five monstrous flames stabbed and writhed as the guns themselves firmgripped by their cradles slammed back along their plank bedding to thud against the mounds of earth piled behind each breech the noise of the weapons hammered louder than the loudest thunder it was a noise that physically pounded the eardrums and echoed back from the pale castle walls and when the sound at last faded the smoke still hung in a shabby screen in front of the guns that now lay askew on their carriages with gently smoking muzzles the noise had startled a thousand nesting birds up from the old citys roofs and the castles higher turrets yet the gate appeared undamaged the stone balls had shattered themselves against the walls while the garro had done nothing except gouge a furrow in the approach road the french who had ducked behind the battlements when the noise and smoke erupted now stood and called insults as the gunners stoically began to realign their weapons the king thirtyfour years old and not as confident as his bearing suggested frowned as the smoke cleared did we use enough powder he demanded of the master gunner the question had to be translated into italian by a priest use more powder sire the italian said and the guns will shatter he spoke regretfully men always expected his machines to work miracles and he was tired of explaining that even black powder needed time and patience to do its work you know best the king said dubiously im sure you know best he was hiding his disappointment for he had half hoped that the whole castle would shatter like glass when the missiles struck his entourage most of them older men were looking contemptuous for they had little faith in guns and even less in italian gunners who the king asked a companion is that woman with my son the countess of armorica sire she fled from brittany the king shuddered not because of jeanette but because the rotten smell of the powder smoke was pungent he grows up fast he said with just a touch of jealousy in his voice he was bedding some peasant girl who was pleasant enough and knew her business but she was not as beautiful as the blackhaired countess who accompanied his son jeanette unaware that the king watched her gazed at the castle in search of any sign that it had been struck by gunfire so what happened she asked the prince it takes time the prince said hiding his surprise that the castle gate had not magically vanished in an eruption of splinters but they do say he went on that in the future we shall fight with nothing but guns mysepuddled loam to the nearest gun the grass in front of the guns was burning in a score of places and the air was filled with a stench like rotted eggs that was even more repugnant than the smell of the corpses in the river if it amuses you my dear then i am glad we have the machines the prince said then frowned because a group of his whiteandgreenclad archers were jeering the gunners whatever happened to the man who brought you from normandy he asked i should have thanked him for his services to you jeanette feared she was blushing but made her voice careless i have not seen him since we came here the prince twisted in his saddle bohun he called to the earl of northampton didnt my ladys personal archer join your fellows he did sire so where is he the earl shrugged vanished we think he must have died crossing the river poor fellow the prince said poor fellow and jeanette to her surprise felt a pang of sorrow then thought it was probably for the best she was the widow of a count and now the lover of a prince and thomas if he was on the rivers bed could never tell the truth poor man she said lightly and he behaved so gallantly to me she was looking away from the prince in case he saw her flushed face and she found herself staring to her utter astonishment at sir simon jekyll who with another group of knights had come for the entertainment of the guns sir simon was laughing evidently amused that so much noise and smoke had produced so little effect jeanette disbelieving her eyes just stared at him she had gone pale the sight of sir simon had brought back the memories of her worst days in la rochederrien the days of fear poverty humiliation and the uncertainty of knowing to whom she could turn for help i fear we never rewarded the fellow the prince said still speaking of thomas then he saw that jeanette was taking no notice my dear the prince prompted but she still looked away from him my lady the prince spoke louder touching her arm sir simon had noticed there was a woman with the prince but he had not realized it was jeanette he only saw a slender lady in a pale gold dress seated sidesaddle on an expensive palfrey that was hung with green and white ribbons the woman wore a tall hat from which a veil stirred in the wind the veil had concealed her profile but now she was staring directly at him indeed she was pointing at him and to his horror he recognized the countess he also recognized the banner of the young man beside her though at first he could not believe she was with the prince then he saw the grim entourage of mailed men behind the fairhaired youth and he had an impulse to flee but instead nervelessly dropped to his knees as the prince jeanette and the horsemen approached him he fell full length on the ground his heart was beating wildly his mind a whirl of panic your name the prince demanded curtly sir simon opened his mouth but no words would come his name jeanette said vengefully is sir simon jekyll he tried to strip me naked sire and then he would have raped me if i had not been rescued he stole my money my armour my horses my ships and he would have taken my honour with as much delicacy as a wolf stealing a lamb is it true the prince demanded sir simon still could not speak but the earl of northumberland intervened the ships armour and horses sire were spoils of war i granted them to him and the rest bohun the rest sire the earl shrugged the rest sir simon must explain for himself but it seems he is speechless the prince said have you lost your tongue jekyll sir simon raised his head and caught jeanettes gaze and it was so triumphant that he dropped his head again he knew he should say something anything but his tongue seemed too big for his mouth and he feared he would merely stammer nonsense so he kept silent you tried to smirch a ladys honour the prince accused sir simon edward of woodstock had high ideas of chivalry for his tutors had ever read to him from the romances he understood that war was not as gentle as the handwritten books liked to suggest but he believed that those who were in places of honour should display it whatever the common man might do the prince was also in love another ideal encouraged by the romances jeanette had captivated him and he was determined that her honour would be upheld he spoke again but his words were drowned by the sound of a tube gun firing everyone turned to stare at the castle but the stone ball merely shattered against the gate tower doing no damage would you fight me for the ladys honour the prince demanded of sir simon sir simon would have been happy to fight the prince so long as he could have been assured that his victory would bring no reprisals he knew the boy had a reputation as a warrior yet the prince was not full grown and nowhere near as strong or experienced as sir simon but only a fool fought against a prince and expected to win the king it was true entered tournaments but he did so disguised in plain armour without a surcoat so that his opponents had no idea of his identity but if sir simon fought the prince then he would not dare use his full strength for any injury done would be repaid a thousandfold by the princes supporters and indeed even as sir simon hesitated the grim men behind the prince spurred their horses forward as if offering themselves as champions for the fight sir simon overwhelmed by reality shook his head if you will not fight the prince said in his high clear voice then we must assume your guilt and demand recompense you owe the lady armour and a sword the armour was fairly taken sire the earl of northampton pointed out no man can take armour and weapons from a mere woman fairly the prince snapped where is the armour now jekyll lost sir sir simon spoke for the first time he wanted to tell the prince the whole story how jeanette had arranged an ambush but that tale ended with his own humiliation and he had the sense to keep quiet then that mail coat will have to suffice the prince declared take it off and the sword too sir simon gaped at the prince but saw he was serious he unbuckled the sword belt and let it drop then hauled the mail coat over his head so that he was left in his shirt and breeches what is in the pouch the prince demanded pointing at the heavy leather bag suspended about sir simons neck sir simon sought an answer and found none but the truth which was that the pouch was the heavy money bag he had taken from thomas it is money sire then give it to her ladyship sir simon lifted the bag over his head and held it out to jeanette who smiled sweetly thank you sir simon she said your horse is forfeit too the prince decreed and you will leave this encampment by midday for you are not welcome in our company you may go home jekyll but in england you will not have our favour sir simon looked into the princes eyes for the first time you damned miserable little pup he thought with your mothers milk still sour on your unshaven lips then he shook as he was struck by the coldness of the princes eyes he bowed knowing he was being banished and he knew it was unfair but there was nothing he could do except appeal to the king yet the king owed him no favours and no great men of the realm would speak for him and so he was effectively an outcast he could go home to england but there men would soon learn he had incurred royal disfavour and his life would be endless misery he bowed he turned and he walked away in his dirty shirt as silent men opened a path for him the cannon fired on they fired four times that day and eight the next and at the end of the two days there was a splintered rent in the castle gate that might have given entrance to a starved sparrow the guns had done nothing except hurt the gunners ears and shatter stone balls against the castles ramparts not a frenchman had died though one gunner and an archer had been killed when one of the brass guns exploded into a myriad redhot scraps of metal the king realizing that the attempt was ridiculous ordered the guns taken away and the siege of the castle abandoned and the next day the whole army left caen they marched eastwards going towards paris and after them crawled their wagons and their camp followers and their herds of beef cattle and for a long time afterwards the eastern sky showed white where the dust of their marching hazed the air but at last the dust settled and the city ravaged and sacked was left alone the folk who had succeeded in escaping from the island crept back to their homes the splintered door of the castle was pushed open and its garrison came down to see what was left of caen for a week the priests carried an image of saint jean about the littered streets and sprinkled holy water to get rid of the lingering stink of the enemy they said masses for the souls of the dead and prayed fervently that the wretched english would meet the king of france and have their own ruin visited on them but at least the english were gone and the violated city ruined could stir again light came first a hazy light smeared in which thomas thought he could see a wide window but a shadow moved against the window and the light went he heard voices then they faded in pascuis herbarum addinavit me the words were in his head he makes me lie down in leafy pastures a psalm the same psalm from which his father had quoted his dying words calix meus inebrians my cup makes me drunk only he was not drunk breathing hurt and his chest felt as though he was being pressed by the torture of the stones then there was blessed darkness and oblivion once more the light came again it wavered the shadow was there the shadow moved towards him and a cool hand was laid on his forehead i do believe you are going to live a mans voice said in a tone of surprise thomas tried to speak but only managed a strangled grating sound it astonishes me the voice went on what young men can endure babies too life is marvellously strong such a pity we waste it its plentiful enough another man said the voice of the privileged the first man whose hand was still on thomass forehead answered you take life he saids o value it as a thief values his victims and you are a victim of course a learned victim a wise victim even a valuable victim but still a victim and this young man what is he an english archer the second voice said sourly and if we had any sense wed kill him here and now i think we shall try and feed him instead help me raise him hands pushed thomas upright in the bed and a spoonful of warm soup was put into his mouth but he could not swallow and so spat the soup onto the blankets pain seared through him and the darkness came again the light came a third time or perhaps a fourth he could not tell perhaps he dreamed it but this time an old man stood outlined against the bright window the man had a long black robe but he was not a priest or monk for the robe was not gathered at the waist and he wore a small square black hat over his long white hair god thomas tried to say though the word came out as a guttural grunt the old man turned he had a long forked beard and was holding a jordan jar it had a narrow neck and a round belly and the bottle was filled with a pale yellow liquid that the man held up to the light he peered at the liquid then swilled it about before sniffing the jars mouth are you awake yes and you can speak what a doctor i am my brilliance astonishes me if only it would persuade my patients to pay me but most believe i should be grateful that they dont spit at me would you say this urine is clear thomas nodded and wished he had not for the pain jarred through his neck and down his spine you do not consider it turgid not dark no indeed not it smells and tastes healthy too a good flask of clear yellow urine and there is no better sign of good health alas it is not yours the doctor pushed open the window and poured the urine away swallow he instructed thomas thomass mouth was dry but he obediently tried to swallow and immediately gasped with pain i think the doctor said that we had best try a thin gruel very thin with some oil i believe or better still butter that thing tied about your neck is a strip of cloth which has been soaked in holy water it was not my doing but i did not forbid it you christians believe in magic indeed you could have no faith without a trust in magic so i must indulge your beliefs is that a dogs paw about your neck dont tell me im sure i dont want to know however when you recover i trust you will understand that it was neither dog paws nor wet cloths that healed you but my skill i have bled you i have applied poultices of dung moss and clove and i have sweated you eleanor though will insist it was her prayers and that tawdry strip of wet cloth that revived you eleanor she cut you down dear boy you were half dead by the time i arrived you were more dead than alive and i advised her to let you expire in peace i told her you were halfway in what you insist is hell and that i was too old and too tired to enter into a tugging contest with the devil but eleanor insisted and i have ever found it difficult to resist her entreaties gruel with rancid butter i think you are weak dear boy very weak do you have a name thomas mine is mordecai though you may call me doctor you wont of course youll call me a damned jew a christ murderer a secret worshipper of pigs and a kidnapper of christian children this was all said cheerfully how absurd who would want to kidnap children christian or otherwise vile things the only mercy of children is that they grow up as my son has but then tragically they beget more children we do not learn lifes lessons doctor thomas croaked thomas thank you an englishman with manners the worlds wonders never cease wait there thomas and do not have the bad manners to die while im gone i shall fetch gruel doctor i am still here where am i in the house of my friend and quite safe your friend sir guillaume devecque knight of the sea and of the land and as great a fool as any i know but a goodhearted fool he does at least pay me thomas closed his eyes he did not really understand what the doctor had said or perhaps he did not believe it his head was aching there was pain all through his body from his aching head down to his throbbing toes he thought of his mother because that was comforting then he remembered being hauled up the tree and he shivered he wished he could sleep again for in sleep there was no pain but then he was made to sit up and the doctor forced a pungent oily gruel into his mouth and he managed not to spit it out or throw it up there must have been mushrooms in the gruel or else it had been infused with the hemplike leaves that the hookton villagers had called angel salad for after he had eaten he had vivid dreams but less pain when he awoke it was dark and he was alone but he managed to sit up and even stand though he tottered and had to sit again next morning when the birds were calling from the oak branches where he had so nearly died a tall man came into the room the man was on crutches and his left thigh was swathed in bandages he turned to look at thomas and showed a face that was horribly scarred a blade had cut him from the forehead to the jaw taking the mans left eye in its savage chop he had long yellow hair very shaggy and full and thomas guessed the man had been handsome once though now he looked like a thing of nightmare mordecai the man growled tells me you will live with gods help thomas said i doubt gods interested in you the man said sourly he looked to be in his thirties and had the bowed legs of a horseman and the deep chest of a man who practises hard with weapons he swung on the crutches to the window where he sat on the sill his beard was streaked with white where the blade had chopped into his jaw and his voice was uncommonly deep and harsh but you might live with mordecais help there isnt a physician to touch him in all normandy though christ alone knows how he does it hes been squinting at my piss for a week now im crippled you jewish halfwit i tell him not wounded in the bladder but he just tells me to shut my mouth and squeeze out more drops hell start on you soon the man who wore nothing except a long white shirt contemplated thomas moodily i have a notion he growled that you are the godforsaken bastard who put an arrow into my thigh i remember seeing a son of a whore with long hair like yours then i was hit youre sir guillaume i am i meant to kill you thomas said so why shouldnt i kill you sir guillaume asked you lie in my bed drink my gruel and breathe my air english bastard worse youre a vexille thomas turned his head to stare at the forbidding sir guillaume he said nothing for the last three words had mystified him but i choose not to kill you sir guillaume said because you saved my daughter from rape your daughter eleanor you fool shes a bastard daughter of course sir guillaume said her mother was a servant to my father but eleanor is all ive got left and im fond of her she says you were kind to her which is why she cut you down and why youre lying in my bed she always was overly sentimental he frowned but i still have a mind to slice your damned throat for four years thomas said i have dreamed of slitting yours sir guillaumes one eye gazed at him balefully of course you have youre a vexille ive never heard of the vexilles thomas said my name is thomas of hookton thomas half expected sir guillaume to frown as he tried to remember hookton but his recognition of the name was instant hookton he said hookton good sweet christ hookton he was silent for a few heartbeats and of course youre a damned vexille you have their badge on your bow my bow you gave it to eleanor to carry she kept it thomas closed his eyes there was pain in his neck and down his back and in his head i think it was my fathers badge he said but i dont really know because he would never talk of his family i know he hated his own father i wasnt very fond of my own but your men killed him and i swore to avenge him sir guillaume turned to gaze out of the window you have truly never heard of the vexilles never then you are fortunate he stood they are the devils offspring and you i suspect are one of their pups i would kill you boy with as little conscience as if i stamped on a spider but you were kind to my bastard daughter and for that i thank you he limped from the room leaving thomas in pain and utterly confused thomas recovered in sir guillaumes garden shaded from the sun by two quince trees under which he waited anxiously for doctormordecais daily verdict on the colour consistency taste and smell of his urine it did not seem to matter to the doctor that thomass grotesquely swollen neck was subsiding nor that he could swallow bread and meat again all that mattered was the state of his urine there was the doctor declared no finer method of diagnosis the urine betrays all if it smells rank or if it is dark if it tastes of vinegar or should it be cloudy then it is time for vigorous doctoring but good pale sweetsmelling urine like this is the worst news of all the worst thomas asked alarmed it means fewer fees for a physician dear boy the doctor had survived the sack of caen by hiding in a neighhours pig shed they slaughtered the pigs but missed the jew mind you they broke all my instruments scattered my medicines shattered all but three of my bottles and burned my house which is why i am forced to live here he shuddered as though living in sir guillaumes mansion was a hardship he smelled thomass urine and then uncertain of his diagnosis spilled a drop onto a finger and tasted it very fine he said lamentably fine he poured the jars contents onto a bed of lavender where bees were at work so i lost everything he said and this after we were assured by our great lords that the city would be safe originally the doctor had told thomas the leaders of the garrison had insisted on defending only the walled city and the castle but they needed the help of the townsfolk to man the walls and those townsfolk had insisted that the ile saint jean be defended for that was where the citys wealth lay and so at the very last minute the garrison had streamed across the bridge to disaster fools mordecai said scornfully fools in steel and glory fools thomas and mordecai were sharing the house while sir guillaume visited his estate in evecque some thirty miles south of caen where he had gone to raise more men he will fight on the doctor said wounded leg or not what will he do with me nothing the doctor said confidently he likes you despite all his bluster you saved eleanor didnt you hes always been fond of her his wife wasnt but he is what happened to his wife she died mordecai saids he just died thomas could eat properly now and his strength returned fast so that he could walk about the ile saint jean with eleanor the island looked as though a plague had struck for over half the houses were empty and even those that were occupied were still blighted by the sack shutters were missing doors splintered and the shops had no goods some country folk were selling beans peas and cheeses from wagons and small boys were offering fresh perch taken from the rivers but they were still hungry days they were also nervous days for the citys survivors feared that the hated english might return and the island was still haunted by the sickly smell of the corpses in the two rivers where the gulls rats and dogs grew fat eleanor hated walking about the city preferring to go south into the countryside where blue dragonflies flew above water lilies in the streams that twisted between fields of overripe rye barley and wheat i love harvest time she told thomas we used to go into the fields and help there would be little harvest this year for there were no folk to cut the grain and so the corn buntings were stripping the heads and pigeons were squabbling over the leavings there should be a feast at harvests end eleanor said wistfully we had a feast too thomas said and we used to hang corn dollies in the church corn dollies he made her a little doll from straw we used to hang thirteen of these above the altar he told her one for christ and one each for the apostles he picked some cornflowers and gave them to eleanor who threaded them into her hair it was very fair hair like sunlit gold they talked incessantly and one day thomas asked her again about the lance and this time eleanor nodded i lied to you she said because he did have it but it was stolen who stole it she touched her face the man who took his eye a man called vexille she nodded solemnly i think so but it wasnt here it was in evecque thats his real home he got the caen house when he married tell me about the vexilles thomas urged her i know nothing of them eleanor said and he believed her they were sitting by a stream where two swans floated and a heron stalked frogs in a reedbed thomas had talked earlier of walking away from caen to find the english army and his words must have been weighing on eleanors mind for she frowned at him will you really go i dont know he wanted to be with the army for that was where he belonged though he did not know how he was to find it nor how he was to survive in a countryside where the english had made themselves hated but he also wanted to stay he wanted to learn more about the vexilles and only sir guillaume could satisfy that hunger and day by day he wanted to be with eleanor there was a calm gentleness in her that jeanette had never possessed a gentleness that made him treat her with tenderness for fear that otherwise he would break her he never tired of watching her long face with its slightly hollow cheeks and bony nose and big eyes she was embarrassed by his scrutiny but did not tell him to stop sir guillaume she told him tells me i look like my mother but i dont remember her very well sir guillaume came back to caen with a dozen menatarms whom he had hired in northern alencon he would lead them to war he said along with the halfdozen of his men who had survived the fall of caen his leg was still sore but he could walk without crutches and on the day of his return he summarily ordered thomas to go with him to the church of saint jean eleanor working in the kitchen joined them as they left the house and sir guillaume did not forbid her to come folk bowed as sir guillaume passed and many sought his assurance that the english were truly gone they are marching towards paris he would answer and our king will trap them and kill them you think so thomas asked after one such assurance i pray so sir guillaume growled thats what the king is for isnt it to protect his people and god knows we need protection im told that if you climb that tower he nodded towards the church of saint jean that was their destination you can see the smoke from the towns your army has burned they are conducting a chevauche chevauchee eleanor asked her father sighed a chevauche child is when you march in a great line through your enemys country and you burn destroy and break everything in your path the object of such barbarity is to force your enemy to come out from his fortresses and fight and i think our king will oblige the english and the english bows thomas said will cut his army down like hay sir guillaume looked angry at that but then shrugged a marching army gets worn down he said the horses go lame the boots wear out and the arrows run out and you havent seen the might of france boy for every knight of yours we have six you can shoot your arrows till your bows break but well still have enough men left to kill you he fished in a pouch hanging at his belt and gave some small coins to the beggars at the churchyard gate which lay close to the new grave where the five hundred corpses had been buried it was now a mound of raw earth dotted with dandelions and it stank for when the english had dug the grave they had struck water not far beneath the surface and so the pit was too shallow and the earth covering was too thin to contain the corruption the grave concealed eleanor clapped a hand to her mouth then hurried up the steps into the church where the archers had auctioned the towns wives and daughters the priests had thrice exorcized the church with prayers and holy water but it still had a sad air for the statues were broken and the windows shattered sir guillaume genuflected towards the main altar then led thomas and eleanor up a side aisle where a painting on the limewashed wall showed saint john escaping from the cauldron of boiling oil that the emperor domitian had prepared for him the saint was shown as an ethereal form half smoke and half man floating away in the air while the roman soldiers looked on in perpiexity sir guillaume approached a side altar where he dropped to his knees beside a great black flagstone and thomas to his surprise saw that the frenchman was weeping from his one eye i brought you here sir guillaume said to teach you a lesson about your family thomas did not contradict him he did not know that he was a vexille but the yale on the silver badge suggested he was beneath that stone sir guillaume said lies my wife and my two children a boy and a girl he was six she was eight and their mother was twentyfive years old the house here belonged to her father he gave me his daughter as ransom for a boat i captured it was mere piracy not war but i gained a good wife from it the tears were flowing now and he closed his eye eleanor stood beside him a hand on his shoulder while thomas waited do you know sir guillaume asked after a while why we went to hookton we thought because the tide took you away from poole no we went to hookton on purpose i was paid to go there by a man who called himself the harlequin like hellequin thomas asked it is the same word only he used the italian form a devils soul laughing at god and he even looked like you sir guillaume crossed himself then reached out to trace a finger down the edge of the stone we went to fetch a relic from the church you knew that already surely thomas nodded and i have sworn to get it back sir guillaume seemed to sneer at that ambition i thought it was all foolishness but in those days i thought all life was foolishness why would some miserable church in an insignificant english village have a precious relic but the harlequin insisted he was right and when we took the village we found the relic the lance of saint george thomas said flatly the lance of saint george sir guillaume agreed i had a contract with the harlequin he paid me a little money and the balance was kept by a monk in the abbey here he was a monk that everyone trusted a scholar a fierce man whom folk said would become a saint but when we returned i found that brother martin had fled and he had taken the money with him so i refused to give the lance to the harlequin bring me nine hundred livres in good silver i told him and the lance is yours but he would not pay so i kept the lance i kept it in evecque and the months passed and i heard nothing and i thought the lance had been forgotten then two years ago in the spring the harlequin returned he came with menatarms and he captured the manor he slaughtered everyone everyone and took the lance thomas stared at the black flagstone you lived scarcely sir guillaume said he hauled up his black jacket and showed a terrible scar on his belly they gave me three wounds he went on one to the head one to the belly and one to the leg they told me the one to the head was because i was a fool with no brains the one in the guts was a reward for my greed and the one to the leg was so i would limp down to hell then they left me to watch the corpses of my wife and children while i died but i lived thanks to mordecai he stood wincing as he put his weight onto his left leg i lived he said grimly and i swore i would find the man who did that he pointed at the flagstone and send his soul screaming into the pit it took me a year to discover who he was and you know how i did it when he came to evecque he had his mens shields covered with black cloth but i slashed the cloth of one with my sword and saw the yale so i asked men about the yale i asked them in paris and anjou in burgundy and the dauphine and in the end i found my answer and where did i find it after asking the length and breadth of france i found it here in caen a man here knew the badge the harlequin is a man called vexille i do not know his first name i do not know his rank i just know he is a devil called vexille so the vexilles have the lance they have and the man who killed my family killed your father sir guillaume looked ashamed for a brief instant i killed your mother i think i did anyway but she attacked me and i was angry he shrugged but i did not kill your father and in killing your mother i did nothing more than you have done in brittany true thomas admitted he looked into sir guillaumes eye and could feel no hatred for his mothers death so we share an enemy thomas said and that enemy sir guillaume said is the devil he said it grimly then crossed himself thomas suddenly felt cold for he had found his enemy and his enemy was lucifer that evening mordecai rubbed a salve into thomass neck it is almost healed i think he said and the pain will go though perhaps a little will remain to remind you of how close you came to death he sniffed the garden scents so sir guillaume told you the story of his wife yes and you are related to the man who killed his wife i dont know thomas said truly i dont but the yale suggests i am and sir guillaume probably killed your mother and the man who killed his wife killed your father and sir simon jekyll tried to kill you mordecai shook his head i nightly lament that i was not born a christian i could carry a weapon and join the sport he handed thomas a bottle perform he commanded and what by the by is a yale a heraldic beast thomas explained the doctor sniffed god in his infinite wisdom made the fishes and the whales on the fifth day and on the sixth he made the beasts of the land and he looked at what he had done and saw that it was good but not good enough for the heralds who have to add wings horns tusks and claws to his inadequate work is that all you can do for the moment id get more juice from squeezing a walnut he grumbled and shuffled away eleanor must have been watching for his departure for she appeared from under the pear trees that grew at the gardens end and gestured towards the river gate thomas followed her down to the bank of the river orne where they watched an excited trio of small boys trying to spear a pike with english arrows left after the citys capture will you help my father eleanor asked help him you said his enemy was your enemy thomas sat on the grass and she sat beside him i dont know he said he still did not really believe in any of it there was a lance he knew that and a mystery about his family but he was reluctant to admit that the lance and the mystery must govern his whole life does that mean youll go back to the english army eleanor asked in a small voice i want to stay here thomas said after a pause to be with you she must have known he was going to say something of the sort but she still blushed and gazed at the swirling water where fish rose to the swarms of insects and the three boys vainly splashed you must have a woman she said softly i did thomas said and he told her about jeanette and how she had found the prince of wales and so abandoned him without a glance i will never understand her he admitted but you love her eleanor asked directly no thomas said you say that because youre with me eleanor declared he shook his head my father had a book of saint augustines sayings and there was one that always puzzled me he frowned trying to remember the latin nondum amaham et amare amabam i did not love but yearned to love eleanor gave him a sceptical look a very elaborate way of saying youre lonely yes thomas agreed so what will you do she asked thomas did not speak for a while he was thinking of the penance he had been given by father hobbe i suppose one day i must find the man who killed my father he said after a while but what if he is the devil she asked seriously then i shall wear garlic thomas said lightly and pray to saint guinefort she looked at the darkening water did saint augustine really say that thing nondum amabam et amare amabam thomas said yes he did i know how he felt eleanor said and rested her head on his shoulder thomas did not move he had a choice follow the lance or take his black bow back to the army in truth he did not know what he should do but eleanors body was warm against his and it was comforting and that for the moment was enough and so for the moment he would stay next morning sir guillaume escorted now by a halfdozen menatarms took thomas to the abbaye aux hommes a crowd of petitioners stood at the gates wanting food and clothing that the monks did not have though the abbey itself had escaped the worst of the plundering because it had been the quarters of the king and of the prince of wales the monks themselves had fled at the approach of the english army some had died on the ile saint jean but most had gone south to a brother house and among those was brother germain who when sir guillaume arrived had just returned from his brief exile brother germain was tiny ancient and bent a wisp of a man with white hair myopic eyes and delicate hands with which he was trimming a goose quill the english the old man said use these feathers for their arrows we use them for gods word brother germain thomas was told had been in charge of the monasterys scriptorium for more than thirty years in the course of copying books the monk explained one discovers knowledge whether one wishes it or not most of it is quite useless of course how is mordecai he lives he lives sir guillaume said and sends you this he put a clay pot sealed with wax on the sloping surface of the writing desk the pot slid down until brother germain trapped it and pushed it into a pouch a salve sir guillaume explained to thomas for brother germains joints which ache the monk said and only mordecai can relieve them tis a pity he will burn in hell but in heaven i am assured i shall need no ointments who is this he peered at thomas a friend sir guillaume said who brought me this he was carrying thomass bow which he now laid across the desk and tapped the silver plate brother germain stooped to inspect the badge and thomas heard a sharp intake of breath the yale brother germain said he pushed the bow away then blew the scraps from his sharpened quill off the desk the beast was introduced by the heralds in the last century back then of course there was real scholarship in the world not like today i get young men from paris whose heads are stuffed with wool yet they claim to have doctorates he took a sheet of scrap parchment from a shelf laid it on the desk and dipped his quill in a pot of vermilion ink he let a glistening drop fall onto the parchment and then with the skill gained in a lifetime drew the ink out of the drop in quick strokes he hardly seemed to be taking notice of what he was doing but thomas to his amazement saw a yale taking shape on the parchment the beast is said to be mythical brother germain said flicking the quill to make a tusk and maybe it is most heraldic beasts seem to be inventions who has seen a unicorn he put another drop of ink on the parchment paused a heartbeat then began on the beasts raised paws there is however a notion that the yale exists in ethiopia i could not say not having travelled east of rouen nor have i met any traveller who has been there if indeed ethiopia even exists he frowned the yale is mentioned by pliny however which suggests it was known to the romans though god knows they were a credulous race the beast is said to possess both horns and tusks which seems extravagant and is usually depicted as being silver with yellow spots alas our pigments were stolen by the english but they left us the vermilion which i suppose was kind of them it comes from cinnabar im told is that a plant father jacques rest his soul always claimed it grows in the holy land and perhaps it does do i detect that you are limping sir guillaume a bastard english archer put an arrow in my leg sir guillaume said and i pray nightly that his soul will roast in hell you should instead give thanks that he was inaccurate why do you bring me an english war bow decorated with a yale because i thought it would interest you sir guillaume said and because my young friend here he touched thomass shoulder wants to know about the vexilles he would do much better to forget them brother germain grumbled he was perched on a tall chair and now peered about the room where a dozen young monks tidied the mess left by the monasterys english occupiers some of them chattered as they worked provoking a frown from brother germain this is not caen marketplace he snapped if you want to gossip go to the lavatories i wish i could ask mordecai if he has an unguent for the bowels would you he glowered about the room for an instant then struggled to pick up the bow that he had propped against the desk he looked intently at the yale for an instant then put the bow down there was always a rumour that a branch of the vexille family went to england this seems to confirm it who are they thomas asked brother germain seemed irritated by the direct question or perhaps the whole subject of the vexilles made him uncomfortable they were the rulers of astarac he said a county on the borders of languedoc and the agenais that of course should tell you all you need to know of them it tells me nothing thomas confessed then you probably have a doctorate from paris the old man chuckled at this jest the counts of astarac young man were cathars southern france was infested by that damned heresy and astarac was at the centre of the evil he made the sign of the cross with fingers deepstained by pigments habere non potest he said solemnly deum patrem qui ecciesiam non habet matrem saint cyprian thomas said he cannot have god as his father who does not have the church as his mother i see you are not from paris after all brother germain said the cathars rejected the church looking for salvation within their own dark souls what would become of the church if we all did that if we all pursued our own whims if god is within us then we need no church and no holy father to lead us to his mercy and that notion is the most pernicious of heresies and where did it lead the cathars to a life of dissipation of fleshly lust of pride and of perversion they denied the divinity of christ brother germain made the sign of the cross again and the vexilles were cathars sir guillaume prompted the old man i suspect they were devil worshippers brother germain retorted but certainly the counts of astarac protected the cathars they and a dozen other lords they were called the dark lords and very few of them were perfects the perfects were the sect leaders the heresiarchs and they abstained from wine intercourse and meat and no vexille would willingly abandon those three joys but the cathars allowed such sinners to be among their ranks and promised them the joys of heaven if they recanted before their deaths the dark lords liked such a promise and when the heresy was assailed by the church they fought bitterly he shook his head this was a hundred years ago the holy father and the king of france destroyed the cathars and astarac was one of the last fortresses to fall the fight was dreadful the dead innumerable but the heresiarchs and the dark lords were finally scotched yet some escaped sir guillaume suggested gently brother germain was silent for a while gazing at the drying vermilion ink there was a story he said that some of the cathar lords did survive and that they took their riches to countries all across europe there is even a rumour that the heresy yet survives hidden in the lands where burgundy and the italian states meet he made the sign of the cross i think a part of the vexille family went to england to hide there for it was in england sir guillaume that you found the lance of saint george vexille he said the name thoughtfully it derives of course from vexillaire a standardbearer and it is said that an early vexille discovered the lance while on the crusades and thereafter carried it as a standard it was certainly a symbol of power in those old days myself i am sceptical of these relics the abbot assures me he has seen three foreskins of the infant jesus and even i who hold him blessed above all things doubt he was so richly endowed but i have asked some questions about this lance there is a legend attached to it it is said that the man who carries the lance into battle cannot be defeated mere legend of course but belief in such nonsense inspires the ignorant and there are few more ignorant than soldiers what troubles me most though is their purpose whose purpose thomas asked there is a story brother germain said ignoring the question that before the fall of the last heretic fortresses the surviving dark lords made an oath they knew the war was lost they knew their strongholds must fall and that the inquisition and the forces of god would destroy their people and so they made an oath to visit vengeance on their enemies one day they swore they would bring down the throne of france and the holy mother church and to do it they would use the power of their holiest relics the lance of saint george thomas asked that too brother germain said that too sir guillaume repeated the words in a puzzled tone brother germain dipped his quill and put another glistening drop of ink on the parchment then deftly he finished his copy of the badge on thomass bow the yale he said i have seen before but the badge you showed me is different the beast is holding a chalice but not any chalice sir guillaume you are right the bow interests me and frightens me for the yale is holding the grail the holy blessed and most precious grail it was always rumoured that the cathars possessed the grail there is a tawdry lump of green glass in genoa cathedral that is said to be the grail but i doubt our dear lord drank from such a bauble no the real grail exists and whoever holds it possesses power above all men on earth he put down the quill i fear sir guillaume that the dark lords want their revenge they gather their strength but they hide still and the church has not yet taken notice nor will it until the danger is obvious and by then it will be too late brother germain lowered his head so that thomas could only see the bald pink patch among the white hair it is all prophesied the monk said it is all in the books what books sir guillaume asked et confortabitur rex austri et de principibus eius praevaebit super eum brother germain said softly sir guillaume looked quizzically at thomas and the king from the south will be mighty thomas reluctantly translated but one of his princes will be stronger than him the cathars are of the south brother germain said and the prophet daniel foresaw it all he raised his pigmentstained hands the fight will be terrible for the soul of the world is at stake and they will use any weapon even a woman filiaque regis austri veniet ad regem aquilonis facere amicitiam the daughter of the king of the south thomas saids hall come to the king of the north and make a treaty brother germain heard the distaste in thomass voice you dont believe it he hissed why do you think we keep the scriptures from the ignorant they contain all sorts of prophecies young man and each of them given direct to us by god but such knowledge is confusing to the unlearned men go mad when they know too much he made the sign of the cross i thank god i shall be dead soon and taken to the bliss above while you must struggle with this darkness thomas walked to the window and watched two wagons of grain being unloaded by novices sir guillaumes menatarms were playing dice in the cloister that was real he thought not some babbling prophet his father had ever warned him against prophecy it drives mens minds awry he had said and was that why his own mind had gone astray the lance thomas said trying to cling to fact instead of fancy was taken to england by the vexille family my father was one of them but he fell out with the family and he stole the lance and hid it in his church he was killed there and at his death he told me it was his brothers son who did it i think it is that man my cousin who called himself the harlequin he turned to look at brother germain my father was a vexille but he was no heretic he was a sinner yes but he struggled against his sin he hated his own father and he was a loyal son of the church he was a priest sir guillaume explained to the monk and you are his son brother germain asked in a disapproving tone the other monks had abandoned their tidying and were listening avidly i am a priests son thomas said and a good christian so the family discovered where the lance was hidden sir guillaume took up the story and hired me to retrieve it but forgot to pay me brother germain appeared not to have heard he was staring at thomas you are english the bow is mine thomas acknowledged so you are a vexille thomas shrugged it would seem so then you are one of the dark lords brother germain said thomas shook his head i am a christian he said firmly then you have a godgiven duty the small man said with surprising force which is to finish the work that was left undone a hundred years ago kill them all kill them and kill the woman you hear me boy kill the daughter of the king of the south before she seduces france to heresy and wickedness if we can even find the vexilles sir guillaume said dubiously and thomas noted the word we they dont display their badge i doubt they use the name vexille they hide but they have the lance now brother germain said and they will use it for the first of their vengeances they will destroy france and in the chaos that ensues they will attack the church he moaned as if he was in physical pain you must take away their power and their power is the grail so it was not just the lance that thomas must save to father hobbes charge had been added all of christendom he wanted to laugh catharism had died a hundred years before scourged and burned and dug out of the land like couch grass grubbed from a field dark lords daughters of kings and princes of darkness were figments of the troubadours not the business of archers except that when he looked at sir guillaume he saw that the frenchman was not mocking the task he was staring at a crucifix hanging on the scriptorium wall and mou thing a silent prayer god help me thomas thought god help me but i am being asked to do what all the great knights of arthurs round table failed to do to find the grail philip of valois king of france ordered every frenchman of military age to gather at rouen demands went to his vassals and appeals were carried to his allies he had expected the walls of caen to hold the english for weeks but the city had fallen in a day and the panicked survivors were spreading across northern france with terrible stories of devils unleashed rouen nestled in a great loop of the seine filled with warriors thousands of genoese crossbowmen came by galley beaching their ships on the rivers bank and thronging the citys taverns while knights and menatarms arrived from anjou and picardy from alencon and champagne from maine touraine and berry every blacksmiths shop became an armoury every house a barracks and every tavern a brothel more men arrived until the city could scarce contain them and tents had to be set up in the fields south of the city wagons crossed the bridge loaded with hay and newly harvested grain from the rich farmlands north of the river while from the seines southern bank came rumours the english had taken evreux or perhaps it was bernay smoke had been seen at lisleux and archers were swarming through the forest of brotonne a nun in louviers had a dream in which the dragon killed saint george king philip ordered the woman brought to rouen but she had a harelip a hunchback and a stammer and when she was presented to the king she proved unable to recount the dream let alone confide gods strategy to his majesty she just shuddered and wept and the king dismissed her angrily but took consolation from the bishops astrologer who said mars was in the ascendant and that meant victory was certain rumour said the english were marching on paris then another rumour claimed they were going south to protect their territories in gascony it was said that every person in caen had died that the castle was rubble then a story went about that the english themselves were dying of a sickness king philip ever a nervous man became petulant demanding news but his advisers persuaded their irritable master that wherever the english were they must eventually starve if they were kept south of the great river seine that twisted like a snake from paris to the sea edwards men were wasting the land so needed to keep moving if they were to find food and if the seine was blocked then they could not go north towards the harbours on the channel coast where they might expect supplies from england they use arrows like a woman uses money charles the count of alencon and the kings younger brother advised philip but they cannot fetch their arrows from france they are brought to them by sea and the further they go from the sea the greater their problems so if the english were kept south of the seine then they must eventually fight or make an ignominious retreat to normandy what of paris paris what of paris the king demanded paris will not fall the count assured his brother the city lay north of the seine so the english would need to cross the river and assault the largest ramparts in christendom and all the while the garrison would be showering them with crossbow bolts and the missiles from the hundreds of small iron guns that had been mounted on the city walls maybe they will go south philip worried to gascony if they march to gascony the count said then they will have no boots by the time they arrive and their arrow store will be gone let us pray they do go to gascony but above all things pray they do not reach the seines northern bank for if the english crossed the seine they would go to the nearest channel port to receive reinforcements and supplies and by now the count knew the english would be needing supplies a marching army tired itself its men became sick and its horses lame an army that marched too long would eventually wear out like a tired crossbow so the french reinforced the great fortresses that guarded the seines crossings and where a bridge could not be guarded such as the sixteenarched bridge at poissy it was demolished a hundred men with sledgehammers broke down the parapets and hammered the stonework of the arches into the river to leave the fifteen stumps of the broken piers studding the seine like the stepping stones of a giant while poissy itself which lay south of the seine and was reckoned indefensible was abandoned and its people evacuated to paris the wide river was being turned into an impassable barrier to trap the english in an area where their food must eventually run short then when the devils were weakened the french would punish them for the terrible damage they had wrought on france the english were still burning towns and destroying farms so that in those long summer days the western and southern horizons were so smeared by smoke plumes that it seemed as if there were permanent clouds on the skylines at night the worlds edge glowed and folk fleeing the fires came to rouen where because so many could not be housed or fed they were ordered across the river and away to wherever they might find shelter sir simon jekyll and henry colley his manatarms were among the fugitives and they were not refused admittance for they both rode destriers and were in mail colley wore his own mail and rode his own horse but sir simons mount and gear had been stolen from one of his other menatarms before he fled from caen both men carried shields but they had stripped the leather covers from the willow boards so that the shields bore no device thus declaring themselves to be masterless men for hire scores like them came to the city seeking a lord who could offer food and pay but none arrived with the anger that filled sir simon it was the injustice that galled him it burned his soul giving him a lust for revenge he had come so close to paying all his debts indeed when the money from the sale of jeanettes ships was paid from england he had expected to be free of all encumbrances but now he was a fugitive he knew he could have slunk back to england but any man out of favour with the king or the kings eldest son could expect to be treated as a rebel and he would be fortunate if he kept an acre of land let alone his freedom so he had preferred flight trusting that his sword would win back the privileges he had lost to the breton bitch and her puppy lover and henry colley had ridden with him in the belief that any man as skilled in arms as sir simon could not fail no one questioned their presence in rouen sir simons french was tinged with the accent of englands gentry but so was the french of a score of other men from normandy what sir simon needed now was a patron a man who would feed him and give him the chance to fight back against his persecutors and there were plenty of great men looking for followers in the fields south of rouen where the looping river narrowed the land a pasture had been set aside as a tourney ground where in front of a knowing crowd of menatarms anyone could enter the lists to show their prowess this was not a serious tournament the swords were blunt and lances were tipped with wooden blocks but rather it was a chance for masterless men to show their prowess with weapons and a score of knights the champions of dukes counts viscounts and mere lords were the judges dozens of hopeful men were entering the lists and any horseman who could last more than a few minutes against the wellmounted and superbly armed champions was sure to find a place in the entourage of a great nobleman sir simon on his stolen horse and with his ancient battered sword was one of the least impressive men to ride into the pasture he had no lance so one of the champions drew a sword and rode to finish him off at first no one took particular notice of the two men for other combats were taking place but when the champion was sprawling on the grass and sir simon untouched rode on the crowd took notice a second champion challenged sir simon and was startled by the fury which confronted him he called out that the combat was not to the death but merely a demonstration of swordplay but sir simon gritted his teeth and hacked with the sword so savagely that the champion spurred and wheeled his horse away rather than risk injury sir simon turned his horse in the pastures centre daring another man to face him but instead a squire trotted a mare to the fields centre and wordlessly offered the englishman a lance who sent it sir simon demanded my lord who is there the squire said pointing to the pastures end where a tall man in black armour and riding a black horse waited with his lance sir simon sheathed his sword and took the lance it was heavy and not well balanced and he had no lance rest in his armour that would cradle the long butt to help keep the point raised but he was a strong man and an angry one and he reckoned he could manage the cumbersome weapon long enough to break the strangers confidence no other men fought on the field now they just watched wagers were being made and all of them favoured the man in black most of the onlookers had seen him fight before and his horse his armour and his weapons were all plainly superior he wore plate mail and his horse stood at least a hands breadth taller than sir simons sorry mount his visor was down so sir simon could not see the mans face while sir simon himself had no faceplate merely an old cheap helmet like those worn by englands archers only henry colley laid a bet on sir simon though he had difficulty in doing it for his french was rudimentary but the money was at last taken the strangers shield was black and decorated with a simple white cross a device unknown to sir simon while his horse had a black trapper that swept the pasture as the beast began to walk that was the only signal the stranger gave and sir simon responded by lowering the lance and kicking his own horse forward they were a hundred paces apart and both men moved swiftly into the canter sir simon watched his opponents lance judging how firmly it was held the man was good for the lance tip scarcely wavered despite the horses uneven motion the shield was covering his trunk as it should be if this had been a battle if the man with the strange shield had not offered sir simon a chance of advancement he might have lowered his own lance to strike his opponents horse or a more difficult strike thrust the weapons tip into the high pommel of his saddle sir simon had seen a lance go clean through the wood and leather of a saddle to gouge into a mans groin and it was ever a killing blow but today he was required to show the skill of a knight to strike clean and hard and at the same time defend himself from the oncoming lance the skill of that was to deflect the thrust which having the weight of a horse behind it could break a mans back by throwing him against the high cantle the shock of two heavy horsemen meeting and with all their weight concentrated into lance points was like being hit by a cannons stone sir simon was not thinking about any of this he was watching the oncoming lance glancing at the white cross on the shield where his own lance was aimed and guiding his horse with pressure from his knees he had trained to this from the time he could first sit on a pony he had spent hours tilting at a quintain in his fathers yard and more hours schooling stallions to endure the noise and chaos of battle he moved his horse slightly to the left like a man wanting to widen the angle at which the lances would strike and so deflect some of their force and he noted that the stranger did not follow the move to straighten the line but seemed happy to accept the lesser risk then both men rowelled back their spurs and the destriers went into the gallop sir simon touched the horses right side and straightened the line himself driving hard at the stranger now and leaning slightly forward to ready himself for the blow his opponent was trying to swing towards him but it was too late sir simons lance cracked against the black and white shield with a thump that hurled sir simon back but the strangers lance was not centred and banged against sir simons plain shield and glanced off sir simons lance broke into three pieces and he let it fall as he pressed his knee to turn the horse his opponents lance was across his body now and was encumbering the blackarmoured knight sir simon drew his sword and while the other man was still trying to rid himself of the lance gave a backswing that struck his opponent like a hammer blow the field was still henry colley held out a hand for his winnings the man pretended not to understand his crude french but he understood the knife that the yelloweyed englishman suddenly produced and the coins just as suddenly appeared the knight in the black armour did not continue the fight but instead curbed his horse and pushed up his visor who are you my name is sir simon jekyll english i was the two horses stood beside each other the stranger threw down his lance and hung the shield from his pommel he had a sallow face with a thin black moustache clever eyes and a broken nose he was a young man not a boy but a year or two older than sir simon what do you want he asked sir simon a chance to kill the prince of wales the man smiled is that all money food land women sir simon said the man gestured to the side of the pasture there are great lords here sir simon who will offer you pay food and girls i can pay you too but not so well i can feed you though it will be common stuf and the girls you must find for yourself what i will promise you is that i shall equip you with a better horse armour and weapons i lead the best knights in this army and we are sworn to take captives who will make us rich and none i think so rich as the king of england and his whelp not kill mark you but capture sir simon shrugged ill settle for capturing the bastard he said and his father the man said i want his father too there was something vengeful in the mans voice that intrigued sir simon why he asked my family lived in england the man said but when this king took power we supported his mother so you lost your land sir simon asked he was too young to remember the turmoil of those times when the kings mother had tried to keep power for herself and for her lover and the young edward had struggled to break free young edward had won and some of his old enemies had not forgotten we lost everything the man said but we shall get it back will you help i told you so then you had best employ me sir simon said with my man he nodded towards henry colley good the harlequin said so sir simon had a new master and the king of france had gathered an army the great lords alencon john of hainault aumale the count of blois who was brother to the aspiring duke of brittany the duke of lorraine the count of sancerre all were in rouen with their vast retinues of heavily armoured men the armys numbers became so large that men could not count the ranks but clerks reckoned there were at least eight thousand menatarms and five thousand crossbowmen in rouen and that meant that philip of valoiss army already outnumbered edward of englands forces and still more men were coming john count of luxembourg and king of bohemia a friend of philip of france was bringing his formidable knights the king of majorca came with his famed lances and the duke of normandy was ordered to abandon the siege of an english fortress in the south and bring his army north the priests blessed the soldiers and promised them that god would recognize the virtue of frances cause and crush the english mercilessly the army could not be fed in rouen so at last it crossed the bridge to the north bank of the seine leaving a formidable garrison behind to guard the river crossing once out of the city and on the long roads stretching through the newly harvested fields men could dimly comprehend just how vast their army was it stretched for miles in long columns of armed men troops of horsemen battalions of crossbowmen and trailing behind the innumerable host of infantry armed with axes billhooks and spears this was the might of france and frances friends had rallied to the cause there was a troop of knights from scotland big savagelooking men who nourished a rare hatred of the english there were mercenaries from germany and italy and there were knights whose names had become famous in christendoms tournaments the elegant killers who had become rich in the sport of war the french knights spoke not just of defeating edward of england but of carrying the war to his kingdom foreseeing earldoms in essex and dukedoms in devonshire the bishop of meaux encouraged his cook to think of a recipe for archers fingers a daube perhaps seasoned with thyme he would the bishop insisted force the dish down edward of englands throat sir simon rode a sevenyearold destrier now a fine grey that must have cost the harlequin close to a hundred pounds he wore a hauberk of closeringed mail covered with a surcoat that bore the white cross his horse had a chanfron of boiled leather and a black trapper while at sir simons waist hung a sword made in poitiers henry colley was almost as well equipped though in place of a sword he carried a fourfootlong shaft of oak topped with a spiked metal ball theyre a solemn bunch he complained to sir simon about the other men who followed the harlequin like bloody monks they can fight sir simon said though he himself was also daunted by the grim dedication of the harlequins men the men were all confident but none took the english as lightly as the rest of the army which had convinced itself that any battle would be won by numbers alone the harlequin quizzed sir simon and henry colley about the english way of fighting and his questions were shrewd enough to force both men to drop their bombast and think theyll fight on foot sir simon concluded he like all knights dreamed of a battle conducted on horseback of swirling men and couched lances but the english had learned their business in the wars against the scots and knew that men on foot defended territory much more effectively than horsemen even the knights will fight on foot sir simon forecast and for every manatarms theyll have two or three archers those are the bastards to watch the harlequin nodded but how do we defeat the archers let them run out of arrows sir simon said they must eventually so let every hothead in the army attack then wait till the arrow bags are empty then youll get your revenge it is more than revenge i want the harlequin said quietly what the harlequin a handsome man smiled at sir simon though there was no warmth in the smile power he answered very calmly with power sir simon comes privilege and with privilege wealth what are kings he asked but men who have risen high so we shall rise too and use the defeat of kings as the rungs of our ladder such talk impressed sir simon though he did not wholly understand it it seemed to him that the harlequin was a man of high fancies but that did not matter because he was also unswervingly dedicated to the defeat of men who were sir simons enemies sir simon daydreamed of the battle he saw the english princes frightened face heard his scream and revelled in the thought of taking the insolent whelp prisoner jeanette too the harlequin could be as secretive and subtle as he wished so long as he led sir simon to those simple desires and so the french army marched and still it grew as men came from the outlying parts of the kingdom and from the vassal states beyond frances frontiers it marched to seal off the seine and so trap the english and its confidence soared when it was learned that the king had made his pilgrimage to the abbey of saint denis to fetch the oriflamme it was frances most sacred symbol a scarlet banner kept by the benedictines in the abbey where the kings of france lay entombed and every man knew that when the onflamme was unfurled no quarter would be given it was said to have been carried by charlemagne himself and its silk was red as blood promising carnage to the enemies of france the english had come to fight the oriflamme had been released and the dance of the armies had begun sir guillaume gave thomas a linen shirt a good mail coat a leatherlined helmet and a sword its old but good he said of the sword a cutter rather than a piercer he provided thomas with a horse a saddle a bridle and gave him money thomas tried to refuse the last gift but sir guillaume brushed his protest aside youve taken what you wanted from me i might as well give you the rest taken thomas was puzzled even hurt by the accusation eleanor ive not taken her thomas protested sir guillaumes ravaged face broke into a grin you will boy he said you will they rode next day going eastwards in the wake of the english army that was now far off news had come to caen of burned towns but no one knew where the enemy had gone and so sir guillaume planned to lead his twelve menatarms his squire and his servant to paris someone will know where the king is he said and you thomas what will you do thomas had been wondering the same ever since he woke to the light in sir guillaumes house but now he must make the decision and to his surprise there was no conflict at all i shall go to my king he said and what of this sir simon what if he hangs you again i have the earl of northamptons protection thomas said though he reflected it had not worked before and what of eleanor sir guillaume turned to look at his daughter who to thomass surprise had accompanied them her father had given her a small palfrey and unused to riding she sat its saddle awkwardly clutching the high pommel she did not know why her father had let her come suggesting to thomas that perhaps he wanted her to be his cook the question made thomas blush he knew he could not fight against his own friends but nor did he want to leave eleanor i shall come looking for her he told sir guillaume if you still live the frenchman growled why dont you fight for me because im english sir guillaume sneered youre cathar youre french youre from languedoc who knows what you are youre a priests son a mongrel bastard of heretic stock im english thomas said youre a christian sir guillaume retorted and god has given you and me a duty how are you to fulfil that duty by joining edwards army thomas did not answer at once had god given him a duty if so he did not want to accept it for acceptance meant believing in the legends of the vexilles thomas in the evening after he had met brother germain had talked with mordecai in sir guillaumes garden asking the old man if he had ever read the book of daniel mordecai had sighed as if he found the question wearlsome years ago hed said many years ago it is part of the ketuvim the writings that all jewish youths must read why hes a prophet yes he tells the future dear me mordecai had said sitting on the bench and dragging his thin fingers through his forked beard you christians he had said insist that prophets tell the future but that wasnt really what they did at all they warned israel they told us that we would be visited by death destruction and horror if we did not mend our ways they were preachers thomas just preachers though god knows they were right about the death destruction and horror as for daniel he is very strange very strange he had a head filled with dreams and visions he was drunk on god that one but do you think thomas had asked that daniel could foretell what is happening now mordecai had frowned if god wished him to yes but why should god wish that and i assume thomas that you think daniel might foretell what happens here and now in france and what possible interest could that hold for the god of israel the ketuvim are full of fancy vision and mystery and you christians see more in them than we ever did but would i make a decision because daniel ate a bad oyster and had a vivid dream all those years ago no no no he stood and held a jordan bottle high trust what is before your eyes thomas what you can smell hear taste touch and see the rest is dangerous thomas now looked at sir guillaume he had come to like the frenchman whose battlehardened exterior hid a wealth of kindness and thomas knew he was in love with the frenchmans daughter but even so he had a greater loyalty i cannot fight against england he said any more than you would carry a lance against king philip sir guillaume dismissed that with a shrug then fight against the vexilles but thomas could not smell hear taste touch or see the vexilles he did not believe the king of the south would send his daughter to the north he did not believe the holy grail was hidden in some heretics fastness he believed in the strength of a yew bow the tension of a hemp cord and the power of a whitefeathered arrow to kill the kings enemies to think of dark lords and of heresiarchs was to flirt with the madness that had harrowed his own father if i find the man who killed my father he evaded sir guillaumes demand then i will kill him but you will not search for him where do i look where do you look thomas asked then offered his own answer if the vexilles really still exist if they truly want to destroy france then where would they begin in englands army so i shall look for them there that answer was an evasion but it half convinced sir guillaume who grudgingly conceded that the vexilles might indeed take their forces to edward of england that night they sheltered in the scorched remains of a farm where they gathered about a small fire on which they roasted the hind legs of a boar that thomas had shot the menatarms treated thomas warily he was after all one of the hated english archers whose bows could pierce even plate mail if he had not been sir guillaumes friend they would have wanted to slice off his string fingers in revenge for the pain that the whitefledged arrows had given to the horsemen of france but instead they treated him with a distant curiosity after the meal sir guillaume gestured to eleanor and thomas that they should both accompany him outside his squire was keeping watch and sir guillaume led them away from the young man going to the bank of a stream where with an odd formality he looked at thomas so you will leave us he said and fight for edward of england yes but if you see my enemy if you see the lance what will you do kill him thomas said eleanor stood slightly apart watching and listening he will not be alone sir guillaume warned but you assure me he is your enemy i swear it thomas said puzzled that the question even needed to be asked sir guillaume took thomass right hand you have heard of a brotherhood in arms thomas nodded men of rank frequently made such pacts swearing to aid each other in battle and share each others spoils then i swear a brotherhood to you sir guillaume said even if we will fight on opposing sides i swear the same thomas said awkwardly sir guillaume let thomass hand go there he said to eleanor im safe from one damned archer he paused still looking at eleanor i shall marry again he said abruptly and have children again and they will be my heirs you know what im saying dont you eleanors head was lowered but she looked up at her father briefly then dropped her gaze again she said nothing and if i have more children god willing sir guillaume said what does that leave for you eleanor she gave a very small shrug as if to suggest that the question was not of great interest to her i have never asked you for anything but what would you have asked for she stared into the ripples of the stream what you gave me she said after a while kindness nothing else she paused i would have liked to call you father sir guillaume seemed uncomfortable with that answer he stared northwards you are both bastards he said after a while and i envy that envy thomas asked a family serves like the banks of a stream they keep you in your place but bastards make their own way they take nothing and they can go anywhere he frowned then flicked a pebble into the water i had always thought eleanor that i would marry you to one of my menatarms benoit asked me for your hand and so did fossat and its past time you were married what are you fifteen fifteen she agreed youll rot away girl if you wait any longer sir guillaume said grufflys o who shall it be benoit fossat he paused or would you prefer thomas eleanor said nothing and thomas embarrassed kept silent you want her sir guillaume asked him brutally yes eleanor she looked at thomas then back to the stream yes she said simply the horse the mail the sword and the money sir guillaume said to thomas are my bastard daughters dowry look after her or else become my enemy again he turned away sir guillaume thomas asked the frenchman turned back when you went to hookton thomas went on wondering why he asked the question now you took a darkhaired girl prisoner she was pregnant her name was jane sir guillaume nodded she married one of my men then died in childbirth the child too why he frowned was the child yours she was a friend thomas evaded the question she was a pretty friend sir guillaume said i remember that and when she died we had twelve masses said for her english soul thank you sir guillaume looked from thomas to eleanor then back to thomas a good night for sleeping under the stars he said and we shall leave at dawn he walked away thomas and eleanor sat by the stream the sky was still not wholly dark but had a luminous quality like the glow of a candle behind horn an otter slid down the far side of the stream its fur glistening where it showed above the water it raised its head looked briefly at thomas then dived out of sight to leave a trickle of silver bubbles breaking the dark surface eleanor broke the silence speaking the only english words she knew i am an archers woman she said thomas smiled yes he said and in the morning they rode on and next evening they saw the smear of smoke on the northern horizon and knew it was a sign that the english army was going about its business they parted in the next dawn how you reach the bastards i do not know sir guillaume said but when it is all over look for me he embraced thomas kissed eleanor then pulled himself into his saddle his horse had a long blue trapper decorated with yellow hawks he settled his right foot into its stirrup gathered the reins and pushed back his spurs a track led north across a heath that was fragrant with thyme and fluttering with blue butterflies thomas his helmet hanging from the saddles pommel and the sword thumping at his side rode towards the smoke and eleanor who insisted on carrying his bow because she was an archers woman rode with him they looked back from the low crest of the heath but sir guillaume was already a halfmile westwards not looking back hurrying towards the oriflamme so thomas and eleanor rode on the english marched east ever further from the sea searching for a place to cross the seine but every bridge was broken or else was guarded by a fortress they still destroyed everything they touched their chevauchee was a line twenty miles wide and behind it was a charred trail a hundred miles long every house was burned and every mill destroyed the folk of france fled from the army taking their livestock and the newly gathered harvest with them so that edwards men had to range ever further to find food behind them was desolation while in front lay the formidable walls of paris some men thought the king would assault paris others reckoned he would not waste his troops on those great walls but instead attack one of the strongly fortified bridges that could lead him north of the river indeed the army tried to capture the bridge at meulan but the stronghold which guarded its southern end was too massive and its crossbowmen were too many and the assault failed the french stood on the ramparts and bared their backsides to insult the defeated english it was said that the king confident of crossing the river had ordered supplies sent to the port of le crotoy that lay far to the north beyond both the seine and the river somme but if the supplies were waiting then they were unreachable because the seine was a wall behind which the english were penned in a land they had themselves emptied of food the first horses began to go lame and men their boots shredded by marching went barefoot the english came closer to paris entering the wide lands that were the hunting grounds of the french kings they took philips lodges and stripped them of tapestries and plate and it was while they hunted his royal deer that the french king sent edward a formal offer of battle it was the chivalrous thing to do and it would by gods grace end the harrowing of his farmlands so philip of valois sent a bishop to the english courteously suggesting that he would wait with his army south of paris and the english king graciously accepted the invitation and so the french marched their army through the city and arrayed it among the vineyards on a hillcrest by bourglareine they would make the english attack them there forcing the archers and menatarms to struggle uphill into massed genoese crossbows and the french nobles estimated the value of the ransoms they would fetch for their prisoners the french battleline waited but no sooner had philips army settled in its positions than the english treacherously turned about and marched in the other direction going to the town of poissy where the bridge across the seine had been destroyed and the town evacuated a few french infantrymen poor soldiers armed with spears and axes had been left to guard the northern bank but they could do nothing to stop the swarm of archers carpenters and masons who used timbers ripped from the roofs of poissy to make a new bridge on the fifteen broken piers of the old it took two days to repair the bridge and the french were still waiting for their arranged battle among the ripening grapes at bourglareine as the english crossed the seine and started marching northwards the devils had escaped the trap and were loose again it was at poissy that thomas with eleanor beside him rejoined the army and it was there by gods grace that the hard times began eleanor had been apprehensive about joining the english army they wont like me because im french she said the armys full of frenchmen thomas had told her there are gascons bretons even some normans and half the women are french the archers women she asked giving him a wry smile but they are not good women some are good some are bad thomas said vaguely but you i shall make into a wife and everyone will know youre special if eleanor was pleased she showed no sign but they were now in the broken streets of poissy where a rearguard of english archers shouted at them to hurry the makeshift bridge was about to be destroyed and the armys laggards were being chivvied across its planks the bridge had no parapets and had been hurriedly made from whatever timbers the army had found in the abandoned town and the uneven planking swayed creaked and bent as thomas and eleanor led their horses onto the roadway eleanors palfrey became so scared of the uncertain footing that it refused to move until thomas put a blindfold over its eyes and then still shaking it trod slowly and steadily across the planks which had gaps between them through which thomas could see the river sliding they were among the last to cross some of the armys wagons had been abandoned in poissy their loads distributed onto the hundreds of horses that had been captured south of the seine once the last stragglers had crossed the bridge the archers began hurling the planks into the river breaking down the fragile link that had let the english escape across the river now king edward hoped they would find new land to waste in the wide plains that lay between the seine and the somme and the three battles spread into the twentymilewide line of the chevauchee and advanced northwards camping that night just a short march from the river thomas looked for the prince of waless troops while eleanor tried to ignore the dirty tattered and sunbrowned archers who looked more like outlaws than soldiers they were supposed to be making their shelters for the coming night but preferred to watch the women and call obscene invitations what are they saying eleanor asked thomas that you are the most beautiful creature in all france he said you lie she said then flinched as a man shouted at her have they never seen a woman before not like you they probably think youre a princess she scoffed at that but was not displeased there were she saw women everywhere they gathered firewood while their men made the shelters and most eleanor noted spoke french there will be many babies next year she said true they will go back to england she asked some perhaps thomas was not really sure or theyll go to their garrisons in gascony if i marry you she asked will i become english yes thomas said it was getting late and cooking fires were smoking across the stubble fields though there was precious little to cook every pasture held a score of horses and thomas knew they needed to rest feed and water their own animals he had asked many soldiers where the prince of waless men could be found but one man said west another east so in the dusk thomas simply turned their tired horses towards the nearest village for he did not know where else to go the place was swarming with troops but thomas and eleanor found a quiet enough spot in the corner of a field where thomas made a fire while eleanor the black bow prominent on her shoulder to demonstrate that she belonged to the army watered the horses in a stream they cooked the last of their food and afterwards sat under the hedge and watched the stars brighten above a dark wood voices sounded from the village where some women were singing a french song and eleanor crooned the words softly i remember my mother singing it to me she said plucking strands of grass that she wove into a small bracelet i was not his only bastard she said ruefully there were two others i know of one died when she was very small and the other is now a soldier hes your brother halfbrother she shrugged i dont know him he went away she put the bracelet on her thin wrist why do you wear a dogs paw she asked because im a fool he said and mock god that was the truth he thought ruefully and he pulled the dry paw hard to break its cord then tossed it into the field he did not really believe in saint guinefort it was an affectation a dog would not help him recover the lance and that duty made him grimace for the penance weighed on his conscience and soul do you really mock god eleanor asked worried no but we jest about the things we fear and you fear god of course thomas said then stiffened because there had been a rustle in the hedge behind him and a cold blade was suddenly pressed against the back of his neck the metal felt very sharp what we should do a voice said is hang the bastard properly and take his woman shes pretty shes pretty another man agreed but he aint good for anything you bastards thomas said turning to stare into two grinning faces it was jake and sam he did not believe it at first just gazed for a while it is you what are you doing here jake slashed at the hedge with his billhook pushed through and gave eleanor what he thought was a reassuring grin though with his scarred face and crossed eyes he looked like something from nightmare charlie blois got his face smacked jake saids o will brought us here to give the king of france a bloody nose she your woman shes the queen of bloody sheba thomas said and the countess is humping the prince i hear jake grinned will saw you earlier only you didnt see us got your nose in the air we heard you were dead i nearly was will wants to see you the thought of will skeat of jake and sam came as a vast relief to thomas for such men lived in a world far removed from dire prophecies stolen lances and dark lords he told eleanor these men were his friends his best friends and that she could trust them though she looked alarmed at the ironic cheer which greeted thomas when they ducked into the village tavern the archers put their hands at their throats and contorted their faces to imitate a hanged man while will skeat shook his head in mock despair gods belly he said but they cant even hang you properly he looked at eleanor another countess the daughter of sir guillaume devecque knight of the sea and of the land thomas said and shes called eleanor yours skeat asked we shall marry bloody heilfire skeat said youre still daft as a carrot you dont marry them tom thats not what theyre for still she aint a bad looker is she he courteously made space for eleanor on the bench there wasnt much ale he went ons o we drank it all he looked about the tavern it was so bare there was not even a bunch of herbs hanging from the rafters bastards cleaned up before they left he said sourly and theres about as much plunder here as youd get hairs off a bald man what happened in brittany thomas asked will shrugged nowt to do with us duke charles led his men into our territory and trapped tommy dugdale on a hilltop three thousand of them and three hundred with tommy and at the end of the day duke charles was running like a scalded hare arrows boy arrows thomas dugdale had taken over the earl of northamptons responsibilities in brittany and had been travelling between the english fortresses when the dukes army caught him but his archers and menatarms ensconced behind the thick hedge of a hilltop pasture had cut the enemy into shreds all day they fought skeat said morning to night and the bastards wouldnt learn their lesson and kept sending men up the hill they reckoned tommy had to run out of arrows soon enough but he was carrying carts of spares to the fortresses see so he had enough to last him till doomsday so duke charles lost his best men the fortresses are safe till he gets some more and were up here the earl sent for us just bring fifty archers he told me so i did and father hobbe of course we sailed to caen and joined the army just as it marched out so what the hell happened to you thomas told his tale skeat shook his head when he heard about the hanging sir simons gone he said probably joined the french hes done what vanished your countess caught up with him and pissed all over him from what we hear skeat grinned luck of the devil youve got god knows why i saved you this he put a clay jar of ale on the table then nodded at thomass bow that eleanor was carrying can you still shoot that thing i mean youve been bollocking about with the aristocracy for so long that you might have forgotten why god put you on the earth i can still use it then you might as well ride with us skeat said but confessed he knew little of what the army was doing no one tells me he said scorufully but they say theres another river up north and weve got to cross it sooner the better i reckon as the frenchies have skimmed this land proper couldnt feed a kitten up here it was indeed a bare land thomas saw that for himself next day as will skeats men moved slowly north across harvested fields but the grain instead of lying in the barns had already been taken for the french army just as the livestock had all been driven away south of the seine the english had cut grain from abandoned fields and their advance guards had moved swiftly enough to capture thousands of cattle pigs and goats but here the land had been scraped bare by an even larger army and so the king ordered haste he wanted his men to cross the next river the somme to where the french army might not have stripped the land and where at le crotoy he hoped a fleet would be waiting with supplies but despite the royal orders the army went painfully slowly there were fortified towns that promised food and men insisted on trying to assault their walls they captured some were repulsed at others but it all took time that the king did not have and while he was trying to discipline an army more interested in plunder than progress the king of france led his army back across the seine through paris and north to the somme a new trap was set an even deadlier one for the english were now penned in a land that had been stripped of food edwards army at last reached the somme but found it was blocked just as the seine had been barred bridges were destroyed or guarded by grim forts with heavy garrisons that would take weeks to dislodge and the english did not have weeks they were weakening daily they had marched from normandy to the edge of paris then they had crossed the seine and left a path of destruction to the sommes southern bank and the long journey had abraded the army hundreds of men were now barefoot while others hobbled on disintegrating shoes they had horses enough but few spare horse shoes or nails and so men led their animals to save their hooves there was grass to feed horses but little grain for men and so the foraging parties had to travel long distances to find villages where the peasants might have hidden some of the harvest the french were becoming bolder now and there were frequent skirmishes at the edges of the army as the french sensed the english vulnerability men ate unripe fruit that soured their bellies and loosened their bowels some reckoned they had no choice but to march all the way back to normandy but others knew the army would fall apart long before they reached the safety of the norman harbours the only course was to cross the somme and march to the english strongholds in flanders but the bridges were gone or garrisoned and when the army crossed desolate marshlands to find fords they discovered the enemy ever waiting on the far bank they twice tried to force a passage but both times the french secure on the higher dry land were able to cut down the archers in the river by crowding the bank with genoese crossbows and so the english retreated and marched westwards getting ever nearer to the rivers mouth and every step reduced the number of possible crossing places as the river grew wider and deeper they marched for eight days between the rivers eight days of increasing hunger and frustration save your arrows a worried will skeat warned his men late one afternoon they were making their camp by a small deserted village which was as bare as every other place they had found since crossing the seine well need every arrow weve got for a battle skeat went on and christ knows weve none to waste an hour later when thomas was searching a hedge row for blackberries a voice called from on high thomas get your evil bones up here thomas turned to see will skeat on the small tower of the village church he ran to the church climbed the ladder past a beam where a bell had hung till the villagers took it away to prevent the english from stealing it then pulled himself through the hatch and onto the towers flat roof where a halfdozen men were crowded among them the earl of northampton who gave thomas a very wry look i heard you were hanged i lived my lord thomas said grimly the earl hesitated wondering whether to ask if sir simon jekyll had been the hangman but there was no point in continuing that feud sir simon had fled and the earls agreement with him was void he grimaced instead no one can kill a devils whelp eh he said then pointed eastwards and thomas stared through the twilight and saw an army on the march it was a long way off on the far northern bank of the river that here flowed between vast reedbeds but thomas could still see that the lines of horsemen wagons infantry and crossbowmen were filling every lane and track of that distant bank the army was approaching a walled town abbeville the earl said where a bridge crossed the river and thomas gazing at the black lines twisting towards the bridge felt as though the gates of hell had opened and spewed out a vast horde of lances swords and crossbows then he remembered sir guillaume was there and he made the sign of the cross and mouthed a silent prayer that eleanors father would survive sweet christ will skeat said mistaking thomass gesture for fear but they want our souls bad they know were tired the earl said and they know the arrows must run out in the end and they know they have more men than we do far more he turned westwards and we cant run much further he pointed again and thomas saw the flat sheen of the sea theyve caught us the earl said theyll cross at abbeville and attack tomorrow so we fight will skeat growled on this ground will the earl asked the land was flat ideal for cavalry and with few hedgerows or coppices to protect archers and against so many he added he stared at the distant enemy they outnumber us will they outnumber us by god they outnumber us he shrugged time to move on move on where skeat asked why not find our ground and stand south the earl sounded unsure maybe we can cross the seine again and take ships home from normandy god knows we cant cross the somme he shaded his eyes as he stared at the river christ he blasphemed but why the hell isnt there a ford we could have raced the bastards back to our fortresses in flanders and left philip stranded like the damned fool he is not fight him thomas asked sounding shocked the earl shook his head weve hurt him weve robbed him blind weve marched through his kingdom and left it smouldering so why fight him hes spent a fortune on hiring knights and crossbowmen so why not let him waste that money then we come back next year and do it again he shrugged unless we cant escape him with those grim words he backed down through the hatch and his entourage followed leaving skeat and thomas alone the real reason they dont want to fight skeat said sourly when the earl was safe out of earshot is that theyre scared of being taken prisoner a ransom can wipe out a familys fortune in the blink of an eye he spat over the tower parapet then drew thomas to its northern edge but the real reason i brought you up here tom is because your eyes are better than mine can you see a village over there he pointed northwards it took thomas a while but eventually he spotted a group of low roofs amidst the reeds bloody poor village he said sourly but its still a place we havent searched for food skeat said and being on a marsh they might have some smoked eels i like a smoked eel i do better than sour apples and nettle soup you can go and have a look tonight why not next week skeat said going to the roof hatch or next year of course i mean tonight you toad hurry yourself thomas took twenty archers none of them wanted to go for it was late in the day and they feared that french patrols might be waiting on the track that twisted endlessly through the dunes and reedbeds that stretched towards the somme it was a desolate country birds flew from the reeds as the horses picked their way along a track that was so lowlying that in places there were battens of elm to give footing and all about them the water gurgled and sucked between banks of greenscummed mud tides going out jake commented thomas could smell the salt water they were near enough to the sea for the tides to flow and ebb through this tangle of reeds and marshgrass though in places the road found a firmer footing on great drifted banks of sand where stiff pale grasses grew in winter thomas thought this would be a godforsaken place with the cold winds driving the spume across the frozen marsh it was very nearly dark when they reached the village which proved to be a miserable settlement of just a dozen reedthatched cottages which were deserted the folk must have left just before thomass archers arrived for there were still fires in the small rock hearths look for food thomas said especially smoked eels be quicker to catch the bloody eels and smoke them ourselves jake said get on with it thomas said then took himself to the end of the village where there was a small wooden church which had been pushed by the wind into a permanently lopsided stance the church was little more than a shed maybe it was a shrine to some saint of this misbegotten marshland but thomas reckoned the wooden structure would just about bear his weight so he scrambled off the horse onto the mossthick thatch and then crawled up to the ridge where he clung to the nailed cross that decorated one gable he saw no movement in the marshes though he could see the smear of smoke coming from the french campfires that misted the fading light north of abbeville tomorrow he thought the french would cross the bridge and file through the towns gates to confront the english army whose fires burned to the south and the size of the smoke plumes witnessed how much larger the french army was than the english jake appeared from a nearby cottage with a sack in his hand what is it thomas called grain jake hefted the sack bloody damp sprouting no eels of course there are no bloody eels jake grumbled bloody eels got more sense than to live in a hovel like this thomas grinned and looked off to the sea that lay like a bloodreddened swordblade to the west there was one distant sail a speck of white on the clouded horizon gulls wheeled and soared above the river that here was a great wide channel broken by reeds and banks sliding towards the sea it was hard to distinguish between river and marsh so tangled was the landscape then thomas wondered why the gulls were screaming and diving he stared at them and saw what at first looked like a dozen cattle on the riverbank he opened his mouth to call that news to jake then he saw that there were men with the cattle men and women perhaps a score of them he frowned staring realizing that the folk must have come from this village they had presumably seen the english archers approaching and they had fled with their livestock but to where the marsh that was sensible for the wetlands probably had a score of secret paths where folk could hide but why had they risked going onto the sand ridge where thomas could see them then he saw that they were not trying to hide but to escape for the villagers were now wading across the wide waters towards the northern bank sweet jesus he thought but there was a ford he stared not daring to believe his own eyes but the folk were forging steadily across the river and dragging their cows with them it was a deep ford and he guessed it could only be crossed at low tide but it was there jake he shouted jake jake ran across to the church and thomas leaned far down and hauled him onto the rotting thatch the building swayed perilously under their weight as jake scrambled to the ridge took hold of the sunbleached wooden cross and looked where thomas was pointing gods arse he said theres a bloody ford and there are bloody frenchmen thomas said for on the rivers far bank where firmer land rose from the tangle of marsh and water there were now men in grey mail they were newly arrived or else thomas would have seen them earlier and their first cooking fires pricked the dark stand of trees where they camped their presence showed that the french knew of the fords existence and wanted to stop the english crossing but that was none of thomass business his only duty was to let the army know that there was a ford a possible way out of the trap thomas slid down the churchs thatch and jumped to the ground you go back to will he told jake and tell him theres a ford and tell him ill burn the cottages one at a time to serve as a beacon it would be dark soon and without a light to guide them no one would be able to find the village jake took six men and rode back to the south thomas waited every now and then he climbed back to the church roof and stared across the ford and each time he thought he saw more fires among the trees the french he reckoned had placed a formidable force there and no wonder for it was the last escape route and they were blocking it but thomas still fired the cottages one by one to show the english where that escape might lie the flames roared into the night scattering sparks across the marshes the archers had found some dried fish concealed in a hut wall and that with brackish water was their supper they were disconsolate and no wonder we should have stayed in brittany one man said theyre going to corner us another suggested he had made a flute from a dried reed and had been playing a melancholy air weve got arrows a third man said enough to kill all those bastards have to be enough the flute player blew some faint notes then became bored and tossed the instrument into the closest fire thomas the night dragging hard on his patience strolled back to the church but instead of climbing onto the roof he pushed open the ramshackle door and then opened the one windows shutters to let in the firelight then he saw it was not a proper church but a fishermens shrine there was an altar made from seawhitened planks balanced on two broken barrels and on the altar was a crude dolllike figure draped with strips of white cloth and crowned with a band of dried seaweed the fishermen at hookton had sometimes made such places especially if a boat was lost at sea and thomass father had always hated them he had burned one to the ground calling it a place of idols but thomas reckoned fishermen needed the shrines the sea was a cruel place and the doll he thought it was female perhaps represented some saint of the area women whose men were long gone to sea could come to pray to the saint begging that the ship would come home the shrines roof was low and it was more comfortable to kneel thomas said a prayer let me live he prayed let me live and he found himself thinking of the lance thinking of brother germain and sir guillaume and of their fears that a new evil born of the dark lords was brewing in the south it is none of your business he told himself it is superstition the cathars are dead burned in the churchs fires and gone to hell beware of madmen his father had told him and who better than his father to know that truth but was he a vexille he bowed his head and prayed that god would keep him from the madness and what are you praying for now a voice suddenly asked startling thomas who turned to see father hobbe grinning from the low doorway he had chatted with the priest during the last few days but he had never been alone with him thomas was not even sure he wanted to be for father hobbes presence was a reminder of his conscience im praying for more arrows father please god the prayers answered father hobbe said then settled on the churchs earthen floor i had the devils own task finding my way across the swamp but i had a mind to talk with you i have this feeling youve been avoiding me father thomas said chidingly so here you are and with a beautiful girl as well i tell you thomas if they forced you to lick a lepers arse youd taste nothing but sweetness charmed you are they cant even hang you they can thomas said but not properly thank god for that the priest said then smiled so how is the penance going i havent found the lance thomas answered curtly but have you even looked for it father hobbe asked then drew a piece of bread from his pouch he broke the small loaf and tossed half to thomas dont ask where i got it but i didnt steal it remember thomas you can fail in a penance and still have absolution if you have made a sincere effort thomas grimaced not at father hobbes words but because he had bitten down on a scrap of millstone grit caught in the bread he spat it out my soul isnt so black as you make it sound father how would you know all our souls are black ive made an effort thomas said then found himself telling the whole tale of how he had gone to caen and sought out sir guillaumes house and how he had been a guest there and about brother germain and the cathar vexilles and about the prophecy from daniel and the advice of mordecai father hobbe made the sign of the cross when thomas talked of mordecai you cant take the word of such a man the priest said sternly he may or may not be a good doctor but the jews have ever been christs enemy if he is on anyones side it must be the devils hes a good man thomas insisted thomas thomas father hobbe said sadly then frowned for a few heartbeats i have heard he said after a while that the cathar heresy still lives but it cant challenge france and the church you would know father hobbe asked it reached out across the sea to steal the lance from your father and you say it reached across france to kill sir guillaumes wife the devil works his business in the dark thomas theres more thomas said and told the priest the story that the cathars had the grail the light of the burning cottages flickered on the walls and gave the seaweedcrowned image on the altar a sinister cast i dont think i believe any of it thomas concluded and why not because if the story is true thomas said then i am not thomas of hookton but thomas vexille im not english but some halfbreed frenchman im not an archer but noble born it gets worse father hobbe said with a smile it means that you have been given a task theyre just stories thomas said scornfully give me another penance father ill make a pilgrimage for you ill go to canterbury on my knees if thats what you want i want nothing of you thomas but god wants a lot from you then tell god to choose someone else im not in the habit of giving advice to the almighty father hobbe said though i do listen to his you think there is no grail men have sought it for a thousand years thomas said and no one has found it unless the thing in genoa is real father hobbe leaned his head against the wattle wall i have heard he said quietly that the real grail is made of common clay a simple peasant dish like the one my mother treasured god rest her soul for she could only afford the one good dish and then clumsy fool that i am i broke it one day but the grail i am told cannot be broken you could put it in one of those guns that amused everyone at caen and it would not break even if you dashed it against a castle wall and when you place the bread and wine the blood and flesh of the mass in that common piece of clay thomas it turns to gold pure shining gold that is the grail and god help me it does exist so you would have me wander the earth looking for a peasants dish thomas asked god would father hobbe said and for good reason he looked saddened there is heresy everywhere thomas the church is besieged the bishops and the cardinals and the abbots are corrupted by wealth the village priests stew in ignorance and the devil is brewing his evil yet there are some of us a few who believe that the church can be refreshed that it can glow with gods glory again i think the grail could do that i think god has chosen you father and perhaps me father hobbe said ignoring thomass protest when this is all over he waved a hand to encompass the army and its plight i think i may join you we shall seek your family together you thomas asked why because god calls father hobbe said simply then jerked his head you must go thomas you must go i shall pray for you thomas had to go because the night had been disturbed by the sound of horses hooves and the strident voices of men thomas seized his bow and ducked out of the church to find that a score of menatarms were now in the village their shields carried the lions and stars of the earl of northumberland and their commander was demanding to know who was in charge of the archers i am thomas said wheres this ford thomas made himself a torch from a sheaf of thatch lashed to a pole and while its flame lasted he led them across the marsh towards the distant ford the flames flickered out after a while but he was close enough to find his way to where he had seen the cattle the tide had risen again and black water seeped and flooded all about the horsemen who huddled on a shrinking ridge of sand you can see where the other side is thomas told the menatarms pointing to the fires of the french which looked to be about a mile away bastards are waiting for us plenty of them too were crossing anyway the leading manatarms said the kings decided it and were doing it when the tide falls he turned to his men off your horses find the path mark it he pointed to some pollarded willows cut staves off them use them as markers thomas groped his way back to the village sometimes wading through water up to his waist a thin mist was seeping from the flooding tide and had it not been for the blazing huts in the village he could easily have got lost the village built on the highest piece of land in all the marsh had attracted a crowd of horsemen by the time thomas returned archers and menatarms gathered there and some had already pulled down the shrine to make fires from its timbers will skeat had come with the rest of his archers the women are with the baggage he told thomas bloody chaos back there it is theyre hoping to cross everyone in the morning be a fight first thomas said either that or fight their whole damn army later in the day did you find any eels we ate them skeat grinned then turned as a voice hailed him it was the earl of northampton his horses trapper spattered with mud almost to the saddle well done will werent me my lord it was this clever bastard skeat jerked a thumb at thomas hanging did you good eh the earl said then watched as a file of menofarms climbed onto the villages sand ridge be ready to move at dawn will and well be crossing when the tide falls i want your boys in front leave your horses here ill have good men watch them there was small sleep that night though thomas did doze as he lay on the sand and waited for the dawn which brought a pale misty light willow trees loomed in the vapour while menatarms crouched at the tides edge and stared north to where the mist was thickened by smoke from the enemys fires the river ran deceptively quick hastened by the ebbing tide but it was still too high to cross the sandbank by the ford held skeats fifty archers and another fifty under john armstrong there were the same number of menatarms all on foot led by the earl of northampton who had been given the job of leading the crossing the prince of wales had wanted to lead the fight himself but his father had forbidden it the earl far more experienced had the responsibility and he was not happy he would have liked many more men but the sandbank would hold no more and the paths through the marshland were narrow and treacherous making it difficult to bring reinforcements you know what to do the earl told skeat and armstrong we know maybe another two hours the earl was judging the fall of the tide the two hours crept by and the english could only stare through the thinning mist at the enemy who formed their battleline at the fords further side the receding water let more men come to the sandbank but the earls force was still pitifully small perhaps two hundred men at most while the french had double that number of menatarms alone thomas counted them as best he could using the method will skeat had taught him to divide the enemy in two divide again then count the small unit and multiply it by four and he wished he had not done it for there were so many and as well as the menatarms there had to be five or six hundred infantry probably a levy from the country north of abbeville they were not a serious threat for like most infantry they would be illtrained and badly armed with ancient weapons and farming tools but they could still cause trouble if the earls men got into difficulties the only blessing thomas could find in the misty dawn was that the french seemed to have very few crossbowmen but why would they need them when they had so many menatarms and the formidable force that now gathered on the rivers northern bank would be fighting in the knowledge that if they repelled the english attack then they would have their enemy pinned by the sea where the greater french army could crush them two packhorses brought sheaves of precious arrows that were distributed among the archers ignore the goddamn peasants skeat told his men kill the menatarms i want the bastards crying for the goats they call their mothers theres food on the far side john armstrong told his hungry men those goddamn bastards will have meat bread and beer and itll be yours if you get through them and dont waste your arrows skeat growled shoot proper aim boys aim i want to see the bastards bleeding watch the wind john armstrong shouted itll carry arrows to the right two hundred of the french menatarms were on foot at the rivers edge while the other two hundred were mounted and waiting a hundred paces behind the rabble of infantry was split into two vast lumps one on each flank the dismounted menatarms were there to stop the english at the waters edge and the mounted men would charge if any did break through while the infantry was present to give the appearance of numbers and to help in the massacre that would follow the french victory the french must have been confident for they had stopped every other attempt to ford the somme except at the other fords the enemy had possessed crossbowmen who had been able to keep the archers in deep water where they could not use their bows properly for fear of soaking the strings and here there were no crossbows the earl of northampton on foot like his men spat towards the river he should have left his foot soldiers behind and brought a thousand genoese he remarked to will skeat wed be in trouble then theyll have some crossbows skeat said not enough will not enough the earl was wearing an old helmet one without any face plate he was accompanied by a greybearded manatarms with a deeply lined face who wore a muchmended coat of mail you know reginald cobham will the earl asked ive heard of you master cobham will said respectfully and i of you master skeat cobham answered a whisper went through skeats archers that reginald cobham was at the ford and men turned to look at the greybeard whose name was celebrated in the army a common man like themselves but old in war and feared by englands enemies the earl looked at a pole which marked one edge of the ford reckon the waters low enough he said then patted skeats shoulder go and kill some will thomas took one glance behind and saw that every dry spot of the marsh was now crowded with soldiers horses and women the english army had come into the lowlands depending on the earl to force the crossing off to the east though none at the ford knew it the main french army was filing across the bridge at abbeville ready to fall on the english rear there was a brisk wind coming from the sea bringing a morning chill and the smell of salt gulls called forlorn above the pale reeds the rivers main channel was a halfmile wide and the hundred archers looked a puny force as they spread into a line and waded into the tide armstrongs men were on the left skeats on the right while behind them came the first of the earls menatarms those menatarms were all on foot and their job was to wait till the arrows had weakened the enemy then charge into the french with swords axes and falchions the enemy had two drummers who began thumping their goatskins then a trumpeter startled birds from the trees where the french had camped note the wind skeat shouted at his men gusting hard she is gusting hard the wind was blowing against the ebbing tide forcing the river into small waves that whipped white at their tops the french infantry were shouting grey clouds scudded above the green land the drummers kept up a threatening rhythm banners flew above the waiting menatarms and thomas was relieved that none of them showed yellow hawks on a blue field the water was cold and came to his thighs he held his bow high watching the enemy waiting for the first crossbow bolts to whip across the water no bolts came the archers were within long bowshot range now but will skeat wanted them closer a french knight on a black horse caparisoned with a green and blue trapper rode to where his comrades were on foot then swerved off to one side and splashed into the river silly bastard wants to make a name skeat said jake dan peter settle the bastard for me the three bows were drawn back and three arrows flew the french knight was hurled back in his saddle and his fall provoked the french to fury they gave their war shout montjoie saint denis and the menatarms came splashing into the river ready to challenge the archers who drew back their bows hold hard skeat shouted hold hard closer get closer the drumbeats were louder the dead knight was being carried away by his horse as the other french edged back to the dry land the water only reached to thomass knees now and the range was shortening a hundred paces no more and will skeat was at last satisfied start putting them down he shouted the boweords were drawn back to mens ears then loosed the arrows flew and while the first flight was still whispering over the windflecked water the second flight was released and as the men put their third arrows on the strings the first whipped home the sound was of metal striking metal like a hundred light hammers tapping and the french ranks were suddenly crouching with shields held high pick your men skeat shouted pick your men he was using his own bow shooting it infrequently always waiting for an enemy to lower a shield before loosing an arrow thomas was watching the rabble of infantry to his right they looked as though they were ready to make a wild charge and he wanted to plant some arrows in their bellies before they reached the water a score of french menatarms were dead or wounded and their leader was shouting at the others to lock their shields a dozen of the rearward menatarms had dismounted and were hurrying forward to reinforce the riverbank steady boys steady john armstrong called make the arrows count the enemy shields were quilled with arrows the french were relying on those shields that were thick enough to slow an arrow and they were staying low waiting for the arrows to run out or for the english menatarms to come close thomas reckoned some of the arrows would have driven clean through the shields to inflict wounds but they were mostly wasted he glanced back to the infantry and saw they were not moving yet the english bows were firing less frequently waiting for their targets and the earl of northampton must have tired of the delay or else he feared the turn of the tide for he shouted his men forward saint george saint george spread wide will skeat shouted wanting his men to be on the flanks of the earls attack so they could use their arrows when the french stood to receive the charge but the water rapidly grew deeper as thomas moved upstream and he could not go as far as he wanted kill them kill them the earl was wading up to the bank now keep ranks reginald cobham shouted the french menatarms gave a cheer for the proximity of the english charge meant the archers aim would be blocked though thomas did manage to loose two arrows as the defenders stood and before the two groups of menatarms met at the rivers edge with a clash of steel and shield men roared their war cries saint denis contending with saint george watch right watch right thomas shouted for the peasant infantrymen had started forward and he sent two arrows whistling at them he was plucking shafts from the arrow bag as fast as he could take the horsemen will skeat bellowed and thomas changed his aim to send an arrow over the heads of the fighting men at the french horsemen who were advancing down the bank to help their comrades some english horsemen had entered the ford now but they could not ride to meet their french counterparts because the fords northern exit was blocked by the wild melee of menatarms men slashed and hacked swords met axes falchions split helmets and skulls the noise was like the devils blacksmith shop and blood was swirling down tide in the shallows a englishman screamed as he was cut down into the water then screamed again as two frenchmen drove axes into his legs and trunk the earl was thrusting his sword in short hard lunges ignoring the hammer blows on his shield close up close up reginald cobham shouted a man tripped on a body opening a gap in the english line and three howling frenchmen tried to exploit it but were met by a man with a doubleheaded axe who struck down so hard that the heavy blade split a helmet and skull from nape to neck flank them flank them skeat bellowed and his archers waded closer to the shore to drive their arrows into the sides of the french formation two hundred french knights were fighting eighty or ninety english menatarms a brawl of swords and shields and monstrous clangour men grunted as they swung the two front ranks were locked together now shields against shields and it was the men behind who did the killing swinging their blades over the front rank to kill the men beyond most of the archers were pouring arrows into the french flanks while a few led by john armstrong had closed up behind the menatarms to shoot into the enemys faces the french infantry thinking the english charge stalled gave a cheer and began to advance kill them kill them thomas shouted he had used a whole sheaf of arrows twentyfour shafts and had only one sheaf more he drew the bow back released drew again some of the french infantry had padded jackets but they were no protection against the arrows sheer numbers was their best defence and they screamed a wild war cry as they pounded down the bank but then a score of english horsemen came from behind the archers pushing through them to meet the mad charge the mailed riders chopped hard into the infantrys front ranks swords flailing left and right as the peasants hacked back the horses bit at the enemy and always kept moving so that no one could slash their hamstrings a manatarms was hauled from his saddle and screamed terribly as he was chopped to death in the shallows thomas and his archers drove their arrows into the mob more horsemen rode to help slaughter them but still the wild rabble crowded the bank and suddenly thomas had no arrows left and so he hung the bow round his neck drew his sword and ran to the rivers edge a frenchman lunged at thomas with a spear he knocked it aside and brought the swords tip flashing round to rip the mans gullet blood spilled bright as dawn vanishing into the river he hacked at a second man sam babyfaced sam was beside him with a billhook that he sliced into a skull it stuck there and sam kicked the man in frustration then took an axe from the dying enemy and leaving his billhook in its victim swung his new weapon in a great arc to drive the enemy back jake still had arrows and was shooting them fast a splashing and a cheer announced the arrival of more mounted menatarms who drove into the infantry with heavy lances the big horses trained to this carnage rode over the living and dead while the menatarms discarded the spears and started hacking with swords more archers had come with fresh arrows and were shooting from the rivers centre thomas was on the bank now the front of his mail coat was red with blood none of it his and the infantry was retreating then will skeat gave a great shout that more arrows had come and thomas and his archers ran back into the river to find father hobbe with a pack mule loaded with two panniers of arrow sheaves do the lords work father hobbe said tossing a sheaf to thomas who undid its binding and spilled the arrows into his bag a trumpet sounded from the northern bank and he whirled round to see that the french horsemen were riding to join the fight put them down skeat shouted put those bastards down arrows slashed and sliced at horses more english menatarms were wading the river to thicken the earls force and inch by inch yard by yard they were making progress up the bank but then the enemy horsemen drove into the melee with lances and swords thomas put an arrow through the mail covering a frenchmans throat drove another through a leather chanfron so that the horse reared and screamed and spilled its rider kill kill kill the earl of northampton bloodied from his helmet to his mailed boots rammed the sword again and again he was bone tired and deafened by the crack of steel but he was climbing the bank and his men were pressed close about him cobham was killing with a calm certainty years of experience behind every blow english horsemen were in the melee now using their lances over the heads of their compatriots to drive the enemy horses back but they were also blocking the aim of the archers and thomas again hung his bow round his neck and drew his sword saint george saint george the earl was standing on grass now out of the reeds above the highwater mark and behind him the rivers edge was a charnel house of dead men wounded men blood and screaming father hobbe his cassock skirts hitched up to his waist was fighting with a quarterstaff ramming the pole into french faces in the name of the father he shouted and a frenchmen reeled back with a pulped eye and of the son father hobbe snarled as he broke a mans nose and of the holy ghost a french knight broke through the english ranks but a dozen archers swarmed over the horse hamstrung it and hauled its rider down to the mud where they hacked at him with axe billhook and sword archers the earl shouted archers the last of the french horsemen had formed into a charge that threatened to sweep the whole ragged mess of brawling men both english and french into the river but a score of archers the only ones with arrows now drove their missiles up the bank to bring the leading rank of horsemen down in a tangle of horses legs and tumbling weapons another trumpet sounded this one from the english side and reinforcements were suddenly streaming over the ford and spurring up onto the higher ground theyre breaking theyre breaking thomas did not know who shouted that news but it was true the french were shuffling backwards the infantry their stomach for battle slaked by the deaths they had suffered had already retreated but now the french knights the menatarms were backing away from the fury of the english assault just kill them kill them no prisoners no prisoners the earl of northampton shouted in french and his menatarms bloody and wet and tired and angry shoved up the bank and hacked again at the french who stepped another pace back and then the enemy did break it was sudden one moment the two forces were locked in grunting shoving hacking battle and then the french were running and the ford was streaming with mounted menatarms who crossed from the southern bank to pursue the broken enemy jesus will skeat said and dropped to his knees and made the sign of the cross a dying frenchman groaned nearby but skeat ignored him jesus he said again you got any arrows tom two left jesus skeat looked up there was blood on his cheeks those bastards he said vengefully he was speaking of the newly arrived english menatarms who crashed past the remnants of the battle to harry the fleeing enemy those bastards they get into their camp first dont they theyll take all the bloody food but the ford was taken the trap was broken and the english were across the somme part three crecy the whole english army had crossed before the tide rose again horses wagons men and women they all crossed safe so that the french army marching from abbeville to trap them found the corner of land between the river and the sea empty all next day the armies faced each other across the ford the english were drawn up for battle with their four thousand archers lining the rivers bank and behind them three great blocks of menatarms on the higher ground but the french strung out on the paths to the ford were not tempted to force the crossing a handful of their knights rode into the water and shouted challenges and insults but the king would not let any english knight respond and the archers knowing they must conserve their arrows endured the insults without responding let the bastards shout will skeat growleds houting never hurt a man yet he grinned at thomas depends on the man of course upset sir simon didnt it he was just a bastard no tom skeat corrected him youre the bastard and he was a gentleman skeat looked across at the french who showed no sign of trying to contest the ford most of them are all right he went on evidently talking of knights and nobles once theyve fought with the archers for a while they learn to look after us on account of us being the mucky bastards what keeps them alive but theres always a few goddamn idiots not our billy though he turned and looked at the earl of northampton who was pacing up and down by the shallows itching for the french to come and fight hes a proper gentleman knows how to kill the goddamn french next morning the french were gone the only sign of them the white cloud of dust hanging over the road which was taking their huge army back to abbeville the english went north slowed by hunger and the lame horses that men were reluctant to abandon the army climbed from the somme marshes into a heavily wooded country that yielded no grain livestock or plunder while the weather which had been dry and warm turned cold and wet during the morning rain spat from the east and dripped incessantly from the trees to increase mens misery so that what had seemed like a victorious campaign south of the seine now felt like an ignominious retreat which is what it was for the english were running from the french and all the men knew it just as they knew that unless they found food soon their weakness would make them easy pickings for the enemy the king had sent a strong force to the mouth of the somme where at the small port of le crotoy he expected reinforcements and supplies to be waiting but instead the small port proved to be held by a garrison of genoese crossbowmen the walls were in bad repair the attackers were hungry and so the genoese died under a hail of arrows and a storm of menatarms the english emptied the ports storehouses of food and found a herd of beef cattle collected for the french armys use but when they climbed the church tower they saw no ships moored in the rivers mouth nor any fleet waiting at sea the arrows the archers and the grain that should have replenished the army were still in england the rain became heavier on the first night that the army camped in the forest rumour said that the king and his great men were in a village at the forests edge but most of the men were forced to shelter under the dripping trees and eat what little they could scavenge acorn stew jake grumbled youve eaten worse thomas said and a month ago we ate it off silver plates jake spat out a gritty mouthful so why dont we bloody fight the bastards because theyre too many thomas said wearily because weve only so many arrows because were worn out the army had marched itself into the ground jake like a dozen other of will skeats archers had no boots any more the wounded limped because there were not enough carts and the sick were left behind if they could not walk or crawl the living stank thomas had made eleanor and himself a shelter from boughs and turf it was dry inside the little hut where a small fire spewed a thick smoke what happens to me if you lose eleanor asked him we wont lose thomas said though there was little conviction in his voice what happens to me she asked again you thank the frenchmen who find you he said and tell them you were forced to march with us against your will then you send for your father eleanor thought about those answers for a while but did not look reassured she had learned in caen how men after victory are not amenable to reason but slaves to their appetites she shrugged and what happens to you if i live thomas shook his head ill be a prisoner they send us to the galleys in the south i hear if they let us live why shouldnt they they dont like archers they hate archers he pushed a pile of wet bracken closer to the fire trying to dry the fronds before they became their bed maybe there wont be a battle he said because weve stolen a days march on them the french were said to have gone back to abbeville and to be crossing the river there which meant that the hunters were coming but the english were still a day ahead and could perhaps reach their fortresses in flanders perhaps eleanor blinked from the smoke have you seen any knight carrying the lance thomas shook his head i havent even looked he confessed the last thing on his mind this night was the mysterious vexilles nor indeed did he expect to see the lance that was sir guillaumes fancy and now father hobbes enthusiasm but it was not thomass obsession staying alive and finding enough to eat were what consumed him thomas will skeat called from outside thomas pushed his head through the hut opening to see a cloaked figure was standing next to skeat im here he said youve got company skeat said sourly turning away the cloaked figure stooped to enter the hut and to thomass surprise it was jeanette i shouldnt be here she greeted him pushing into the smoky interior where throwing the hood from her hair she stared at eleanor whos that my woman thomas spoke in english tell her to go jeanette said in french stay here thomas told eleanor this is the countess of armorica jeanette bridled when thomas contradicted her but did not insist that eleanor left instead she pushed a bag at thomas that proved to contain a leg of ham a loaf of bread and a stone bottle of wine the bread thomas saw was the fine white bread that only the rich could afford while the ham was studded with cloves and sticky with honey he handed the bag to eleanor food fit for a prince he told her i should take it to will eleanor asked for the archers had agreed to share all their food yes but it can wait thomas said i shall take it now eleanor said and pulled a cloak over her head before vanishing into the wet darkness shes pretty enough jeanette said in french all my women are pretty thomas said fit for princes they are jeanette looked angry or perhaps it was just the smoke from the small fire irritating her she prodded the huts side this reminds me of our journey it wasnt cold or wet thomas said and you were mad he wanted to add and i nursed you and you walked away from me without looking back jeanette heard the hostility in his voice he thinks she said that i am saying confession then tell me your sins thomas responded and you wont have lied to his highness jeanette ignored that you know what is going to happen now we run away they chase us and either they catch us or they dont he spoke brusquely and if they catch us therell be a bloodletting they will catch us jeanette said confidently and there will be a battle you know that i listen to what is reported to the prince she said and the french are on the good roads we are not that made sense the ford by which the english army had crossed the seine led only into marshiand and forest it was a link between villages it lay on no great trading route and so no good roads led from its banks but the french had crossed the river at abbeville a city of merchants and so the enemy army would have wide roads to hasten their march into picardy they were well fed they were fresh and now they had the good roads to speed them so therell be a battle thomas said touching his black bow there is to be a battle jeanette confirmed its been decided probably tomorrow or the next day the king says there is a hill just outside the forest where we can fight better that he says than letting the french get ahead and block our road but either way she paused they will win maybe thomas allowed they will win jeanette insisted i listen to the conversations thomas they are too many thomas made the sign of the cross if jeanette was right and he had no reason to think she was deceiving him then the armys leaders had already given up hope but that did not mean he had to despair they have to beat us first he said stubbornly they will jeanette said brutally and what happens to me then what happens to you thomas asked in surprise he leaned cautiously against the fragile wall of his shelter he sensed that eleanor had already delivered the food and hurried back to eavesdrop why should i care he asked loudly what happens to you jeanette shot him a vicious look you once swore to me she said that you would help restore my son to me thomas made the sign of the cross again i did my lady he admitted reflecting that he made his oaths too easily one oath was enough for a lifetime and he had made more then he could recall or keep then help me do that jeanette demanded thomas smiled theres a battle to be won first my lady jeanette scowled at the smoke that churned in the small shelter if i am found in the english camp after the battle thomas then i will never see charles again never why not thomas demanded its not as if youll be in danger my lady youre not a common woman there might not be much chivalry when armies meet but it just about reaches into the tents of royalty jeanette shook her head impatiently if the english win she said then i might see charles again because the duke will want to curry favour with the king but if they lose then he will have no need to make any gesture and if they lose thomas then i lose everything that thomas reckoned was closer to the nub if the english lost then jeanette risked losing whatever wealth she had accumulated in the last weeks wealth that came from the gifts of a prince he could see a necklace of what looked like rubjes half hidden by her swathing cloak and doubtless she had dozens of other precious stones set in gold so what do you want of me he asked she leaned forward and lowered her voice you she said and a handful of men take me south i can hire a ship at le crotoy and sail to brittany i have money now i can pay my debts in la rochederrien and i can deal with that evil lawyer no one need know i was even here the prince will know thomas said she bridled at that you think he will want me for ever what do i know of him he will tire of me jeanette said hes a prince he takes what he wants and when he is tired of it he moves on but he has been good to me so i cannot complain thomas said nothing for a while she had not been this hard he reflected in those lazy summer days when they had lived as vagabonds and your son he asked how will you get him back pay for him i will find a way she said evasively probably thomas thought she would try to kidnap the boy and why not if she could raise some men then it would be possible maybe she would expect thomas himself to do it and as that thought occurred to him so jeanette looked into his eyes help me she said please no thomas said not now he held up a hand to ward off her protests one day god willing he went on ill help find your son but ill not leave this army now if theres to be a battle my lady then im in it with the rest i am begging you she said no then damn you she spat pulled the hood over her black hair and went out into the darkness there was a short pause then eleanor came through the entrance so what did you think thomas asked i think she is pretty eleanor said evasively then she frowned at him and i think that in battle tomorrow a man could seize you by the hair i think you should cut it thomas seemed to flinch you want to go south escape battle eleanor gave him a reproachful look i am an archers woman she said and you will not go south will says you are a goddamn fool she said the last two words in clumsy english to give up such good food but thanks you anyway and father hobbe tells you that he is saying mass tomorrow morning and expects you to be there thomas drew his knife and gave it to her then bent his head she sawed at his pigtail then at handfuls of black hair that she tossed onto the fire thomas said nothing as she cut but just thought about father hobbes mass a mass for the dead he thought or for those about to die for in the wet dark beyond the forest the might of france was drawing close the english had escaped the enemy twice crossing rivers that were supposed to be impassable but they could not escape a third time the french had caught them at last the village lay only a short walk north of the forests edge from which it was separated by a small river that twisted through placid water meadows the village was an unremarkable place a duckpond a small church and a score of cottages with thick thatched roofs small gardens and high dungheaps the village like the forest was called crecy the fields north of the village rose to a long hill that ran north and south a country road rutted by farm carts ran along the hills crest going from crecy to another village just as unremarkable called wadicourt if an army had marched from abbeville and skirted the forest of crecy it would come westwards in search of the english and after a while they would see the hill between crecy and wadicourt rearing in front of them they would see the stumplike church towers in the two small villages and between the villages but much closer to crecy and high on the ridge top where its sails could catch the winds a mill the slope facing the french was long and smooth untroubled by hedge or ditch a playground for knights on horseback the army was woken before dawn it was a saturday august and men grumbled at the unseasonable chill fires were stirred to life reflecting flame light from the waiting mail and plate armour the village of crecy had been occupied by the king and his great lords some of whom had slept in the church and those men were still arming themselves when a chaplain of the royal household came to say a mass candles were lit a handbell sounded and the priest ignoring the clank of armour that filled the small nave called on the help of saint zephyrinus saint gelasinus and both the saints called genesius all of whom had their feasts on this day and the priest also sought aid from little sir hugh of lincoln a child who had been murdered by the jews on this same day nearly two hundred years before the boy who was said to have shown a remarkable piety had been found dead and no one understood how god could have allowed such a paragon to be snatched from earth so young but there were jews in lincoln and their presence had provided a convenient answer the priest prayed to them all saint zephyrinus he prayed give us victory saint gelasinus he pleaded be with our men saint genesius look after us and saint genesius give us strength little sir hugh he begged thou child in gods arms intercede for us dear god he prayed in thy great mercy spare us the knights came to the altar in their linen shirts to receive the sacraments in the forest the archers knelt to other priests they made confession and took the dry stale bread that was the body of christ they made the sign of the cross no one knew there was to be a battle that day but they sensed the campaign had come to its end and they must either fight today or the next give us enough arrows the archers prayed and we shall make the earth red and they held their yew staves towards the priests who touched the bows and said prayers over them lances were unwrapped they had been carried on packhorses or wagons and had hardly been used in the campaign but the knights all dreamed of a proper battle of swirling horsemen punctuated by the shock of lances striking shields the older and wiser men knew they would fight on foot and that their weapons would mostly be swords or axes or falchions but still the painted lances were taken from their cloth or leather coverings that protected them from being dried by the sun or warped by rain we can use them as pikes the earl of northampton suggested squires and pages armed their knights helping them with the heavy coats of leather mail and plate straps were buckled tight destriers were brushed with straw while the smiths dragged sharpening stones down the swords long blades the king who had begun arming himself at four in the morning knelt and kissed a reliquary which contained a feather from the wing of the angel gabriel and when he had crossed himself told the priest to carry the reliquary to his son then with a golden crown surrounding his helmet he was helped up onto a grey mare and rode north from the village it was dawn and the ridge between the two villages was empty the mill its linen sails neatly furled and tethered creaked in the wind that stirred the long grasses where hares grazed but now cocked their ears and raced away as the horsemen climbed the track to the mill the king led mounted on the mare that was swathed in a trapper bright with the royal arms the scabbard of his sword was red velvet and encrusted with golden fleurdelis while the hilt was decorated with a dozen great rubies he carried a long white staff and had brought a dozen companions and a score of knights as escorts but as his companions were all great lords then they were duly followed by their entourages so that close to three hundred men trailed up the winding track the higher a mans rank the closer he rode to the king while the pages and squires were at the back where they tried to hear the conversation of their betters a manatarms dismounted and went into the mill he climbed the ladders opened the small door that gave access to the sails and there straddled the axle as he peered eastwards see anything the king called up cheerfully but the man was so overcome by being addressed by his king that he could only shake his head dumbly the sky was half covered in clouds and the country looked dark from the mills height the manatarms could see down the long slope to the small fields at its foot then up another slope to a wood an empty road ran eastwards beyond the wood the river filled with english horses being watered twisted grey on the right to mark the forests edge the king his visor jammed up against the crowns frontal stared at the same view a local man discovered hiding in the forest had confirmed that the road from abbeville came from the east which meant that the french must cross the small fields at the foot of the slope if they were to make a frontal attack on the hill the fields had no hedges merely shallow ditches that would offer no obstacle to a mounted knight if i was philip the earl of northampton suggested id ride round our north flank sire youre not philip and i thank god youre not edward of england said hes not clever and i am the earl sounded surprised you are clever at war william the king said he stared down the slope for a long time if i was philip he said at last i would be mightily tempted by those fields he pointed to the foot of the slope especially if i saw our men waiting on this hill the long green slope of the open pastureland was perfect for a cavalry charge it was an invitation for lances and glory a place made by god for the lords of france to tear an impudent enemy to ragged shreds the hills steep sire the earl of warwick warned i warrant it wont look so from the foot the king said then turned his horse and spurred northwards along the ridge the mare trotted easily revelling in the morning air shes spanish the king told the earl bought off grindley dyou use him if i can afford his prices of course you can william a rich man like you ill breed her she might make fine destriers if she does sire ill buy one from you if you cant afford grindleys prices the king teased how will you pay mine he spurred the mare into a canter his plate armour clanking and the long train of men hurried after him along the track which led north on the ridges summit green shoots of wheat and barley doomed to die in the winter grew where the grains had fallen from the carts carrying the harvest to the mill the king stopped at the ridges end just above the village of wadicourt and stared northwards his cousin was right he thought philip should march into that empty countryside and cut him off from flanders the french if they did but know it were the masters here their army was larger their men fresher and they could dance rings about their tired enemy until the english were forced to a desperate attack or were trapped in a place that offered them no advantage but edward knew better than to let every fear prey on his mind the french were also desperate they had suffered the humiliation of watching an enemy army wreak havoc across their land and they were in no mood to be clever they wanted revenge offer them a chance he reckoned and the odds were good that they would snatch at it and so the king dismissed his fears and rode down into the village of wadicourt a handful of the villagers had dared to stay and those folk seeing the golden crown encircling the kings helmet and the silver curb chains on his mare went onto their knees we mean you no harm the king called airily but by mornings end he knew their houses would have been ransacked thoroughly he turned southwards again riding along the ground at the foot of the ridge the valleys turf was soft but not treacherous a horse would not flounder here a charge would be possible and better still just as he had reckoned the hill did not look so steep from this angle it was deceptive the long stretch of rising grass looked gentle even though in truth it would sap the horses lungs by the time they reached the english menatarms if they ever did reach them how many arrows do we have he asked every man in earshot twelve hundred sheaves the bishop of durham said two carts full the earl of warwick answered eight hundred and sixty sheaves the earl of northampton said there was silence for a while the men have some themselves the king asked perhaps a sheaf apiece the earl of northampton said gloomily it will just have to be enough the king said bleakly he would have liked twice as many arrows but then he would have liked a lot of things he could have wished for twice as many men and a hill twice as steep and an enemy led by a man twice as nervous as philip of valois who god knows was nervous enough anyway but it was no good wishing he had to fight and win he frowned at the southern end of the ridge where it fell away to the village of crecy that would be the easiest place for the french to attack and the closest too which meant the fight would be hard there guns william he said to the earl of northampton guns sire well have the guns on the flanks bloody things have to be useful some time we could roll the things down the hill sire perhaps maybe crush a man or two the king laughed and rode on looks like rain it should hold off a while the earl of warwick answered and the french may hold off too sire you think they wont come william the earl shook his head theyll come sire but itll take them time a lot of time we might see their vanguard by noon but their rearguard will still be crossing the bridge in abbeville ill wager theyll wait till tomorrow morning to make a fight today or tomorrow the king said carelessly its all the same we could march on the earl of warwick suggested and find a better hill the king smiled he was younger and less experienced than many of the earls but he was also the king and so the decision must rest with him he was in truth filled with doubts but knew that he must look confident he would fight here he said as much and said it firmly we fight here the king said again staring up the slope he was imagining his army there seeing it as the french would see it and he knew his suspicion was right that the lowest part of the ridge close to crecy would be the dangerous ground that would be his right flank close under the mill my son will command on the right he said pointing and you william will be with him i will sire the earl of northampton agreed and you my lord on the left the king said to the earl of warwick we shall make our line twothirds of the way up the hill with archers in front and on the flanks and you sire the earl of warwick asked i shall be at the mill the king said then urged his horse up the hill he dismounted twothirds of the way up the slope and waited for a squire to take the mares reins then he began the mornings real work he paced along the hill marking places by prodding the turf with his white staff and instructing the lords who accompanied him that their men would be here or there and those lords sent men to summon their commanders so that when the army marched to the long green slope they would know where to go bring the banners here the king ordered and place them where the men are to assemble he kept his army in the three battles that had marched all the way from normandy two the largest would make a long thick line of menatarms stretching across the upper reaches of the slope theyll fight on foot the king ordered confirming what every man had expected though one or two of the younger lords still groaned for there was more honour to be gained by fighting from horseback but edward cared more about victory than honour he knew only too well that if his menatarms were mounted then the fools would make a charge as soon as the french attacked and his battle would degenerate into a brawl at the hills foot that the french must win because they had the advantage of numbers but if his men were on foot then they could not make a crazed charge against horsemen but must wait behind their shields to be attacked the horses are to be kept at the rear beyond the ridge he commanded he himself would command the third and smallest battle on the ridges summit where it would be a reserve you will stay with me my lord bishop the king told the bishop of durham the bishop armoured from nape to toes and carrying a massive spiked mace bridled youll deny me a chance to break french heads sire i shall let you weary god with your prayers instead the king said and his lords laughed and our archers the king went on will be here and here and here he was pacing the turf and ramming the white staff into the grass every few paces he would cover his line with archers and mass more at the two flanks the archers edward knew were his one advantage their long whitefledged arrows would do murder in this place that invited the enemy horsemen into the glorious charge here he stepped on and gouged the turf again and here you want pits sire the earl of northampton asked as many as you like william the king said the archers once they were gathered in their groups all along the face of the line would be told to dig pits in the turf some yards down the slope the pits did not have to be large just big enough to break a horses leg if it did not see the hole make enough pits and the charge must be slowed and thrown into disarray and here the king had reached the southern end of the ridge well park some empty wagons put half the guns here and the other half at the other end and i want more archers here if weve any left the earl of warwick grumbled wagons the earl of northampton asked cant charge a horse across a line of wagons william the king said cheerfully then beckoned his horse forward and because his plate armour was so heavy two pages had to half lift and half push him into the saddle it meant an undignified scramble but once he was settled in the saddle he looked back along the ridge that was no longer empty but was dotted with the first banners showing where men would assemble in an hour or two he thought his whole army would be here to lure the french into the archers arrows he wiped the earth from the butt of the staff then spurred his horse towards crecy lets see if theres any food he said the first flags fluttered on the empty ridge the sky pressed grey across distant fields and woods rain fell to the north and the wind felt cold the eastern road along which the french must come was deserted still the priests prayed take pity on us o lord in thy great mercy take pity on us the man who called himself the harlequin was in the woods on the hill that lay to the east of the ridge that ran between crecy and wadicourt he had left abbeville in the middle of the night forcing the sentries to open the northern gate and he had led his men through the dark with the help of an abbeville priest who knew the local roads then hidden by beeches he had watched the king of england ride and walk the far ridge now the king was gone but the green turf was speckled with banners and the first english troops were straggling up from the village they expect us to fight here he remarked its as good a place as any sir simon jekyll observed grumpily he did not like being roused in the middle of the night he knew that the strange blackclad man who called himself the harlequin had offered to be a scout for the french army but he had not thought that all the harlequins followers would be expected to miss their breakfast and grope through a black and empty countryside for six cold hours it is a ridiculous place to fight the harlequin responded they will line that hill with archers and we will have to ride straight into their points what we should do is go round their flank he pointed to the north tell his majesty that sir simon said spitefully i doubt he will listen to me the harlequin heard the scorn but did not rise to it not yet when we have made our name then he will listen he patted his horses neck i have only faced english arrows once and then it was merely a single archer but i saw an arrow go clean through a mail coat ive seen an arrow go through two inches of oak sir simon said three inches henry colley added he like sir simon might have to face those arrows today but he was still proud of what english weapons could do a dangerous weapon the harlequin acknowledged though in an unworried voice he was ever unworried always confident perpetually calm and that selfcontrol irritated sir simon though he was even more annoyed by the harlequins faintly hooded eyes which he realized reminded him of thomas of hookton he had the same good looks but at least thomas of hookton was dead and that was one less archer to face this day but archers can be beaten the harlequin added sir simon reflected that the frenchman had faced one archer in his whole life yet had already worked out how to beat them how you told me how the harlequin reminded sir simon you exhaust their arrows of course you send them lesser targets let them kill peasants fools and mercenaries for an hour or two then release your main force what we shall do he turned his horse away is charge with the second line it does not matter what orders we receive we shall wait till the arrows are running out who wants to be killed by some dirty peasant no glory there sir simon that sir simon acknowledged was true enough he followed the harlequin to the further side of the beech wood where the squires and servants waited with the packhorses two messengers were sent back with news of the english dispositions while the rest dismounted and unsaddled their horses there was time for men and beasts to rest and feed time to don the battle armour and time for prayer the harlequin prayed frequently embarrassing sir simon who considered himself a good christian but one who did not dangle his soul from gods apron strings he said confession once or twice a year went to mass and bared his head when the sacraments passed by but otherwise he spared little thought for the pieties the harlequin on the other hand confided every day to god though he rarely stepped into a church and had little time for priests it was as though he had a private relationship with heaven and that was both annoying and comforting to sir simon it annoyed him because it seemed unmanly and it comforted him because if god was of any use to a fighting man then it was on a day of battle this day though seemed special for the harlequin for after going down on one knee and praying silently for a while he stood and ordered his squire to bring him the lance sir simon wishing they could stop the pious foolery and eat instead presumed that they were expected to arm themselves and sent colley to fetch his own lance but the harlequin stopped him wait he ordered the lances wrapped in leather were carried on a packhorse but the harlequins squire fetched a separate lance one that had travelled on its own horse and was wrapped in linen as well as leather sir simon had assumed it was the harlequins personal weapon but instead when the linen was pulled from the shaft he saw it was an ancient and warped spear made from a timber so old and dark that it would surely splinter if it was subjected to the smallest strain the blade looked to be made of silver which was foolish for the metal was too weak to make a killing blade sir simon grinned youre not fighting with that we are all fighting with that the harlequin said and to sir simons surprise the blackdressed man fell to his knees again down he instructed sir simon sir simon knelt feeling like a fool you are a good soldier sir simon the harlequin said i have met few men who can handle weapons as you do and i can think of no man i would rather have fighting at my side but there is more to fighting than swords and lances and arrows you must think before you fight and you must always pray for if god is on your side then no man can beat you sir simon obscurely aware that he was being criticized made the sign of the cross i pray he said defensively then give thanks to god that we will carry that lance into battle why because it is the lance of saint george and the man who fights under the protection of that lance will be cradled in gods arms sir simon stared at the lance which had been laid reverently on the grass there had been a few times in his life usually when he was half drunk when he would glimpse something of the mysteries of god he had once been reduced to tears by a fierce dominican though the effect had not lasted beyond his next visit to a tavern and he had felt shrunken the first time he had stepped into a cathedral and seen the whole vault dimly lit by candles but such moments were few infrequent and unwelcome yet now suddenly the mystery of christ reached down to touch his heart he stared at the lance and did not see a tawdry old weapon tricked with an impractical silver blade but a thing of godgiven power it had been given by heaven to make men on earth invincible and sir simon was astonished to feel tears prick at his eyes my family brought it from the holy land the harlequin said and they claimed that men who fought under the lances protection could not be defeated but that was not true they were beaten but when all their allies died when the very fires of hell were lit to burn their followers to death they lived they left france and took the lance with them but my uncle stole it and concealed it from us then i found it and now it will give its blessings to our battle sir simon said nothing he just gazed at the weapon with a look close to awe henry colley untouched by the moments fervour picked his nose the world the harlequin said is rotting the church is corrupt and kings are weak we have it in our power sir simon to make a new world loved by god but to do it we must destroy the old we must take power ourselves then give the power to god that is why we fight henry colley thought the frenchman was plain crazy but sir simon had an enraptured expression tell me the harlequin looked at sir simon what is the battle flag of the english king the dragon banner sir simon said the harlequin offered one of his rare smiles is that not an omen he asked then paused i shall tell you what will happen this day he went on the king of france will come and he will be impatient and he will attack the day will go badly for us the english will jeer at us because we cannot break them but then we shall carry the lance into battle and you will see god turn the fight we shall snatch victory from failure you will take the english kings son as a prisoner and maybe we will even capture edward himself and our reward will be philip of valoiss favour that is why we fight sir simon for the kings favour because that favour means power riches and land you will share that wealth but only so long as you understand that we shall use our power to purge the rot from christendom we shall be a scourge against the wicked mad as a brush henry colley thought daft as lights he watched as the harlequin stood and went to a packhorses pannier from which he took a square of cloth which unfolded proved to be a red banner on which a strange beast with horns tusks and claws reared on its hind legs while clasping a cup in its forepaws this is my familys banner the harlequin said tying the flag to the lances long silver head with black ribbons and for many years sir simon this banner was forbidden in france because its owners had fought against the king and against the church our lands were wasted and our castle is still slighted but today we shall be heroes and this banner will be back in favour he rolled the flag about the lancehead so that the yale was hidden today he said fervently my family is resurrected what is your family sir simon asked my name is guy vexille the harlequin admitted and i am the count of astarac sir simon had never heard of astarac but he was pleased to learn that his master was a proper nobleman and to signify his obedience he held his praying hands towards guy vexille in homage i will not disappoint you my lord sir simon said with an unaccustomed humility god will not disappoint us today guy vexille said he took sir simons hands in his own today he raised his voice to speak to all his knights we shall destroy england for he had the lance and the royal army of france was coming and the english had offered themselves for slaughter arrows will skeat said he was standing at the woods edge beside a pile of sheaves unloaded from a wagon but suddenly paused good god he was staring at thomas looks like a rat got your hair he frowned suits you though you look grown up at long last arrows he said again dont waste them he tossed the sheaves one by one to the archers it looks like a lot but most of you godforsaken lepers have never been in a proper battle and battles swallow arrows like whores swallowing good morning father hobbe youll spare me a sheaf will dont waste it on sinners father will said throwing a bundle to the priest kill some godfearing frenchmeri theres no such thing will theyre all spawn of satan thomas emptied a sheaf into his arrow bag and tucked another into his belt he had a pair of boweords in his helmet safe from the rain that threatened a smith had come to the archers encampment and had hammered the nicks from their swords axes knives and billhooks then sharpened the blades with his stones the smith who had been wandering the army said the king had ridden north to look for a battlefield but he himself reckoned the french would not come that day its a lot of sweat for nothing he had grumbled as he smoothed a stone down thomass sword this is french work he said peering at the long blade from caen you could sell this for a penny or two the praise was grudging good steel old of course but good now with their arrows replenished the archers placed their belongings into a wagon that would join the rest of the armys baggage and one man who was sick in his belly would guard it through the day while a second invalid would stand sentry on the archers horses will skeat ordered the wagon away then cast an eye over his assembled archers the bastards are coming he growled if not today then tomorrow and there are more of them than there are of us and they aint hungry and theyve all got boots and they think their shit smells of roses because theyre bloody frenchmen but they die just like anyone else shoot their horses and youll live to see sundown and remember they aint got proper archers so theyre going to lose it aint difficult to understand keep your heads aim at the horses dont waste shafts and listen for orders lets go boys they waded the shallow river one of the many bands of archers who emerged from the trees to file into the village of crecy where knights were pacing up and down then stamping their feet and calling on squires or pages to tighten a strap or loosen a buckle to make their armour comfortable bunches of horses tied bridle to bridle were being led to the back of the hill where with the armys women children and baggage they would stay inside a ring of wagons the prince of wales armoured from the waist down was eating a green apple beside the church and he nodded distractedly when skeats men respectfully pulled off their helmets there was no sign of jeanette and thomas wondered if she had fled on her own then decided he did not care eleanor walked beside him she touched his arrow bag do you have enough arrows depends how many frenchmen come thomas said how many englishmen are there rumour said the army had eight thousand men now half of them archers and thomas reckoned that was probably about right he gave that figure to eleanor who frowned and how many frenchmen she asked the good lord knows thomas said but he reckoned it had to be far more than eight thousand a lot more but he could do nothing about that now and so he tried to forget the disparity in numbers as the archers climbed towards the windmill they crossed the crest to see the long forward slope and for an instant thomas had the impression that a great fair was just beginning gaudy flags dotted the hill and bands of men wandered between them and all it needed was some dancing bears and a few jugglers and it would have looked just like the dorchester fair will skeat had stopped to search for the earl of northamptons banner then spotted it on the right of the slope straight down from the mill he led the men down and a manatarms showed them the sticks marking the spot where the archers would fight and the earl wants horsepits dug the manatarms said you heard him will skeat shouted get digging eleanor helped thomas make the pits the soil was thick and they used knives to loosen the earth that they scooped out with their hands why do you dig pits eleanor asked to trip the horses thomas said kicking the excavated earth away before starting another hole all along the face of the hill archers were making similar small pits a score of paces in front of their positions the enemy horsemen might charge at the full gallop but the pits would check them they could get through but only slowly and the impetus of their charge would be broken and while they tried to thread the treacherous holes they would be under attack from archers there eleanor said pointing and thomas looked up to see a group of horsemen on the far hill crest the first frenchmen had arrived and were staring across the valley to where the english army slowly assembled under the banners be hours yet thomas said those frenchmen he guessed were the vanguard who had been sent ahead to find the enemy while the main french army would still be marching from abbeville the crossbowmen who would surely lead the attack would all be on foot off to thomass right where the slope fell away to the river and the village a makeshift fortress of empty wagons was being made the carts were parked close together to form a barrier against horsemen and between them were guns these were not the guns that had failed to break caen castle but were much smaller ribalds will skeat said to thomas ribalds thats what theyre called ribalds he led thomas and eleanor along the slope to look at the guns which were strange bundles of iron tubes gunners were stirring the powder while others were undoing bundles of garros the long arrowlike iron missiles that were rammed into the tubes some of the ribalds had eight barrels some seven and a few only four useless bloody things skeat spat but they might frighten the horses he nodded a greeting to the archers who were digging pits ahead of the ribalds the guns were thick here thomas counted thirtyfour and others were being dragged into place but they still needed the protection of bowmen skeat leaned on a wagon and stared at the far hill it was not warm but he was sweating are you ill thomas asked guts are churning a bit skeat admitted but nothing to make a song and dance about there were about four hundred french horsemen on the far hill now and others were appearing from the trees it might not happen skeat said quietly the battle philip of france isjumpy skeat said hes got a knack of marching up to battle then deciding hed rather be frolicking at home thats what i hear nervous bastard he shrugged but if he thinks hes got a chance today tom its going to be nasty thomas smiled the pits the archers dont be a bloody fool boy skeat retorted not every pit breaks a leg and not every arrow strikes true we might stop the first charge and maybe the second but theyll still keep coming and in the end theyll get through theres just too many of the bastards theyll be on top of us tom and itll be up to the menatarms to give them a hammering just keep your head boy and remember its the menatarms who do the closequarter work if the bastards get past the pits then take your bow back wait for a target and stay alive and if we lose he shrugged leg it for the forest and hide there what is he saying eleanor asked that it should be easy work today you are a bad liar thomas just too many of them skeat said almost to himself tommy dugdale faced worse odds down in brittany tom but he had plenty of arrows were short were going to be all right will aye well maybe skeat pushed himself off the wagon you two go ahead i need a quiet place for a second thomas and eleanor walked back north the english line was forming now the scattered flags being swamped by menatarms who were forming into blocks archers stood ahead of each formation while marshals armed with white staffs made sure there were gaps in the line through which the archers could escape if the horsemen came too close bundles of lances had been fetched from the village and were being issued to the menatarms in the front rank for if the french did get past the pits and the arrows the lances would have to be used as pikes by midmorning the whole army was assembled on the hill it looked far bigger than it really was because so many women had stayed with their men and now sat on the grass or else lay and slept a fitful sun came and went racing shadows across the valley the pits were dug and the guns loaded perhaps a thousand frenchmen watched from the far hill but none ventured down the slope at least its better than marching jake said gives us a chance for a rest eh be an easy day sam reckoned he nodded at the far hill not many of the bastards eh thats only the vanguard you daft bastard jake said there are more coming sam sounded genuinely surprised every goddamn bastard in france is coming jake said thomas kept quiet he was imagining the french army strung along the abbeville road they would all know the english had stopped running that they were waiting and doubtless the french were hurrying in case they missed the battle they had to be confident he made the sign of the cross and eleanor sensing his fear touched his arm you will be all right she said you too my love you remember your promise to my father she asked thomas nodded but he could not persuade himself that he would see the lance of saint george this day this day was real while the lance belonged to some mysterious world of which thomas really wanted no part everyone else he thought cared passionately about the relic and only he who had as good a reason as any to discover the truth was indifferent he wished he had never seen the lance he wished that the man who had called himself the harlequin had never come to hookton but if the french had not landed he thought then he would not be carrying the black bow and would not be on this green hillside and would not have met eleanor you cannot turn your back on god he told himself if i see the lance he promised eleaflor i shall fight for it that was his penance though he still hoped he would not have to serve it they ate mouldy bread for their midday meal the french were a dark mass on the far hill too many to count now and the first of their infantry had arrived a spit of rain made those archers who had their strings dangling from a bowtip hurry to coil the cords and shelter them under helmets or hats but the small rain passed a wind stirred the grass and still the french came to the far hill they were a horde they had come to crecy and they had come for revenge the english waited two of skeats archers played straw flutes while the hobelars who were helping to protect the guns on the armys flanks sang songs of green woods and running streams some men danced the steps they would have used on a village green back home others slept many played dice and all but the sleepers continually looked across the valley to the far hill crest that was thickening with men jake had a linenwrapped lump of beeswax that he handed round the archers so they could coat their bows it was not necessary just something to do where did you get the wax thomas asked him stole it of course off some daft manatarms saddle polish i reckon an argument developed over which wood made the best arrows it was an old discussion but it passed the time everyone knew ash made the best shafts but some men liked to claim that birch or hornbeam even oak flew just as well alder though heavy was good for killing deer but needed a heavy head and did not have the distance for battle sam took one of his new arrows from his bag and showed everyone how warped the shaft was must be made of bloody blackthorn he complained bitterly you could shoot that round a corner they dont make arrows like they used to will skeat said and his archers jeered for it was an old complaint its true skeat said its all hurry up and no craftsmanship these days who cares the bastards get paid by the sheaf and the sheaves are sent to london and no one looks at them till they reach us and what are we going to do just look at it he took the arrow from sam and twisted it in his fingers thats not a bloody goose feather its a goddamn sparrow feather no bloody use for anything except scratching your arse he tossed the arrow back to sam no a proper archer makes his own arrows i used to thomas said but youre a lazy bastard now eh tom skeat grinned but the grin faded as he stared across the valley enough of the goddamn bastards he grumbled looking at the gathering french then he grimaced as a solitary raindrop splashed on his worn boots i wish it would damn well rain and get it over with it wants to if it pisses on us when the bastards are attacking then we might as well run for home because the bows wont shoot eleanor sat beside thomas and watched the far hill there were at least as many men there as were in the english army now and the french main battle was only just arriving mounted menatarms were spreading across the hill organizing themselves into conrois a conroi was the basic fighting unit for a knight or manatarms and most had between a dozen and twenty men but those who formed the bodyguards of the great lords were much larger there were now so many horsemen on the far hilltop that some had to spill down the slope which was turning into a spread of colour for the menatarms were wearing surcoats embroidered with their lords badges and the horses had gaudy trappers while the french banners added more blue and red and yellow and green yet despite the colours the dull grey of steel and mail still predominated in front of the horsemen were the first green and red jackets of the genoese crossbowmen there was only a handful of those bowmen but more and more were streaming over the hill to join their comrades a cheer sounded from the english centre and thomas leaned forward to see that archers were scrambling to their feet his first thought was that the french must have attacked but there were no enemy horsemen and no arrows flew up will skeat shouted suddenly on your feet what is it jake asked thomas saw the horsemen then not frenchmen but a dozen englishmen who rode along the face of the waiting battleline carefully keeping their horses away from the archers pits three of the horsemen were carrying banners and one of those flags was a huge standard showing the hues and the leopards framed in gold its the king a man said and skeats archers began to cheer the king stopped and spoke with the men in the centre of the line then trotted on towards the english right his escort was mounted on big destriers but the king rode a grey mare he wore his bright surcoat but had hung his crowned helmet from his saddle pommel and so was bareheaded his royal standard all red gold and blue led the flags while behind it was the kings personal badge of the flaming sun rising while the third which provoked the loudest cheer was an extravagantly long pennant which showed the firespewing dragon of wessex it was the flag of england of the men who had fought the conqueror and the conquerors descendant now flew it to show that he was of england like the men who cheered him as he rode the grey horse he stopped close to will skeats men and raised a white staff to silence the cheers the archers had pulled off their helmets and some had gone on one knee the king still looked young and his hair and beard were as gold as the rising sun on his standard i am grateful he began in a voice so hoarse that he paused and started again i am grateful that you are here that started the cheering again and thomas who was cheering with the others did not even reflect on what choice they had been given the king raised the white staff for silence the french as you see have decided to join us perhaps they are lonely it was not a great joke but it prompted roars of laughter that turned to jeers for the enemy the king smiled as he waited for the shouts to subside we came here he then called only to procure the rights and lands and privileges that are ours by the laws of man and of god my cousin of france challenges us and in so doing he defies god the men were silent now listening carefully the destriers of the kings escort were pawing the ground but not a man moved god will not endure philip of frances impudence the king went on he will punish france and you he cast a hand to indicate the archers will be his instrument god is with you and i promise you i swear to you before god and on my own life that i will not leave this field till the last man of my army has marched from here we stay on this hill together and we fight here together and we shall win together for god for saint george and for england the cheers began again and the king smiled and nodded then turned as the earl of northampton strode from the line the king leaned down in his saddle and listened to the earl for a moment then straightened and smiled again is there a master skeat here skeat immediately reddened but did not confess his presence the earl was grinning the king waited then a score of archers pointed at their leader hes here come here the king commanded sternly will skeat looked embarrassed as he threaded through the bowmen and approached the kings horse where he went on one knee the king drew his rubyhilted sword and touched it on skeats shoulder we are told you are one of our best soldiers so from henceforth you will be sir william skeat the archers shouted even louder will skeat sir william now stayed on his knees as the king spurred on to give the same speech to the last men in the line and to those who manned the guns in the circle of farm carts the earl of northampton who had plainly been responsible for skeats knighthood raised him up and led him back to his cheering men and skeat was still blushing as his archers clapped him on the back bloody nonsense he said to thomas you deserve it will thomas said then grinned sir william just have to pay more bloody tax wont i skeat said but he looked pleased anyway then he frowned as a drop of rain splashed on his bare forehead bowstrings he shouted most of the men were still sheltering their strings but a handful had to coil the cords as the rain began to fall more heavily one of the earls menatarms came to the archers shouting that the women were to go back beyond the crest you heard him will skeat called women to the baggage some of the women wept but eleanor just clung to thomas for a moment live she said simply then walked away through the rain passing the prince of wales who with six other mounted men was riding to his place among the menatarms behind will skeats archers the prince had decided to fight on horseback so he could see over the heads of the dismounted men and to mark his arrival his banner which was bigger than any other on the right of the field was loosed to the heavy downpour thomas could no longer see across the valley because wide curtains of heavy grey rain were sweeping from the north and obscuring the air there was nothing to do but sit and wait while the leather backing of his mail became cold and clammy he hunched miserably staring into the greyness knowing that no bow could draw properly till this downpour ended what they should do said father hobbe who sat beside thomas is charge now they couldnt find their way in this muck father thomas said he saw the priest had a bow and an arrow bag but no other battle equipment you should get some mail he said or at least a padded jacket im armoured by the faith my son wheres your bowstrings thomas asked for the priest had neither helmet nor cap i looped them round my well never mind it has to be good for something other than pissing eh and its dry down there father hobbe seemed indecently cheerful ive been walking the lines tom and looking for your lance its not here hardly goddamn surprising thomas said i never thought it would be father hobbe ignored the blasphemy and i had a chat with father pryke do you know him no thomas said curtly the rain was pouring off the front of his helmet onto the broken bridge of his nose how the hell would i know father pryke father hobbe was not deterred by thomass surliness hes confessor to the king and a great man hell be a bishop one day soon i asked him about the vexilles father hobbe paused but thomas said nothing he remembers the family the priest went on he says they had lands in cheshire but they supported the mortimers at the beginning of the kings reign so they were outlawed he said something else they were always reckoned pious but their bishop suspected they had strange ideas a touch of gnosticism cathars thomas said it seems likely doesnt it and if its a pious family thomas said then i probably dont belong isnt that good news you cant escape thomas father hobbe said softly his usually wild hair was plastered close to his skull by the rain you promised your father you accepted the penance thomas shook his head angrily there are a score of bastards here father he indicated the archers crouching under the rains lash whove murdered more men than i have go and harrow their souls and leave mine alone father hobbe shook his head youve been chosen thomas and im your conscience it occurs to me see that if the vexilles supported mortimer then they cant love our king if theyll be anywhere today itll be over there he nodded towards the valleys far side which was still blotted out by the pelting rain then theyll live for another day wont they thomas said father hobbe frowned you think were going to lose he asked sternly no thomas shivered it must be getting late in the afternoon father if they dont attack now theyll wait till morning thatll give them a whole day to slaughter us ah thomas how god loves you thomas said nothing to that but he was thinking that all he wanted was to be an archer to become sir thomas of hookton as will had just become sir william he was happy serving the king and did not need a heavenly lord to take him into weird battles against dark lords let me give you some advice father he said its always welcome tom first bastard that drops get his helmet and mail look after yourself father hobbe clapped thomass back god is on our side you heard the king say as much he stood and went to talk with other men and thomas sat by himself and saw that the rain was lessening at last he could see the far trees again see the colours of the french banners and surcoats and now he could see a mass of red and i green crossbowmen at the other side of the valley they were going nowhere he reckoned for a crossbow string was as susceptible to the damp as any other itll be tomorrow he called down to jake well do it all again tomorrow lets hope the sun shines jake said the wind brought the last drops of rain from the north it was late thomas stood stretched and stamped his feet a day wasted he thought and a hungry night ahead and tomorrow his first real battle an excited group of mounted men had gathered about the french king who was still a halfmile from the hill where the largest part of his army had gathered there were at least two thousand menatarms in the rearguard who were still marching but those who had reached the valley hugely outnumbered the waiting english two to one sire charles the count of alencon and the kings younger brother said vehemently like the rest of the horsemen his surcoat was soaking and the dye in its badge had run into the white linen his helmet was beaded with water we must kill them now the count insisted but philip of valoiss instinct was to wait it would be wise he thought to let his whole army gather to make a proper reconnaissance and then attack next morning but he was also aware that his companions especially his brother thought him cautious they even believed him to be timid for he had avoided battle with the english before and even to propose waiting a mere day might make them think he had no stomach for the highest business of kings he still ventured the proposal suggesting that the victory would be all the more complete if it was just delayed by one day and if you wait alencon said scathingly edward will slip away in the night and tomorrow well face an empty hill theyre cold wet hungry and ready to be slaughtered the duke of lorraine insisted and if they dont leave sire the count of flanders warned theyll have more time to dig trenches and holes and the signs are good john of hainault a close companion of the king and the lord of beaumont added the signs the king asked john of hainault gestured for a man in a black cloak to step forward the man who had a long white beard bowed low the sun sire he said is in conjunction with mercury and opposite saturn best of all noble sire mars is in the house of virgo it spells victory and could not be more propitious and how much gold philip wondered had been paid to the astrologer to come up with that prophecy yet he was also tempted by it he thought it unwise to do anything without a horoscope and wondered where his own astrologer was probably still on the abbeville road go now alencn urged his brother guy vexille the count of astarac pushed his horse into the throng surrounding the king he saw a greenandredjacketed crossbowman evidently the commander of the genoese and spoke to him in italian has the rain affected the strings badly carlo grimaldi the genoese leader admitted crossbow strings could not be unstrung like the cords of ordinary bows for the tension in the cords was too great and so the men had simply tried to shelter their weapons under their inadequate coats we should wait till tomorrow grimaldi insisted we cant advance without pavises whats he saying alencon demanded the count of astarac translated for his majestys benefit and the king pale and longfaced frowned when he heard that the crossbowmens long shields that protected them from the enemys arrows while they reloaded their cumbersome weapons had still not arrived how long will they be he asked plaintively but no one knew why didnt they travel with the bowmen he demanded but again no one had an answer who are you the king finally asked the count astarac sire guy vexille said ah it was plain the king had no idea who or what astarac was nor did he recognize vexilles shield that bore the simple symbol of the cross but vexilles horse and armour were both expensive and so the king did not dispute the mans right to offer advice and you say the bows wont draw of course theyll draw the count of alencon man interrupted the damned genoese dont want to fight bastard genoese he spat the english bows will be just as wet he added the crossbows will be weakened sire vexille explained carefully ignoring the hostility of the kings younger brother the bows will draw but they wont have their full range or force it would be best to wait the king asked it would be wise to wait sire vexille said and it would be especially wise to wait for the pavises tomorrows horoscope john of hainault asked the astrologer the man shook his head neptune approaches the bendings tomorrow sire it is not a hopeful conjunction attack now theyre wet tired and hungry alencon urged attack now the king still looked dubious but most of the great lords were confident and they hammered him with their arguments the english were trapped and a delay of even one day might give them a chance to escape perhaps their fleet would come to le crotoy go now they insisted even though it was late in the day go and kill go and win show christendom that god is on the side of the french just go go now and the king because he was weak and because he wanted to appear strong surrendered to their wishes so the oriflamme was taken from its leather tube and carried to its place of honour at the front of the menatarms no other flag would be allowed to go ahead of the long plain red banner that flew from its crossstaff and was guarded by thirty picked knights who wore scarlet ribbons on their right arms the horsemen were given their long lances then the conrois closed together so the knights and menatarms were knee to knee drummers took the rain covers from their instruments and grimaldi the genoese commander was peremptorily told to advance and kill the english archers the king crossed himself while a score of priests fell to their knees in the wet grass and began to pray the lords of france rode to the hill crest where their mailed horsemen waited by nightfall they would all have wet swords and prisoners enough to break england for ever for the oriflamme was going into battle gods teeth will skeat sounded astonished as he scrambled to his feet the bastards are coming his surprise was justified for it was late in the afternoon the time when labourers would think of going home from the fields the archers stood and stared the enemy was not yet advancing but a horde of crossbowmen were spreading across the valley bottom while above them the french knights and menatarms were arming themselves with lances thomas thought it had to be a feint it would be dark in another three or four hours yet perhaps the french were confident they could do the business quickly the crossbowmen were at last starting forward thomas took off his helmet to find a bowstring looped one end over a horn tip then flexed the shaft to fix the other loop in its nock he fumbled and had to make three attempts to string the long black weapon sweet jesus he thought but they were really coming be calm he told himself be calm but he felt as nervous as when he had stood on the slope above hookton and dared himself to kill a man for the very first time he pulled open the laces of the arrow bag the drums began to beat from the french side of the valley and a great cheer sounded there was nothing to explain the cheer the menatarms were not moving and the crossbowmen were still a long way off english trumpets responded calling sweet and clear from the windmill where the king and a reserve of menatarms waited archers were stretching and stamping their feet all along the hill four thousand english bows were strung and ready but there were half as many crossbowmen again coming towards them and behind those six thousand genoese were thousands of mailed horsemen no pavises will skeat shouted and their strings will be damp they wont have the reach for us father hobbe had appeared at thomass side again thomas nodded but was too drymouthed to answer a crossbow in good hands and there were none better than the genoese should outrange a straight bow but not if it had a damp string the extra range was no great advantage for it took so long to rewind a bow that an archer could advance into range and loose six or seven arrows before the enemy was ready to send his second bolt but even though thomas understood that imbalance he was still nervous the enemy looked so numerous and the french drums were great heavy kettles with thick skins that boomed like the devils own heartbeat in the valley the enemy horsemen were edging forward eager to spur their mounts into an english line they expected to be deeply wounded by the crossbows assault while the english menatarms were shuffling together closing their line to make solid ranks of shields and steel the mail clinked and jangled god is with you a priest shouted dont waste your arrows will skeat called aim true boys aim true they aint going to stand long he repeated the message as he walked along his line you look like youve seen a ghost tom ten thousand ghosts thomas said theres more of the bastards than that will skeat said he turned and gazed at the hill maybe twelve thousand horsemen he grinned so thats twelve thousand arrows lad there were six thousand crossbowmen and twice as many menatarms who were being reinforced by infantry that was appearing on both french flanks thomas doubted that those foot soldiers would take any part in the battle not unless it turned into a rout and he understood that the crossbowmen could probably be turned back because they were coming without pavises and would have rainweakened weapons but to turn the genoese back would need arrows a lot of arrows and that would mean fewer for the mass of horsemen whose painted lances held upright made a thicket along the far hilltop we need more arrows he said to skeat youll make do with what youve got skeat said we all will cant wish for what you aint got the crossbowmen paused at the foot of the english slope and shook themselves into line before placing their bolts into their bows troughs thomas took out his first arrow and superstitiously kissed its head which was a wedge of slightly rusted steel with a wicked point and two steep barbs he laid the arrow over his left hand and slotted its nocked butt onto the centre of the bowstring which was protected from fraying with a whipping of hemp he half tensed the bow taking comfort from the yews resistance the arrow lay inside the shaft to the left of the handgrip he released the tension gripped the arrow with his left thumb and flexed the fingers of his right hand a sudden blare of trumpets made him jump every french drummer and trumpeter was working now making a cacophony of noise that started the genoese forward again they were climbing the english slope their faces white blurs framed by the grey of their helmets the french horsemen were coming down the slope but slowly and in fits and starts as though they were trying to anticipate the order to charge god is with us father hobbe called he was in his archers stance left foot far forward and thomas saw the priest had no shoes what happened to your boots father some poor boy needed them more than i did ill get a french pair thomas smoothed the feathers of his first arrow wait will skeat shouted wait a dog ran out of the english battleline and its owner shouted for it to come back and in a heartbeat half the archers were calling the dogs name biter biter come here you bastard biter quiet will skeat roared as the dog utterly confused ran towards the enemy off to thomass right the gunners were crouched by the carts linstocks smoking archers stood in the wagons weapons half braced the earl of northampton had come to stand among the archers you shouldnt be here my lord will skeat said the king makes him a knight the earl said and he thinks he can give me orders the archers grinned dont kill all the menatarms will the earl went on leave some for us poor swordsmen youll get your chance will skeat said grimly wait he called to the archers wait the genoese were shouting as they advanced though their voices were almost drowned by the heavy drumming and the wild trumpet calls biter was running back to the english now and a cheer sounded when the dog at last found shelter in the battleline dont waste your goddamn arrows will skeat called take proper aim like your mothers taught you the genoese were within bow range now but not an arrow flew and the redandgreencoated crossbowmen still came bending forward slightly as they trudged up the hill they were not coming straight at the english but at a slight angle which meant that the right of the english line where thomas was would be struck first it was also the place where the slope was most gradual and thomas with a sinking heart understood he was likely to be in the heart of the fight then the genoese stopped shuffled into line and began to shout their war cry too soon the earl muttered the crossbows went into the shooting position they were angled steeply upwards as the genoese hoped to drop a thick rain of death on the english line draw skeat said and thomas could feel his heart thumping as he pulled the coarse string back to his right ear he chose a man in the enemy line placed the arrow tip directly between that man and his right eye edged the bow to the right because that would compensate for the bias in the weapons aim then lifted his left hand and shifted it back to the left because the wind was coming from that direction not much wind he had not thought about aiming the arrow it was all instinct but he was still nervous and a muscle was twitching in his right leg the english line was utterly silent the crossbowmen were shouting and the french drums and trumpets deafening the genoese line looked like green and red statues let go you bastards a man muttered and the genoese obeyed him six thousand crossbow bolts arced into the sky now will said surprisingly softly and the arrows flew eleanor crouched by the wagon that held the archers baggage thirty or forty other women were there many with children and they all flinched as they heard the trumpets the drums and the distant shouting nearly all the women were french or breton though not one was hoping for a french victory for it was their men who stood on the green hill eleanor prayed for thomas for will skeat and for her father the baggage park was beneath the crest of the hill so she could not see what was happening but she heard the deep sharp note of the english bowstrings being released and then the rush of air across feathers that was the sound of thousands of arrows in flight she shuddered a dog tethered to the cart one of the many strays that had been adopted by the archers whimpered she patted it there will be meat tonight she told the dog the news had spread that the cattle captured in le crotoy would be reaching the army today if there was an army left to eat them the bows sounded again more raggedly the trumpets still screamed and the drumbeats were constant she glanced up at the hill crest half expecting to see arrows in the sky but there was only grey cloud against which scores of horsemen were outlined those horsemen were part of the kings small reserve of troops and eleanor knew that if she saw them spur forward then the main line would have been breached the kings royal standard was flying from the topmost vane of the windmill where it stirred in the small breeze to show its gold crimson and blue the vast baggage park was guarded by a mere score of sick or wounded soldiers who would not last a heartbeat if the french broke through the english line the kings baggage heaped on three whitepainted wagons had a dozen menatarms to guard the royal jewels but otherwise there was only the host of women and children and a handful of pageboys who were armed with short swords the armys thousands of horses were also there picketed close to the forest and watched by a few crippled men eleanor noted that most of the horses were saddled as though the menatarms and archers wanted the animals ready in case they had to flee a priest had been with the royal baggage but when the bows sounded he had hurried to the crest and eleanor was tempted to follow better to see what was going on she thought than wait here beside the forest and fear what might be happening she patted the dog and stood intending to walk to the crest but just then she saw the woman who had come to thomas in the damp night in the forest of crecy the countess of armorica beautifully dressed in a red gown and with her hair netted in a silver mesh was riding a small white mare up and down beside the princes wagons she paused every now and then to gaze at the crest and then she would stare towards the forest of crecygrange that lay to the west a crash startled eleanor and made her turn to the crest nothing explained the terrible noise that had sounded uncannily like a close clap of thunder but there was no lightning and no rain and the mill stood unharmed then a seep of greywhite smoke showed above the mills furled sails and eleanor understood that the guns had fired ribalds they were called she remembered and she imagined their rusting iron arrows slashing down the slope she looked back to the countess but jeanette was gone she had ridden to the forest taking her jewels with her eleanor saw the red gown flash in the trees then disappear so the countess had fled fearing the consequences of defeat and eleanor suspecting that the princes woman must know more of the english prospects than the archers women made the sign of the cross then because she could not bear the waiting any longer she walked to the crest if her lover died she thought then she wanted to be near him other women followed her none spoke they just stood on the hill and watched and prayed for their men thomass second arrow was in the air before his first had reached its greatest height and begun to fall he reached for a third then realized he had shot the second in panic and so he paused and stared at the clouded sky that was strangely thick with flickering black shafts that were as dense as starlings and deadlier than hawks he could see no crossbow bolts then he laid the third arrow on his left hand and picked a man in the genoese line there was an odd pattering noise that startled him and he looked to see it was the hail of genoese bolts striking the turf around the horse pits and a heartbeat later the first english arrow flight slammed home scores of crossbowmen were snatched backwards including the one thomas had picked out for his third arrow and so he changed his aim to another man hauled the cord back to his ear and let the shaft fly theyre falling short the earl of northampton shouted exultantly and some of the archers swore thinking he spoke of their own arrows but it was the genoese bows that had been enfeebled by the rain and not one of their quarrels had reached the english archers who seeing the chance for slaughter gave a howling cheer and ran a few paces down the slope kill them will skeat shouted they killed them the great bows were drawn again and again and the whitefeathered arrows slashed down the slope to pierce mail and cloth and to turn the lower hill into a field of death some crossbowmen limped away a few crawled and the uninjured edged backwards rather than span their weapons aim well the earl called dont waste arrows will skeat shouted thomas shot again plucked a new arrow from the bag and sought a new target as his previous arrow seared down to strike a man in the thigh the grass about the genoese line was thick with arrows that had missed but more than enough were striking home the genoese line was thinner much thinner and it was silent now except for the cries of men being struck and the moans of the wounded the archers advanced again right to the edge of their pits and a new flight of steel poured down the slope and the crossbowmen fled one moment they had been a ragged line still thick with men who stood behind the bodies of their comrades and now they were a rabble who ran as hard as they could to escape the arrows stop shooting will skeat bellowed stop hold john armstrong whose men were to the left of skeats band shouted well done the earl of northampton called back lads back will skeat motioned the archers sam david go and collect some arrows quick he pointed down the slope to where amidst the genoese dying and dead the whitetipped shafts were thickly stuck in the turf hurry lads john peter go and help them go all along the line archers were running to salvage arrows from the grass but then a shout of warning came from the men who had remained in their places get back get back will skeat shouted the horsemen were coming sir guillaume devecque led a conroi of twelve men on the far left of the french second line of horsemen ahead of him was a mass of french cavalry belonging to the first battle to his left was a scatter of infantrymen who sat on the grass and beyond them the small river twisted through its water meadows beside the forest to his right was nothing but horsemen crammed together as they waited for the crossbowmen to weaken the enemy line that english line looked pitifully small perhaps because its menatarms were on foot and so took up much less room than mounted knights yet sir guillaume grudgingly acknowledged that the english king had chosen his position well the french knights could not assault either flank for they were both protected by a village they could not ride around the english right for that was guarded by the soft lands beside the river while to circle about edwards left would mean a long journey around wadicourt and by the time the french came in sight of the english again the archers would surely have been redeployed to meet a french force made ragged by its long detour which meant that only a frontal assault could bring a swift victory and that in turn meant riding into the arrows heads down shields up and keep close he told his men before clanging down the facepiece of his helmet then knowing he would not charge for some time yet he pushed the visor back up his menatarms shuffled their horses till they were knee to knee the wind it was said should not be able to blow between the lances of a charging conroi be a while yet sir guillaume warned them the fleeing crossbowmen were running up the frenchheld hill sir guillaume had watched them advance and mouthed a silent prayer that god would be on the shoulders of the genoese kill some of those damned archers he had prayed but spare thomas the drummers had been hammering their great kettles driving down the sticks as if they could defeat the english by noise alone and sir guillaume elated by the moment had put the butt of his lance on the ground and used it to raise himself in the stirrups so he could see over the heads of the men in front he had watched the genoese loose their quarrels seen the bolts as a quick haze in the sky and then the english had shot and their arrows were a dark smear against the green slope and grey clouds and sir guillaume had watched the genoese stagger he had looked to see the english archers falling but they were coming forward instead still loosing arrows and then the two flanks of the small english line had billowed dirty white as the guns added their missiles to the hail of arrows that was whipping down the slope his horse had twitched uneasily when the crack of the guns rolled over the valley and sir guillaume dropped into the saddle and clicked his tongue he could not pat the horse for the lance was in his right hand and his left arm was strapped into its shield with the three yellow hawks on the blue ground the genoese had broken at first sir guillaume did not credit it believing that perhaps their commander was trying to trick the english archers into an undisciplined pursuit that would strand them at the bottom of the slope where the crossbows could turn on them but the english did not move and the fleeing genoese had not stopped they ran leaving a thick line of dead and dying men and now they climbed in panic towards the french horsemen a growl sounded from the french menatarms it was anger and the sound rose to a great jeer cowards a man near sir guillaume called the count of alencon felt a surge of pure rage theyve been paid he snarled at a companion bastards have taken a bribe cut them down the king called from his place at the edge of the beech wood cut them down his brother heard him and wanted nothing more than to obey the count was in the second line not the first but he spurred his horse into a gap between two of the leading conrois and shouted at his men to follow cut them down he called cut the bastards down the genoese were between the horsemen and the english line and now they were doomed for all along the hill the french were spurring forward hotblooded men from the second battle were tangling with the conrois of the first line to form an untidy mass of banners lances and horses they should have walked their horses down the hill so that they were still in close order when they reached the climb on the far side but instead they raked back spurs and driven by a hatred of their own allies raced each other to the kill we stay guy vexille count of astarac shouted at his men wait sir guillaume called better to let the first ragged charge spend itself he reckoned rather than join the madness perhaps half the french horsemen stayed on the hill the rest led by the kings brother rode down the genoese the crossbowmen tried to escape they ran along the valley in an attempt to reach the northern and southern ends but the mass of horsemen overlapped them and there was no way out some genoese sensibly lay down and curled into balls others crouched in the shallow ditches but most were killed or wounded as the horsemen rode over them the destriers were big beasts with hooves like hammers they were trained to run men down and the genoese screamed as they were trampled or slashed some knights used their lances on the crossbowmen and the weight of a horse and armoured man easily drove the wooden spears clean through their victims but those lances were all lost m left in the mangled torsos of the dead men and the knights had to draw their swords for a moment there was chaos in the valley bottom as the horsemen drove a thousand paths through the scattered crossbowmen then there were only the mangled remnants of the genoese mercenaries their red and green jackets soaked with blood and their weapons lying broken in the mud the horsemen one easy victory under their belt cheered themselves mon tjoie saint den is they shouted montjoie saint den is hundreds of flags were being taken forward with the horsemen threatening to overtake the oriflamme but the redribboned knights guarding the sacred flag spurred ahead of the charge shouting their challenge as they started up the slope towards the english and so climbed from a valley floor that was now thick with charging horsemen the remaining lances were lowered the spurs went back but some of the more sensible men who had waited behind for the next assault noted that there was no thunder of hoofs coming from the vast charge its turned to mud sir guillaume said to no one in particular trappers and surcoats were spattered with the mud churned up by the hoofs from the low ground that had been softened by the rain for a moment the charge seemed to flounder then the leading horsemen broke out of the wet valley bottom to find better footing on the english hill god was with them after all and they screamed their war cry montjoie saint denis the drums were beating faster than ever and the trumpets screamed to the sky as the horses climbed towards the mill fools guy vexille said poor souls sir guillaume said whats happening the king asked wondering why his careful ordering of the battlelines had broken even before the fight proper had begun but no one answered him they just watched jesus mary and joseph father hobbe said for it seemed as if half the horsemen of christendom were coming up the hill into line will skeat shouted god be with you the earl of northampton called then went back to join his menatarms aim for the horses john armstrong ordered his men bastards rode down their own bowmen jake said in wonderment so well kill the goddamn bastards thomas said vengefully the charge was nearing the line of those genoese who had died in the arrow storm to thomas staring down the hill the attack was a flurry of garish horse trappers and bright shields of painted lances and streaming pennants and now because the horses had climbed out of the wet ground every archer could hear the hooves that were louder even than the enemys kettledrums the ground was quivering so that thomas could feel the vibration through the worn soles of his boots that had been a gift from sir guillaume he looked for the three hawks but could not see them then forgot sir guillaume as his left leg went forward and his right arm hauled back the arrows feathers were beside his mouth and he kissed them then fixed his gaze on a man who carried a black and yellow shield now will skeat shouted the arrows climbed away hissing as they went thomas put a second on the string hauled and loosed a third this time picking out a man with a pigsnout helmet decorated with red ribbons he was aiming at the horses each time hoping to drive the wickededged blades through the padded trappers and deep into the animals chests a fourth arrow he could see clods of grass and soil being thrown up behind the leading horses the first arrow was still flying as he hauled back the fourth and looked for another target he fixed on a man without a surcoat in polished plate armour he loosed and just then the man in the plate armour tumbled forward as his horse was struck by another arrow and all along the slope there were screaming horses flailing hoofs and falling men as the english arrows drove home a lance cartwheeled up the slope a cry sounded above the beating hootbeats a horse ran into a dying animal and broke its leg and knights were thumping their knees against their horses to make them swerve about the stricken beasts a fifth arrow a sixth and to the menatarms behind the line of archers it seemed as though the sky was filled with a never ending stream of arrows that were dark against the darkening clouds whitetipped and rising above the slope to plunge into the churning menatarms scores of horses had fallen their riders were trapped in their high saddles and ridden over as they lay helpless yet still the horsemen came on and the men at the back could see far enough ahead to find gaps between the twitching piles of dead and dying montjoie saint denis montjoie saint denis spurs raked back to draw blood to thomas the slope looked a nightmare of heaving horses with yellow teeth and white eyes of long lances and arrowstuck shields of flying mud wild banners and grey helmets with slits for eyes and snouts for noses the banners flew led by a ribbonlike red streamer he shot again and again pouring arrows into the madness yet for every horse that fell there was another to take its place and another beast behind that arrows protruded from trappers from horses from men even from lances the white feathers bobbing as the charge thundered close and then the french front rank was among the pits and a stallions leg bone cracked and the beasts scream soared above the drums trumpets clang of mail and the beating of hoofs some men rode clean through the pits but others fell and brought down the horses behind the french tried to slow the horses and turn them aside but the charge was committed now and the men behind pressed the ones in front onto the pits and arrows the bow thumped in thomass hand and its arrow seared into a horsemans throat slitting the mail like linen and hurling the man back so that his lance reared into the sky back will skeat was shouting the charge was too close much too close back back back now go the archers ran into the gaps between the menatarms and the french seeing their tormentors vanish gave a great cheer montjoie saint denis shields the earl of northampton shouted and the english menatarms locked their shields together and raised their own lances to make a hedge of points saint george the earl screamed saint george mon tjoie saint den is enough horsemen had got through the arrows and the pits and still the menatarms streamed up the hill and now at last charged home if a plum was thrown at a conroi the experts said it should be impaled on a lance that was how close the horsemen were supposed to be in a charge because that way they stood a chance of living but if the conroi scattered then each man would end up surrounded by enemies your neighbour in a cavalry charge the experienced men told the younger should be closer to you than your wife closer even than your whore but the first french charge was a crazed gallop and the men first became scattered when they slaughtered the genoese and the disarray became worse as they raced uphill to close on the enemy the charge was not supposed to be a crazed gallop but an ordered dreadful and disciplined assault the men lined knee to knee should have started slowly and stayed close until and only at the very last minute they spurred into a gallop to crash their tightbunched lances home in unison that was how the men were trained to charge and their destriers were trained just as hard a horses instinct on facing a packed line of men or cavalry was to shy away but the big stallions were ruthlessly schooled to keep running and so crash into the packed enemy and there to keep moving stamping biting and rearing a charge of knights was supposed to be thundering death on hooves a flail of metal driven by the ponderous weight of men horses and armour and properly done it was a mass maker of widows but the men of philips army who had dreamed of breaking the enemy into ribbons and slaughtering the dazed survivors had reckoned without archers and pits by the time the undisciplined first french charge reached the english menatarms it had broken itself into scraps and then been slowed to a walk because the long smooth and inviting slope turned out to be an obstacle course of dead horses unsaddled knights hissing arrows and legcracking pits concealed in the grass only a handful of men reached the enemy that handful spurred over the last few yards and aimed their lances at the dismounted english menatarms but the horsemen were met by more lances that were braced against the ground and tilted up to pierce their horses breasts the stallions ran onto the lances twisted away and the frenchmen were falling the english menatarms stepped forward with axes and swords to finish them off stay in line the earl of northampton shouted more horses were threading through the pits and there were no archers in front to slow them now these were the third and fourth ranks of the french charge they had suffered less damage from arrows and they came to help the men hacking at the english line that still bristled with lances men roared their battle cries hacked with swords and axes and the dying horses dragged down the english lances so that the french could at last close on the menatarms steel rang on steel and thumped on wood but each horseman was faced by two or three menatarms and the french were being dragged from their saddles and butchered on the ground no prisoners the earl of northampton shouted no prisoners those were the kings orders to take a man prisoner meant possible wealth but it also required a moment of courtesy to enquire whether an enemy truly yielded and the english had no time for such civility they needed only to kill the horsemen who kept streaming up the hill the king watching from beneath the mills furled sails which creaked as the wind twitched their tethers saw that the french had broken through the archers only on the right where his son fought and where the line lay closest to the french and the slope was gentlest the great charge had been broken by arrows but more than enough horsemen had survived and those men were spurring towards the place where the swords rang when the french charge began it had been spread all across the battlefield but now it shrank into a wedge shape as the men facing the english left swerved away from the archers there and added their weight to the knights and menatarms who hacked at the prince of waless battle hundreds of horsemen were still milling about in the valleys muddy bottom unwilling to face the arrow storm a second time but french marshals were reforming those men and sending them up the hill towards the growlng melee that fought under the banners of alencon and the prince of wales let me go down there sire the bishop of durham looking ungainly in his heavy mail and holding a massive spiked mace appealed to the king theyre not breaking edward said mildly his line of menatarms was four ranks deep and only the first two were fighting and fighting well a horsemans greatest advantage over infantry was speed but the french charge had been sapped of all velocity the horsemen were being forced into a walk to negotiate the corpses and pits and there was no room beyond to spur into a trot before they were met by a vicious defence of axes swords maces and spears frenchman hacked down but the english held their shields high and stabbed their blades into the horses guts or else sliced swords across hamstrings the destriers fell screaming and kicking breaking mens legs with their wild thrashing but every horse down was an added obstacle and fierce as the french assault was it was failing to break the line no english banners had toppled yet though the king feared for his sons bright flag that was closest to the most violent fighting have you seen the oriflamme he asked his entourage it fell sire a household knight answered the man pointed down the slope to where a heap of dead horses and broken men were the remnants of the first french attack somewhere there sir arrows god bless arrows the king said a conroi of fourteen frenchmen managed to negotiate the pits without harm montjoie saint denis they shouted and couched their lances as they spurred into the melee where they were met by the earl of northampton and a dozen of his men the earl was using a broken lance as a pike and he rammed the splintered shaft into a horses chest felt the lance slide off the armour concealed by the trapper and instinctively lifted his shield a mace cracked on it driving one spike clean through the leather and willow but the earl had his sword dangling by a strap and he dropped the lance gripped the swords hilt and stabbed it into the horses fetlock making the beast twist away he dragged the shield clear of the maces spikes swung the sword at the knight was parried then a manatarms seized the frenchmans weapon and tugged the frenchman pulled back but the earl helped and the frenchman shouted as he was tumbled down to the english feet a sword ran into the armour gap at his groin and he doubled over then a mace crushed his helmet and he was left twitching as the earl and his men climbed over his body and hacked at the next horse and man the prince of wales spurred into the melee made conspicuous by a fillet of gold that circled his black helmet he was only sixteen well built strong tall and superbly trained he fended an axe away with his shield and rammed his sword through another horsemans mail off the bloody horse the earl of northampton shouted at the prince get off the bloody horse he ran to the prince seized the bridle and tugged the horse away from the fight a frenchman spurred in trying to spear the princes back but a manatarms in the princes green and white livery slammed his shield into the destriers mouth and the animal twitched away the earl dragged the prince back they see a man on horseback sire he shouted up and they think hes french the prince nodded his own household knights had reached him now and they helped him down from the saddle he said nothing if he had been offended by the earl he hid it behind his facepiece as he went back to the melee saint george saint george the princes standardbearer struggled to stay with his master and the sight of the richly embroidered flag attracted still more screaming frenchmen in line the earl shouted in line but the dead horses and butchered men made obstacles that neither the french nor english could cross and so the menatarms led by the prince were scrambling over the bodies to reach more enemies a disembowelled horse trailed its guts towards the english then sank onto its forelegs to pitch its rider towards the prince who rammed the sword into the mans helmet mangling the visor and starting blood from the eyeholes saint george the prince was exultant and his black armour was streaked with enemy blood he was fighting with his visor raised for else he could not see properly and he was loving the moment the hours and hours of weapons practice the sweating days when sergeants had drilled him and beat at his shield and cursed him for not keeping his sword point high were all proving their worth and he could have asked for nothing more in this life a woman in the camp and an enemy coming in their hundreds to be killed the french wedge was widening as more men climbed the hill they had not broken through the line but they had drawn the two front english ranks across the tideline of dead and wounded and thus scattered them into groups of men who defended themselves against a welter of horsemen the prince was among them some frenchmen unhorsed but unwounded were fighting on foot forward the earl of northampton shouted at the third rank it was no longer possible to hold the shield wall tight now he had to wade into the horror to protect the prince and his men followed him into the maelstrom of horses blades and carnage they scrambled over dead horses tried to avoid the beating hooves of dying horses and drove their blades into living horses to bring the riders down to where they could be savaged each frenchman had two or three english footmen to contend against and though the horses snapped their teeth reared and lashed their hoofs and though the riders beat left and right with their swords the unmounted english invariably crippled the destriers in the end and more french knights were pitched onto the hoofscarred grass to be bludgeoned or stabbed to death some frenchmen recognizing the futility spurred back across the pits to make new con rois among the survivors squires brought them spare lances and the knights rearmed and wanting revenge came back to the fight and always they rode towards the princes bright flag the earl of northampton was close to the flag now he hammered his shield into a horses face cut at its legs and stabbed at the riders thigh another conroi came from the right three of its men still holding lances and the others with swords held far forward they slammed against the shields of the princes bodyguard driving those men back but other men in green and white came to their help and the prince pushed two of them out of the way so he could hack at a destriers neck the conroi wheeled away leaving two of its knights dead form line the earl shouted form line there was a lull in the fighting about the princes standard for the french were regrouping and just then the second french battle as large as the first started down their hill they came at a walk knee to booted knee lances held so close that a wind could not have passed between them they were showing how it should be done the ponderous drums drove them on the trumpets seared the sky and the french were coming to finish the battle eight jake said three sam told will skeat seven thomas said they were counting arrows not one archer had died yet not from will skeats band but they were perilously low on arrows skeat kept looking over the heads of the menatarms fearful that the french would break through but the line was holding once in a while when no english banner or head was in the way an archer would loose one of the precious arrows at a horseman but when a shaft wasted itself by glancing off a helmet skeat told them to save their supply a boy had brought a dozen skins of water from the baggage and the men passed the bags around skeat lotted up the arrows and shook his head no man had more than ten while father hobbe who admittedly had started with fewer than any of the men had none go up the hill father skeat told the priest and see if theyre keeping any shafts back the kings archers might spare some their captains called hal crowley and he knows me ask him anyway he did not sound hopeful right lads this way he said to the rest and led them towards the southern end of the english line where the french had not closed then forward of the menatarms to reinforce the archers who as low on arrows as the rest of the army were keeping up a desultory harassment of any group of horsemen who threatened to approach their position the guns were still firing intermittently spewing a noisome stench of powder smoke on the battles edge but thomas could see little evidence that the ribalds were killing any frenchmen though their noise and the whistle of their iron missiles was keeping the enemy horsemen well away from the flank well wait here skeat said then swore for he had seen the french second line leave the far hill crest they did not come like the first in ragged chaos but steadily and properly skeat made the sign of cross pray for arrows he said the king watched his son fight he had been worried when the prince had advanced on horseback but he nodded silent approval when he saw that the boy had possessed the good sense to dismount the bishop of durham pressed to be allowed to go to prince edwards help but the king shook his head he has to learn to win fights he paused i did the king had no intention of going down into the horror not because he feared such a fight but because once entangled with the french horsemen he would not be able to watch the rest of his line his job was to stay by the mill and trickle reinforcements down to the most threatened parts of his army men of his reserve continually pleaded to be allowed into the melee but the king obstinately refused them even when they complained that their honour would be smirched if they missed the fight the king dared not let men go for he was watching the french second battle come down the hill and he knew he must hoard every man in case that great sweep of horsemen battered through his line that second french line almost a mile across and three or four ranks deep walked down the slope where its horses had to thread the bodies of the slaughtered genoese form up the conroi leaders shouted when the crossbowmens bodies were behind them and the men obediently moved knee to knee again as they rode into the softer ground the hooves made hardly any sound in the wet soil so the loudest noises of the charge were the clink of mail the thump of scabbards and the swish of trappers on the long grass the drummers were still beating on the hill behind but no trumpets called you see the princes banner guy vexille asked sir simon jekyll who rode beside him there jekyll pointed his lance tip to where the ragged fight was hottest all vexilles conroi had baffles on their lances placed just back from the tip so that the wooden spears did not bury themselves in their victims bodies a lance with a baffle could be dragged free of a dying man and used again the highest flag sir simon added follow me vexille shouted and signalled to henry colley who had been given the job of standardbearer colley was bitter at the assignment reckoning he should have been allowed to fight with lance and sword but sir simon had told him it was a privilege to carry the lance of saint george and colley was forced to accept the task he planned to discard the useless lance with its red flag as soon as he entered the melee but for now he carried it high as he wheeled away from the well organized line vexilles men followed their banner and the departure of the conroi left a gap in the french formation and some men called out angrily even accusing vexille of cowardice but the count of astarac ignored the jibes as he slanted across the rear of the line to where he judged his horsemen were precisely opposite the princes men and there he found a fortuitous gap forced his horse into the space and let his men follow as best they could thirty paces to vexilles left a conroi with badges showing yellow hawks on a blue field trotted up the english hill vexille did not see sir guillaumes banner nor did sir guillaume see his enemys badge of the yale both men were watching the hill ahead wondering when the archers would shoot and admiring the bravery of the first charges survivors who repeatedly withdrew a few paces reformed and recharged the stubborn english line not one man threatened to break the enemy but they still tried even when they were wounded and their destriers were limping then as the second french charge neared the line of genoese crossbowmen killed by the english archers more trumpets sounded from the french hill and the horses pricked back their ears and tried to go into the canter men curbed the destriers and twisted awkwardly in their saddles to peer through visor slits to find what the trumpets meant and saw that the last of the french knights the king and his household warriors and the blind king of bohemia and his companions were trotting forward to add their weight and weapons to the slaughter the king of france rode beneath his blue banner that was spattered with the golden fleurdelis while the king of bohemias flag showed three white feathers on a dark red field all the horsemen of france were committed now the drummers sweated the priests prayed and the royal trumpeters gave a great fanfare to presage the death of the english army the count of alencon brother to the king had begun the crazed charge that had left so many frenchmen dead on the far slope but the count was also dead his leg broken by his falling horse and his skull crushed by an english axe the men he had led those that still lived were dazed arrow stung sweatblinded and weary but they fought on turning their tired horses to thrash swords maces and axes at menatarms who fended the blows with shields and raked their swords across the horses legs then a new trumpet called much closer to the melee the notes fell in urgent triplets that followed one after the other and some of the horsemen registered the call and understood they were being ordered to withdraw not to retreat but to make way for the biggest attack was yet to come god save the king will skeat said dourly for he had ten arrows left and half france was coming at him thomas was noticing the strange rhythm of battle the odd lulls in the violence and the sudden resurrection of horror men fought like demons and seemed invincible and then when the horsemen withdrew to regroup they would lean on their shields and swords and look like men close to death the horses would stir again english voices would shout warnings and the menatarms would straighten and lift their dented blades the noise on the hill was overwhelming the occasional crack of the guns that did little except make the battlefield reek with hells dark stench the screams of horses the blacksmiths clangour of weapons men panting shouting and moaning dying horses bared their teeth and thrashed the turf thomas blinked sweat from his eyes and stared at the long slope that was thick with dead horses scores of them hundreds maybe and beyond them approaching the bodies of the genoese who had died under the arrows lash even more horsemen were coming beneath a new spread of bright flags sir guillaume where was he did he live then thomas realized that the terrible opening charge when the arrows had felled so many horses and men had been just that an opening the real battle was starting now will will father hobbes voice called from somewhere behind the menatarms sir william here father the menatarms made way for the priest who was carrying an armload of arrow sheaves and leading a smallfrightened boy who carried still more a gift from the royal archers father hobbe said and he spilled the sheaves onto the grass thomas saw the arrows had the reddyed feathers of the kings own bowmen he drew his knife cut a binding lace and stuffed the new arrows into his bag into line into line the earl of northampton shouted hoarsely his helmet was deeply dented over his right temple and his surcoat was spotted with blood the prince of wales was shouting insults at the french who were wheeling their horses away going back through the tangled sprawl of dead and wounded archers the earl called then pulled the prince back into the menatarms who were slowly lining themselves into formation two men were picking up fallen enemy lances to rearm the front rank archers the earl called again will skeat took his men back into their old position in front of the earl were here my lord you have arrows some enough some skeat stubbornly answered thomas kicked a broken sword from under his feet two or three paces in front of him was a dead horse with flies crawling on its wide white eyes and over the glistening blood on its black nose its trapper was white and yellow and the knight who had ridden the horse was pinned under the body the mans visor was lifted many of the french and nearly all of the english menatarms fought with open visors and this dead mans eyes stared straight at thomas then suddenly blinked sweet jesus thomas swore as if he had seen a ghost have pity the man whispered in french for christs sake have pity thomas could not hear him for the air was filled with the drumbeat of hooves and the bray of trumpets leave them theyre beat will skeat bawled for some of his men were about to draw their bows against those horsemen who had survived the first charge and had withdrawn to realign their ranks well within bowshot range wait skeat shouted wait thomas looked to his left there were dead men and horses for a mile along the slope but it seemed the french had only broken through to the english line where he stood now they came again and he blinked away sweat and watched the charge come up the slope they came slowly this time keeping their discipline one knight in the french front rank was wearing extravagant white and yellow plumes on his helmet just as if he were in a tournament that was a dead man thomas thought for no archer could resist such a flamboyant target thomas looked back at the carnage in front were there any english among the dead it seemed impossible that there should not be but he could see none a frenchman an arrow deep in his thigh was staggering in a circle among the corpses then slumped to his knees his mail was torn at his waist and his helmets visor was hanging by a single rivet for a moment with his hands clasped over his swords pommel he looked just like a man at prayer then he slowly fell forward a wounded horse whinnied a man tried to rise and thomas saw the red cross of saint george on his arm and the red and yellow quarters of the earl of oxford on his jupon so there were english casualties after all wait will skeat shouted and thomas looked up to see that the horsemen were closer much closer he drew the black bow he had shot so many arrows that the two calloused string fingers of ihis right hand were actually sore while the edge of his left hand had been rubbed raw by the flick of the goose feathers whipping across its skin the long muscles of his back and arms were sore he was thirsty wait skeat shouted again and thomas relaxed the string a few inches the close order of the second charge had been broken by the bodies of the crossbowmen but the horsemen were reforming now and were well within bow range but will skeat knowing how few arrows he had wanted them all to count aim true boys he called weve no steel to waste now so aim true kill the damned horses the bows stretched to their full extent and the string bit like fire into thomass sore fingers now skeat shouted and a new flight of arrows skimmed the slope this time with red feathers among the white jakes bowstring snapped and he cursed as he fumbled for a replacement a second flight whipped away its feathers hissing in the air and then the third arrows were on the string as the first flight struck horses screamed and reared the riders flinched and then drove back spurs as if they understood that the quickest way to escape the arrows was to ride down the archers thomas shot again and again not thinking now just looking for a horse leading it with the steel arrowhead then releasing he drew out a whitefeathered arrow and saw blood on the quills and knew his bow fingers were bleeding for the first time since he had been a child he shot again and again until his fingers were raw flesh and he was almost weeping from the pain but the second charge had lost all its cohesion as the barbed points tortured the horses and the riders encountered the corpses left by the first attack the french were stalled unable to ride into the arrow flail but unwilling to retreat horses and men fell the drums beat on and the rearward horsemen were pushing the front ranks into the bloody ground where the pits waited and the arrows stung thomas shot another arrow watched the red feathers whip into a horses breast then fumbled in the arrow bag to find just one shaft left he swore arrows sam called but no one had any to spare thomas shot his last then turned to find a gap in the menatarms that would let him escape the horsemen who would surely come now the arrows had run out but there were no gaps he felt a heartbeat of pure terror there was no escape and the french were coming then almost without thinking he put his right hand under the horn tip of the bow and launched it high over the english menatarms so it would fall behind them the bow was an encumbrance now so he would be rid of it and he picked up a fallen shield hoping to god it showed an english insignia and pushed his left forearm into the tight loops he drew his sword and stepped back between two of the lances held by the menatarms other archers were doing the same let the archers in the earl of northampton shouted let them in but the menatarms were too fearful of the rapidly approaching french to open their files ready a man shouted ready there was a note of hysteria in his voice the french horsemen now that the arrows were exhausted were streaming up the slope between the corpses and the pits their lances were lowered and their spurs raked back as they demanded a last spurt from the horses before they struck the enemy the trappers were flecked with mud and hung with arrows thomas watched a lance held the unfamiliar shield high and thought how monstrous the enemys steel faces looked youll be all right lad a quiet voice spoke behind him hold the shield high and go for the horse thomas snatched a look and saw it was the greyhaired reginald cobham the old champion himself standing in the front rank brace yourselves cobham shouted the horses were on top of them vast and high lances reaching the noise of the hooves and the rattle of mail overwhelming frenchmen were shouting victory as they leaned into the lunge now kill them cobham shouted the lances struck the shields and thomas was hurled back and a hoof thumped his shoulder but a man behind pushed him upright so he was forced hard against the enemy horse he had no room to use the sword and the shield was crushed against his side there was the stench of horse sweat and blood in his nostrils something struck his helmet making his skull ring and vision darken then miraculously the pressure was gone and he glimpsed a patch of daylight and staggered into it swinging the sword to where he thought the enemy was shield up a voice screamed and he instinctively obeyed only to have the shield battered down but his dazed vision was sharpening and he could see a brightcoloured trapper and a mailed foot in a big leather stirrup close to his left he rammed his sword through the trapper and into the horses guts and the beast twisted away thomas was dragged along by the trapped blade but managed to give it a violent tug that jerked it free so sharply that its recoil struck an english shield the charge had not broken the line but had broken against it like a sea wave striking a cliff the horses recoiled and the english menatarms advanced to hack at the horsemen who were relinquishing lances to draw their swords thomas was pushed aside by the menatarms he was panting dazed and sweatblinded his head was a blur of pain an archer was lying dead in front of him head crushed by a hoof why had the man no helmet then the menatarms were reeling back as more horsemen filed through the dead to thicken the fight all of them pushing towards the prince of waless high banner thomas banged his shield hard into a horses face felt a glancing blow on his sword and skewered the blade down the horses flank the rider was fighting a man on the other side of his horse and thomas saw a small gap between the saddles high pommel and the mans mail skirt and he shoved the sword up into the frenchmans belly heard the mans angry roar turn into a shriek then saw the horse was falling towards him he scrambled clear pushing a man out of his path before the horse collapsed in a crash of armour and beating hooves english menatarms swarmed over the dying beast going to meet the next enemy a horse with an iron garro deep in its haunch was rearing and striking with its hooves another horse tried to bite thomas and he struck it with the shield then flailed at its rider with his sword but the man wheeled away and thomas looked desperately for the next enemy no prisoners the earl screamed seeing a man trying to lead a frenchman out of the melee the earl had discarded his shield and was wielding his sword with both hands hacking it like a woodmans axe and daring any frenchman to come and challenge him they dared more and more horsemen pushed into the horror there seemed no end of them the sky was bright with flags and streaked with steel the grass was gouged by iron and slick with blood a frenchman rammed the bottom edge of his shield down onto an englishmans helmet wheeled the horse lunged a sword into an archers back wheeled again and struck down at the man still dazed by the shield blow montjoie saint den is he shouted saint george the earl of northampton visor up and face streaked with blood rammed his sword through a gap in a chanfron to take a horses eye the beast reared and its rider fell to be trampled by a horse behind the earl looked for the prince and could not see him then could not search more for a fresh conroi with white crosses on black shields was forging through the melee pushing friend and foe alike from their path as they carried their lances towards the princes standard thomas saw a baffled lance coming at him and he threw himself to the ground where he curled into a ball and let the heavy horses crash by montjoie saint denis the voices yelled above him as the count of astaracs conroi struck home sir guillaume devecque had seen nothing like it he hoped he never saw it again he saw a great army breaking itself against a line of men on foot it was true that the battle was not lost and sir guillaume had convinced himself it could yet be won but he was also aware of an unnatural sluggishness in himself he liked war he loved the release of battle he relished imposing his will on an enemy and he had ever profited from combat yet he suddenly knew he did not want to charge up the hill there was a doom in this place and he pushed that thought away and kicked his spurs back montjoie saint den is he shouted but knew he was just pretending the enthusiasm no one else in the charge seemed afflicted by doubts the knights were beginning to jostle each other as they strove to aim their lances at the english line very few arrows were flying now and none at all were coming from the chaos ahead where the prince of waless banner flew so high horsemen were now charging home all along the line hacking at the english ranks with swords and axe but more and more men were angling across the slope to join the fury on the english right it was there sir guillaume told himself that the battle would be won and the english broken it would be hard work of course and bloody work hacking through the princes troops but once the french horsemen were in the rear of the english line it would collapse like rotted wood and no amount of reinforcements from the top of the hill could stop that panicked rout so fight he told himself fight but there was still the nagging fear that he was riding into disaster he had never felt anything like it and he hated it cursing himself for being a coward a dismounted french knight his helmets facepiece torn away and blood dripping from a hand holding a broken sword while his other hand gripped the remnants of a shield that had been split into two staggered down the hill then dropped to his knees and vomited a riderless horse stirrups flapping galloped whiteeyed across the line of the charge with its torn trapper trailing in the grass the turf here was flecked by the white feathers of fallen arrows that looked like a field of flowers go go go sir guillaume shouted at his men and knew he was shouting at himself he would never tell men to go on a battlefield but to come to follow and he cursed himself for using the word and stared ahead looking for a victim for his lance and he watched for the pits and tried to ignore the melee that was just to his right he planned to widen the melee by boring into the english line where it was still lightly engaged die a hero he told himself carry the damned lance right up the hill and let no man ever say that sir guillaume devecque was a coward then a great cheer sounded from his right and he dared look there away from the pits he saw the prince of waless great banner was toppling into the struggling men the french were cheering and sir guillaumes gloom lifted magically for it was a french banner that pressed ahead going over the place where the princes flag had flown and then sir guillaume saw the banner he saw it and stared at it he saw a yale holding a cup and he pressed his knee to turn his horse and shouted at his men to follow him to war he shouted to kill and there was no more sluggishness and no more doubts for sir guillaume had found his enemy the king saw the enemy knights with the whitecrossed shields pierce his sons battle and then he watched his sons banner fall he could not see his sons black armour nothing showed on his face let me go the bishop of durham demanded the king brushed a horsefly from his horses neck pray for him he instructed the bishop what the hell use will prayer be the bishop demanded and hefted his fearful mace let me go sire i need you here the king said mildly and the boy must learn as i did i have other sons edward of england told himself though none like that one that son will be a great king one day a warrior king a scourge of our enemies if he lives and he must learn to live in the chaos and terror of battle you will stay he told the bishop firmly then beckoned a herald that badge he said pointing to the red banner with the yale whose is it the herald stared at the banner for a long time then frowned as if uncertain of his opinion well the king prompted him i havent seen it in sixteen years the herald said sounding dubious of his own judgement but i do believe its the badge of the vexille family sire the vexilles the king asked vexilles the bishop roared vexilles damned traitors they fled from france in your greatgrandfathers reign sire and he gave them land in cheshire then they sided with mortimer ah the king said half smiling so the vexilles had supported his mother and her lover mortimer who together had tried to keep him from the throne no wonder they fought well they were trying to avenge the loss of their cheshire estates the eldest son never left england the bishop said staring down at the widening struggle on the slope he had to raise his voice to be heard above the din of steel he was a strange fellow became a priest can you credit it an eldest son didnt like his father he claimed but we locked him up all the same on my orders the king asked you were very young sire so one of your council made sure the vexille priest couldnt cause trouble sealed him up in a monastery then beat and starved him till he was convinced he was holy after that he was harmless so they put him into a country parish to rot he must be dead by now the bishop frowned because the english line was bending backwards pushed by the conroi of vexille knights let me go down sire he pleaded i pray you let me take my men down i asked you to pray to god rather than to me i have a score of priests praying the bishop said and so do the french were deafening god with our prayers please sire i beg you the king relented go on foot he told the bishop and with only one conroi the bishop howled in triumph then slid awkwardly off his destriers back barratt he shouted to one of his menatarms bring your fellows come on the bishop hefted his wickedly spiked mace then ran down the hill bellowing at the french that the time of their death had come the herald counted the conroi that followed the bishop down the slope can twenty men make a difference sire he asked the king it will make small difference to my son the king said hoping his son yet lived but a great difference to the bishop i think i would have had an enemy in the church for ever if id not released him to his passion he watched as the bishop thrust the rear english ranks aside and still bellowing waded into the melee there was still no sign of the princes black armour nor of his standard the herald backed his palfrey away from the king who made the sign of the cross then twitched his rubyhilted sword to make certain the days earlier rain had not rusted the blade into the scabbards metal throat the weapon moved easily enough and he knew he might need it yet but for now he crossed his mailed hands on his saddles pommel and just watched the battle he would let his son win it he decided or else lose his son the herald stole a look at his king and saw that edward of englands eyes were closed the king was at prayer the battle had spread along the hill every part of the english line was engaged now though in most places the fighting was light the arrows had taken their toll but there was none left and so the french could ride right up to the dismounted menatarms some frenchmen tried to break through but most were content to shout insults in the hope of drawing a handful of the dismounted english out of the shield wall but the english discipline held they returned insult for insult inviting the french to come and die on their blades only where the prince of waless banner had flown was the fighting ferocious and there and for a hundred paces on either side the two armies had become inextricably tangled the english line had been torn but it had not been pierced its rear ranks still defended the hill while the front ranks had been scattered into the enemy where they fought against the surrounding horsemen the earls of northampton and warwick had tried to keep the line steady but the prince of wales had broken the formation by his eagerness to carry the fight to the enemy and the princes bodyguard were now down the slope near to the pits where so many horses lay with broken legs it was there that guy vexille had lanced the princes standardbearer so that the great flag with its hues and leopards and gilded fringe was being trampled by the ironshod hoofs of his conroi thomas was twenty yards away curled into the bloody belly of a dead horse and flinching every time another destrier trod near him noise overwhelmed him but through the shrieks and hammering he could hear english voices still shouting defiance and he lifted his head to see will skeat with father hobbe a handful of archers and two menatarms defending themselves against french horsemen thomas was tempted to stay in his bloodreeking haven but he forced himself to scramble over the horses body and run to skeats side a french sword glanced off his helmet he bounced off the rump of a horse then stumbled into the small group still alive lad skeat said jesus thomas swore he aint interested come on you bastard come on skeat was calling to a frenchman but the enemy preferred to carry his unbroken lance towards the battle raging about the fallen standard theyre still coming skeat said in tones of wonderment no end to the goddamn bastards an archer in the princes green and white livery without a helmet and bleeding from a deep shoulder wound lurched towards skeats group a frenchman saw him casually wheeled his horse and chopped down with a battleaxe the bastard sam said and before skeat could stop him he ran from the group and leaped up onto the back of the frenchmans horse he put an arm round the knights neck then simply fell backwards dragging the man from the high saddle two enemy menatarms tried to intervene but the victims horse was in their way protect him skeat shouted and led his group to where sam was beating fists at the frenchmans armour skeat pushed sam away lifted the frenchmans breastplate just enough to let a sword enter then slid his blade into the mans chest bastard skeat said got no right to kill archers bastard he twisted the sword rammed it in further then yanked it free sam lifted the battleaxe and grinned proper weapon he said then turned as the two wouldbe rescuers came riding in bastards bastards sam shouted as he chopped the axe at the nearer horse skeat and one of the menatarms were flailing swords at the other beast thomas tried to protect them with his shield as he stabbed up at the frenchman and felt his sword deflected by shield or armour then the two horses both bleeding wheeled away stay together skeat saids tay together watch our backs tom thomas did not answer tom skeat shouted but thomas had seen the lance there were thousands of lances on the field but most of them were painted in spiralling colours and this one was black warped and feeble it was the lance of saint george that had hung in the cobwebs of his childhood nave and now it was being used as the pole of a standard and the flag that hung from the silver blade was red as blood and embroidered with a silver yale his heart lurched the lance was here all the mysteries he had tried so hard to avoid were on this battlefield the vexilles were here his fathers killer was probably here tom skeat shouted again thomas just pointed at the flag i have to kill them dont be a fool tom skeat said then whipped back as a horseman crashed in from the lower slope the man tried to veer away from the group of infantry but father hobbe the only man still carrying a bow thrust the weapon into the horses front legs tangling them and snapping the bow the horse collapsed with a crash by their side and sam whacked the axe into the screaming knights spine vexille thomas shouted as loud as he could vexille lost his bloody head skeat said to father hobbe he hasnt the priest said he was without a weapon now but when sam had finished chopping his new axe through mail and leather the priest took the dead frenchmans falchion that he hefted appreciatively vexille vexille thomas screamed one of the knights about the yale standard heard the shout and turned his pigsnouted helmet it seemed to thomas that the man stared at him through the snouts eyeslits for a long time though it could only have been for a heartbeat or two because the man was assailed by footmen he was defending himself skilfully his horse dancing the battle steps to keep itself from being hamstrung but the rider beat down one englishmans sword and slashed his left spur across the face of the other before turning the quick horse and killing the first man with a lunge of his sword the second man reeled away and the pigsnouted knight turned and trotted straight at thomas asking for bloody trouble skeat growled but went to thomass side the knight swerved at the last moment and beat down with his sword thomas parried and was shocked by the force of the mans blow that stung his shield arm to his shoulder the horse was gone turned came back and the knight beat at him again skeat lunged at the horse but the destrier had a mail coat under its trapper and the sword slid away thomas parried again and was half beaten to his knees then the horseman was three paces away the destrier was swivelling fast and the knight raised his sword hand and pushed up his pigsnout and thomas saw it was sir simon jekyll anger rose in thomas like bile and ignoring skeats warning shout he ran forward sword swinging sir simon parried the blow with contemptuous ease the trained horse sidestepped delicately and sir simons blade was coming back fast thomas had to twist aside and even so fast as he was the blade clanged against his helmet with stunning force this time youll die sir simon said and he lunged with the blade thrusting with killing force on thomass mailclad chest but thomas had tripped on a corpse and was already falling backwards the lunge pushed him down faster and he sprawled on his back his head spinning from the blow to his helmet there was no one to help him any more for he had dashed away from skeats group that was defending itself against a new rush of horsemen thomas tried to stand but a pain ripped at his head and he was winded by the blow to his chest then sir simon was leaning down from his saddle and his long sword was seeking thomass unprotected face goddamn bastard sir simon said then opened his mouth wide as though he was yawning he stared at thomas then spewed a stream of blood that spattered thomass face a lance had gone clean through sir simons side and thomas shaking the blood from his eyes saw that a frenchman had thrust the blue and yellow lance a horseman only the french were mounted but thomas had seen the horseman let go of the lance that was hanging from sir simons side and now the englishman eyes rolling was swaying in his saddle choking and dying then thomas saw the trappers of the horsemen who had swept past him they showed yellow hawks on a blue field thomas staggered to his feet sweet christ he thought but he had to learn how to fight with a sword a bow was not enough sir guillaumes men were past him now cutting into the vexille conroi will skeat shouted at thomas to come back but he stubbornly followed sir guillaumes men frenchman was fighting frenchman the vexilles had almost broken the english line but now they had to defend their backs while english menatarms tried to haul them from their saddles vexille vexille sir guillaume shouted not knowing which visored man was his enemy he beat again and again on a mans shield bending him back in his saddle then he chopped the sword down on the horses neck and the beast dropped and an englishman a priest was slashing the fallen knights head with a falchion a flash of rearing colour made sir guillaume look to his right the prince of waless banner had been rescued and raised he looked back to find vexille but saw only a halfdozen horsemen with white crosses on their black shields he spurred towards them raised his own shield to fend off an axe blow and lunged his sword into a mans thigh twisted it clear felt a blow on his back turned the horse with his knee and parried a high sword blow men were shouting at him demanding to know why he fought his own side then the vexilles standardbearer began to topple as his horse was hamstrung two archers were slashing at the beasts legs and the silver yale fell into the melee as henry colley let go of the old lance to draw his sword bastards he shouted at the men who had hamstrung his horse bastards he slashed the blade down hacking into a mans mailed shoulder then a great roar made him turn to see a heavy man in plate and mail and with a crucifix about his neck wielding a mace colley still on his collapsing horse swung at the bishop who hammered the sword away with his shield and then slammed the mace down onto colleys helmet in the name of god the bishop roared as he dragged the spikes free of the mangled helmet colley was dead his skull crushed and the bishop swung the bloody mace at a horse with a yellow and blue trapper but the rider swerved at the last instant sir guillaume never saw the bishop with his mace instead he had seen that one of the vexille conroi had finer armour than the others and he raked back his spurs to reach that man but felt his own horse faltering and he looked behind to glimpse through the constricting slits in his visor that englishmen were hacking at his horses rear legs he beat the swords back but the animal was sinking down and a huge voice was shouting clear my way i want to kill the bastard in the name of christ out of the way sir guillaume did not understand the words but suddenly an arm was around his neck and he was being hauled out of the saddle he shouted in anger then had the breath driven from him as he thumped onto the ground a man was holding him down and sir guillaume tried to hit him with his sword but his wounded horse was thrashing beside him threatening to roll on him and sir guillaumes assailant dragged him free then twisted the frenchmans sword away just lie there a voice shouted at sir guillaume is the goddamned bastard dead the bishop roared hes dead thomas shouted praise god on on kill thomas sir guillaume squirmed dont move thomas said i want vexille theyve gone thomas shouted theyve gone lie still guy vexille assailed from two sides and with his red banner fallen had pulled his three remaining men back but only to join the last of the french horsemen the king himself with his friend the king of bohemia was entering the melee although john of bohemia was blind he had insisted on fighting and so his bodyguard had tied their horses reins together and put the kings destrier in their centre so that he could not lose them prague they shouted their war cry prague the kings son prince charles was also tied into the group prague he shouted as the bohemian knights led the last charge except it was not a charge but a blundering advance through a tangle of corpses and thrashing bodies and terrified horses the prince of wales still lived the gold fillet had been half cut from his helmet and the top edge of his shield had been split in a halfdozen places but now he led the countercharge and a hundred men went with him snarling and screaming wanting nothing else but to maul this last enemy who came in the dying light to the killing place where so many frenchmen had died the earl of northampton who had been mustering the rearward ranks of the princes battle to keep them in line sensed that the battle had turned the vast pressure against the english menatarms had weakened and though the french were trying again their best men were bloodied or dead and the new ones were coming too slowly and so he shouted at his footmen to follow him just kill them he shouted just kill them archers menatarms and even hobelars who had come from their place inside the wagon circles that protected the guns on the flanks of the line swarmed at the french to thomas crouching beside sir guillaume it was like the mindless rage at the bridge of caen all over again this was madness released a bloodcrazed madness but the french would suffer for it the english had endured deep into the long summer evening and they wanted revenge for the terror of watching the big horses come at them and so they clawed and beat and slashed at the royal horsemen the prince of wales led them fighting beside archers and menatarms hacking down horses and butchering their riders in a frenzy of blood the king of majorca died and the count of saint pol and the duke of lorraine and the count of flanders then bohemias flag with its three white feathers fell and the blind king was dragged down to be butchered by axes maces and swords a kings ransom died with the king and his son bled to death on his fathers body as his bodyguard hampered by the dead horses that were still tied to the living beasts were slaughtered one after the other by englishmen no longer shouting a war cry but screaming in a howling frenzy like lost souls they were streaked with blood stained and spattered and soaked in it but the blood was french the prince of wales cursed the dying bohemians blaming them for barring his approach to the french king whose blue and gold banner still flew two english menatarms were hacking at the kings horse the royal bodyguard was spurring to kill them more men in english livery were running to bring philip down and the prince wanted to be there to be the man who took the enemy king captive but one of the bohemian horses dying lurched on its side and the prince was still wearing his spurs and one of them became caught in the dying horses trapper the prince lurched was trapped and it was then that guy vexille saw the black armour and the royal surcoat and the broken fillet of gold and saw too that the prince was unbalanced amidst the dying horses so guy vexille turned and charged thomas saw vexille turn he could not reach the charging horseman with his sword for that would mean clambering over the same horses where the prince was trapped but under his right hand was a black ash shaft tipped with silver and he snatched up the lance and ran at the charging man skeat was there too scrambling over the bohemian horses with his old sword the lance of saint george struck guy vexille on the chest the silver blade crumpled and tangled with the crimson banner but the old ash shaft had just enough strength to knock the horseman back and keep his sword from the prince who was being pulled free by two of his menatarms vexille hacked again reaching far from his saddle and will skeat bellowed at him and thrust his sword hard up at vexilles waist but the black shield deflected the lunge and vexilles trained horse instinctively turned into the attack and the rider slashed down hard no thomas shouted he thrust the lance again but it was a feeble weapon and the dry ash splintered against vexilles shield will skeat was sinking blood showing at the ragged gash in his helmet vexille raised his sword to strike at skeat a second time as thomas stumbled forward the sword fell slicing into skeats head then the blank mask of vexilles dark visor swung towards thomas will skeat was on the ground not moving vexilles horse turned to bring its master to where he could kill most efficiently and thomas saw death in the frenchmans bright sword but then in panicked desperation he rammed the broken end of the black lance into the destriers open mouth and gouged the ragged wood deep into the animals tongue the stallion sheered away screaming and rearing and vexille was thrown hard against his saddles cantle the horse eyes white behind its chanfron and mouth dripping blood turned back to thomas but the prince of wales had been freed from the dying horse and he brought two menatarms to attack vexilles other flank and the horseman parried the princes sword blow then saw he must be overwhelmed and so drove back his spurs to take his horse through the melee and away from danger calix meus inebrians thomas shouted he did not know why the words just came to him his fathers dying words but they made vexille look back he stared through the eye slits saw the darkhaired man who was holding his own banner then a new surge of vengeful englishmen spilled down the slope and he pricked his horse through the carnage and the dying men and the broken dreams of france a cheer sounded from the english hilltop the king had ordered his mounted reserve of knights to charge the french and as those men lowered their lances still more horses were being hurried from the baggage park so that more men could mount and pursue the beaten enemy john of hainault lord of beaumont took the french kings reins and dragged philip away from the melee the horse was a remount for one royal horse had already been killed while the king himself had taken a wound in the face because he had insisted on fighting with his visor up so that his men would know he was on the field it is time to go sire the lord of beaumont said gently is it over philip asked there were tears in his eyes and incredulity in his voice its over sire the lord of beaumont said the english were howling like dogs and the chivalry of france was twitching and bleeding on a hillside john of hainault did not know how it had happened only that the battle the oriflamme and the pride of france were all lost come sire he said and dragged the kings horse away groups of french knights their horses trappers rattling with arrows were crossing the valley to the far woods that were dark with the coming night that astrologer john the french king said sire have him put to death bloodily you hear me bloodily the king was weeping as with the handful of his bodyguard that was left he rode away more and more frenchmen were fleeing to seek safety in the gathering dark and their retreat turned into a gallop as the first english horsemen of the battle burst through the remnants of their battered line to begin the pursuit the english slope seemed to twitch as the men at arms wandered among the wounded and dead the twitching was the jerking of the dying men and horses the valley floor was scattered with the genoese who had been killed by their own paymasters it was suddenly very quiet there was no clang of steel no hoarse shouts and no drums there were moans and weeping and sometimes a gasp but it seemed quiet the wind stirred the fallen banners and flickered the white feathers of the fallen arrows that had reminded sir guillaume of a spread of flowers and it was over sir william skeat lived he could not speak there was no life in his eyes and he seemed deaf he could not walk though he seemed to try when thomas lifted him but then his legs crumpled and he sagged to the bloody ground father hobbe lifted skeats helmet away doing it with an extraordinary gentleness blood poured from skeats grey hair and thomas gagged when he saw the sword cut in the scalp there were scraps of skull strands of hair and skeats brain all open to the air will thomas knelt in front of him will skeat looked at him but did not seem to see him he had a half smile and empty eyes will thomas said hes going to die thomas father hobbe said softly he is not goddamn it he is not you hear me he will live you bloody pray for him i will pray god knows how i will pray father hobbe soothed thomas but first we must doctor him eleanor helped she washed will skeats scalp then she and father hobbe laid scraps of broken skull like pieces of shattered tile afterwards eleanor tore a strip of cloth from her blue dress and gently bound the strip about will skeats skull tying it beneath his chin so that when it was done he looked like an old woman in a scarf he had said nothing as eleanor and the priest bandaged him and if he had felt any pain it did not show on his face drink will thomas said and held out a water bottle taken from a dead frenchman but skeat ignored the offer eleanor took the bottle and held it to his mouth but the water just spilled down his chin it was dark by then sam and jake had made a fire using a battleaxe to chop french lances for fuel will skeat just sat by the flames he breathed but nothing else i have seen it before sir guillaume told thomas he had hardly spoken since the battle but now sat beside thomas he had watched his daughter tend skeat and he had accepted food and drink from her but he had shrugged away her conversation will he recover thomas asked sir guillaume shrugged i saw a man cut through the skull he lived another four years but only because the sisters in the abbaye looked after him he will live thomas said sir guillaume lifted one of skeats hands held it for a few seconds then let it drop maybe he sounded sceptical you were fond of him hes like a father thomas said fathers die sir guillaume said bleakly he looked drained like a man who had turned his sword against his own king and failed in his duty he will live thomas said stubbornly sleep sir guillaume said i will watch him thomas slept among the dead in the battle line where the wounded moaned and the night wind stirred the white feathers flecking the valley will skeat was no different in the morning he just sat eyes vacant gazing at nothing and stinking because he had fouled himself i shall find the earl father hobbe said and have him send will back to england the army stirred itself sluggishly forty english menatarms and as many archers were buried in crecys church yard but the hundreds of french corpses all but for the great princes and noblest lords were left on the hill the folk of crecy could bury them if they wished edward of england did not care father hobbe looked for the earl of northampton but two thousand french infantry had arrived just after dawn coming to reinforce an army that had already been broken and in the misty light they had thought the mounted men who greeted them were friends and then the horsemen dropped their visors couched their lances and put back their spurs the earl led them most of the english knights had been denied a chance to fight on horseback in the previous days battle but now this sunday morning theyd been given their moment and the great destriers had torn bloody gaps in the marching ranks then wheeled to cut the survivors into ragged terror the french had fled pursued by the implacable horsemen who had cut and thrust until their arms were weary with the killing back on the hill between crecy and wadicourt a pile of enemy banners was gathered the flags were torn and some were still damp with blood the oriflamme was carried to edward who folded it and ordered the priests to give thanks his son lived the battle was won and all christendom would know how god favoured the english cause he declared he would spend this one day on the field to mark the victory then march on his army was still tired but it had boots now and it would be fed cattle were roaring as archers slaughtered them and more archers were bringing food from the hill where the french army had abandoned its supplies other men were plucking arrows from the field and tying them into sheaves while their women plundered the dead the earl of northampton came back to crecys hill roaring and grinning like slaughtering sheep he exulted then roamed up and down the line trying to relive the excitements of the last two days he stopped by thomas and grinned at the archers and their women you look different young thomas he said happily but then looked down and saw will skeat sitting like a child with his head bound by the blue scarf will the earl said in puzzlement sir william skeat just sat he was cut through the skull my lord thomas said the earls bombast fled like air from a pricked bladder he slumped in his saddle shaking his head no he protested no not will he still had a bloody sword in his hand but now he wiped the blade through the mane of his horse and pushed it into the scabbard i was going to send him back to brittany he said will he live no one answered will the earl called then clumsily dismounted from the clinging saddle he crouched by the yorkshireman will talk to me will he must go to england my lord father hobbe said of course the earl said no thomas said the earl frowned at him no there is a doctor in caen my lord thomas spoke in french now and i would take him there this doctor works miracles my lord the earl smiled sadly caen is in french hands again thomas he said and i doubt theyll welcome you he will be welcome sir guillaume said and the earl noticed the frenchman and his unfamiliar livery for the first time he is a prisoner my lord thomas explained but also a friend we serve you so his ransom is yours but he alone can take will to caen is it a large ransom the earl asked vast thomas said then your ransom sir the earl spoke to sir guillaume is will skeats life he stood and took his horses reins from an archer then turned back to thomas the boy looked different he thought looked like a man he had cut his hair that was it chopped it anyway and he looked like a soldier now like a man who could lead archers into battle i want you in the spring thomas he said therell be archers to lead and if will cant do it then you must look after him now but in the spring youll serve me again you hear yes my lord i hope your doctor can work miracles the earl said then he walked on sir guillaume had understood the things that had been said in french but not the rest and now he looked at thomas we go to caen he asked we take will to doctor mordecai thomas said and after that i go to the earl thomas said curtly sir guillaume flinched and vexille what of him what of him thomas asked brutally hes lost his damned lance he looked at father hobbe and spoke in english is my penance done father father hobbe nodded he had taken the broken lance from thomas and entrusted it to the kings confessor who had promised that the relic would be taken to westminster you have done your penance the priest said sir guillaume spoke no english but he must have understood father hobbes tone for he gave thomas a hurt look vexille still lives he said he killed your father and my family even god wants him dead there were tears in sir guillaumes eye would you leave me as broken as the lance he asked thomas what would you have me do thomas demanded find vexille kill him he spoke fiercely but thomas said nothing he has the grail the frenchman insisted we dont know that thomas said angrily god and christ he thought but spare me i can be an archers leader i can go to caen and let mordecai work his miracle and then lead skeats men into battle we can win for god for will for the king and for england he turned on the frenchman i am an english archer he said harshly not a knight of the round table sir guillaume smiled tell me thomas he said gently was your father the eldest or a younger son thomas opened his mouth he was about to say that of course father ralph had been a younger son then realized he did not know his father had never said and that meant that perhaps his father had hidden the truth as he had hidden so many things think hard my lord sir guillaume said pointedly think hard and remember the harlequin maimed your friend and the harle quin lives i am an english archer thomas thought and i want nothing more but god wants more he thought but he did not want that burden it was enough that the sun shone on summer fields on white feathers and dead men and that hookton was avenged historical note only two actions in the book are pure invention the initial attack on hookton though the french did make many such landings on the english coast and the fight between sir simon jekylls knights and the menatarms under sir geoffrey de pont blanc outside la rochederrien other than those all the sieges battles and skirmishes are lifted from history as was sir geoffreys death in lannion la rochederrien fell to escalade rather than an attack from its riverside but i wanted to give thomas something to do so took liberties with the earl of northamptons achievement the earl did all that he is credited with in the novel the capture of la rochederrien the successful crossing of the somme at blanchetaque ford as well as his exploits in the battle of crecy the capture and sack of caen happened very much as described in the novel as did the famous battle of crecy it was in brief an horrific and terrifying period of history which is now recognized as the beginning of the hundred years war i thought when i began reading for and researching the novel that i would be much concerned with chivalry courtesy and knightly gallantry those things must have existed but not on these battlefields which were brutal unforgiving and vicious the books epigraph quoted from king jean ii of france serves as a corrective many deadly battles have been fought people slaughtered churches robbed souls destroyed young women and virgins deflowered respectable wives and widows dishonoured towns manors and buildings burned and robberies cruelties and ambushes committed on the highways those words written some fourteen years after the battle of crecy justified the reasons why king jean was surrendering almost a third of french territory to the english the humiliation was preferable to a continuation of such ghastly and horrid warfare setpiece battles like crecy were comparatively rare in the long anglofrench wars perhaps because they were so utterly destructive though the casualty figures for crecy show that it was the french who suffered and not the english losses are hard to compute but at a minimum the french lost two thousand men and the figure was probably nearer four thousand most of them knights and menatarms the genoese losses were very high and at least half of them were killed by their own side the english losses were paltry perhaps fewer than a hundred most of the credit must go to the english archers but even when the french did break through the screen of arrows they lost heavily a horseman who had lost the momentum of the charge and was unsupported by other horsemen was easy prey to footmen and so the cavalry of france was butchered in the melee after the battle when the french were seeking explanations for their loss they blamed the genoese and there were massacres of genoese mercenaries in many french towns but the real french mistake was to attack in a hurry late on the saturday afternoon instead of waiting until sunday when they could have arranged their army more carefully and having made the decision to attack they then lost discipline and so threw away their first wave of horsemen and the remnants of that charge obstructed the better conducted second wave there has been a great deal of discussion about the english dispositions in the battle most of it centring on where the archers were placed most historians place them on the english wings but i have followed robert hardys suggestion that they were arrayed all along the line as well as on the wings when it comes to matters about bows archers and their exploits mr hardy is a good man to heed battles were rare but the chevauchee an expedition that set out deliberately to waste the enemys territory was common it was of course economic warfare the fourteenthcentury equivalent of carpet bombing contemporaries describing the french countryside after the passage of an english chevauchee recorded that france was overwhelmed and trampled under foot that it was on the verge of utter ruin or tormented and warravaged no chivalry there little gallantry and less courtesy france would eventually recover and expel the english from france but only after she had learned to cope with the chevauchee and more importantly the english and welsh archers the word longbow does not appear in the novel for that word was not used in the fourteenth century it is for the same reason that edward of woodstock the prince of wales is not called the black prince a later coinage the bow was simply that the bow or perhaps the great bow or the war bow much ink has been wasted discussing the origins of the longbow whether it is welsh or english a medieval invention or stretching back to the neolithic but the salient fact is that it had emerged in the years leading up to the hundred years war as a battlewinning weapon what made it so effective was the number of bowmen who could be assembled in an army one or two longbows might do damage but thousands would destroy an army and the english alone in europe were capable of assembling those numbers why the technology could not be simpler yet still other countries did not produce archers part of the answer is surely in the great difficulty it took to become an expert archer it needed hours and years of practice and the habit of such practice took hold in only some english and welsh regions there had probably been such experts in britain since the neolithic yew bows as long as the ones used at crecy have been found in neolithic graves but equally probably there were only a few experts but for some reason or another the middle ages saw a popular enthusiasm for the pursuit of archery in parts of england and wales that led to the rise of the longbow as a mass weapon of war and certainly once that enthusiasm waned then the bow quickly disappeared from the english arsenal common wisdom has it that the longbow was replaced by the gun but it is more true to say that the longbow withered despite the gun benjamin franklin no fool reckoned the american rebels would have won their war much more swiftly had they been practised longbowmen and it is quite certain that a battalion of archers could have outshot and beaten easily a battalion of wellingtons veterans armed with smoothbore muskets but a gun or crossbow was much easier to master than a longbow the longbow in brief was a phenomenon probably fed by a popular craze for archery that translated into a battlewinning weapon for englands kings it also raised the status of the infantryman as even the dullest english nobleman came to realize that his life depended on archers and it is no wonder that archers outnumbered menatarms in the english armies of the period i have to record an enormous debt to jonathan sumption author of trial hy battle the hundred years war volume i it is a rank offence to fulltime authors like myself that a man who successfully practices as a lawyer can write such superb books in what is presumably hiss pare time but i am grateful he did so and recommend his history to anyone who wishes to learn more of the period any mistakes that remain are entirely my own
