robin cook toxin this book is dedicated to those families who have suffered from the scourge of e coli h and other foodborne illnesses i would like to acknowledge bruce berman for his suggestions at the outset of this project as well as his insightful critique of the outline for toxin nikki fox for sharing with me her extensive research on foodborne illness ron savenor for helping me overcome a particular barrier in my own research and jean reeds for her invaluable comments and suggestions on the work in progress prologue january th the sky was an immense inverted bowl of gray clouds that arched from one flat horizon to the other it was the kind of sky that hovered over the american midwest in the summer the ground would be awash in a sea of corn and soybeans but now in the depths of winter it was a frozen stubble with patches of dirty snow and a few lonely leafless skeletonized trees the leaden clouds had excreted a lazy drizzle all day more of a mist than a rain but by two oclock the precipitation had abated and the single functioning windshield wiper of the aged recycled ups delivery van was no longer necessary as the vehicle negotiated a rutted dirt road what did old man oakly say bart winslow asked bart was the driver of the van he and his partner willy brown sitting in the passenger seat were in their fifties and could have been mistaken for brothers their creased leather faces bore witness to a lifetime of labor on the farm both were dressed in soiled and tattered overalls over layered sweatshirts and both were chewing tobacco benton oakly didnt say much willy answered after wiping some spittle off his chin with the back of his hand just said one of his cows woke up sick how sick bart asked i guess sick enough to be a downer willy said has the runs bad bart and willy had evolved over the years from mere farmhands to become what the local farmers referred to as d men it was their job to go around and pick up dead dying diseased and disabled farm animals particularly cows and take them to the rendering plant it wasnt a coveted job but it suited bart and willy just fine the van turned at a rusted mailbox and followed a muddy road that ran between barbedwire fences a mile beyond the road opened up at a small farm bart drove the van up to the barn made a threepoint turn and backed the vehicle to the open barn door by the time bart and willy had climbed from the truck benton oakly had appeared afternoon benton said he was as laconic as bart and willy something about the landscape made people not want to talk benton was a tall thin man with bad teeth he kept his distance from ban and willy as did his dog shep shep had been barking until ban and willy got out of the truck with his nose twitching from the scent of death shep shrank back behind his master in the barn benton said he motioned with his hand before leading his visitors into the depths of the dark barn stopping at a pen he pointed over the rail bart and willy ventured to the edge of the pen and looked in they wrinkled their noses the area reeked of fresh manure within the pen an obviously sick cow was lying in its own diarrhea raising its wobbly head she gazed back at bart and willy one of her pupils was the color of gray marble whats with the eye willy asked been that way since she was a calf benton said got poked or something she only been sick since this morning bart asked thats right benton said but shes been down on her milk for almost a month i want her outa here before my other cows get the runs well take her all right bart said is it still twentyfive bucks to haul her to the renderer benton asked yup willy said but can we hose her off before putting her in the truck be my guest benton said theres hose right over there against the wall willy went to get the hose while bart opened the gate to the pen trying to be careful where he put his feet bart gave the cow a few swats on its rump reluctantly it rose to its feet and tottered willy came back with the hose and squirted the cow until it looked relatively clean then he and bart got behind the cow and coaxed it out of the pen with added help from benton they got the animal outside and into the van willy closed the trucks back door whatd ya got in there about four head benton asked yup willy said all four dead this morning theres some kind of infection over at the silverton farm criminy benton said with alarm he slapped a few wrinkled greenbacks into barts palm get them the hell off my spread bart and willy both spat as they rounded their respective sides of the truck the tired engine let out a belch of black smoke before propelling the vehicle out of the farm as was their habit bart and willy didnt speak again until the truck reached the pavement of the county road bart accelerated and finally got the van into fourth gear you thinkin what im thinkin bart asked i imagine willy said that cow didnt look half bad after we hosed her down hell it looks a mite bettern that one we sold to the slaughterhouse last week and it can stand and even walk a little bart said willy glanced at his watch just about the right time too the d men did not speak again until they pulled off the county road onto the track that ran around a lowslung almost windowless large commercial building a billboardsized sign said higgins and hancock at the rear of the building was an empty stockyard that was a sea of trampled mud you wait here bart said as he pulled to a stop near the chute that lead from the stockyard into the factory bart got out of the van and disappeared down the chute willy got out and leaned up against the vans rear door five minutes later bart reappeared with two burly men dressed in bloodstained long white coats yellow plastic construction helmets and yellow midcalf rubber boots both sported a nametag the heavier mans nametag said jed street supervisor the other mans said salvatore morano quality control jed had a clipboard bart gestured to willy and willy unlatched the vans rear door and opened it salvatore and jed covered their noses and peered inside the sick cow raised its head jed turned to bart can the animal stand sure can she can even walk a little jed looked at salvatore what do you think sal wheres the sme inspector salvatore asked where do you think jed said hes in the locker room where he goes as soon as he thinks the last animal has come through salvatore lifted the tail of his white coat to get at a twoway radio attached to his belt he switched it on and held it up to his lips gary did that last combo bin thats going to mercer meats get filled the answer came back accompanied by static almost okay salvatore said into the radio were sending in one more animal that will more than do it salvatore switched off his radio and looked at jed lets do it jed nodded and turned to bart looks like you got a deal but as i said well only pay fifty bucks bart nodded fifty bucks is okay while bart and willy climbed into the back of the van salvatore walked back down the chute from his pocket he pulled out a couple of earplugs that he put in his ears as he entered the slaughterhouse his mind was no longer concerned about the sick cow he was concerned about the myriad forms he still had to fill out before he could think of going home with his earplugs in place salvatore wasnt troubled by the noise as he traversed the killfloor area of the slaughterhouse he approached mark watson the line supervisor and got his attention we got one more animal coming through salvatore yelled over the din but its only for boneless beef therell be no carcass got it mark made a circle with his thumb and index finger to indicate he understood salvatore then passed through the soundproof door that led into the administrative area of the building entering his office he hung up his bloodied coat and construction helmet he sat down at his desk and went back to his daily forms concentrating as hard as he was salvatore wasnt sure how much time had passed when jed suddenly appeared at his door we got a slight problem jed said now what salvatore asked the head of that downer cow fell off the rail did any of the inspectors see it salvatore asked no jed said theyre all in the locker room with the sme for their daily chitchat then put the head back on the rail and hose it off okay jed said i thought you should know absolutely salvatore said to cover our asses ill even fill out a process deficiency report whats the lot and head number of that animal jed looked down at his clipboard lot thirtysix head fiftyseven got it salvatore said jed left salvatores office and returned to the kill floor he tapped josé on the shoulder josé was a sweeper whose job it was to sweep all the filth from the floor into one of the many grates josé had not been working there very long it was a chronic problem keeping sweepers because of the nature of the job josé didnt speak much english and jeds spanish wasnt much better so he was reduced to communicating by crude gestures jed motioned that he wanted josé to help manuel one of the skinners to heft the skinned cows head from the floor onto one of the hooks on the moving overhead rail eventually josé caught on luckily josé and manuel could communicate without difficulty because the job required two steps and significant effort first they had to get the hundredpluspound head up onto the metal catwalk then after climbing up there themselves they had to hoist the head up high enough to secure it on one of the moving hooks jed gave a thumbsup sign to the two panting men who at the last second had almost dropped their slippery burden jed then trained a jet of water on the soiled skinless head as it moved along on the rail even to the hardened jed the appearance of the cataractous eye gave the skinned head a gruesome aura but he was pleased with how much of the filth came off with the highpressure water and by the time the head passed through the aperture in the killfloor wall on its way into the headboning room it looked relatively clean one friday january th the sterling place mall was aglow with the marble bright brass and polished wood of its upscale shops tiffany competed with cartier neimanmarcus with saks mozarts piano concerto number was piped in through hidden speakers beautiful people milled about on this late friday afternoon in their gucci shoes and armani coats to survey the offerings of the postchristmas sales under normal circumstances kelly anderson wouldnt have minded spending a part of the afternoon at the mall as a tv journalist it was a far cry from the gritty beats she was usually assigned around the city while putting together indepth pieces for the six or eleven oclock news but on this particular friday the mall had not provided kelly with what she wanted this is a joke kelly said irritably she looked up and down the expansive hall for a likely candidate to interview but no one looked promising i think weve gotten enough brian said brian washington a lanky laidback africanamerican was kellys cameraman of choice in her mind he was the best wene had to offer and kelly had maneuvered cajoled and even used threats to get the station to assign him to her kelly puffed up her cheeks before blowing out her breath in an expression of exasperation like hell weve got enough she said weve got diddlysquat at thirtyfour kelly anderson was a nononsense intelligent aggressive woman hoping to break into national news most people thought she had a good chance if she could find a story that would catapult her into the spotlight she looked the pan with her sharp features and lively eyes framed by a helmet of tight blond curls to add to her professional image she dressed fashionably and tastefully and groomed herself impeccably kelly transferred her microphone to her right hand so that she could see her watch and to make matters worse were running out of time im going to have to pick up my daughter her skating lessons over thats cool brian said he lowered his camcorder from his shoulder and unplugged the power source i should get my daughter from day care kelly bent down and stowed her microphone in her sizable shoulder bag then helped brian break down the equipment like a couple of experienced pack rats they hoisted everything over their shoulders and started walking toward the center of the mall whats becoming obvious kelly said is that people dont give a damn about americares merger of the samaritan hospital and the university med center unless theyve had to go to the hospital during the last six months its not an easy subject to get people fired up about brian said its not criminal sexy or scandalous and there are no celebrities involved they ought to be concerned kelly said with disgust hey what people ought to do and what they actually do has never been related brian said you know that all i know is that i shouldnt have scheduled this piece for tonights eleven oclock news kelly said im desperate tell me how to make it sexy if i knew that id be the talent rather than the cameraman brian said with a laugh emerging from one of the radiating corridors of the sterling place mall kelly and brian arrived at the spacious epicenter in the middle of this vast area and beneath a threestoryhigh skylight was an oval skating rink its frosted surface glowed under the glare of klieg lights dotted around the rink were a dozen or so children along with several adults all were careening across the ice in various directions the apparent chaos resulted from the recent conclusion of the intermediate lesson and the imminent commencement of the advanced lesson seeing her daughters bright red outfit kelly waved and called out caroline anderson waved back but took her time skating over caroline was very much her mothers daughter she was bright athletic and willful shake a leg chicken kelly said when caroline finally neared i gotta get you home moms got a deadline and a major problem caroline stepped out of the rink and walking on the toes of her figureskate blades she moved to the bench and sat down i want to go to the onion ring for a burger im starved thats going to be up to your father sweetie kelly said come on chop chop kelly bent down and got carolines shoes out of her knapsack and put them on the bench next to her daughter now theres one hell of a skater brian said kelly straightened up and shielded her eyes with her hand from the bright lights where in the center brian said pointing in the pink outfit kelly looked where brian indicated and it was immediately apparent whom he was referring to a girl around the same age as caroline was going through a warmup exercise that had now caused some of the shoppers to pause and watch whoa kelly said she is good she looks almost professional shes not that good caroline said as she gritted her teeth in an attempt to pull off one of her skates she looks good to me kelly said who is she her name is becky reggis having given up trying to yank off her skate caroline was back to loosening the laces she was the junior state champion last year as if sensing she was being watched the girl then executed two double axels in a row before arcing around the end of the rink heel to heel a number of the shoppers broke out in spontaneous applause shes fantastic kelly said yeah well shes been invited to the nationals this year caroline reluctantly added hmmm kelly murmured she looked at brian there could be a story there brian shrugged maybe for the six oclock certainly not for the eleven kelly redirected her attention to the skater her last name is reggis huh yup caroline said she had both skates off now and was looking in her knapsack for her shoes could that be dr kim reggiss daughter kelly asked i know her fathers a doctor caroline said how do you know kelly asked she goes to my school caroline said shes a year ahead of me well bingo kelly murmured this must be serendipity calling i recognize that beady look in your eye brian said youre like a cat ready to pounce youre plotting something i cant find my shoes caroline complained i just had a brainstorm kelly said she picked up carolines shoes from the bench and put them in her daughters lap dr kim reggis would be perfect for this merger story he was chief of cardiac surgery at the samaritan before the merger and then bang he became one of the indians id bet hed have something saucy and sexy to say no doubt brian said but would he talk to you he didnt come off too good in that poor little rich kids piece you did oh thats water over the dam kelly said with a wave of dismissal that might be the way you feel brian said but i doubt hed feel the same way he had it coming kelly said im sure hes figured that out for the life of me i cant understand why cardiac surgeons like him dont realize their moaning about medicare reimbursement rates strikes a hollow chord with the public when theyre earning sixfigure incomes youd think theyd be more streetsmart deserved or not i cant imagine he wasnt pissed brian said i doubt if hed talk to you youre forgetting that surgeons like kim reggis love publicity kelly said anyway i think its worth the risk what do we have to lose time brian said which we dont have much of kelly said bending down to caroline she added sweetie would you know if beckys mother were here sure caroline said she pointed shes over there in the red sweater how convenient kelly said as she straightened up to peer across the ice this truly is serendipitous listen chicken finish getting your shoes on ill be right back kelly turned to brian hold the fort go for it girl brian said with a smile kelly walked around the end of the skating rink and approached beckys mother the woman appeared to be about her own age she was attractive and well groomed although her clothes were conservative kelly hadnt seen a crewneck sweater over a white collared shirt on a woman since shed been in college beckys mother was deeply absorbed in a book that couldnt have been bestseller fiction she was carefully underlining with a yellow felttipped pen excuse me kelly said i hope im not disturbing you too much beckys mother looked up she was a dark brunette with auburn highlights her features were chiseled but her demeanor was gentle and her spirit immediately empathetic its quite all right the woman said can i help you are you mrs reggis kelly asked please call me tracy thanks kelly said that looks like serious reading for the skating rink i have to take advantage of every moment i get tracy replied it looks like a textbook kelly said im afraid it is tracy said ive gone back to school in my early middle age thats commendable kelly said its challenging tracy said whats the title tracy flipped the book over to show its cover the assessment of child and adolescent personality whoa that sounds heavy kelly said its not too bad tracy said in fact its interesting ive got a nineyearold daughter kelly said i probably should read something about teenage behavior before all hell breaks loose it cant hurt tracy said parents need all the help they can get adolescence can be a tough time and its been my experience that when difficulties are anticipated they happen sounds like something you know a bit about kelly said some tracy admitted but you can never be complacent before going back to school last semester i was involved with therapy mostly with children including adolescents psychologist kelly asked social worker tracy said interesting kelly said to change the subject actually the reason i came over here was to introduce myself im kelly anderson of wene news i know who you are tracy said with a touch of scorn uhoh kelly said i have the uncomfortable feeling that my reputation precedes me i hope you dont hold it against me that i did that segment on cardiac surgeons and medicare i felt it was underhanded tracy said kim was under the impression that you were sympathetic when he agreed to do the interview i was to an extent kelly said after all i did present both sides of the issue only in regard to falling professional incomes tracy said which you made the focus in reality thats only one of the issues that concern cardiac surgeons a pink blur raced past kelly and tracy and drew their attention to the rink becky had increased her speed and was now tensing as she streaked backward then to the delight of the impromptu audience of shoppers she executed a perfect triple axel more applause erupted kelly let out a faint whistle your daughter is a phenomenal skater thank you tracy said we think she is a phenomenal person kelly regarded tracy in an attempt to interpret her comment kelly couldnt quite decide if it were meant to be disdainful or merely informative but tracy s face gave little hint she stared back at kelly with a soulful but undecipherable expression did she get her skating talent from you kelly asked tracy laughed freely letting her head fall back in true amusement hardly she said ive never had a pair of skates on my clumsy feet we dont know where she got her talent one day she just said she wanted to skate and the rest is history my daughter says beckys going to the nationals this year kelly said that might make a good story for wene i dont think so tracy said becky was invited but shes decided not to go im sorry kelly said gosh you and the good doctor must be crushed her fathers not terribly happy tracy said but to be honest im relieved why is that kelly asked that level of competition extracts a high price from anyone much less a prepubescent child its not always mentally healthy its a lot of risk without a lot of payoff hmmm kelly said ill have to give that some thought but meanwhile ive got a more pressing problem im trying to do a piece for tonights eleven oclock news since todays the sixthmonth anniversary of americares merger of the samaritan with the university med center what i wanted was the communitys reaction but ive run into a lot of apathy so id love to get your husbands feelings on the issue since i know hed have an opinion by any chance is he coming here to the rink this afternoon no tracy said with a giggle as if kelly had suggested an absurdity he never leaves the hospital until six or seven on weekdays never too bad kelly commented while her mind rapidly processed various contingencies tell me do you think your husband would be willing to talk with me i really have no idea tracy said you see weve been divorced for a number of months so i couldnt guess how he feels about you at the moment im sorry kelly said with sincerity i didnt have any idea no need to be sorry it was best for everyone im afraid a casualty of the times and a clash of personalities well i can imagine being married to a surgeon particularly a cardiac surgeon is no picnic i mean they think that everything pales in importance compared to what they do hmmm tracy responded noncommittally i know i couldnt stand it kelly said egotistical selfcentered personalities like your former husband and i dont mix maybe thats saying something about you tracy suggested you think so kelly said she paused for a moment recognizing she was dealing with a gentle but quick wit maybe youre right anyway let me ask you this would you have any idea where i might find your former husband right now id really like to talk with him i can guess where he is tracy said hes probably in surgery with all the fighting for or time at the med center hes had to do all three of his weekly cases on friday thank you i think ill head right over there and see if i can catch him youre welcome tracy said she returned kellys wave and then watched the woman walk swiftly back around the rink good luck tracy murmured to herself two friday january th all twentyfive of the university medical center s operating rooms were identical having been recently renovated and reequipped they were uptotheminute in every way the floors were a white composite that gave the impression of granite the walls were gray tile the lights and fittings were either stainless steel or gleaming nickel or twenty was one of two rooms used for openheart surgery and at fourfifteen it was still in full operation between the perfusionists anesthesiologists circulating and scrub nurses the surgeons and all the necessary hightech equipment the room was quite crowded at that moment the patients still heart was in full view surrounded by a profusion of bloodstained tapes trailing sutures metal retractors and pale green drapes okay thats it dr kim reggis said as he handed his needle holder to the scrub nurse and straightened up to relieve the stiffness in his back hed been operating since seventhirty that morning this was his third and final case lets stop the cardioplegia solution and get this ticker going kims command resulted in a minor flurry of activity at the console of the bypass machine switches were flipped warming up the profusionist announced to no one in particular the anesthesiologist stood and looked over the ether screen how much longer do you estimate she asked well be closing here in five minutes kim said provided the heart cooperates which looks promising after a few erratic beats the heart picked up its normal rhythm okay kim said lets go off bypass for the next twenty minutes there was no talk everyone on the team knew his job so communication wasnt necessary after the split sternum had been wired together kim and dr tom bridges stepped back from the heavily draped patient and began removing their sterile gowns gloves and plastic face shields at the same time the thoracic residents moved into the vacated positions i want a plastic repair on that incision kim called to the residents is that understood you got it dr reggis tom harkly said tom was the chief thoracic resident but dont make it your lifes work kim teased the patient has been under long enough kim and torn emerged from the or into the operatingroom corridor both used the scrub sink to wash the talc off their hands dr tom bridges was a cardiac surgeon like kim they had been assisting each other for years and had become friends although their relationship remained essentially professional they frequently covered for each other especially on weekends that was a slick job tom commented i dont know how you manage to get those valves in so perfectly and make it look so easy kims practice over the years had evolved into mostly valve replacement tom had gravitated more toward bypass procedures just like i dont know how you can sew those tiny coronary arteries the way you do kim answered leaving the sink kim interlocked his fingers and stretched them high over his sixfootthreeinch frame then he bent down and put his palms on the floor keeping his legs straight to stretch out his lower back kim was an athletic trim sinewy type whod played football basketball and baseball for dartmouth as an undergraduate because of the demands of time his current exercise had been reduced to infrequent tennis and lots of hours on a home exercise bike tom on the other hand had given up he too had played football in college but after years of no exercise the muscle bulk that hed not lost had turned mostly to fat in contrast to kim he had a beer belly despite the fact that he rarely drank beer the two men started down the tiled corridor which at that time of day was relatively peaceful only nine of the ors were in use with two more available for emergencies it was about standard for the threetoeleven shift kim rubbed his stubbled angular face following his normal routine hed shaved that morning at fivethirty and now twelve hours later he had the proverbial fiveoclock shadow he ran a hand through his long dark brown hair as a teenager in the early seventies hed let his hair grow beyond shoulder length now at fortythree it was still on the long side for someone in his position though it was nowhere near as long as it had been kim looked at his watch pinned to his scrub pants damn its fivethirty already and i havent even made rounds i wish i didnt have to operate on friday invariably it cuts into any weekend plans at least you get to have your cases run consecutively tom said its sure not like it used to be when you ran the department over at the samaritan tell me about it kim said with americare calling the shots and with the current status of the profession i wonder if id even go into medicine if i had it all to do over again you and me both tom said especially with these new medicare rates last night i stayed up and did some figuring im afraid im not going to have any money left after i pay my office overhead i mean what kind of a situation is that its gotten so bad nancy and i are thinking of putting our house on the market good luck kim said mines been on the market for five months and i havent even had a serious offer i already had to pull my kids out of private school tom said but hell i went to public school myself how are you and nancy getting along kim asked to be honest not great tom said thereve been a lot of bad feelings im sorry to hear that kim said i sympathize since ive been through it its a stressful time this is not how i expected things to be at this stage in my life tom said with a sigh me neither kim said the two men stopped just beyond the or desk at the entrance to the recovery room hey are you going to be around for the weekend tom asked yeah sure kim said why whats up i might have to go back in on that case you helped me with tuesday tom said theres been some residual bleeding and unless it stops my hand is forced if that happens i could use your assistance just page me kim said ill be available my ex wanted the whole weekend i think shes seeing someone anyway becky and i will be hanging out together how is becky doing after the divorce tom asked shes doing fantastic kim said certainly better than i am at this point shes the only bright light in my life i guess kids are more resilient than we give them credit for tom said apparently so kim agreed hey thanks for helping today sorry that second case took so long no problem tom said you handled it like a virtuoso it was a learning experience see you in the surgical locker room kim stepped into the recovery room hesitating just beyond the threshold he scanned the beds for his patients the first one he saw was sheila donlon shed been his immediately preceding case and had been particularly difficult shed needed two valves instead of only one kim walked over to the bed one of the recovery room nurses was busy changing an almost empty iv bottle kims experienced eye first checked the patients color and then glanced at the monitors the cardiac rhythm was normal as was the blood pressure and arterial oxygenation everything okay kim asked as he lifted the recoveryroom chart to glance at the grafts no problems the nurse said without interrupting her efforts everythings stable and the patients content kim replaced the chart and moved alongside the bed gently he raised the sheet to glance at the dressing kim always instructed his residents to use minimal dressing if there was unexpected bleeding kim wanted to know about it sooner rather than later satisfied kim replaced the sheet before straightening up to look for his other patient only about half the beds were occupied so it didnt take long to scan them wheres mr glick kim asked ralph glick had been kims first case ask mrs benson at the desk the nurse responded she was preoccupied putting her stethoscope in her ears and inflating sheila donlons blood pressure cuff mildly irritated at the lack of cooperation kim walked over to the central desk but found mrs benson the head nurse equally preoccupied she was giving detailed instructions to several housekeeping workers who were there to break down clean and change one of the beds excuse me kim said im looking mrs benson motioned to kim that she was busy kim thought about complaining that his time was more valuable than the housekeepers but he didnt instead he rose up on his toes to look again for his patient what can i do for you dr reggis mrs benson said as soon as the housekeepers headed off toward the recently vacated bed i dont see mr glick kim said he was still scanning the room certain he was overlooking the man mr glick was sent to his floor mrs benson said curtly she pulled out the controlledsubstance log and opened it to the appropriate page kim looked at the nurse and blinked but i specifically asked he be kept here until i finished my final case the patient was stable mrs benson added there was no need for him to remain and tie up a bed kim sighed but you have tons of beds it was a matter of excuse me dr reggis mrs benson said the point is mr glick was clinically ready to go but i had requested he be kept kim said it would have saved me time dr reggis mrs benson said slowly with all due respect the recoveryroom staff doesnt work for you we have rules we work for americare if you have a problem with that i suggest you talk to one of the administrators kim felt his face redden he started to talk about the concept of teamwork but he quickly changed his mind mrs benson had already directed her attention to the looseleaf notebook in front of her murmuring a few choice epithets under his breath kim walked out of the recovery room he yearned for the old days back at the samaritan hospital stepping across the hall he stopped at the or desk with the aid of the intercom he checked on the progress of his last case tom harklys voice assured him the closure was proceeding on schedule leaving the operating suite kim marched down the hall to the newly constructed family lounge it was one of the few innovations americare had instituted that kim thought was a good idea it had come from americares concern for amenities the room was specifically designated for the relatives of patients in the operating or delivery rooms prior to americares purchase of the university medical center there had been no place for family members to wait by that time of day it was not crowded there were a few of the omnipresent expectant fathers pacing or nervously flipping through magazines while waiting for their wives to have caesareans in the far corner a priest was sitting with a grieving couple kim glanced around for mrs gertrude arnold the wife of kims last patient kim wasnt looking forward to talking with her her peppery and truculent personality was hard for him to bear but he knew it was his responsibility he found the latesixties woman in the opposite far corner away from the grieving couple she was reading a magazine mrs arnold kim said forcing himself to smile startled gertrude looked up for a nanosecond her face registered surprise but as soon as she recognized kim she became visibly irritated well its about time mrs arnold snapped what happened is there a problem no problem at all kim assured her quite the contrary your husband tolerated the procedure very well hes resting but its almost six oclock gertrude sputtered you said youd be done by three that was an estimate mrs arnold kim said trying to keep his voice even despite a wave of irritation hed anticipated a strange response but this was more than hed bargained for unfortunately the previous case took longer than expected then my husband should have gone first gertrude shot back youve kept me waiting here all day not knowing what was happening im a wreck kim lost control and in spite of a valiant effort his face twisted into a wry disbelieving smile dont you smile at me young man gertrude scolded if you ask me you doctors are too high and mighty making us normal folk wait all the time im sorry if my schedule has caused you any distress kim said we do the best we can yeah well let me tell you what else happened gertrude said one of the americare administrators came to see me and he told me that americare wasnt going to pay for my husbands first day in the hospital they said he was supposed to be admitted this morning on the day of surgery and not the day before what do you say to that this is an ongoing problem im having with the administration kim said when someone is as sick as your husband was before his surgery i could not in good conscience allow him to be admitted the day of surgery well they said they werent going to pay gertrude said and we cant pay if americare persists then ill pay kim said gertrudes mouth dropped open you will its come up before and ive paid before kim said now about your husband soon hell be in recovery theyll keep him there until hes stable and then hell go to the cardiac floor youll be able to see him then kim turned and walked from the room pretending not to hear mrs arnold calling his name retreating back up the hall kim entered the surgical lounge it was occupied by a handful of or nurses on their breaks and a few of the staff anesthesiologists and anesthetists kim nodded to those people he recognized having been working at the university medical center only since the merger six months previously kim didnt know all the staff particularly the evening and night people pushing through the door into the mens surgical locker room kim pulled off his scrub top and threw it forcibly into the hamper he then sat on the bench in front of the bank of lockers to unpin his watch from the waistband of the pants tom whod taken a shower was busy putting on his shirt it used to be when i finished a case i felt a certain euphoria kim commented now i feel a vague unpleasant anxiety i know the feeling tom said correct me if im wrong kim said this all used to be a lot more fun tom turned from facing the mirror and chuckled excuse me for laughing but you say that as if it were a sudden revelation im not talking about the economics kim said im talking about the little things like getting respect from the staff and appreciation from patients nowadays you cant take anything for granted times are achanging tom agreed especially with managed care and the government teamed up to make us specialists miserable sometimes i fantasize about one of the responsible bureaucrats coming to me for a bypass and i make him get it from a general practitioner kim stood up and pulled off his scrub pants the sad irony is that all this is happening when we cardiac surgeons have the most to offer the public kim was about to toss his pants into the hamper by the door when the door opened and one of the women anesthesiologists dr jane flanagan stuck her head in catching sight of kims skivvyclad body she whistled you came mighty close to having these sweatsoaked pants draped over your noggin kim warned for such a view it would have been worth it jane joked anyway im here to inform you that your public awaits you out here in the lounge the door closed and lanes perky face disappeared kim looked at tom public what the hell is she talking about my guess is you have a visitor tom said and the fact that no one has come in here leads me to believe it must be female kim stepped over to the cubbyholes filled with scrub tops and bottoms and took a clean set what now he questioned irritably at the door kim paused if this is mrs arnold the wife of my last case im going to scream kim pushed out into the lounge instantly he saw it wasnt gertrude arnold instead kelly anderson was at the coffee urn helping herself to a cup a few steps behind her was her cameraman with a camcorder balanced on his right shoulder ah dr reggis kelly exclaimed catching sight of the surprised and nonetoopleased kim how good of you to come to talk with us how the hell did you get in here kim asked with indignation and how did you know i was here the surgical lounge was like a sanctuary that even nonsurgical doctors were hesitant to violate for kim the idea of being confronted by anyone here much less kelly anderson was too much to bear brian and i knew you were here thanks to your former wife kelly said as for how we got up here im happy to say we were invited and even escorted by mr lindsey noyes kelly gestured toward a graysuited gentleman standing in the doorway to the hall whod hesitated to come in himself hes from the americare university med center pr department evening dr reggis lindsey said nervously we just need a moment of your time miss anderson has graciously decided to do a story commemorating the sixmonth anniversary of our hospital merger of course wed like to assist her in any way we can for a moment kims dark eyes darted back and forth between kelly and lindsey on the spur of the moment he wasnt certain who irritated him more the muckraking journalist or the meddlesome administrator ultimately he decided he didnt care if you want to help her then you talk to her kim said before turning to go back into the locker room dr reggis wait kelly blurted ive already heard the prepared americare side were interested in your personal view from the trenches so to speak with the lockerroom door open a crack kim paused and debated he looked back at kelly anderson after that piece you did on cardiac surgery i vowed never to talk to you again and why is that kelly said it was an interview i didnt put words in your mouth you quoted me out of context by editing your questions kim fumed and you left out most of the issues i said were of primary importance we always edit our interviews kelly said its a fact of life find another victim kim said kim pushed open the lockerroom door and had taken a step within when kelly called out again dr reggis just answer one question has the merger been as good for the community as americare contends they say they did it for purely altruistic reasons they insist its the best thing thats happened to medical care in this city since the discovery of penicillin kim hesitated again the absurdity of such a comment made it impossible for him not to respond once again he turned back to kelly i have trouble understanding how anyone could say such a ludicrous statement and have a conscience clear enough to sleep at night the truth is that the entire rationale for the merger was to benefit americares bottom line anything else they may tell you is rationalization and pure bull the door closed behind kim kelly looked at brian brian smiled and gave kelly the thumbsup sign i got it brian said kelly smiled back perfect that was just what the doctor ordered lindsey coughed politely into a closed fist obviously he said dr reggis has given his personal view which i can assure you is not shared by other members of the professional staff oh really kelly questioned she let her eyes roam the room anybody here wish to make a comment concerning dr reggiss statement for a moment no one moved pro or con kelly prodded still no one moved in the sudden silence the hospital page could be heard like the backdrop of a tv melodrama well kelly said brightly thank you all for your time tom slipped on his long white hospital coat and arranged the collection of pens pencils and flashlight in its upper front pocket kim had come into the locker room and after removing his clothes and throwing them into the hamper had gotten into the shower hed not said a word arent you going to tell me who was out there tom said it was kelly anderson from wene news kim said from the shower in our surgical lounge tom questioned can you believe it kim said she was dragged up here by one of the americare admin guys apparently my ex told her where to find me i hope you told her what you thought of that piece she did on cardiac surgery tom said after my car mechanic saw it i swear he raised his rates i mean talk about backwards my incomes plummeting and service people are upping their charges i said as little as i could kim said hey what time were you supposed to pick up becky tom asked six oclock kim said what time is it now youd better get a move on tom said its already heading toward sixthirty damn kim said i havent even done my rounds yet what a life three friday january th by the time kim did his rounds and checked mr arnold in the recovery room another hour had passed en route to his former wifes house in the university section of town he pushed his tenyearold mercedes and made record time but it was still going on eight when he pulled up behind a yellow lamborghini directly in front of tracy s house leaping from the car kim jogged up the front walk the house was a modest affair built around the birth of the twentieth century with a few victorian gothic touches like pointed arch windows in the secondfloor dormers kim took the front steps in twos to reach the columned porch where he rang the bell his breath steamed in the wintery chill while he waited he fanned his arms to keep warm he wasnt wearing a coat tracy opened the door and immediately put her hands on her hips she was plainly anxious and irritated kim its almost eight you said youd be here by six at the latest sorry kim said it was unavoidable the second case took longer than anticipated we ran into an unexpected problem i suppose i should be used to this by now tracy said she stepped out of the way and motioned for kim to step inside she closed the door behind him kim glanced into the living room and saw a smart casually dressed midforties man in a suede fringe jacket and ostrich cowboy boots he was sitting on the couch with a drink in one hand and a cowboy hat in the other i would have fed becky if id had any idea it was going to be this late tracy said shes starved thats easy to remedy kim said i mean we are planning on going out to dinner i wish you would have at least called tracy said i was in surgery and didnt get out until fivethirty kim said its not like i was out golfing i know tracy said with resignation its all very noble the problem is you were the one who picked the time not me its a matter of consideration every second i thought you were about to arrive luckily were not flying commercial flying kim questioned where are you going aspen tracy said ive given becky the number where i can be reached aspen for two days i feel its time for me to have a little fun in my life not that you would know what that is apart from your surgery of course well as long as were being nasty and sarcastic kim said thanks for sending kelly anderson to the surgical lounge that was a pleasant surprise i didnt send her tracy said she said you did i just told her i thought you were in surgery tracy said well its the same thing kim said over kims shoulder tracy saw her guest stand up sensing he was uncomfortable from undoubtedly overhearing her exchange with her former husband tracy motioned to kim to follow her into the living room enough of this bickering she said kim id like you to meet a friend of mine carl stahl the two men shook hands and eyed each other warily you two entertain yourselves tracy suggested ill run upstairs and make sure becky has everything she needs then we can all go our separate ways kim watched tracy disappear up the stairs then his gaze returned to tracy s apparent boyfriend it was an uncomfortable situation and kim couldnt help feel some jealousy but at least carl was several inches shorter with significantly thinning hair on the other hand the man was tanned despite its being midwinter he also appeared in reasonable physical shape can i get you a drink carl suggested motioning toward a bottle of bourbon on a side table dont mind if i do kim said kim had never been much of a drinker although over the last six months a nightly cocktail had become a habit carl put down his cowboy hat and stepped over to the sideboard kim noticed he seemed to have a proprietary manner i saw that interview kelly anderson did with you a month or so ago carl said as he shoveled several ice cubes into an oldfashioned glass im sorry kim said i was hoping most people missed it carl splashed a generous dollop of liquor over the ice and then handed the drink to kim he sat back down on the couch next to his cowboy hat kim lowered himself into a facing club chair you have a right to be angry about it carl said condescendingly it wasnt fair tv news has an irritating way of twisting things sad but true kim agreed he took a sip of the fiery fluid and inhaled before swallowing he felt a comfortable warm feeling course through his body i certainly didnt buy her premise carl said you guys earn every penny you get i mean i personally have a lot of respect for you doctors thank you kim said thats very reassuring seriously carl said in fact i was premed for a couple of semesters in college really what happened didnt you like it it didnt like me carl said with a laugh that ended with a peculiar snorting sound it was a wee bit too demanding and it began to cut into my social life carl laughed again as if hed just told a joke kim began to wonder what tracy saw in the guy what do you do kim asked to make conversation besides he was interested considering the lowermiddleclass neighborhood the yellow lamborghini outside had to belong to carl plus there was tracy s comment about not flying commercial that was even more worrisome im ceo of foodsmart carl said im sure youve heard of us i cant say that i have kim said its a large agricultural business carl said really more of a holding company one of the largest in the state actually wholesale or retail kim asked not that he knew much about business both carl said but mainly export wholesale involving grain and beef but were also the major stockholder in the onion ring burger chain ive heard of them kim said i even own some stock good choice carl said then he leaned forward and after furtively looking around as if he thought there were a chance of hidden eavesdroppers he whispered buy some more onion ring stock the companys about to take the chain national consider it an insider tip just dont tell anyone where you heard it thanks kim said then he added sarcastically ive been wondering what to do with all my discretionary income youll be thanking me a thousandfold carl added insensitive to kims tone of voice the stock is going to go through the roof in a years time the onion ring will be out there challenging mcdonalds burger king and wendys tracy mentioned you two are flying to aspen on a private plane kim said changing the subject what do you fly me personally carl questioned i dont fly hell no id be the last person to get into a plane with me behind the controls carl laughed again with his peculiar style making kim wonder if the guy snored when he slept ive a new lear jet carl added well technically its foodsmarts at least according to the irs anyway as you undoubtedly know for such an aircraft the faa mandates we have two highly qualified pilots of course kim said as if he were intimately aware of the rule the last thing he wanted to do was reveal his ignorance of such things nor did he want to let on how angry it made him feel that a businessman who did nothing but shuffle paper could have such perks while he who worked twelve hours a day on peoples hearts was having trouble keeping his decadeold mercedes on the road a clatter of footfalls on the uncarpeted stairs heralded beckys arrival she had an overnight bag and her skates thrown over her shoulder she dumped both onto a chair in the front hall before racing into the living room kim hadnt seen becky since the previous sunday when theyd spent a happy day at a nearby ski area and becky acted accordingly she made a beeline into kims arms and gave him an enthusiastic hug momentarily making him lose his balance with his face pressed up against her head kim could feel that her brunette hair was damp from a recent shower the remnant odor of the shampoo made her smell like an apple orchard in bloom without letting go of kim becky leaned back and assumed a mock reproving expression youre late daddy kims aggravations of the day melted as he regarded his darling precocious tenyearold daughter who in his mind glowed with grace youth and energy her skin was flawless her eyes large and expressive im sorry pumpkin kim said i understand youre hungry im starved becky said but look becky turned her head from side to side see my new diamond earrings arent they gorgeous carl gave them to me just chips carl said selfconsciously sorta late christmas present and something for letting me borrow her mom for the weekend kim swallowed he was taken aback very impressive he managed becky let go of kim and went out into the foyer to gather her things and get her coat out of the front closet kim followed and went to the door now i want you in bed at your normal time young lady tracy said you understand the flus making the rounds oh mom becky complained im serious tracy said i dont want you missing school chill out mom becky said you have fun and dont be so nervous about ill have a great time tracy said interrupting her daughter before she could say something embarrassing but ill have a better time if i dont have to worry about you you have the phone number i gave you yeah yeah becky intoned then brightening she added ski the big burn for me okay i promise tracy said as she took beckys coat from her daughters arms i want this on but well be in the car becky complained i dont care tracy said helping her daughter into the coat becky ran to carl who was standing in the doorway to the living room she gave him a hug and got her mouth close to his ear shes real nervous but shell be okay and thanks for the earrings i love them youre welcome becky carl said nonplussed becky ran to tracy and gave her a quick hug before dashing out the door held open by kim outside becky ran down the stairs and waved to kim to hurry up kim broke into a trot call if theres a problem tracy yelled from the porch kim and becky waved as they got into kims car shes such a worrywart becky said as kim started the car then she pointed ahead through the windshield thats a lamborghini its carls car and its awesome im sure it is kim said trying not to sound as if he cared you should get one dad becky said she turned her head to look at the vehicle as they drove by lets talk about food kim said i was planning on picking up ginger i thought all three of us could go to chez lean i dont want to eat with ginger becky said poutingly kim drummed his fingers on the steering wheel the stress of the day at the hospital even the meeting with carl had him on edge he wished hed had time to play some tennis he needed some form of physical outlet the last thing he wanted was a problem between becky and ginger becky kim began weve been through this before ginger likes your company i just want to be with you not your receptionist becky complained but you will be with me kim said well all be together and ginger is more than my receptionist i dont want to eat at that stuffy old restaurant either becky said with emotion i hate it okay okay kim said struggling to control himself how about we go to the onion ring on prairie highway just you and me its just up the road fabulous becky perked up and despite her seat belt she managed to lean over and give kim a peck on the cheek kim marveled at how adroitly his daughter could manipulate him he felt better now that she had reverted to her normal vivacious self but after a few miles beckys comment began to gnaw at him again for the life of me kim said i dont understand why you have this thing against ginger because she made you and mom break up becky commented good gravy kim snapped is that what your mother says no becky said she says it was only part of it but i think it was gingers fault you guys hardly ever argued until ginger kim went back to drumming his fingers on the steering wheel despite what becky had said he was certain tracy had to have put the thought in her mind as he turned into the onion ring parking lot kim shot a glance in beckys direction her face was awash in color from the huge onion ring sign she was smiling in anticipation of their fastfood dinner the reason your mother and i got divorced was very complicated kim began and ginger had very little look out becky cried kim redirected his gaze through the windshield and saw the blurry image of a preteen on a skateboard off the right front fender kim jammed on the brakes and threw the steering wheel over to the left the car lurched to a stop but not before colliding with the rear of a parked car there was the unmistakable sound of breaking glass you smashed the car becky shouted as if it were a question i know i smashed the car kim shouted back well its not my fault becky said indignantly dont yell at me the skateboarder whod momentarily stopped now passed in front of the car kim looked at the child and the boy irreverently mouthed asshole kim closed his eyes for a moment to control himself im sorry he said to becky of course it wasnt your fault i should have been paying more attention and i certainly shouldnt have yelled at you what are we going to do becky said her eyes anxiously scanned the parking area she was terrified lest she see one of her schoolmates im going to see what happened kim said as he opened his door and got out he was back in seconds and asked becky to hand him the registration packet from the glove compartment what broke becky asked as she handed over the papers our headlight and their tail light kim said ill leave a note once inside the restaurant becky immediately forgot the mishap it being friday night the onion ring was mobbed most of the crowd were young teenagers in a ridiculous collection of oversized clothing and punk hairstyles but there were also a number of families with lots of small children and even infants the noise level was considerable thanks to fussy babies and competing ghetto blasters the onion ring restaurants were particularly popular with children mainly because the kids could doctor their own gourmet burgers with a bewildering display of condiments they could also make their own sundaes with an equivalent number of toppings isnt this an awesome place becky commented as she and kim got into one of the order lines just delightful kim teased especially with the quiet classical music in the background oh dad becky moaned and rolled her eyes did you ever come here with carl kim asked he really didnt want to hear the answer because he had an inkling she had sure becky offered he took mom and me here a couple of times it was cool he owns the place not quite kim said with a certain satisfaction actually the onion ring is a publicly owned company do you know what that means sort of becky said it means a lot of people own stock kim said even i own stock so im one of the owners too yeah well when i was here with carl we didnt have to stand in line becky said kim took a deep breath and let it out lets talk about something else have you thought any more about skating in the nationals i know the entry deadline is coming up im not going to enter becky said without hesitation really kim questioned why not dear you are such a natural and you won the state junior championship last year so easily i like skating becky said i dont want to ruin it but you could be the best i dont want to be the best in competition becky said gosh becky kim said i cant help but be a little disappointed id be so proud of you mom said you would say something like that becky said oh great kim exclaimed your knowitall therapist mother she also said that i should do what i think is best for me kim and becky found themselves at the front of the line a bored teenage cashier gazed at them with glassy eyes and asked them what they wanted becky looked up at the menu mounted over the bank of cash registers she screwed up her mouth and stuck a finger in her cheek hmmm i dont know what i want have a burger kim said thought that was your favorite okay becky said ill have a burger fries and a vanilla shake regular or jumbo the cashier asked in a tired voice regular becky said and you sir the cashier asked oh hell let me see kim said he too looked up at the menu soup du jour and salad i guess and an iced tea comes to seven ninety the cashier said kim paid and the cashier handed him a receipt your number is twentyseven kim and becky turned around and left the order area it took some hunting but they found a couple of empty seats at one of the picnicstyle tables near the window becky squeezed in but not kim he handed her the receipt and told her he had to use the mens room becky nodded absently she had her eye on one of the cute boys from her school who happened to be sitting at the next table it was like a brokenfield run for kim to make his way across the restaurant to the anteroom leading to the restrooms there were two phones but both were tied up by teenage girls behind each was a line kim reached into his jacket pocket and extracted his cell phone he punched in the numbers leaned back against the wall and held it to his ear ginger its me kim said where the devil are you ginger complained have you forgotten our reservations at chez lean were for seventhirty were not going kim said ive had to change the plans becky and i are grabbing a bite at the onion ring on prairie highway ginger didnt respond hello kim said are you still there yeah im still here ginger said did you hear what i said of course i heard ginger said i havent eaten and ive been waiting you havent called and besides you promised me wed eat at chez jean tonight listen kim growled dont you give me a hard time too i cant please everybody i was late picking up becky and she was starved thats nice ginger said you and your daughter have a nice dinner together youre irritating me ginger well how do you expect me to feel ginger asked for a year your wife was your convenient excuse now i suppose its going to be your daughter thats enough ginger kim snapped im not going to get into an argument becky and i are eating here and then well come by and pick you up maybe ill be here and maybe i wont ginger said im getting tired of being taken for granted fine kim said you decide kim cut off the connection and jammed the phone back into his jacket pocket he gritted his teeth and cursed under his breath the evening was hardly progressing as he would have liked kims eyes involuntarily strayed to the face of a teenage girl waiting for one of the wall phones her lipstick was such a dark red it bordered on brown it made her look like someone whod succumbed to the elements on the north face of mount everest the girl caught kim staring at her she interrupted her cowlike gumchewing long enough to stick out her tongue kim pushed off the wall and went into the mens room to splash water on his face and wash his hands the level of activity in the kitchen and service area of the onion ring was commensurate with the number of customers in the restaurant proper it was controlled pandemonium roger polo the manager who regularly worked a double shift on fridays and saturdays the onion rings two busiest days was a nervous man in his late thirties who drove himself and his staff hard when the restaurant was as busy as it was while kim and becky awaited their order roger worked the line he was the one who gave the burger and fries order to the shortorder chef paul or the soup and salad orders to the steamtable and saladbar worker julia or the drink orders to claudia all the restocking and the routine ongoing cleanup was done by the gofer skip number twentyseven coming up roger barked i want a soup and salad soup and salad julia echoed iced tea and vanilla shake roger called out coming up claudia said regular burger and medium fries roger ordered got it paul said paul was considerably older than roger his face was leathered and deeply creased he looked more like a farmer than a cook he had spent twenty years as a shortorder chef on an oil rig in the gulf on his right forearm was a tattoo of a gusher with the word eureka paul stood at the grill built into a central island behind the row of cash registers at any given time he had a number of hamburger patties on the cooktop each one was in response to an order he organized the cooking by rotation so that all the burgers got the same amount of grill time in response to the most recent wave of orders paul turned around and opened the chesthigh refrigerator directly behind him skip paul yelled when he realized the patty box was empty get me a box of burgers from the walkin skip put his mop aside coming up the walkin freezer was at the very back of the kitchen next to the walkin refrigerator and across from the storeroom skip whod only been working at the onion ring for a week had found that a significant portion of his job was to carry various supplies from storage to the preparation area he opened the heavy freezer door and stepped within the door was mounted with a heavy spring and closed behind him the interior was about ten feet by twenty feet and illuminated by a single light bulb in a wire cage the walls were surfaced in a metallic material that looked like aluminum foil the floor was a wooden grate the space was almost full of cardboard containers except for a central aisle to the left were the large cartons full of frozen hamburger patties to the right were the boxes of frozen french fries fish fillets and chicken chunks skip flapped his arms against the subzero chill his breath came in frosted clouds wishing to get back to the warmth of the kitchen he scraped away the frost from the label of the first carton to his left to make sure it was ground meat it read mercer meats reg lb hamburger patties extra lean lot batch production jan use by apr reassured skip tore open the carton and lifted out one of the inner boxes that contained fifteen dozen patties he carried them back to the refrigerator behind paul and put them in youre back in business skip said paul didnt respond he was too busy setting up the cooked burgers while his mind kept a running account of the new orders roger had given him as soon as he could he turned to the refrigerator opened the patty box and extracted the number of burgers he needed but as he was about to close the door his eye caught the label skip paul yelled get your ass back here whats wrong skip questioned hed not left the area but had bent down to change the trash bag under the central islands rubbish disposal opening you brought the wrong goddamn patties paul said these just came in today what difference does it make skip asked plenty paul said ill show you in a second he then called roger how many burgers you looking for after order twentysix roger checked his tickets i need one burger for twentyseven four for twentyeight and three for twentynine thats eight total thats what i thought paul said he tossed the eight patties he had in his hand onto the grill and turned around to get the box of patties out of the refrigerator as preoccupied as he was he didnt notice that the first patty he threw ended up partially covering another patty that was already on the grill paul motioned for skip to follow him and spoke while he walked we get shipments of frozen hamburger once every couple of weeks he explained but we have to use the older ones first paul opened the door to the walkin freezer and was immediately confronted by the carton skip had opened paul wedged the box he was carrying back into the carton and closed the lid see this date paul asked while pointing to the label yeah i see it skip said those other cartons back there have an older date paul said they have to be used first somebody should have told me skip complained im telling you now paul said come on help me move these new ones to the back and the ones in the back to the front kim had returned from the restroom and had managed to squeeze his sixfootplus frame into the seat next to becky there were six other individuals at the same table including a twoyearold whose face was smeared with ketchup he was busy beating his halfeaten hamburger with a plastic soupspoon becky please be reasonable kim said while trying to ignore the twoyearold i told ginger that wed pick her up after we finished eating becky took a breath and exhaled slumping her shoulders she was sulking which was uncharacteristic for her i mean weve done what you wanted kim said were eating together just you and me and its not at chez lean well you didnt ask me if i wanted to pick up ginger becky said when you said we were coming here i thought you meant we didnt have to see her tonight at all kim looked off and tightened his jaw muscles he loved his daughter but he knew she could be frustratingly willful as a cardiac surgeon he was accustomed to people on his team following his orders paul returned from the rearranging in the walkin freezer to face an exasperated roger where have you been roger demanded were way behind dont worry paul said everything is under control paul picked up his spatula and began slipping the fully cooked burgers into their respective buns the patty that had been leaning up against another was pushed aside so that the one beneath could be removed ordering thirty roger barked two regular burgers and one jumbo coming up paul said he reached behind into the refrigerator to get the meat turning back around he tossed them onto the grill he then used his spatula to pick up the patty that had been draped over another flipping it back onto the grill it again landed so that it was leaning on another and not flat against the cooktop paul was about to adjust it when roger got his attention paul you screwed up roger snapped whats wrong with you tonight paul looked up with his spatula suspended over the grill number twentyfive is supposed to be two jumbos not two regulars roger complained shit sorry paul said he turned back to the refrigerator to get two jumbo patties after he tossed them onto the grill he used his spatula to press them down jumbos needed twice the cooktime of the regular burgers and number twentyfive was supposed to have a medium fries roger said irritably he waved the ticket as if he were threatening paul with it you got it paul said he quickly filled a paper cone with the potatoes roger took the fries and put them on the number twentyfive tray and shoved it over to what was called the distribution counter okay roger said to paul number twentysevens ready to go wheres the burger and fries come on paul lets get on the ball all right already paul said paul used his spatula to scoop up the patty that had spent most of its grilltime on top of two other patties he slipped it into a bun and placed it on the paper plate roger had put on the countertop in front of him paul shoveled on some grilled onions then filled another paper cone with french fries within seconds the teenager on the distribution counter leaned over his goosenecked microphone and said pick up number twentyfive and number twentyseven kim stood up thats us he said ill get the food but after we eat were going to pick up ginger and thats final and im going to expect you to be pleasant okay oh all right becky said reluctantly she stood up ill get the food kim said you stay put but i want to fix my own burger becky said oh yeah kim said i forgot while becky dressed her burger with an impressive layer of various toppings kim picked out what he hoped would be the least offensive salad dressing then father and daughter returned to their seats kim was happy to see the ketchupbesmeared toddler had departed becky perked up considerably when the boy from her school asked for some of her french fries kim picked up his soupspoon and was about to sample the soup when his cell phone rang against his chest he took the phone out and put it to his ear dr reggis here he said this is nancy warren the nurse said im calling because mrs arnold demands that you come in to see her husband what about kim asked becky used both hands to pick up her burger even so a couple of sliced pickles fell out from beneath the layers of bread undaunted she got her mouth around the behemoth and took a bite she chewed for a moment then examined the bitten surface mr arnold is very anxious nancy said and he says his pain medication isnt holding hes also had a couple of pvcs becky reached out and tugged on kims arm trying to get him to look at the bitten surface of her burger kim motioned for her to wait while he continued his cellular phone conversation has he had a lot of pvcs no not a lot nancy said but enough so that hes aware of them draw a potassium and doubleup on his pain meds is the intensivist there yes dr silber is in the hospital nancy said but i think you should come in mrs arnold is insistent ill bet she is kim said with a dismissive chuckle but lets wait for the potassium level first also check and make sure there isnt any marked abdominal distension kim disconnected his call mrs arnold was turning into a bigger pain in the neck than hed imagined look at my hamburger becky said kim glanced at beckys burger and saw the ribbon of pink in the middle of the meat patty but he was preoccupied and none too happy about the call hed just gotten from the hospital hmmm he said thats the way i used to eat my hamburgers when i was your age really becky questioned thats gross deciding it was best he speak directly to the intensivist himself kim dialed the hospital page number that was the only way i ate my hamburgers he said to becky as the call went through medium rare with a slice of raw onion not with those reconstituted grilled onions and certainly not with all that slop the hospital page operator answered and kim asked for dr alice silber he said hed hang on becky looked at her burger shrugged her shoulders and then took another more tentative bite she had to admit it tasted fine four saturday january th kims car rounded the bend in his street and approached his house it was a large tudorstyle home sited on a generous wooded lot in a comfortable suburban township at one time it had been an admirable house now it looked neglected the previous fall none of the leaves had been raked up and they now covered the lawn area with a layer of wet dirty brown debris most of the houses trim was badly peeling and sorely in need of paint and some of the window shutters were awry on the roof a few of the slate shingles had slipped out and were angled into the gutters it was nine oclock on an overcast wintery saturday morning the neighborhood seemed deserted there was no sign of life as kim turned into his drive and pulled up to the garage door even the nextdoor neighbors morning paper had yet to be retrieved from the front walk the interior of kims house reflected the exterior it had been mostly stripped of rugs accessories and furniture since tracy had taken what she wanted when she moved out in addition the house hadnt been cleaned in months the living room in particular had a dancehall feel with only one chair a tiny scatter rug a side table with a telephone on it and a single floor lamp kim tossed his keys onto a builtin console table in the foyer before passing through the dining room into the kitchenfamily room combination he called out beckys name but she didnt answer kim glanced into the sink there were no soiled dishes having awakened a little after five that morning which was his custom kim had gotten up and gone to the hospital to make his rounds by the time he got home hed expected becky to be up and ready to go becky you lazy bum where are you kim called out while mounting the stairs as he crested the top he heard beckys bedroom door open a moment later becky was standing in the doorway still dressed in her flannel nightgown her hair was a dark mop of tangled curls and her eyes were heavylidded whats going on kim asked i thought youd be raring to get to your skating lesson lets move it i dont feel so good becky said she rubbed her eye with her knuckle oh kim remarked how come whats wrong i have a stomachache well its nothing im sure kim said does the pain come and go or is it steady it comes and goes becky said where exactly do you feel it kim asked becky made some vague movements with her hand around her abdomen any chills kim asked he reached out and put his hand on beckys forehead becky shook her head ah nothing but a few cramps kim said its probably your poor stomach complaining about last nights junk food you shower up and get dressed while i see to some breakfast for you but snap it up i dont want your mother complaining to me about you being late for your skating im not hungry becky said im sure you will be after your shower kim said ill see you downstairs back in the kitchen kim got out cereal milk and juice returning to the base of the stairs he was about to call out to becky when he could hear the unmistakable sound of the shower returning to the kitchen he used the wall phone to call ginger everybodys okay at the hospital kim said as soon as ginger answered all three postops are sailing along fine although the arnolds particularly gertrude arnold are driving me bananas im glad ginger said tartly whats wrong now kim asked hed had another minor runin with one of the nurses on rounds that morning and was looking forward to a stressfree day i wanted to stay over last night ginger said i dont think it is fair stop right there kim snapped lets not get into this again would you please im tired of this nonsense besides becky is a little under the weather this morning whats the matter with her ginger asked her concern was genuine nothing much just a stomachache kim said he was about to elaborate when he heard becky coming down the stairs uhoh he intoned here she comes listen meet us at the rink at the mall bye as becky came into the room kim hung up the phone she was dressed in kims bathrobe which was so big it dragged on the floor and the arms came down to midcalf theres cereal milk and juice on the table kim said feel any better becky shook her head what do you want to eat nothing becky said well you have to have something kim said how about a shot of peptobismol becky screwed up her face into an expression of pure disgust ill have a little juice she suggested the stores in the mall were just beginning to lift their shutters to start the day as kim and becky made their way along the corridor toward the skating rink kim hadnt asked again but he was certain becky was feeling better shed ended up eating some cereal after all and in the car shed been her usual talkative self are you going to stay while i have my lesson becky asked thats the plan kim said im looking forward to seeing that triple axel youve been telling me about as they approached the rink kim handed becky her skates that hed been carrying a whistle sounded indicating the end of the preceding intermediate class perfect timing kim said becky sat down and started to unlace her sneakers kim glanced around at the other parents mostly mothers suddenly he found himself locking eyes with kelly anderson despite the earlymorning hour she was dressed as if she were about to go to a fashion show and her hair looked as if shed just emerged from a beauty salon she smiled kim looked away a young girl about beckys age skated over and exited the rink she sat down next to becky and said hi becky returned the greeting ah my favorite cardiac surgeon kim turned and to his distaste he found himself facetoface with kelly have you met my daughter kelly asked kim shook his head caroline say hello to dr reggis kelly said despite his reluctance to get into a conversation with kelly kim greeted the young girl and introduced becky to kelly what a delightful coincidence running into you again kelly said to kim as she straightened up from shaking hands with becky did you see my segment last night on the eleven oclock news about the hospital merger anniversary cant say that i did kim responded shucks kelly said you would have enjoyed it you got some good airtime and the consensus is that your bottom line quote stole the show it lit up the phone lines which the station manager loves remind me not to talk to you again kim said careful dr reggis kelly said happily youll hurt my feelings kim a voice called from the other side of the rink kim over here ginger had arrived and was enthusiastically waving as she started around the end of the rink on her way toward kim and kelly she was in her early twenties with pixielike features flowing blond hair and spidery legs when she wasnt at the office she made it a point to dress in her interpretation of a casual sexy manner that morning she had on a tight pair of jeans a cutoff top that exposed her narrow firm midriff and a workout headband and wristbands as evidence of her fondness for aerobics on her feet were crosstrainer shoes she wasnt wearing a coat oh my kelly whispered while watching ginger approach what do we have here im smelling tabloid material the renowned cardiac surgeon and the aerobics instructor shes my receptionist kim said in an attempt to downplay the imminent confrontation i wouldnt doubt that for a minute kelly said but look at that body and look at that girlish enthusiasm i get the feeling she thinks you are the living end im telling you she works for me kim snapped hey i believe you kelly said and thats what interests me even my internist and ophthalmologist divorced their wives to marry their receptionists im smelling a story here what is this the typical male medical midlife crisis scenario i want you to stay away from her kim growled oh come on dr reggis kelly said you cardiac surgeons think of yourselves as celebrities this is the kind of thing that comes with the turf especially if you date people half your age becky leaned over to caroline and whispered ill see ya here comes my fathers dorky girlfriend becky stood up entered the rink and quickly skated off ginger came straight to kim and before he knew what she intended she managed to plant a forceful kiss on his cheek sorry darling she said i know i was out of sorts on the phone this morning i was just missing you hmmm not very businesslike kelly remarked lipstick evidence kim used the back of his hand to wipe his cheek uhoh ginger commented when she saw the red imprint of her lips on kims skin let me get it off ginger licked two of her fingers and before kim could react again she smeared the lipstick this is perfect kelly commented ginger turned to kelly and immediately recognized her as a local celebrity kelly anderson she gushed what a treat i adore you on the news why thank you kelly said and you are ginger powers nice to meet you ginger kelly said let me give you one of my cards perhaps we could get together why thank you ginger said she took the card and smiled with true glee id love to get together good kelly said i do a number of healthrelated stories and im always looking for the opinions of those in the business youd want to interview me ginger questioned she was surprised and flattered why not kelly said ginger pointed to kim hes the one you should interview not me he knows everything about medicine sounds like you have a high opinion of the good doctor kelly said would that be safe to say as if theres a question ginger said with fake indignation hes the best cardiac surgeon in the world and hes the bestlooking too ginger tried to tweak kims cheek but this time he evaded her with that i think ill take my leave kelly said come on caroline lets get your coat on and get the show on the road and ginger give me a call im serious about talking to you and kim i can certainly understand why you have ginger for your receptionist and companion kelly and caroline walked away with kelly carrying her daughters skates and backpack caroline was having trouble getting into her long downfilled coat shes really nice ginger said watching kellys figure recede shes a shark kim said and i dont want you talking with her why not ginger said shes given me nothing but grief kim said but it would be fun ginger whined listen kim spat you talk to her and youre out of a job and my life understand all right ginger snapped back gosh what a grouch whats wrong with you becky whod been doing some warmup exercises skated over to where kim and ginger were standing i cant take a lesson becky said she stepped off the ice sat down and began quickly removing her skates why not kim asked my stomach is worse becky said and i have to use the bathroom bad five sunday january th kim lifted out harvey arnolds hospital chart and cracked it open it was before eight in the morning and the dayshift nursing crew was busy having its report consequently kim had the nurses station to himself save for the ward clerk he turned to the nurses notes to read what had transpired during the previous day and during the night he suppressed a smile it was apparent from some of the entries that mrs arnold was bothering the nursing staff as much as she bothered him it was also apparent mr arnold was doing fine this impression was confirmed by the graphs of his vital signs the input and output sheet and the previous days laboratory values satisfied kim slipped the looseleaf chart back into its slot and walked down to his patients room mr arnold was sitting up in his bed eating his breakfast and watching tv kim silently marveled at the progress cardiac surgery had made over the last couple of decades as evidenced by this individual here was a seventyyearold man who less than fortyeight hours previously had been gravely ill and had had openheart surgery his heart had literally been stopped opened and repaired and yet he was already relatively happy mostly painfree and enjoying a significant improvement in the quality of his life kim couldnt help but feel a keen disappointment that such a miracle was being devalued in the current economic environment how are you feeling mr arnold kim asked pretty good mr arnold said he wiped his chin with his napkin when he was by himself mr arnold was a pleasant gentleman it was when the husband and wife were together that the sparks began to fly kim interrupted his patients breakfast long enough to check on the dressing and the amount of drainage everything was progressing on schedule are you sure ill be able to play golf mr arnold asked absolutely kim said youll be able to do whatever you want after a few more minutes of banter kim took his leave unfortunately he ran into gertrude arnold on her way in there you are doctor mrs arnold said im glad i caught you i want a privateduty nurse in here around the clock you hear whats the problem kim asked the problem mrs arnold echoed ill tell you what the problem is the nurses on this floor are never available sometimes hours go by before we see one and when harvey rings his call button they take their sweet time i imagine thats because they believe mr arnold is doing well kim explained and that they are devoting their time to patients who are not doing quite so well now dont you start making excuses for them mrs arnold said i want a nurse in here all the time ill have someone come to talk to you about it kim said momentarily mollified mrs arnold nodded dont make me wait too long ill see what i can do kim said back at the nurses station kim told the ward clerk to page the americare administrator and have him come up to talk to mrs arnold kim couldnt help smiling as he waited for the elevator he would have loved to hear the conversation that would ensue the idea of causing the americare administrators a little grief was enormously entertaining the elevator arrived and kim squeezed on it was remarkably crowded for a sunday morning kim found himself pressed up against a tall bony resident dressed in the typical whites and whose name tag read john markham md pediatrics excuse me kim said are there any enteric viruses making the rounds these days in schoolage kids not that im aware of john said weve been seeing a pretty nasty strain of the flu but its all respiratory why do you ask my daughters got a gi upset kim said what are the symptoms john asked it started with cramps yesterday morning kim said then diarrhea ive treated her with some overthecounter antidiarrheal agents has it helped john asked i thought so at first kim said but then last night the symptoms returned any nausea and vomiting some mild nausea but no vomiting at least not yet but she hasnt had much appetite either fever nope none at all whos her pediatrician it was george turner after the merger he was forced to leave town i remember dr turner john said i rotated over to the samaritan he was a good man for sure kim said hes now back in boston at childrens hospital our loss john said anyway about your daughter it would be my guess shes got a touch of food poisoning and not a virus really kim questioned i thought food poisoning generally came on like gangbusters you know like the proverbial staph in the picnic potato salad not necessarily john said food poisoning can be present in countless ways but whatever the symptom complex if your daughter has had acute onset diarrhea chances are its food poisoning statistically its the most likely cause to give you an idea of its prevalence the cdc estimates there are two to three hundred million cases a year the elevator stopped and john disembarked i hope your daughter feels better john said as the doors closed kim shook his head he turned to another resident did you hear that two to three hundred million cases of food poisoning every year thats crazy that would mean that just about everyone in the entire country gets it each year the resident said that cant be true a nurse getting off duty said i think it is another resident said most people take the symptoms in stride and attribute it to the stomach flu of course there isnt any such thing as the stomach flu it seems astounding kim said it makes you think twice about eating out people get food poisoning in their own homes just as easily a woman from the back of the elevator said it comes from leftovers to a large degree although inappropriate handling of raw chicken is another major source kim nodded he had the uncomfortable feeling that everyone else on the elevator knew more about the issue than he did when the elevator reached the ground floor kim got off and left the hospital as he drove home he couldnt help but ponder about food poisoning he continued to marvel at the shocking idea of there being two to three hundred million cases a year in the united states if such a statistic were true it seemed incredible that hed not come across it in any of his medical reading kim was still mulling all this over as he came through his front door and tossed his keys on the console table in the foyer he thought hed get on the internet and see if he could substantiate the foodpoisoning statistic when he heard the sound of the tv coming from the kitchen he walked in ginger was at the kitchen counter struggling with the wallmounted can opener she was dressed in a spandex workout suit that left little to the imagination both saturdays and sundays she did aerobics religiously becky was sprawled on the couch in the family room watching cartoons she had a blanket drawn up around her neck she looked slightly pale against the dark green wool theyd spent the previous evening at home because of beckys condition ginger had made a chicken dinner of which becky had eaten very little after becky had gone to bed early ginger had stayed over kim hoped theyd gotten along okay while he was at the hospital hed expected them still to be in bed by the time he got back from rounds hello everybody kim called out im home neither becky nor ginger responded damn ginger exclaimed this thing is a piece of trash whats the trouble kim asked as he stepped over to ginger ginger had abandoned her efforts with the can opener and had her hands on her hips she looked exasperated i cant get this can open she said petulantly ill do it kim said he picked up the can but before putting it under the opener he looked at the label what is this he questioned its chicken broth just like it says ginger replied what are you doing with chicken broth at nine oclock in the morning kim questioned its for becky ginger said my mother always gave me chicken broth when i had the runs i told her i wasnt hungry becky called from the couch my mother knew what she was doing ginger said kim put the can of broth back on the counter and walked around the central island and into the family room when he got to the couch he put his hand on beckys forehead becky moved her head to try to keep the tv in view feeling any better kim asked she felt warm but he thought it might have been because his hand was cold about the same becky said and i dont want anything to eat it makes my cramps worse shes got to eat ginger said she didnt eat much dinner if her body is telling her not to eat she shouldnt eat kim said but she threw up ginger added is that right becky kim asked vomiting was a new symptom just a little becky admitted maybe she should be seen by a doctor ginger said and what do you think i am kim responded hotly you know what i mean ginger said youre the best cardiac surgeon in the world but you dont have much chance to deal with childrens tummies why dont you go upstairs and get me a thermometer kim said to ginger where would i find it ginger asked agreeably in the master bath kim said the top drawer on the right how about your cramps kim asked i still get them becky admitted are they any worse about the same becky said they come and go what about your diarrhea kim asked do we have to talk about this becky asked i mean its like embarrassing okay pumpkin kim said im sure youll be feeling your old self again in a few hours but what about eating im not hungry becky said okay kim said just let me know when you want something it was dark by the time kim turned into tracy s street and pulled to the curb at the base of her lawn he got out and went around to the passenger side to open beckys door becky had herself wrapped up inside a blanket so that it formed a hood over the top of her head kim helped his daughter out of the car and up the walkway to the front door shed spent the entire day on the familyroom couch in front of the tv kim rang the bell and waited tracy opened it and started to say hello to her daughter she stopped in midsentence and frowned whats the blanket for she asked her eyes shot to kim for an explanation and then back to becky come in becky stepped inside kim followed tracy closed the door whats going on tracy asked she turned back the edge of the blanket from beckys face youre pale are you sick single tears formed in the corners of beckys eyes tracy saw them and immediately enveloped her daughter in a protective hug as she did so she locked eyes with kim shes feeling a little punk kim admitted defensively tracy pushed becky out to arms length so she could again look at her face becky wiped her eyes youre very pale tracy said whats the matter its just a minor gi upset kim interjected probably just a touch of food poisoning at least that was the opinion of a pediatric resident i spoke with if its so minor why is she so pale tracy questioned tracy put her hand to beckys forehead she doesnt have a fever kim said just some cramps and diarrhea have you given her anything tracy asked sure kim said shes had peptobismol and when that didnt seem to do the trick i gave her some imodium did it help tracy asked some kim said i have to go to the bathroom becky said okay dear tracy said you go on upstairs ill be up in a minute becky hoisted the edge of her blanket and hurried up the stairs tracy turned to kim her face was flushed my god kim youve only had her for less than fortyeight hours and shes sick what did you do with her nothing out of the ordinary kim said i should have known better than to leave town tracy snapped oh come off it kim said becoming angry himself becky could have gotten sick whether you left town or not in fact if shes got a virus she could easily have contracted it before the weekend when you were here i thought you said it was food poisoning tracy said that was just a statistical guess by a pediatric resident kim said did ginger make food this weekend tracy asked as a matter of fact she did kim said she made a wonderful chicken dinner last night chicken tracy exclaimed i could have guessed that must have been it so youre already blaming ginger kim said mockingly you really dislike her dont you no i dont dislike her tracy said not anymore at this point im indifferent to her but the fact of the matter is shes young and undoubtedly hasnt had much experience in the kitchen those of us who have know that you have to be very careful with chicken you think you know everything kim said well for your information becky hardly touched the chicken besides shed been feeling punk since saturday morning that means that if shes got a touch of food poisoning then she got it from the onion ring out on prairie highway the place that your new boyfriend bragged to becky that he owned tracy reached around kim and opened the door goodnight kim she said sharply theres something else id like to say kim spat i resent you implying to becky that im some kind of ogre for encouraging her to compete in the nationals i never made a value judgment about your wishes for our daughter tracy said when becky informed me of her reluctance to face that kind of competition i supported her i also told her that you might try to change her mind that was all i said kim stared daggers at his former wife the air of psychological superiority she assumed whenever they argued enraged him especially in this instance when she felt she had to warn their daughter about what he might say to her goodnight kim tracy repeated she was still holding the door open kim spun on his heels and left six monday january th kims alarm was set to go off at fivefifteen in the morning but it was rarely needed he usually awoke just before the alarm which allowed him to turn it off before it could shatter the earlymorning peace kim had been getting up before dawn ever since hed been a firstyear surgical resident and this particular morning was no exception he climbed out of his warm bed in the pitch black and dashed stark naked into the bathroom following a routine that needed no thought kim pulled open the heavy glass door of the shower and turned on the water fullblast kim and tracy had always preferred showering to bathtub bathing and the bathroom was the only room theyd wanted renovated back when he and tracy had first purchased the house ten years earlier theyd had the tub pulled out as well as its attached tiny shower stall in their place a generous fivebyninefoot custom shower was constructed three sides were marble slab the fourth was halfinch glass including the door that had vertically oriented bright brass ushaped handles mounted as if they pierced the thick tempered glass in kims estimation it was a bathing extravaganza worthy of a spread in a design magazine breakfast was a donut and a cup of halfmilk halfcoffee that kim stopped for at a dunkin donuts shop near his home he ate while he drove through the morning darkness he also used the time to listen to medical tapes by six he was already in his office dictating consult letters and writing checks for various overhead expenses at sixfortyfive he was in the hospital for teaching rounds with the thoracic surgery residents at which time he made it a point to see his own patients by seventhirty he was in the conference room for the unavoidable daily hospital meeting that morning it concerned hospital credentials and admitting privileges after the administrative meeting kim met with the thoracic surgery fellows whose research he supervised and participated in that meeting went over so he was a few minutes late to surgical grand rounds where he presented a case of triplevalve replacement by ten oclock kim was back at his office and already behind schedule he found out that ginger had booked emergency patients for ninethirty and ninefortyfive cheryl constantine kims office nurse had the patients already in the two examining rooms the morning passed with nonstop patients lunch consisted of a sandwich that ginger had ordered in kim ate while he went over cath results and xrays he also found time to return a semiemergency phone call to a salt lake city cardiologist about a patient who needed a triplevalve replacement the afternoon was a mirror image of the morning with backtoback patients including a few emergencies that ginger slipped into the schedule at four oclock kim took a short break to dash over to the hospital to handle a minor problem with one of his inpatients while he was there he quickly did afternoon rounds back at the office kim vainly tried to catch up but he never could several hours and a number of patients later he paused for a moment to catch his breath before pushing into what was called exam room a he used the brief respite to glance at the chart he was relieved to see it was merely a routine postop check that promised the visit would most likely be a quickie the patients name was phil norton and as kim entered the cubicle phil was already obligingly sitting on the examination table with his shirt off congratulations mr norton kim said lifting his eyes from the chart your stress test is now normal thank god phil said and thank modernday cardiac surgery kim mused he bent over and examined the incision that ran down the center of phils chest gently kim palpated the raised ridge of healing tissue with the tips of his fingers by such observation and touch kim could accurately tell the internal state of the wound and the incision looks great kim added he straightened up well as far as im concerned you can start training for the boston marathon i dont think thats in my future phil joked but come spring ill certainly be out on the links kim gave the man a pat on the shoulder and then shook his hand enjoy yourself he said but remember to maintain the change weve made in your lifestyle dont worry about that phil said i read all the material you sent home with me and ive taken it to heart no more smoking for this fellow and dont forget the diet and exercise kim added dont worry phil said i dont want to go through this again now it wasnt that bad kim joked no but it was scary phil said kim gave phil another pat on the back jotted a quick note on the chart and left the examination room he stepped across the hall to exam room b but noticed there was no waiting chart in the rack on the door mr norton was the last patient cheryl said from behind kim kim turned around and smiled at his office nurse he ran a tired hand through his tussled hair good kim said what time is it its after seven cheryl said thanks for staying kim said youre welcome cheryl said i hope this chronic overtime doesnt cause you any trouble at home kim said its not a problem cheryl said im getting used to it and so is my husband he knows now to pick my son up from day care kim reversed direction and went into his private office he collapsed into his desk chair and eyed the stack of phone messages hed have to respond to before leaving he rubbed his eyes he was exhausted yet on edge as per usual the stresses of the day had accumulated he would have loved to play some tennis and he vaguely thought about stopping in at the athletic club on his way home maybe he could at least use a stairmaster the door to his office opened and ginger leaned in tracy just called she said with an edge to her voice what about kim asked she wouldnt say ginger reported all she said was to have you call why are you upset ginger exhaled and shifted her weight shes just rude i try to be nice and all i even asked how becky was and what did she say she said just to have you call okay thanks kim said he picked up the phone and started to dial im leaving for aerobics class ginger said with a wave kim acknowledged that hed heard call me later ginger said kim nodded ginger left and closed the door behind her then tracy answered whats up kim asked with no preamble becky is worse tracy said how so her cramps are worse to the point of tears and theres blood in her diarrhea what color kim asked for chrissake what do you mean what color tracy demanded bright red or dark kim asked chartreuse tracy said impatiently im serious kim said bright red or dark red almost brown bright red tracy said how much how am i to tell tracy responded irritably its blood and its red and its scary isnt that enough its not so abnormal to have a little blood in diarrhea kim said i dont like it tracy said what do you want to do youre asking me tracy questioned with disbelief listen youre the doctor not me maybe i should try to call george turner in boston kim said and what is he going to do a thousandplus miles away tracy complained i want her seen and i want her seen tonight okay okay kim said calm down kim paused for a moment to gather his thoughts with george gone he didnt have any handy contacts in pediatrics he considered having one of his internal medicine acquaintances take a peek at becky but was reluctant it seemed excessive to call someone out at night because of mild diarrhea of a couple days duration even if it were tinged with a small amount of bright red blood ill tell you what kim said meet me over at the university med center emergency room when when can you be there kim asked i guess in about a half hour tracy said ill see you then kim said since he was only about ten minutes away from the hospital now that peak traffic time had passed kim used the intervening twenty minutes to return as many phone calls as he could when he got to the emergency room he discovered hed still beat tracy so he stood out on the receiving dock and waited while he stood there several ambulances pulled up to the platform with their screaming sirens trailing off hurriedly the emts unloaded a couple of patients in dire need of emergency care one of them was being given cpr kim watched them disappear inside and it made him nostalgically recall his days as a surgical resident kim had worked hard and had been rewarded by being told repeatedly he was one of the best residents who had ever come through the program it had been a heady time and in many ways more fulfilling than now kim was just about to use his cell phone to try to contact tracy when he saw tracy s volvo station wagon round the corner and pull to a stop kim dropped to the pavement and trotted over to the car as the doors were being opened he went directly to the passenger side and helped becky she smiled at him weakly as she got out are you okay pumpkin kim asked my cramps are worse becky said well well get them taken care of kim said he glanced at tracy whod come around the car kim noticed she looked as irritated as she had the night before kim led the way back to the platform and up the half dozen steps he pushed open the swinging doors and they entered as the major emergency room in a large sprawling midwestern city the unit was so jammed it looked like a busy urban bus station monday nights tended to be particularly busy because of a leftover effect from the weekend with his arm around his daughter kim steered her through the throng in the anteroom where the main admitting desk was located and past the crowded waiting room he was almost past the nurses desk when an enormous brunhildtype nurse stepped out from behind the counter her bulk effectively blocked kim from proceeding any further her name tag read molly mcfadden her height was such that she just about looked kim in the eye sorry molly said you cant come in here on your own you have to check in at the receiving desk kim tried to push by but molly held her ground excuse me kim said im dr reggis im on the staff here and im bringing my daughter in to be seen molly gave a short laugh i dont care if youre pope john whatever she snorted everyone and i mean everyone checks in at the front desk unless theyre carried in here by the emts kim was so shocked he was rendered momentarily speechless he could not believe that not only wasnt he being deferred to he was being openly challenged kim stared disbelievingly into the womans defiant blue eyes she seemed as formidable as a sumo wrestler dressed in white if shed heard kim identify himself as a member of the professional staff she gave no indication whatsoever the sooner you check in doctor molly added the sooner the girl will be seen you did hear me didnt you kim questioned im a senior attending in the department of cardiac surgery of course i heard you doctor molly said the question is did you hear me kim glared at the woman but she was not to be intimidated tracy sensed an impasse having an alltoogood idea of her former husbands temper she took it upon herself to defuse the situation come on dear tracy said to becky lets follow orders and get you checked in she guided becky back the way theyd come kim shot one more nasty look at molly then turned and caught up to tracy and becky together they joined the ragtag line of patients waiting to check in but kim was still fuming im going to complain about that woman kim said shes not going to get away with that kind of insolence the nerve i cant believe it she was only doing her job tracy replied content to let the incident drop she was relieved that kim hadnt caused more of a scene oh really kim snapped does that mean youre trying to defend her calm down tracy said shes undoubtedly just following orders you dont think she makes up the rules do you kim shook his head the line inched ahead at the moment there was only one clerk taking admissions it was her job to fill out the checkin sheet with all the pertinent information including insurance coverage if the patient was not a member of americares health plan beckys face suddenly contorted in pain pressing her hand into her abdomen she whimpered whats the matter kim asked what do you think tracy said its another cramp perspiration appeared on beckys forehead and she became pale she looked pleadingly at her mother itll pass like the others dear tracy said tracy stroked beckys head and then used her hand to remove the moisture from beckys face do you want to sit down becky nodded keep our place tracy said to kim kim watched tracy lead becky over to one of the moldedplastic chairs along the wall becky sat down kim could tell that tracy was talking with her because becky was nodding her head beckys color returned a few minutes later tracy came back how is she kim asked she feels better for the moment tracy said tracy noted how little the line had advanced since theyd joined it cant you think of an alternative to this its monday night kim said a tough night anywhere tracy exhaled noisily i certainly miss dr turner kim nodded he rose up on his tiptoes to see if he could figure out why the queue wasnt moving but he couldnt this is ridiculous he exclaimed ill be right back with his mouth set in a grim line kim skirted the people in front of him to reach the counter immediately he could see why they had not moved forward an inebriated man in a soiled and wrinkled business suit was struggling through the process of checking in all his credit cards had fallen from his wallet on the back of his head was an angry scalp laceration hello kim called out trying to get the receptionists attention she was an africanamerican woman in her midtwenties im dr reggis im on staff in the department of cardiac surgery i have my excuse me the receptionist said interrupting kim i can only deal with one person at a time listen kim ordered im on the staff here it doesnt matter the woman interjected were an equalopportunity server its firstcome firstserved for all routine emergencies routine emergencies kim questioned it was a ridiculous oxymoron all at once the idea of trying to talk to this clerk reminded him of the frustration of having to deal with medically untrained people when he called insurance companies or managedcare plans to get clearance for patients that chore had become one of the truly exasperating problems of modern office practice please wait at the end of the line the receptionist said if youll allow me to concentrate and get these people before you signed in ill be able to take your information sooner she then directed her full attention to the drunk in the interim hed managed to gather the contents of his wallet kim started to protest but it was all too obvious it was a waste of time to try to talk with this woman it occurred to him that she might not even know what the term on staff meant with growing frustration humiliation and irritation kim returned to tracy i dont know where they find these people kim complained theyre like automatons im impressed by how your exalted position in this hospital has greased the skids for us your sarcasm doesnt help one iota kim snapped its all because of the merger im not known down here in fact i cant remember ever coming to this er if youd taken beckys complaints seriously over the weekend we probably wouldnt have to be here now tracy said i took them seriously kim said defensively oh sure tracy said by giving her some overthecounter diarrhea medications thats really an aggressive approach but you know something im not surprised you didnt do more youve never taken seriously any symptoms becky has ever had or mine either for that matter thats not true kim said hotly oh yes it is tracy said only someone married to a surgeon would know what im talking about from your perspective any symptom less than what would call for immediate openheart surgery is a kind of malingering i resent that kim said yeah well so do i tracy said all right miss knowitall kim snapped what would you have had me do with becky over the weekend have her be seen by somebody tracy said one of your many colleagues you must have a thousand doctor friends it wouldnt have been too much to ask wait a second kim said struggling to control himself all becky had was just simple diarrhea and some cramps both of short duration and it was the weekend i wasnt going to bother someone with such symptoms mommy becky called shed come up behind kim and tracy i have to go to the bathroom tracy turned and reminded of her daughters discomfort her anger immediately mellowed she put her arm over beckys shoulder im sorry dear sure well find you a bathroom wait kim said this could be helpful well need a sample ill get a stoolsample container you must be joking tracy said im sure she has to go now hold on becky kim said ill be right back kim walked deliberately and quickly into the depths of the er without becky and tracy he wasnt challenged as he passed the nurses desk for the moment the mammoth molly mcfadden was nowhere to be seen the interior of the er was a series of large rooms divided into separate cubicles by curtains that hung from overhead tracks in addition there were individual trauma rooms replete with stateoftheart equipment there were also a handful of examination rooms used primarily for psychiatric cases like the outer waiting area the er proper was packed and chaotic every trauma room was occupied and staff physicians residents nurses and orderlies swirled between them in continuous motion as he walked kim searched for someone he recognized unfortunately he didnt see anyone he knew he stopped an orderly excuse me kim said i need a stoolsample container asap the orderly gave kim a rapid onceover with his eyes who are you dr reggis kim said you got an id kim produced his hospital identification card okay the orderly said ill be right back kim watched the man disappear through an unmarked door that apparently led to a storeroom coming through a voice called kim turned around in time to see a portable xray unit bearing down on him he stepped to the side as the heavy machine was trundled past by an xray technician a moment later the orderly reappeared he handed kim two clear plastic bags with plastic containers inside thanks kim said dont mention it the orderly said kim hurried back the way hed come tracy and becky were still in line although they had moved up a few feet becky had her eyes shut tight tears streaked her face kim handed one of the plastic bags to tracy cramps he questioned of course you lunkhead tracy said tracy grabbed beckys hand and led her back to the restroom kim held their place in line as it advanced by one more patient now there were two checkin clerks apparently the other had been off on break by ninefifteen the er waiting room was filled to overflowing all the moldedplastic chairs were occupied the rest of the people were leaning up against the walls or sprawled on the floor there was little conversation in one corner a television hung suspended from the ceiling it was tuned to cnn a number of unhappy infants drowned out the newscaster outside it had started to rain the smell of wet wool filled the air kim tracy and becky had eventually found seats together and had not moved except for becky whod made several more trips to the restroom kim was holding the stoolsample container although there had been some spots of bright red blood originally now the contents appeared a uniform light brown becky was miserable and mortified tracy was exasperated kim was still seething i dont believe this kim said suddenly i truly dont believe this every second i think well be called but it doesnt happen he glanced at his watch weve been here an hour and a half welcome to the real world tracy said this is what kelly anderson should have done her merger story about kim said this is ridiculous americare closed the er at the samaritan to cut costs and make everyone come here its all just to maximize profits and maximize inconvenience tracy added its true kim agreed americare definitely wants to discourage emergencyroom usage i cant think of a better way tracy said i cant believe that not one of the staff people has recognized me kim growled its incredible hell im probably the bestknown cardiac surgeon in the department isnt there something you can do tracy pleaded beckys miserable kim stood up all right he said ill try but dont lose your temper tracy admonished it might make everything worse how can it be worse kim replied kim walked out of the waiting room on his way to the nurses desk hed gone only a few steps when the wailing of an ambulance siren reverberated through the main swinging doors to his left a moment later a flashing red light was seen through the doors glass panels the siren died off and soon the doors burst open several bloodied people apparently autoaccident victims were rolled in and whisked into the er proper kim could not help but wonder if these new arrivals meant becky would have to wait that much longer kim approached the nurses desk again he looked for molly mcfadden but she was still out of sight the people there were a clerk who was on the phone transcribing laboratory values and a solitary nurse doing paperwork while sipping coffee her name tag read monica hoskins er staff nurse forcing himself to be civil kim got her attention by gently tapping the countertop good evening he said when she looked up at him perhaps you recognize me monica narrowed her eyes slightly as she gazed at kim no i dont think i do she said should i im on the surgical attending staff kim said but right now im here with my daughter and weve been waiting for over an hour and a half could you tell me when shell be seen its been a busy night especially with auto accidents monica explained whats the name dr reggis kim said he squared his shoulders no the patients name monica said rebecca reggis kim said monica picked up a stack of er signin sheets after wetting the tip of her index finger with her tongue she rapidly flipped through the papers okay she remarked as she withdrew one of them here it is she read the chief complaint and then raised her face to kim she arched her eyebrows diarrhea two days duration she commented not exactly a fourplus emergency kim lifted the stoolsample container to bring it into her line of sight shes been passing a little bit of blood this afternoon kim said monica leaned forward doesnt look like blood it did earlier kim said and it has her mother upset well well get to her as soon as we can monica said noncommittally thats about all i can say she replaced beckys signin sheet to its former location in the stack listen kim said in a deliberately controlled voice as a member of the staff i expect some consideration and after waiting this long already i want her to be seen shortly i hope im making myself clear shes in considerable discomfort monica treated kim to a patently false smile as i said a moment ago well get to her as soon as we can we have limited resources if youve been here for an hour and a half im sure youve seen the auto accidents that have come in and now the police have alerted us a shooting victim is on his way no sooner had these last words escaped from monicas lips than the familiar sound of an arriving ambulance could be heard in fact id wager thats them now monica said as she got to her feet she moved over to an intercom and pressed a button talking to someone in one of the trauma rooms she informed them to get ready then she herself disappeared back into the depths of the er with little satisfaction for his latest efforts kim headed back to the waiting room as he passed by the main entrance doors a team of emts rushed in with the shooting victim on a gurney the patient had an oxygen mask strapped over his face and an iv running his color was ashen well tracy asked as kim reclaimed his seat they said theyd see her as soon as they could kim said he was embarrassed to relate the rest of the conversation he noticed that becky had curled up in her seat as best she could and had her eyes closed thats pretty vague tracy said what does it mean fifteen minutes an hour tomorrow morning it means exactly as soon as they can kim snapped a shooting victim just came in and victims from an auto accident came in a few minutes ago its a busy night tracy sighed and shook her head in frustration hows becky doing kim asked she just had another bout of cramps tracy said so you guess youre the doctor kim looked away gritting his teeth it was hard not to lose his temper and on top of everything else he was hungry for the next hour kim was sullenly silent he was busy brooding over this ridiculous er experience and eager to complain to his colleagues about it they would understand tracy and becky seemed more resigned to the wait every time one of the nurses or residents came to the waitingroom threshold to call out a name kim expected it to be rebecca reggis but it never was finally kim looked at his watch its been two and a half freaking hours he stood up i truly cant believe this if i were the slightest bit paranoid id think it was some kind of screwy conspiracy this time im going to make something happen ill be right back tracy glanced up at her former husband under more normal circumstances shed be concerned about kims temper but after having been kept waiting so long she didnt care she wanted becky seen she didnt comment as kim stalked off kim marched directly back to the nurses desk a number of the er staff was scattered about the station engaged in desultory conversation punctuated by laughter upon reaching the counter kim scanned the group for a recognizable face no one looked familiar and none seemed to recognize him in fact the only person to notice his presence was the clerk a young collegeaged boy who was most likely a student at the university im doctor reggis kim said whats happening he motioned to all the people theyre just taking a breather the clerk said the shooting victim and the last caraccident patients just went up to surgery whos the acting head of the emergency department for the evening shift kim asked that would be dr david washington the clerk said is he here at the moment kim asked the clerk glanced around the area to be sure no he said i believe hes back with an orthopedic case how about a head nurse or nurse supervisor kim asked that would be nora labat the clerk said shes with a psych patient i see kim said thanks kim proceeded down the counter until he was at the very center raising his hand he called out excuse me everybody hello no one acknowledged kims voice or gesture for another moment he glanced around trying to make eye contact with anyone it was impossible instead he reached across the counter and lifted a metallic inandout basket from the desk top holding it above his head for a moment he thought someone might notice they didnt kim brought the metal basket down to crash onto the formica counter he smashed it down twice again each time with more force until the basket became distorted to the shape of a threedimensional parallelogram that got everyones attention conversations stopped in midsentence residents nurses and orderlies all stared at kim a security man whod been standing over near the bank of elevators came running over his hand holding the clutch of keys attached to his belt having worked himself up to a fury kims voice was tremulous i know you all are busy but you certainly dont look busy at the moment ive been waiting here for two and a half hours with my daughter as a professional man myself my time could be spent in much more valuable ways excuse me sir the security man said he took hold of kims arm kim yanked his arm free and spun around on the man dont you touch me kim snarled the security man wisely stepped back while he grappled for his twoway radio kim was not only a half a foot taller but also significantly more muscled no need to contact anyone kim said he pulled out his hospital id and held it up to the security mans face im on the staff here even though no one here in the emergency department seems willing to concede it the security mans eyes narrowed as he read kims id card sorry doctor he said thats quite all right kim said with a controlled voice he turned back to the desk monica hoskins had stepped forward id like to talk with dr david washington kim said im sorry youve had to wait monica said were doing the best we can nonetheless id like to speak to the acting head of the department kim said dr washington is tied up with a pneumothorax molly explained i want to see him now kim said evenly im sure there must be at least one resident competent to handle a pneumothorax just a moment monica said she stepped back and out of earshot from kim conferred with molly and several of the other staff in less than a minute she returned to kim in the background one of the nurses shed been talking with picked up a phone well have someone here in authority to talk with you momentarily monica said its about time kim remarked kims minitantrum had unnerved the staff and most of them vacated the nurses desk for the interior of the er monica took the inandout basket kim had bent and tried to bend it back she was unsuccessful kims pulse was racing a sudden commotion behind him made him turn around a teenage girl was being escorted by a vanguard of emts she was sobbing both wrists were bound with bloody dishtowels a clear suicide attempt no doubt in this young womans case a desperate cry for help kim looked expectantly into the er depths after the teenager was taken in he expected to see the doctorincharge appear at any moment instead he felt a tap on his shoulder turning around he was surprised to see tracy wheres becky kim asked in the restroom tracy answered its a routine visit this time but i have to get right back i just came in here to beg you not to have one of your narcissistic rages when you stood up in the waiting room to come in here i didnt think i cared whether you got into a furor or not but i do im convinced it wont improve an already bad situation in fact it might cause becky to have to wait even longer spare me your psychobabble kim spat all im planning on is a sane but pointed conversation with the man who runs this place i mean this is unacceptable plain and simple just try to control yourself tracy said icily when youre done youll know where to find us tracy turned around and walked back toward the waiting room kim drummed his fingers impatiently on the counter after a while he looked at his watch another five minutes had passed once again he leaned out into the corridor to peer back into the er depths he saw plenty of staff but no one came striding in his direction kims eyes met the clerks who immediately averted his gaze the rest of the er staff avoided looking at kim instead busying themselves with paperwork a muffled bell sounded to herald the arrival of an elevator kim looked over to see a hefty man dressed in a conservative gray business suit disembark to kims surprise he came directly up to him dr reggis the man inquired his voice was robust and commanding im dr reggis kim agreed im barclay bradford the man said stiffly im a vice president of the hospital and the acting chief administrator for the evening shift how convenient kim said what id advise you to do is to go back into the er locate the asshole acting head of the department and drag him out here he and i have something to talk about you see ive been waiting for two and a half hours to have my daughter seen dr reggis barclay began as if kim had not even spoken as a member of our professional staff particularly a surgeon you of all people know that triage is necessary in a busy er lifethreatening problems have to take precedence over simple juvenile diarrhea of course i understand triage kim shot back ive worked in ers all through my training but let me tell you something when i walked in here ten minutes ago there had to be a dozen er staff hanging out behind this counter drinking coffee and chitchatting appearances never tell the whole story barclay commented condescendingly he fluttered his eyelids they were probably conferring with each other over particularly difficult cases but regardless your childish behavior of pounding a letter box on a countertop cannot be tolerated its entirely inappropriate for you to demand special treatment special treatment kim sputtered childish behavior his face reddened and his eyes bulged the administrator in front of him suddenly embodied his frustrations about the present emergencyroom experience the hospital merger americare and modern medicine in general with a sudden fit of fury and losing all semblance of control kim struck the administrator with a lightning blow to the chin kim shook his hand and clasped it with his other in response to the sudden pain in his knuckle at the same time barclay rocked back on his heels teetered then fell heavily to the floor kim was stunned by his violent reaction taking a step forward he looked down at barclay and felt an impulse to help the man up a collective gasp arose from the staff behind the desk the security guard came running the clerk grabbed the intercom to announce mayday at the nurses desk from the depths of the er residents nurses and orderlies came streaming out even tracy appeared after hearing the announcement a crowd gathered around kim and barclay the hospital vp had pushed himself up to a sitting position he touched a hand to his lip it was bleeding damn it kim tracy said i warned you this is totally unacceptable monica said she turned to the clerk call the police hold up dont call anybody a deep resonant voice called the crowd parted a powerfully built handsome africanamerican man appeared he snapped latex gloves from his hands as he walked into the center of the ring the name tag pinned to his scrub top read dr david washington acting chief emergency department his eyes went from kim down to barclay whats going on here mr bradford was just struck by this man monica said pointing at kim and that was after he destroyed a letter box by bashing it against the counter believe it or not hes a doctor on the hospital staff molly added david put out a hand and got barclay to his feet david glanced at the mans split lip and palpated along the line of his jaw are you all right david asked the administrator i think so barclay said he got out a handkerchief and dabbed at his bloodied lip david turned to monica take mr bradford back and get him cleaned up and have dr krugger take a look at him to see if we should get an xray sure monica said she grasped barclays arm above the elbow to guide him through the crowd barclay glared at kim before allowing himself to be led away everyone else back to work david said with a wave of his hand then he turned to kim whod recovered his senses what is your name david asked dr kim reggis did you really hit mr bradford david asked incredulously im afraid so kim said what on earth could have provoked you david asked kim took a deep breath that prick condescendingly accused me of demanding special treatment when my sick child has been waiting for two and a half hours david stared at kim for a beat he was mystified at such behavior from a colleague whats the childs name he asked rebecca reggis kim said david turned to the clerk and asked for rebeccas signin sheet the clerk fumbled through the stack are you really on staff here at the university med center david asked while he waited for the sheet since the merger kim said im one of the cardiac surgeons although youd never know it the way ive been treated here in the er we do the best we can david said yeah ive heard that excuse several times tonight kim said david eyed kim again you know you should be ashamed of yourself he said punching people out smashing letter boxes youre acting like some malcontent teenager screw you kim said for the moment im going to chalk that remark up to stress david said dont be patronizing kim said here it is the clerk said he handed the signin sheet to david david glanced at it then looked at his watch at least youre right about the time its been close to three hours thats certainly no justification for your behavior but its too long to wait david looked at tracy are you mrs reggis he asked im rebecca reggiss mother tracy said why dont you get the young lady ill personally see to it shes seen immediately thank you tracy said she hurried out to the waiting room david went behind the desk to get a clipboard for the signin sheet he also used the intercom to get a nurse to come out when he reemerged tracy was back with becky in tow a moment later a nurse appeared her name tag identified her as nicole michaels how are you feeling young lady david asked becky not too good becky admitted i want to go home im sure you do david said but first lets check you out why dont you go ahead with nicole shell get you situated in one of the examination cubicles tracy becky and kim started forward david reached out to restrain kim id prefer that you wait out here if you dont mind david said im going with my daughter kim stated no you are not david said youve proved yourself emotionally stressed youre acting like a loose cannon kim hesitated as much as he didnt want to admit it david had a point still it was irritating and demeaning come on doctor david said surely you understand kim cast a glance at the receding image of becky and tracy he looked back at david who was not about to be intimidated physically or otherwise but kim began no buts david said dont make me call the police which ill do if you dont cooperate reluctantly kim turned around and walked back to the waiting room there were no seats so he leaned up against the wall by the entrance he tried to watch the television but couldnt concentrate he raised his hand and looked at it he was trembling a half hour later tracy and becky emerged from the treatment area it was by chance that kim happened to see them as they pushed through the exit door they were leaving without even having tried to find him kim quickly gathered his coat and gloves and hurried after them he caught up to them just as tracy was helping becky climb into the car what are you going to do kim demanded just ignore me tracy didnt say anything she shut the door behind becky and then walked around to the driversside door kim followed and put his hand on the door to keep it from opening please dont cause any more trouble tracy said youve already embarrassed both of us taken aback by this new and unexpected affront kim took his hand away tracy got into the car she reached for the door but then didnt close it she looked up into kims surprised and hurt face go home and get some sleep she said thats what were going to do what happened in there kim asked what did they say not much tracy reported apparently her blood count and electrolytes whatever they are are fine im supposed to give her broth and other fluids and lay off the dairy products is that all kim asked thats it tracy said but by the way they said the culprit could very well have been gingers chicken they see a lot of food poisoning secondary to chicken it wasnt kim shot back no way ask becky she was feeling sick the morning before the chicken kim leaned over to talk directly to his daughter isnt that right pumpkin i want to go home becky said staring out through the windshield good night kim tracy said she pulled the door shut started the car and drove away kim watched the car until it had disappeared behind the corner of the hospital only then did he start walking toward the doctors parking area he felt alone more alone than hed ever felt in his life seven tuesday january th the or door burst open and kim and tom entered the scrub area outside or number as they did so they untied their face masks and let them drop down over their chests they rinsed off the talc from their hands hey thanks for lending a hand on such short notice tom said glad to help kim said flatly the two men started walking up the corridor toward the recovery room you seem down in the dumps tom said what happened did your accountant just call you about your bottom line in response to the new medicare reimbursement rates kim didnt laugh he didnt respond at all are you all right tom asked seriously this time i suppose kim said without emotion just a lot of aggravation kim then told tom what had happened in the er the night before whoa tom commented when kim was finished what a god awful experience but dont be down on yourself for taking a poke at that barclay bradford character i had a mini runin with him myself administrators you know i read in a journal last night that in the united states theres currently one administrator for every one and a half doctors or nurses can you believe that yeah i can kim said thats a big part of why our healthcare costs are so high that was exactly the point of the article tom said but anyway i can understand why you popped bradford if it had been me i know i would have been bullshit three hours hell id a punched him out as a minimum thanks tom kim said i appreciate your support but the worst part of the whole episode is that after all that wait and aggravation i never got a chance to talk with the doctor who examined becky hows she doing today i dont know yet kim said it was too early for me to call when i got up and tracy hasnt called me but shes got to be doing better her bloodwork was fine and shes been afebrile dr reggis a voice called kim turned to see deborah silverman the or head nurse beckoning toward him kim detoured to the or desk dr biddle called while you were in surgery deborah said he left a message for you to stop into his office as soon as you were out kim took the message slip it was punctuated with a number of exclamation points apparently it was serious uhoh tom commented over kims shoulder sounds to me like the chief is planning on adding to your aggravation kim and tom parted ways at the recoverymom door kim went into the surgical locker room despite the implied urgency of forrester biddles message kim took his time it wasnt hard to guess what forrester wanted to see him about the problem was that after a point kim wasnt sure he understood his own behavior kim took a shower and mulled over in his mind the previous evenings experience he didnt reach any epiphany beyond admitting hed been unduly stressed after dressing in a clean set of scrubs kim used the phone in the surgical lounge to call ginger at the office to discuss the afternoon schedule only then did he make his way over to the chiefs office in the administration wing dr forrester biddle was the quintessential new england conservative he had the gaunt look of a puritan preacher and the acerbic personality to go with it his only redeeming quality was that he was an excellent surgeon come in and close the door forrester said as kim stepped into his cramped journalfilled office take a seat kim sat down forrester made him wait while some paperwork was being completed kims eyes roamed the room kim noted hed had a much better office as chief over at the samaritan after adding his signature with a flourish forrester slapped down his pen on his desk top so that it sounded like a distant report of a firearm ill get right to the point he said assuming an expression more stern than usual your behavior last night in the emergency room is an embarrassment to this department as well as to the entire medical staff my daughter was in pain kim said simply it was an explanation not an excuse he was not inclined to sound remorseful theres no excuse for violence forrester remarked mr bradford is considering filing charges and i wouldnt blame him if he did if anybody gets sued it should be americare kim said i waited over three hours mostly so that americare can maximize profits assaulting an administrator is no way to make social commentary forrester said nor i might add is appealing directly to the media i wasnt going to say anything about your quote kelly anderson gave during the friday night news until this inexcusable episode of battery saying publicly that the rationale for the merger of the university medical center and the samaritan was to benefit americares bottom line hurts the reputation of this hospital kim stood up the meeting was not going to be a discussion and there was no way kim would sit there and absorb reprimands like a delinquent schoolboy if thats all i have patients to see forrester pushed his chair back and stood up as well i think you should keep in mind dr reggis he said this department seriously considered hiring a fulltime salaried surgeon to cover your area of valve replacement prior to the merger your behavior of late is making us reevaluate that issue kim turned around and left without responding he wasnt about to validate such a comment it was hardly the threat that forrester intended in reality kim was being repeatedly recruited to take over a number of prestigious departments around the country the only reason he was still at the university medical center was because of shared custody of becky and the fact that tracy couldnt move because of her matriculation in the liberal arts college but kim was again angry of late it seemed to be his constant state of mind striding out of the administrative area of the hospital he practically ran headon into kelly anderson and her cameraman brian ah kelly squealed with apparent delight dr reggis just the man ive been hoping to see kim flashed a nasty glance at the tv journalist and continued down the corridor at a brisk pace kelly reversed directions and ran after him brian kept pace despite his burden of equipment my god dr reggis kelly panted are you in training for a marathon slow down i need to talk with you ive no intention of talking with you kim said but i want to hear your side of last nights er episode kelly said kim pulled up short forcing brian to collide with him brian apologized effusively kim ignored him and peered at kelly in surprise how in gods name did you hear about that and so quickly surprised you huh kelly remarked with a sly selfsatisfied smile but im sure you understand that i cant reveal my sources you see i do so many medicalrelated stories that ive developed a kind of fifth column here at the med center youd be surprised about the gossip i get unfortunately its usually as prosaic as whos screwing whom but once in a while i get a real tip like your episode in the er last night cardiac surgeon punches out administrator thats news i dont have anything to say to you kim responded he recommenced walking kelly caught up to him ah but i think you do she said having to wait three hours in an emergency room with a sick child must have been a major aggravation that id love to discuss too bad kim said among other things i was just reprimanded for giving you that bottomline quote im not talking with you so the administration hates the truth kelly said that in itself is interesting im not talking to you kim repeated you might as well save your breath oh come on kelly said your having to wait hours to be seen in the emergency room will strike a familiar chord with my viewers especially with the ironic twist that its a doctor doing the waiting we dont even have to discuss the assault and battery part if you dont want yeah sure as if i could trust you kim said you can kelly said you see i think having to wait so long relates to the merger story i believe it has something to do with americares interest in profits what do you think kim looked at kelly as they walked her bright bluegreen eyes sparkled kim had to admit that although she was a pain in the neck she was also smart as a whip you said it not me kim remarked so no quotes my life right now is sufficiently screwed up that i dont need you to make it worse goodbye miss anderson kim went through a pair of swinging doors leading back into the operating area kelly pulled to a stop to the relief of brian both were out of breath well we tried kelly said the sad irony is that this time im sincerely sympathetic a month ago i had to wait almost the same amount of time with my own daughter kim entered his office complex by the back door it gave him a chance to get into his private office without having to go through the waiting room as he struggled out of his suit jacket he picked up his phone and got ginger at the reception desk im back kim said with the receiver caught in the crook of his neck he walked over to his closet the telephone wire was just long enough youve got a waitingroom full of patients ginger said thanks to toms emergency surgery youre about two hours behind schedule any phone messages of import kim asked he managed to get his jacket hung up and grabbed his short white doctors jacket nothing that cant wait ginger said no calls from tracy no ginger said okay have cheryl start moving the patients into the examining rooms kim said after slipping on the white jacket and collecting the pens and other paraphernalia he kept in his pockets kim dialed tracy s number while the call went through he draped his stethoscope around his neck tracy answered on the first ring as if she were right next to the phone well hows the patient doing kim asked he tried to sound upbeat not a lot of change tracy said any fever how about cramps kim asked some tracy said but i was able to get her to take some chicken broth kim was tempted to say that ginger had tried to get her to eat chicken broth on sunday but then he thought better of it instead he said it sounds like youre making progress ill bet becky will be feeling herself in no time i certainly hope so tracy said it stands to reason kim said with no fever and no elevated white count her bodys obviously handled the infection but keep me posted okay i will tracy said then she added im sorry if i was mean last night you dont have to apologize kim said i feel i said some nasty things tracy said i was very upset please kim said i was the one out of line not you ill call if theres any change tracy said ill either be here or at home kim said kim hung up the phone for the first time all day he felt relatively content walking out into the corridor he smiled at cheryl and took the first chart when kim turned off the headlights of his car in front of his garage door he found himself in pitch dark it was only eight oclock but it could have been midnight there was no moon and the only light was a slight smudge on the eastern horizon where the city lights reflected off the low cloud cover the house was so dark it appeared like a hunk of rock kim opened the car door and the interior lights came on that gave him an opportunity to collect the cartons of chinese takeout hed picked up on the way back from his office the last patient had left at sevenfifteen with his arms full of food containers and paperwork he hoped to complete that evening kim made his way from the driveway toward the front door he had to move by feel along the flagstone walkway as dark as it was it was difficult to comprehend that during the summer at that very time of the evening the sun would have still been in the sky kim heard his phone even before he got to the door it was jangling insistently in the darkness without knowing why kim felt a stab of panic in the process of getting his keys out he dropped the paperwork then he couldnt find the right key which forced him to put down the food cartons so that he could use both hands finally he got the door open and rushed inside with the help of the foyer light kim dashed into the cavernous mostly empty living room and answered the phone he was irrationally terrified that whoever was calling would hang up before the connection went through but it didnt happen it was tracy shes worse tracy blurted she sounded desperate and on the verge of tears whats happened kim demanded as his heart skipped a beat she hemorrhaged tracy cried the toilets full of blood is she lucid kim asked quickly yes tracy said shes calmer than i am shes on the couch can she walk kim asked is she dizzy she can walk okay tracy said getting more in control of herself im glad you answered the phone i was about to call get her into the car and back to the er kim said provided you think you can drive okay otherwise we can call for an ambulance i can drive fine tracy said ill meet you there kim said he hung up the phone then he raced into the library and tore open the central drawer of his desk roughly he searched through the contents looking for his address book when he found it he opened it to the ts and ran his finger down until he came to george turner taking out his cell phone he entered the number and pressed send with the phone pressed to his ear kim retraced his route to the car he stepped over the chinese takeout leaving the cartons and the paperwork strewn over the doormat mrs turner answered just as kim opened the car door without any pleasantries he asked if george were available by the time george was on the line kim was already backing out the driveway sorry to bother you kim said no bother george said whats up nothing i hope im afraid so kim said i mean its nothing earthshattering its just that beckys sick with dysenterylike symptoms cramps diarrhea and now some bleeding but no fever im sorry to hear that george said we never got another pediatrician after you left kim explained guiltily and the few i knew including yourself all left town last night we took her to the emergency room at the university med center and ended up waiting for three hours god thats terrible george said im embarrassed to say i punched out one of the americare administrators over it kim said anyway becky was sent home with nothing no medications tracy just called me to tell me she hemorrhaged i dont know how much but tracy was a bit hysterical im on my way to meet them at the er who should i have see her hmmmm george intoned i dont think a pediatrician would be best i guess id recommend either an infectiousdisease specialist or a gi person well which kim asked and would you recommend one the consults i deal with dont see kids as a rule youve got a lot of superb people george said i guess id recommend an infectiousdisease guy at least initially try to get claude faraday you cant do better than claude anyplace thanks george kim said my pleasure george said sorry im not around me too kim said keep me posted george said i will kim said kim disconnected then used speeddialing to get the hospital he had the hospital operator patch him through to claude faraday to kims relief the man was at home kim explained the situation much as he did to george claude listened asked a few pertinent questions and then graciously agreed to come to the er directly kim pulled into the hospital on this occasion he drove directly around to the parking area reserved for the emergency room he looked briefly for tracy s volvo when he didnt see it he went up the steps to the er platform and pushed inside the emergency room appeared to kim nearly as busy as it did the night before although he saw some empty chairs in the waiting room he bypassed the reception and went directly to the nurses desk both molly and monica happened to be sitting there as he came in they exchanged nervous glances has my daughter come in yet tonight kim asked i havent seen her molly said she seemed disinterested and a tinge wary at the same time nor i monica said is she supposed to come in again molly asked kim didnt bother to answer he left the desk and headed directly back into the emergency room proper hey where are you going molly demanded she stood up with the idea of coming around the edge of the desk to bar kims passage as shed done the previous night but kim was already beyond molly hurried after him monica snapped her fingers to get the security mans attention when he looked over she pointed frantically at kims disappearing figure the security man nodded and started after him as well as he trotted he slipped his twoway radio out from its holster kim walked the length of the first room sticking his nose into each cubicle as he went along molly caught up to him just what do you think you are doing she demanded kim ignored the woman who was joined by the security man they trailed after kim what should i do the security man asked molly i mean he is a doctor i havent the slightest idea molly said kim ran out of cubicles on one side of the room and started on those on the opposite side finally he found david washington suturing a laceration on a childs hand a nurse was assisting him david was wearing twoplus oculars and he regarded kim over the top of them my daughters on her way in kim announced now shes apparently passing frank blood im sorry to hear that david said whats her blood pressure and pulse that i dont know kim said my exwife is bringing her in i havent seen her yet with his sterile gloved hands raised in the air david turned to molly and asked her to get a mom ready with a crash cart and plasma expanders in case they were needed molly nodded and disappeared i want my daughter seen immediately kim ordered and i want her to have an infectiousdisease consult dr reggis david said lets try to be friends it would help if you recognize im in charge here ive already talked with dr claude faraday kim said as if hed not heard david hes on his way i presume you know him of course i know him david said thats not the point the usual protocol is for us to order the consults if the patient does not have an americare gatekeeper americare is very clear on this issue i want dr faraday to see her kim averred all right david said but at least understand we are doing you a favor this is not the way things are usually done here thank you kim said he turned and walked back the length of the room he scanned the reception area and when he didnt see tracy and becky he went out onto the receiving platform he stood waiting just as hed done the evening before he didnt have long to wait within minutes tracy s station wagon appeared and drove practically up to the platform itself kim jumped down and was at the back door by the time tracy was pulling on the emergency brake he opened the door and leaned in becky was lying on the backseat on her side kim could see her face with the help of the floodlights on the receiving platform although she appeared pale she smiled at him and he felt relieved how do you feel pumpkin kim asked better now becky said the cramp went away im glad kim said come on let me carry you i can walk becky said ill carry you just the same kim said he got his right arm under her knees and slid her out so that he could get his left arm under her upper body he hoisted her up she put her own arms around his neck and buried her face under his chin okay kim said soothingly daddy has you shes not too heavy is she tracy asked not at all kim said kim led the way first up the stairs and then bucking through the swinging doors as he walked past reception with tracy directly behind him one of the clerks called out that they had to checkin kim ignored her although tracy felt uncomfortable she didnt say anything monica was sitting at the nurses desk when she heard the clerk call out looking up she saw kim approaching immediately she leaped to her feet and stepped into the hall to bar the way but she was not molly no you dont monica said youre not bringing that child in without a signin sheet kim continued walking monica took several steps backward you cant do this she protested tracy tugged on kims arm lets not have a scene she said relentless as a steamroller kim continued forward monica did not have mollys bulk and was forced to the side you can get the information from last nights signin sheet kim called over his shoulder monica rushed back into the desk area to page david washington kim carried becky into the first available cubicle he laid her on the gurney tracy came in to stand on the opposite side and hold beckys hand kim took the bloodpressure cuff and wrapped it around her other arm monica reappeared after putting in her page and tried to take over but kim would not hear of it he put a stethoscope in his ears and started to inflate the cuff david washington and molly mcfadden entered david had a white jacket thrown over his scrubs he nodded a greeting to tracy and waited for kim to finish taking the blood pressure he also motioned to monica that she could leave you have no respect for protocol david commented as kim took the stethoscope from his ears her blood pressure is ninety over fifty kim said lets get an iv going i want her typed and crossmatched just in case also hold up david yelled raising his hand for emphasis then in a calm voice he added dr reggis with all due respect youve already forgotten that you are not in charge here im just covering the basics kim said miss mcfadden how about getting me a twentyonegauge catheter and ill need a tourniquet and some tape david motioned for molly to stay where she was while he went up to kim he wrapped one of his sizable hands around kims forearm im only going to ask you once david said in his calm but commanding voice i want you to walk out of here and wait outside its in your daughters best interest im sure that if you just stop and think for a moment youll understand kims eyes narrowed as he stared at david slowly he looked down at davids hand clasped around his arm for a moment no one said a word the only sound came from a cardiac monitor in another cubicle tracy sensed the electricity in the air for her it was like the explosive calm just prior to a sudden summer thunderstorm to avert an undoubtedly unpleasant scene she dashed around the foot of the gurney and put her arm over kims shoulder and tugged on him please kim she pleaded lets let them do their thing gradually kim responded to tracy s urging and he visibly relaxed a degree david took his hand away kim nodded to tracy okay he said then turning back to becky he gripped her tiny arm daddy will be right outside pumpkin i dont want any needles becky said plaintively they want to give you some fluid kim said but it will be only one stick it will be over in a second i know its no fun but youve got to be strong so you can get back to normal okay okay becky said reluctantly tracy gave beckys hand a squeeze and told her that she would be with kim and that they would be back in to see her in a few moments becky nodded but she clearly wasnt happy she looked scared tracy followed kim out through the curtain surrounding beckys gurney she could hear that he was breathing fast she didnt say anything until they had passed the nurses desk kim you have to calm down tracy said she put her hand gently on his arm youre so tense david washington drives me up a wall kim snapped hes doing his job tracy said if the situation were reversed and you were taking care of his child im sure youd act the same way he has you wouldnt want him giving orders kim pondered this as he pushed through the swinging doors to the outside the blast of cold air felt good on his face he stopped on the platform and took a deep breath he slowly let it out tracy still had a hold of his arm i guess youre right he said finally its hard for me to see becky lying there and so vulnerable i can imagine tracy said it must be very difficult their eyes met you can understand kim asked seriously absolutely tracy said youre a surgeon you are trained to act and who would you want to take care of more than your own child for you the hardest thing in the world is to see becky in need and not do something youre right kim said of course i am tracy said im always right in spite of himself kim smiled now im not going to go that far frequently maybe but not always ill accept that provided we go back inside tracy said with a smile im freezing sure im sorry kim said i just needed a breath of cold air does the iv bother you kim asked becky becky raised her left hand which was taped to a flat wristboard a length of clear plastic tubing dove into the gauze covering the back of her hand i cant feel it at all she said thats the way its supposed to be kim said does it feel cold tracy said thats what i remember when i was in the hospital having you it does feel cold becky remarked i didnt know it until you said it my whole arm is cold david had carefully examined becky had started the iv had done routine bloodwork and urinalysis and had a flat plate and an upright xray taken of her abdomen although hed yet to see the xrays since they were not yet available the blood and urine results were all normal suggesting the blood loss had been minimal at that point hed sent for kim and tracy to keep becky company while they waited for dr claude faraday the infectiousdisease specialist arrived a few minutes later he introduced himself to kim and tracy and then to becky he was a slender darkcomplected man with an intense manner he listened to a full recounting of beckys problem from the very first symptoms saturday morning until the episode of hemorrhage that evening he nodded every so often especially when becky herself added specific details okay miss reggis he said to becky would you mind if i looked you over a bit becky looked at tracy as if she had to get permission dr faraday is asking you if its all right for him to examine you tracy translated for becky its okay becky said i just dont want any more needles no more needles claude assured her claude started his rapid but thorough examination by feeling beckys pulse and checking the turgor of her skin he looked into her mouth and ears he used an ophthalmoscope to peer into her eyes he listened to her chest and checked her skin for rashes he gently poked into her abdomen which was tender he searched for enlarged lymph nodes you seem okay to me except for that slightly sore belly he said at last now im going to step outside and talk to your parents okay becky nodded tracy leaned over and gave her daughter a kiss on the forehead before following claude and kim out through the curtain the corridor was busy so the group drew to the side to avoid the bustle david happened to see them and walked over he introduced himself to claude i was just about to give a summary to the parents claude said to david mind if i listen in david asked claude looked at kim and tracy thats fine tracy said all in all she looks good to me claude began shes a little pale of course and a bit dehydrated theres also some generalized abdominal tenderness otherwise on physical exam shes quite normal but the hemorrhage tracy questioned she was afraid claude was about to dismiss the case let me finish claude said i also went over her laboratory work compared to last night there is a slight drop in her hemoglobin its not statistically significant but in view of the mild dehydration it might be important considering the history of the hemorrhage theres also a slight drop in her platelets otherwise everything is within normal limits whats your presumptive diagnosis kim asked id have to say foodborne bacterial illness claude said not viral kim asked no i think its bacterial claude said he looked at david i believe that was your feeling last night as well wasnt it yes it was david said but why no fever kim asked the fact that there has been no fever makes me think this has been more a toxemia than an infection claude said which also goes along with the normal white count what about last nights culture kim asked is there a preliminary twentyfourhour reading i didnt see a culture claude said he looked at david we didnt do a culture last night david said kim shook his head in disbelief what the hell are you talking about he demanded i even gave you the sample we dont do routine stool cultures for simple diarrhea here in the er david said kim slapped his hand to his forehead wait a sec you just said youd made a presumptive diagnosis of a bacterial infection why wouldnt you do a culture it just stands to reason much less being good medicine how else could you treat rationally americare utilization rules proscribe routine cultures in this kind of case david said its not costeffective kims face reddened tracy was the only one who noticed she reached out and gripped kims arm he pulled it free costeffective what kind of screwball excuse is that what the hell kind of emergency room are you running here youre telling me that to save a few measly dollars you failed to do a culture listen you prima donna david snapped i just told you its standard operating procedure not to do them not for you not for anybody losing control as hed done the night before kim grabbed david by the lapels of his white jacket prima donna am i well your goddamn screwedup operating procedure has lost us a whole damn day tracy grabbed kims arm no kim she cried not again take your hands off me you arrogant sonofabitch david growled calm down claude said as he insinuated himself between the two much larger men its okay well run some cultures stat we havent lost that much because i doubt wed treat anyway kim let go of david david smoothed his jacket each man glared at the other what would you expect to see in the culture tracy asked hoping to defuse the situation and get the conversation back on track what kind of bacteria do you think is involved mainly salmonella shigella and some of the newer strains of e coli claude said but it could be a lot of other things as well the blood scared me tracy said i guess it looked like more than it was will she be admitted claude looked at david its not a bad idea he said but its not my call i think it is a good idea david said she needs fluids then we can evaluate the possibility of anemia and make sure theres no more bleeding what about antibiotics tracy asked i wouldnt recommend it claude said not at this juncture not until we have a definitive diagnosis which is why the goddamn culture should have been done last night kim growled please kim tracy urged we have to deal with the current situation it would be nice if youd try to be helpful all right kim said resignedly if we dont have a culture why not use a broadspectrum antibiotic it can always be changed once the organism and its sensitivities are known it would not be my recommendation claude repeated if the offending agent turns out to be one of the aberrant strains of e coli antibiotics can make the situation worse now how can that be kim said thats ridiculous im afraid not claude said antibiotics can decimate the normal flora and give the renegade e coli more room to flourish will she be admitted to your care tracy asked claude no thats not possible claude said americare requires a gatekeeper but ill be happy to look in on her especially if whoever handles the case requests an infectiousdisease consult since becky does not have a staff pediatrician shell be admitted under the care of claire stevens david said its her rotation i can give her a call you cant do much better than claire claude remarked you know her tracy asked very well claude said youre lucky its her rotation she takes care of my kids finally something seems to be going right kim said eight wednesday january st kim turned into the hospital parking lot a little after six in the morning hed skipped stopping at his office as he normally did he was eager to look in on becky and make sure everything was okay the previous night things had gone well after the unpleasant episode with david washington dr claire stevens had come into the er within a half hour of being paged in the interim kim had phoned george turner for the second time that evening this gave him a chance to ask georges opinion about the pediatrician george had echoed claudes sentiments and both kim and tracy had felt relieved claire was a tall thin woman nearly kims height her features were sharp but they were belied by her gentle reassuring manner kims personal impressions of her added to the professional testimonials she was about his age which suggested years of clinical experience under her belt whats more her competence was immediately apparent and reassuring of equal importance she established immediate rapport with becky kim pushed into beckys room there was a nightlight near the floor that reflected off the ceiling casting a gentle glow over the entire room kim advanced silently to the bedside and looked down at his sleeping daughter her halo of dark hair made her face appear the color of ivory its translucency gave her a fragile look as if she were made of porcelain kim knew that under the circumstances it was appropriate for becky to be in the hospital at the same time her being there gave him great anxiety his vast experiences in hospitals reminded him that it was an environment where horror could lurk beckys breathing was regular and deep her iv was running slowly happy to see her resting so well kim quietly backed out he did not want to disturb her back at the nurses station kim withdrew beckys chart he glanced through the admitting notes that claire had dictated then turned to the nurses notes he noticed becky had been up twice during the night with continued diarrhea there had been some blood reported but only by becky none of the nurses had seen it kim then turned to the order sheet and was pleased to see that claire had followed up on her word shed requested a pediatric gastroenterology consult for that day now thats one delightful child a lilting voice said kim looked up glancing over his shoulder was a plump nurse with a face red from exertion her blond hair was permed into a multitude of tight ringlets her cheeks were dimpled her name tag indicated she was janet emery have you been looking in on her kim asked yup janet said her rooms in my area cute as a button that one how has she been doing kim asked okay i guess janet said without a lot of conviction that doesnt sound too positive kim said a minute sliver of fear eked its way up his spine giving him an involuntary shiver the last time she was up she seemed weak janet said of course it might have been because she was sleeping she rang for me to come help her back to bed i understand from the chart that you didnt get to see how much blood she might have passed kim said thats right janet said the poor thing is embarrassed to beat the band i tried to tell her not to flush after she uses the toilet but she does anyway what can you do kim made a mental note to talk to claire about that problem and to becky as well it would be important to know if the blood was mere spotting or worse are you a consult on the case janet asked no kim said im dr reggis beckys father oh my goodness janet said i thought you were a consult i hope i didnt say anything out of line not at all kim said i certainly got the feeling you care for her absolutely janet said i just adore children thats why i work this floor kim went off to see his inpatients and then attend the series of hospital conferences scheduled for that morning like mondays wednesdays were particularly busy with respect to his administrative responsibilities consequently he didnt get back to beckys floor until almost ten when he did the ward clerk informed him that becky was off to xray he was also told that tracy had come in and was with her can you tell me about the status of the gastroenterology consult kim asked its been ordered the clerk said if thats what you mean any idea when it will be kim asked sometime this afternoon id guess the clerk said would you mind giving me a call when it does happen kim asked he handed the clerk one of his cards not at all the clerk said kim thanked him and hurried off to his office he would have preferred to see becky and talk to her even if for a moment but he didnt have the time he was already behind schedule a fact that he was philosophical about since it tended to happen more often than not well mr amendola kim said do you have any questions mr amendola was a heavyset plumber in his early sixties he was intimidated by modern medicine and horrified by kims verdict he needed a valve in his heart replaced a few weeks earlier hed been blissfully unaware he even had valves in his heart now after experiencing some scary symptoms he knew that one of them was bad and had the potential to kill him kim ran a nervous hand through his hair as mr amendola pondered the last question kims eyes wandered out the window to the pale wintery sky he had been preoccupied ever since tracy had called an hour earlier to say she thought becky didnt look good that she was glassyeyed and listless with a waitingroom full of patients kims response had been to instruct tracy to page claire and to tell her beckys status he also told tracy to remind the clerk to call him when the gastroenterology consult arrived maybe i should talk to my children mr amendola said excuse me kim said hed forgotten what hed asked the man my children mr amendola said i got to ask them what they think the old man should do good idea kim said he stood discuss it with your family if you have any questions just call kim walked mr amendola to the door youre sure the tests youve done are right mr amendola asked maybe my valve isnt so bad its bad kim said remember we got a second opinion true mr amendola said with resignation okay ill get back to you kim waited in the corridor until it was certain mr amendola was on his way to reception then kim lifted the heavy chart of the next patient out of the chart rack on the back of the door to the second examining room before kim had even read the name ginger appeared at the end of the corridor she had to move out of the way for mr amendola to pass i just got a call from the ward clerk on beckys floor she reported im supposed to tell you that the gastro somethingorother doctor is seeing becky at this very moment then im out of here kim said quickly he replaced the chart into its rack and stepped into his private office while he was getting his suit jacket from the closet ginger came in where are you going she asked back to the hospital kim said when will you be back ginger asked i dont know kim said he pulled on his winter coat let cheryl know so that the patient doesnt sit and wait in the examining room what about the other patients ginger said tell them theres been an emergency kim said ill be back but probably not for an hour and a half or so kim picked up his car keys and went to his rear door ginger shook her head she was the one who would have to face the patients from past experience she knew how upset they were going to be especially the ones coming from out of town just do the best you can kim said as if reading her mind kim dashed to his car he jumped in started it and drove out into the congested street leaning on his horn he weaved in and out of the traffic he felt desperate particularly after tracy s comments he did not want to miss talking directly to the gi consult in the hospital lobby kim repeatedly hit the elevator button as if such action would bring a car sooner several visitors eyed him suspiciously once on beckys floor kim literally ran down the hall when he entered beckys room he was panting he saw tracy standing off to the side talking with a woman in a long professorial white coat even a quick glance told him that tracy was distraught becky was in her bed on her back with her head propped up against the pillow her dark eyes stared ahead at the moment the only apparent motion was the relentless drip of fluid in the millipore chamber of the iv line kim stepped over to the side of the bed how are you doing pumpkin he asked he grasped her hand and lifted it there was little resistance im tired becky offered im sure you are dear kim said instinctively he felt her pulse her heart rate was on the high side of normal by gently pulling down one of her eyelids he checked her conjunctiva it was pale but not significantly paler than it had been he felt her skin it was not particularly hot or moist and her level of hydration seemed better than it had been the night before kims own pulse began to race he could tell what tracy had meant there had been a change in becky and tracy s description of glassyeyed and listless was accurate it was as if part of beckys incredible life force was in abeyance shed become lethargic im going to talk to mom kim said all right becky answered kim stepped over to tracy he could see she was subtly trembling this is dr kathleen morgan tracy said are you the gi specialist kim asked i am indeed kathleen said kim eyed the woman in many ways she was the physical antithesis of claire stevens although they were about the same age kim estimated that she couldnt have been much over five feet in height her face was round and her features were quite soft she wore wirerimmed glasses that gave her the aura of a schoolmarm her dark hair was prematurely streaked with silver dr morgan has told me she thinks beckys case is serious tracy managed oh thats a great comment kim remarked with obvious derision serious huh i dont need someone to tell me its serious she wouldnt be in the goddamn hospital if it werent serious i need someone to say what it is that she has and how to treat and cure it the lab will call me the moment they have a positive kathleen said warily she was taken aback by kims response until then our hands are tied have you examined her yet kim demanded yes i have kathleen said and ive gone over the laboratory results that are available and kim remarked impatiently so far i agree with dr faraday kathleen said foodborne bacterial illness she looks worse to me kim said to me too tracy added shes changed just since last night shes not herself shes not as alert kathleen cast an uncomfortable glance over at becky she was relieved to see the child was not paying attention to their conversation nonetheless she suggested they move out into the hallway having just seen her i cant comment on any change kathleen said and there wasnt anything in the nurses notes to that effect i want her more closely monitored kim said how about moving her into one of the isolation rooms in the icu im only a consult kathleen said becky is officially under the care of dr claire stevens the pediatrician gatekeeper then how about you convincing her kim said last night i suggested as much on admission but i got the feeling shes on americares side and worried about costs that doesnt sound like claire to me kathleen said but to be truthful i dont think your daughter needs the icu at least not yet thats an encouraging statement kim snapped in other words you expect her to get worse while the lot of you sit around and do nothing thats unfair dr reggis kathleen said taking offense the hell it is dr morgan kim spat he pronounced her name with more scorn than he felt not from my point of view as a surgeon i make a diagnosis then i go in and i fix it in other words i do something whereas now i have this sickening sense my daughter is slipping downhill in front of my eyes and no one is doing anything stop it kim tracy said fighting tears as anxious as she was about becky she didnt want to have to deal with kims contentiousness stop what kim challenged your bickering tracy managed this constant fighting with the doctors and the nurses is not helping its driving me to distraction kim glared at tracy he couldnt believe that she could turn on him so quickly especially since the issue involved beckys care dr reggis come with me kathleen said suddenly she made a motion with her hand as she started toward the nurses station go tracy encouraged get a grasp on yourself as tracy went back into beckys room kim caught up with the striding kathleen she had her mouth set and was moving at a surprising clip with her relatively short legs where are you taking me kim questioned to the chart room behind the nurses station kathleen said i want to show you something and i think we should talk just you and me doctor to doctor the nurses station was a beehive of activity the day shift was preparing to leave and the evening shift was just coming on duty kathleen walked through the congestion with practiced ease she held open the chartroom door and motioned for kim to step inside once the door closed against the hubbub relative quiet ensued the chart room was a windowless nook with builtin desks and xray view box the communal coffeemaker stood on the countertop in the corner without speaking kathleen slipped some xrays from their folder and snapped them up onto the light box she turned the unit on the films were of a childs abdomen are these beckys kim asked kathleen nodded kim leaned forward to study the details as he allowed his trained eye to scan the xrays he was more adept at reading chest films but he knew the basics the bowel looks uniformly edematous he said after a moment exactly kathleen said she was impressed shed thought shed have to point out the pathology the mucosal lining is swollen for most of its length kim leaned back what does that tell you he asked he did not like what he was seeing but had no way of relating it to clinical symptoms it makes me worry specifically about e coli h kathleen said you could see about the same xray with shigella dysentery but the patient would probably have fever as you know becky doesnt have any fever what about antibiotics kim asked claude faraday advised against them for fear of disturbing the normal flora do you agree i do kathleen said not only so as not to disturb the normal flora but they might very well be useless with no fever there is a good chance the offending organisms are already gone from beckys gut if were dealing with a potential toxemia kim said how do we make the diagnosis then there is the possibility of testing for the toxin itself kathleen said unfortunately americare has not authorized our lab to do the test dont tell me its a money issue kim warned im afraid so kathleen said its one of those tests which is not used often enough for americare to justify its expense americare feels it is not costeffective jesus h christ kim exploded he pounded the countertop with his fist in frustration if i hear that phrase not costeffective one more time im going to have a fit from the moment becky became sick americares bottom line seems to be haunting me unfortunately managed care is a reality we all must face kathleen said but in this case i took it upon myself to have a sample sent out to sherring labs well have the results in twentyfour to fortyeight hours hallelujah kim commented thank you and i apologize for saying you werent doing anything i mean money should not be a consideration when beckys health is concerned what do you know about this particular e coli and its toxin kathleen asked assuming that it is indeed what becky has not much kim said i didnt even know antibiotics werent helpful e coli isnt something ive had to deal with in my practice but vancomycinresistant enterococcus is another matter we cardiac surgeons are terrified of it i get your point kathleen said im not familiar with the enterococcus problem but i am with e coli hmaybe even a little too familiar i think you and your wife should know that it can be a very bad bug how so kim asked nervously he didnt like the sound of kathleens voice nor the implications of what she was saying kim didnt even bother to correct her misconception that he and tracy were still married maybe you should sit down kathleen said she was struggling with how best to explain her fears without unduly unsettling kim she could sense he was only in marginal control of his emotions kim dutifully sat down in one of the desk chairs he was afraid not to if e coli is involved with beckys current problem kathleen said im concerned about the drop in platelets shes had there was only a slight drop last night but after shes been rehydrated the drop is more apparent and statistically significant it makes me worry about hus hus kim questioned what in devils name is hus its the acronym for the hemolytic uremic syndrome kathleen said its associated with the shigellalike toxins e coli h is capable of producing you see this type of toxin can cause intravascular platelet coagulation as well as redcell destruction that in turn can lead to multipleorgan failure kidneys are the most commonly affected and hence the name uremic syndrome kims lower jaw slowly dropped he was stunned for a moment all he could do was look at kathleen in a vain hope that she would suddenly smile and say it was all a bad joke but she didnt you think becky has hus kim asked quietly with a calmness he did not feel lets put it this way kathleen said trying to ease the impact its my concern theres no proof as of yet at this moment its my clinical intuition that is suggesting it kim swallowed loudly his mouth had gone dry what can we do he asked not a lot im afraid kathleen said ive sent the sample to the lab looking for the toxin meanwhile i will suggest hematology and nephrology consults i dont think it is premature to get their opinions lets do it kim blurted hold on dr reggis kathleen said remember im only a consult any other consult requests have to go through claire stevens its her decision americare is very clear on this well lets call her for chrissake kim sputtered lets get the ball rolling you want me to call her this minute kathleen asked absolutely kim said he reached for the phone and pushed it in front of kathleen while kathleen used the phone kim cradled his head in his hands he felt weak with sudden anxiety what had been a nuisance albeit a bothersome scary nuisance requiring becky to suffer and come into the hospital had now become something else entirely for the first time in his life he was on the patient side of a major medical problem one that he didnt even know much about he was going to have to learn and learn fast he quickly thought of ways he could do it claires in full agreement kathleen announced as she replaced the receiver you are lucky to have her she and i have handled several cases of hus in the past when will the consults see becky kim asked urgently im sure as soon as claire can arrange them kathleen said i want them right away kim stated this afternoon dr reggis you have to calm down kathleen said thats why i brought you down here so that we could talk calmly one professional to another i cant calm down kim admitted he breathed out noisily how common is hus unfortunately its become relatively common kathleen said its usually caused by e coli h of which there are about twenty thousand cases a year its become common enough to be the current major cause of acute kidney failure in children good lord kim commented he nervously massaged his scalp twenty thousand cases a year thats the cdc estimate of the e coli hcases kathleen said its only a percentage that go on to hus is hus ever fatal kim forced himself to ask are you sure we should be talking about this aspect kathleen questioned remember the e coli diagnosis has not been definitively made ive just wanted to prepare you for its possibility answer the question goddamn it kim said hotly kathleen sighed with resignation shed hoped kim would be smart enough not to want to hear the disturbing details the fact that he did left her with no choice she cleared her throat between two hundred and five hundred people mostly kids die from e coli hevery year she said and its usually from hus perspiration broke out on kims forehead he was stunned anew two to five hundred deaths a year he repeated thats unbelievable especially since ive never heard of hus as i said these are cdc estimates kathleen said with that kind of mortality how come all this isnt better known kim asked intellectualization had always been a coping mechanism for kim in dealing with the emotional burdens of medicine that i cant answer kathleen commented theres been a couple of highprofile episodes with this e coli strain like the jackinthebox outbreak in ninetytwo and the hudson meat recall in summer ninetyseven why these and other episodes havent raised general awareness and concern i dont know it is rather mystifying i remember those two episodes kim said i suppose i just assumed the government and the usda took care of the problems kathleen laughed cynically im sure thats what the usda and the beef industry hoped youd believe is this mostly a problem with red meat kim asked ground meat to be precise kathleen said ground meat that is not cooked through and through but its also true that some cases have been caused by such things as apple juice and apple cider and even unpasteurized milk the key problem is contact with infected cow feces i dont remember this problem as a child kim said i used to eat raw hamburger all the time its a relatively new situation kathleen said its thought to have originated in the late seventies perhaps in argentina the belief is that a shigella bacterium gave an e coli bacterium the dna necessary to make a shigellalike toxin by bacterial conjugation kim suggested precisely kathleen said conjugation is bacterias answer to sexual reproduction a method of genetic shuffling but if conjugation was involved its curious since conjugation usually only happens within a species but the truly surprising aspect is that once this new strain of e coli was formed it spread extraordinarily rapidly around the globe today it exists in about three percent of bovine intestines are the infected cows sick kim questioned not necessarily kathleen said although it can cause a bovine diarrheal disease cows seem to be generally immune to the toxin at least systemically strange kim commented and ironic back when molecular biology was in its infancy a doomsday scenario was envisioned that scared everybody a researcher would give an e coli bacterium the ability to manufacture the botulism toxin and then bacteria would inadvertently get released into nature its a good analogy kathleen said especially considering that with the emergence of e coli hnature probably didnt do it on its own man helped how so kim asked i believe e coli h has come from the intense farming techniques that are in use today kathleen said the need for cheap protein to feed the animals has resulted in creative but disgusting solutions cows are fed rendered animals including themselves even chicken manure is being widely used youre joking kim said i wish kathleen said and on top of that the animals are given antibiotics it creates a soup within the animals intestines that fosters new strains in fact the e coli hwas created when the shigella toxin dna was transferred along with the dna necessary for a particular antibiotic resistance kim shook his head in disbelief he was hearing about an issue of considerable interest but then all of a sudden he remembered the case in point beckys situation the realization was instantly sobering the bottom line of all this is bovine fecal material particularly in ground beef kim said his voice returned to its previous anxious intensity i think thats fair to say kathleen said then i know how becky got it kim said angrily she had a rare hamburger at the onion ring restaurant friday night that would be consistent kathleen said although the incubation period for e coli h is usually longer sometimes as much as a week the door to the chart room banged open causing both kim and kathleen to start one of the nurses leaned in she was flushed dr morgan she said urgently theres an emergency with your consult rebecca reggis kim and kathleen raced out of the room and ran headlong down the corridor toward beckys room nine wednesday afternoon january st kim came through beckys door he saw a nurse on either side of his daughters bed one was taking her blood pressure the other her temperature becky was writhing in pain and whimpering she appeared as pale as a ghost tracy was standing off to the side with her back against the wall and a hand pressed to her mouth she was almost as pale as becky what happened kim demanded kathleen came into the room behind kim i dont know tracy wailed becky and i were just talking when suddenly she cried out she said she had a terrible pain in her stomach and her left shoulder then she had a shaking chill the nurse taking the blood pressure called out that it was ninetyfive over sixty kathleen went around the left side of the bed and felt beckys pulse has dr stevens been called she asked yes immediately one of the nurses said her temperature is one hundred and five the other nurse said with dismay her name was lorraine phillips her colleague was called stephanie gragoudos kim nudged lorraine away from the right side of beckys bed kim was frantic it was like being stabbed in the heart to see his daughter suffering becky what is it kim demanded my stomach hurts me becky managed amid groans it hurts me bad daddy please kim pulled down beckys blanket he was shocked to see a swath of purplish subcutaneous bleeding on her chest he raised his eyes to kathleen were you aware of this purpura he asked kathleen nodded yes i saw it earlier it wasnt there last night kim said kim looked back at becky tell daddy where it hurts becky pointed to her lower abdomen slightly to the right of the midline she was careful not to touch herself kim gently placed the tips of his index middle and ring fingers on beckys abdomen where shed pointed he pressed in enough to barely dimple the skin becky writhed please dont touch me daddy she pleaded kim pulled his hand back sharply beckys eyes shot open and a cry of pain issued from her parched lips such a response was a sign kim did not want to see it was called rebound tenderness and it was a strong indication of peritonitis inflammation of the lining of the abdominal cavity and there was only one thing that could cause such a catastrophe kim straightened up shes got an acute abdomen he yelled shes perforated without a moments hesitation kim pushed up to the head of the bed and released the wheels someone get the rear wheels he yelled well use the bed for transport weve got to get her to surgery i think we should wait for dr stevens kathleen said calmly she motioned for stephanie to get away from the foot of the bed kathleen then stepped to the head next to kim the hell with dr stevens kim snapped this is a surgical emergency the handwringing is over we have to act kathleen put her hand on kims arm ignoring the wild look in his eyes dr reggis you are not in charge you have to calm in his agitated frame of mind kim perceived kathleen as an obstacle not a colleague determined to get becky to surgery as soon as possible he literally swept her aside with his strength and kathleens small stature he inadvertently threw her against the bedside table kathleen grabbed the table in a vain attempt to keep her feet but only succeeded in knocking everything off its surface water pitcher glass flower vase and thermometer all crashed to the floor beside her stephanie ran out into the hall to scream for help while lorraine tried to hold the bed in position despite the rear wheels being locked kim had managed to push it several feet toward the door tracy recovered from her initial shock to rush to kim she tugged on one of his arms to get him to release the bed kim stop it she sobbed please several other nurses arrived including the head nurse and a brawny male nurse everyone converged on kim who initially remained intent on pushing the bed into the hall even kathleen pulled herself up from the floor to lend a hand finally overwhelmed kim let go of the bed but he wasnt happy he yelled that anyone who didnt understand that beckys condition was a surgical emergency was incompetent how will they put me to sleep becky asked with a voice already thick with sleep theyll just put some medicine in your iv kim said dont worry you wont feel it the next thing youll know is that youre awake and all better becky was on a gurney in the anesthesiaholding area of the or a surgical cap covered her head shed been premedicated so her pain and discomfort had abated but she was anxious about facing surgery kim was standing next to her gurney in a clutch of other gurneys with patients waiting to be taken to their respective operating rooms he was dressed in scrubs with a hood on his head and booties covering his shoes hed recovered his senses after the scene in beckys room an hour and a half earlier hed apologized profusely to kathleen shed graciously said she understood claire had arrived soon after and had immediately requested an emergency surgical consult will i be all right daddy becky asked what are you talking about kim asked trying to make it sound as if it were a ridiculous question of course youll be fine theyre just going to open you up like a zipper patch the little hole and that will be it maybe im being punished for not signing up for the nationals becky said im sorry now that i didnt i know you wanted me to kim choked on tears that threatened to erupt for a moment he looked off to compose himself and try to think of a response he found it difficult to tell his daughter about fate when he was grasping for an explanation himself only days before shed been the very epitome of youthful vigor now she was poised at the edge of the abyss why he pondered ill have mom bring me in the application becky added dont you worry about the nationals kim said i dont care about them i only care about you okay becky a cheerful voice called out time to fix you up kim raised his head both jane flanagan the anesthesiologist and james odonnell the gastrointestinal surgeon had appeared from the depths of the or they came over to beckys gurney jane went to the head and released the wheel locks becky gripped kims hand with surprising strength considering the amount of preop medication shed had will it hurt she asked kim not with jane taking care of you james said playfully overhearing the question shes the best sandwoman in the business well even order you a good dream jane joked kim knew and admired both these professionals he had worked with jane on numerous cases and had served with james on multiple hospital committees james had been at samaritan with kim and had the reputation of being the best gi surgeon in the city kim had felt relieved when he agreed to drop everything that afternoon and come in to operate on becky james grasped the foot of beckys gurney with jane walking backward and james guiding they maneuvered becky toward the double swinging doors leading to the or corridor kim walked along the side becky still had a grip on his hand jane used her rump to open the doors as the gurney slid through james reached out and grasped kims arm to keep him from following the doors closed behind becky and jane kim looked down at the hand clasped around his arm and then up into jamess face james was not quite as tall as kim but bulkier he had a spattering of freckles across the bridge of his nose what are you doing kim inquired let go of my arm james i heard what happened downstairs james said i think its best you dont come into the or but i want to come in kim said maybe so james said but youre not the hell im not kim said this is my daughter my only daughter thats the point james said you stay out in the lounge or im not doing the case its as simple as that kims face reddened he felt panic about being cornered and confused as to what he should do he desperately wanted james to do the surgery but he was terrified to be apart from becky you have to make up your mind james said the longer you agonize the worse it is for becky kim angrily snatched his arm free and without saying another word he broke off from staring at james he strode away toward the surgical locker room kim didnt look at the faces of the people in the surgical lounge as he passed through he was too distraught but he didnt pass by unnoticed in the locker room kim went directly to the sink and filled the bowl with cold water he splashed it repeatedly onto his face before straightening up to regard himself in the mirror over his shoulder he saw the pinched face of forrester biddle i want to talk with you forrester said in his clipped voice talk kim said he took a towel and briskly dried his face he didnt turn around after imploring you not to go to the media with your opinions i was appalled to hear kelly anderson again quote you on the eleven oclock news kim let out a short mirthless laugh thats curious considering that i had refused to talk with her she said it was your feeling that americare closed the samaritan er to cut costs and increase profits by forcing everyone to use the overburdened er here at the university med center i didnt say that kim responded she did she quoted you forrester said a curious situation kim said casually in his current agitated state of mind he was getting perverse pleasure out of forresters selfrighteous anger consequently kim was not inclined to defend himself although the incident strengthened his resolve never to talk to the tv journalist again im warning you again forrester announced the administration and myself only have so much forbearance fine kim said consider me warned again for a moment forresters tight mouth became a grim line without lips you can be galling he spat i should remind you that just because you ran the department over at the samaritan you should not expect special treatment over here thats apparent kim said he threw the towel into the hamper and walked out without giving forrester another glance using the phone in one of the dictation booths to avoid forrester kim called ginger to tell her that hed not be coming back to the office she told him that shed assumed as much and had sent all the patients home were they upset kim asked do you really have to ask ginger said of course they were upset but they understood when i said it was an emergency i hope you dont mind that i said it involved your daughter i knew theyd empathize i suppose thats all right kim said although mixing his private life and professional life bothered him how is becky ginger asked kim explained what had happened and that becky was in surgery at that moment im so sorry ginger said is there anything i can do i cant think of anything kim said call me ginger said after aerobics ill be at home fine kim said he hung up knowing himself well enough that he could not just sit and wait while becky was in surgery kim went to the hospital library he had a lot of reading to do he had to learn what he could about e coli h and hus kim glanced at his watch it was almost midnight he looked back at becky and shuddered her image was distorted by a clear plastic tube that snaked out of one of her nostrils and was attached to low suction beckys dark hair framed her otherwise angelic pale face with soft waves tracy had combed it for almost an hour it was something becky had always liked and it had done the trick becky was fast asleep and appeared for the moment the picture of tranquility kim was standing next to beckys bed the room was awash with the gentle glow of the reflected nightlight just as it had been early that morning kim was exhausted mentally and physically tracy was on the other side of the bed leaning back in one of the two vinylcovered chairs in the room she had her eyes closed but kim knew she was not asleep the door opened on silent hinges janet emery the corpulent night nurse pushed through the door her permed blond hair glowed in the half light she didnt speak she moved to the side of the bed opposite from kim her shoes were soled in a soft crepe so her footfalls were inaudible using a small flashlight she took beckys blood pressure pulse and temperature becky stirred but immediately fell back asleep everything staying nice and normal janet said in a low voice kim nodded maybe you folks should think about going home janet added ill be keeping a sharp eye on your little angel here thanks but i prefer to stay kim said seems to me you could use some rest yourselves janet said its been a long day just do your job kim grumbled no question about that janet said cheerfully she went to the door and silently disappeared tracy opened her eyes and glanced over at kim he looked wretched under the strain his hair was a mess and his face covered with stubble the single nightlight near the floor accentuated the gauntness of his cheeks and made his eye sockets look like dark hollows kim tracy said cant you control yourself its not helping anyone not even yourself tracy waited for a response but it didnt come kim appeared like a sculpture depicting anguished frenzy tracy sighed and stretched hows becky doing shes holding her own kim said at least the surgery handled the immediate crisis the surgery had gone quickly in fact james had reported to kim that what had taken the most time was a painstaking irrigation of beckys abdomen to lessen the chances of infection following the surgery becky had spent a short time in the recovery room before being brought back to the floor kim had requested the icu but again hed been overruled tell me again about her colostomy tracy asked you said it can be closed in a couple of weeks something like that kim said tiredly if all goes well it was a major shock for becky tracy said as was the tube in her nose shes having a hard time coping whats made it worse is she feels betrayed because no one told her these things might happen it couldnt be helped kim snapped kim backed up and sank into a chair similar to tracy s with his elbows on the hard wooden arms he buried his face in his hands now all tracy could see was the top of kims head over beckys bed he didnt move the sculpture of anguished frenzy had assumed another even more expressive pose looking at kims dejected posture forced her to think about the situation from kims point of view drawing on her experience as a therapist she could appreciate how hard it had to be for him considering not only his surgical training but more important his narcissism all at once her anger toward him melted kim tracy called maybe you should go home i think you need some distance as well as rest besides you have to see patients tomorrow i can stay ill just be skipping class i wouldnt be able to sleep even if i did go home kim said without lifting his face from his hands now i know too much during the entire time becky had been in surgery kim had researched hus in the hospital library what hed learned had been frighteningly overwhelming everything kathleen had said had been true hus could be a horrible illness and now all he could hope was becky had something else the problem was that everything was pointing in the direction of hus you know im beginning to appreciate how difficult this is for you above and beyond your medical training tracy said sincerely kim lifted his face from his hands and looked over at tracy please dont patronize me with any of your psychological bullshit not now call it what you like tracy said but im realizing this is probably the first time in your life that youve been faced with a major problem that your force of will or expertise cannot alter i think that must make this especially hard for you yeah and i suppose all this isnt affecting you at all quite the contrary tracy said its affecting me terribly but its different for you i think youre having to deal with a lot more than beckys condition youre having to take a hard look at new limits new constraints that are impeding your ability to act on beckys behalf its taking a toll kim blinked he always hated his former wifes psychological theorizing but at the moment he had to admit she was making a certain amount of sense ten thursday january nd kim ended up going home but as he expected he had not been able to sleep much and the sleep he did get was marred by disturbing dreams several of the dreams he found incomprehensible they were about being ridiculed for poor performance on tests in college by far the most horrible nightmare had been about becky and it was easy for him to understand in the dream she had fallen from a jetty into a surging sea although kim was on the jetty he couldnt reach becky no matter what he did when he had awakened he had been covered with perspiration despite getting little rest kims going home did afford him an opportunity to shower and shave with at least an improved appearance he was back in his car just after five in the morning he drove on mostly deserted streets slick with a dusting of wet snow in the hospital he found becky as hed left her she appeared deceptively peaceful in her slumber tracy was fast asleep as well curled in the vinyl chair and covered with a hospital blanket at the nurses station kim came across janet emery dutifully doing her chart work im sorry if i was rude last night kim said he sat down heavily in the seat next to janet he pulled beckys chart from the rack i didnt take it personally janet said i know what kind of stress it is to have a child in the hospital i experienced it with my own son how was beckys night kim asked anything i should know shes been stable janet said most important her temperature has stayed normal thank god kim said he found the operative note that james had dictated and which had been put into the chart over night kim read it but didnt learn anything he didnt already know with nothing else to do kim went to his office and busied himself with the mountain of paperwork that had accumulated as he worked he eyed the clock when he thought the time appropriate taking into account the hour difference on the east coast kim gave george turner a call george was enormously sympathetic when he heard about the perforation and the resultant surgery kim thanked him for his concern and quickly came to the point of the call he wanted to ask georges opinion of what to do if the diagnosis of hus secondary to e coli hwas confirmed kim was particularly interested in knowing if becky should be transferred elsewhere i wouldnt recommend it george said youve got an excellent team with claire stevens and kathleen morgan on board theyve had a lot of experience with this syndrome perhaps as much as anybody have you had any experience with hus kim asked just once george said is it as bad as its described kim asked ive read just about everything i could find on it including whats on the internet the problem is theres not a lot the case i had was a very unnerving experience george admitted could you elaborate kim asked it was unpredictable and relentless george said im going to hope that beckys problem turns out to be something else can you be more specific kim asked id rather not george said its a protean syndrome chances are that even if becky has it it will not be anything like my case my case was quite depressing after a few more minutes kim brought the conversation to a close before hanging up george asked to be kept informed about beckys progress kim promised to do so after disconnecting from george kim phoned the nurses station on beckys floor when he got janet he asked about tracy shes up and about janet said i saw her last time i was down that way taking vital signs would you mind putting her on the phone kim asked not at all janet said agreeably while he waited kim thought about georges comments he didnt like the sound of relentless and unpredictable and that georges case had been depressing such descriptions reminded kim of his nightmare and he could feel himself perspire is that you kim tracy asked as she came on the line they talked for a few minutes about how they had each passed the previous five hours neither had slept well then they got around to becky she seems a bit better than last night tracy said shes more lucid i think shes slept off the rest of the anesthesia her main complaint is the nasogastric tube when can that come out as soon as her whole gi system seems to be working kim said lets hope that can be soon tracy said i spoke to george this morning kim said what did he say tracy asked he said claire and kathleen were a good team especially if hus is confirmed he told me that we couldnt do any better anyplace else thats reassuring tracy said listen im going to stay here kim said ill see a few patients including the preops for tomorrow i hope you dont mind i dont mind in the slightest tracy said in fact i think its a good idea its hard for me to sit there and do nothing kim explained i understand completely tracy said you do what you have to do ill be here so dont worry call me if there is any change kim said of course tracy said youll be the first to know when ginger arrived just before nine kim told her to cancel whatever patients she could because he wanted to get back to the hospital sometime in the afternoon ginger asked about becky saying she was disappointed kim hadnt called her the night before shed been worrying all night but had been afraid to phone kim told her becky was doing better following the surgery he also explained that hed not gotten home until after midnight and thought it much too late to call at first kim found seeing patients was not easy under the circumstances but he forced himself to concentrate gradually the effort paid off by noontime he felt slightly more relaxed although his heart would race every time the phone rang he wasnt hungry at lunchtime and the takeout sandwich ginger had brought in sat untouched on his desk kim preferred to immerse himself totally in his patients problems that way he didnt have to deal with his own in the middle of the afternoon kim was on the phone with a cardiologist from chicago when ginger stuck her head in the door from her expression alone kim could tell something was wrong kim covered the mouthpiece with his palm tracy was on the other line ginger said she was very upset she told me that becky has taken a sudden turn for the worse and has been moved to the icu kims pulse quickened he quickly wound up the conversation with the chicago doctor and hung up he changed his jacket grabbed his car keys and ran for the door what should i do with the rest of the patients ginger asked send them home kim said tersely kim drove with determination frequently barreling along the shoulder to avoid afternoon traffic jams the closer he got to the hospital the more anxious he became although hed been lobbying to have becky moved to the icu now that she had been he was terrified having become all too aware of americares costsaving attitudes he was certain the move wasnt for prophylaxis there had to have been a serious emergency eschewing the doctors parking area kim drove right up beneath the hospitals porte cochere he leaped out and tossed his keys to a surprised hospital security guard kim fidgeted as the elevator rose painstakingly slowly up to the icus floor once in the corridor crowded with visitors kim moved as fast as he could as he came abreast of a waiting room built specifically for family members of icu patients kim caught sight of tracy she stood up when she saw him and came forward tracy threw her arms around kim pinning his to his side for a moment she would not let go kim had to forcibly extricate his arms before gently pushing her back he looked into her eyes which were brimming with tears what happened he asked he was afraid to hear the answer shes worse tracy managed much worse and it seemed to happen so suddenly just like with the perforation what was it kim asked with alarm it was her breathing tracy said all of the sudden she couldnt get her breath kim tried to break away from tracy but she held on clutching his jacket kim promise me youll control yourself you have to for beckys sake kim broke tracy s hold and ran from the room kim wait tracy called running after him ignoring tracy kim dashed across the hall and entered the icu just inside the door he held up for a moment while he scanned the room most of the beds were full the occupants were all seriously ill patients nurses toiled at nearly every bedside banks of electronic monitoring equipment beeped and displayed vital data the most activity was in one of the small separate rooms off to the side within its confines was a group of doctors and nurses attending to an acute situation kim walked over and stood in the doorway he saw the respirator and heard its rhythmical cycling judy carlson a nurse kim knew caught sight of him she called out his name and all the people surrounding beckys bed silently stepped back to afford kim a view becky had been intubated a large tube stuck out of her mouth and was taped to her cheek she was being breathed by a respirator kim rushed to the bedside becky looked up at him with terrified eyes shed been sedated but she was still conscious her arms were restrained to keep her from pulling out the endotracheal tube kim felt a crushing feeling in his chest he was revisiting the dream that hed had the night before only this time it was real its okay pumpkin daddys here kim said struggling to control his emotions he was desperate to say something to reassure her he gripped her arm she tried to speak but couldnt because of the tube in her throat kim looked around at the people present he centered his attention on claire stevens what happened he asked keeping his voice calm perhaps we should go outside claire said kim nodded he gave beckys hand a squeeze and told her hed be right back becky tried to speak but couldnt the doctors filed out into the icu proper and formed a group off to the side kim folded his arms to hide his trembling talk to me kim commanded first let me introduce everyone claire said of course you know kathleen morgan we have dr arthur horowitz nephrologist dr walter ohanesian hematologist and kevin blanchard respiratory therapist claire had pointed out each person in turn all had nodded to kim who nodded in return whats the story kim asked impatiently first i have to tell you were definitely dealing with e coli h claire said well have an idea of the particular strain tomorrow after pulse field electrophoress why is she intubated kim asked the toxemia is affecting her lungs claire said her blood gases suddenly deteriorated shes also in kidney failure arthur said weve started peritoneal dialysis the kidney specialist was a completely bald man with a full beard why not a dialysis machine kim questioned arent they more effective she should do fine with the peritoneal dialysis arthur said but she just had surgery for a perforation kim said that was taken into consideration arthur said but the problem is americare only offers dialysis machines at suburban hospital wed have to transfer the patient there which we surely dont recommend the other major problem is her platelet count walter said the blood specialist was a grayhaired older man who kim guessed was in his seventies her platelets have fallen precipitously to the point where we feel they must be replenished despite the inherent risks otherwise we might have a bleeding problem on our hands theres also the problem with her liver claire said liver enzymes have risen remarkably suggesting kims mind was on overload he was stunned to the extent that he was no longer absorbing the information being presented to him he could see the doctors talking but he didnt hear it was the nightmare all over again with becky floundering in the dangerous surging sea a half hour later kim stumbled out of the icu into the icu waiting room tracy got up the moment she saw him he looked like a broken man for a moment they stared into each others eyes now it was kims turn for tears tracy reached out and they locked in a hug of fear and grief eleven friday january rd kim paused for a moment to get his breath he glanced up at the institutional clock on the tiled or wall it was nearly two oclock in the afternoon he was making good progress this was the last of three cases kim looked back into the depths of the wound the heart was fully exposed he was in the process of putting the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass as soon as he was finished the heart could be stopped and opened at that point he would replace the damaged valve the next step was particularly critical the placement of the arterial infusion cannula into the aorta to perfuse the coronary arteries it would be through this cannula that the cardioplegia solution would be introduced that would stop the heart with its high potassium cool it and nourish it during the procedure the problem was that the arterial pressure had to be dealt with scalpel kim said the scrub nurse slapped the scalpel with the appropriate blade into his waiting palm kim lowered the razorsharp instrument into the wound and directed it toward the aorta the knife trembled in his hand kim wondered if tom noticed kim made a quick stab into the aorta then covered the incision with the tip of his left index finger he did it quickly so that there was little blood loss the little blood that appeared was cleared by tom arterial infusion cannula kim said the instrument was placed in his waiting hand he introduced it into the wound and positioned it next to his finger occluding the stab wound into the aorta sliding the tip under his finger he tried to push it into the pulsating vessel for reasons not clear to him the cannula would not penetrate the vessel wall arterial blood was now spurting out uncharacteristically kim panicked with blood filling the wound he pushed too hard with the instrument and tore the aorta enlarging the opening now the stab wound was too big to seal around the cannulas bulbous tip blood squirted high enough to splatter against kims plastic face shield kim now faced a surgical emergency instead of panicking more his experience kicked in rapidly recovering his composure he reached into the wound with his left hand blindly his finger found the hole in the pulsating vessel and he pressed against it partially stemming the blood tom rapidly sucked out enough of the blood to give kim a partial view suture kim barked a needleholder trailing a length of black silk was pressed into his hand deftly he passed the needles tip into the vessels wall he did this several times so that when he pulled up on the suture the hole was closed with the emergency quickly contained kim and tom eyed each other across the patient tom motioned with his head and kim nodded to the surprise of the team kim and tom stepped away from the operative field they kept their sterile gloved hands pressed against their sterile gowned chests kim why dont you let me finish this last case tom whispered it was a suggestion for kims ears only i can pay you back for doing the same for me a couple of weeks ago when i was coming down with the flu remember sure i remember kim said youre understandably bushed tom said it was true kim was exhausted he had spent most of the night in the icu waiting room with tracy when it had become apparent that beckys condition had stabilized tracy convinced kim to get a few hours rest in one of the resident oncall rooms shed also been the one to convince kim to go ahead with his planned surgery arguing that his patients needed him shed insisted that it was best for kim to stay busy since there wasnt anything he could do for becky besides wait her most convincing point had been that hed be in the hospital and available if needed how did we do this as residents kim asked we never had any sleep the benefit of youth tom said the problem is were no longer young how true kim commented he paused for a moment turning his case over to anyone even to someone as qualified as tom was not an easy decision for him all right he said at length you take over but ill be watching you like a hawk i wouldnt expect anything different tom joked he knew kim well enough to recognize his style of humor the two surgeons returned to the operating table this time tom was on the patients right all right everybody tom said lets get that cannula in scalpel please with tom at the helm the operation went smoothly although kim was on the patients left he was the one who positioned the valve and placed the initial sutures tom did the rest as soon as the sternum was closed tom suggested kim should bow out you dont mind kim asked hell no tom said get over there and check on becky thanks kim said he stepped back and pulled off his gown and gloves as kim pulled open the heavy or door tom called out between myself and jane well write the postop orders if theres anything else i can do just call i appreciate it kim said he hurried into the surgical locker room where he picked up a long white coat to pull on over his scrubs he was eager to get to the icu and didnt want to take the time to change back into his street clothes kim had visited the intensivecare unit prior to and between each of his surgeries becky had shown some improvement and there was some talk of trying to wean her off the respirator kim hadnt allowed himself to become too hopeful knowing shed been on for less than twentyfour hours kim had even found time prior to his first case to phone george again to ask if he could think of anything else they could do for becky unfortunately he hadnt had any suggestions except for plasmaphoresis which he didnt recommend kim had come across plasmaphoresis for e coli h toxemia in his research in the library during beckys surgery it involved replacing the patients plasma with pooled fresh frozen plasma unfortunately it was a controversial treatment considered experimental with an enormous attendant risk of hiv since the new plasma came from hundreds of different donors the doors to the elevator opened and kim was dismayed to join a group of happy staffers leaving the hospital at the end of the day shift he knew it was unreasonable of him but he couldnt help but be annoyed by their cheerful babble getting off the elevator kim started down the hall the closer he got to the icu the more nervous he became he was almost beginning to feel a premonition he paused at the waitingroom threshold to see if tracy was there he knew shed planned on going home to clean up and change clothes kim saw her sitting in a chair near the window she spotted him at almost the same moment and stood up as she approached kim could see thered been fresh tears they streaked the side of her face whats wrong now he asked with dismay has there been a change for a moment tracy could not speak kims question brought forth new tears that she had to choke back shes worse tracy managed dr stevens talked about a cascading pattern of major organ failure it was so much mumbojumbo to me but she said that we should prepare ourselves i think she was saying that becky may die beckys not going to die kim said with vehemence that bordered on anger what happened to make her suggest such a thing becky has had a stroke tracy said they think shes blind kim shut his eyes hard the idea of his tenyearold daughter having a stroke seemed beyond any realm of possibility yet kim well understood that her clinical course had been spiraling downward from the outset that she may have reached the point of no return was not entirely surprising leaving tracy in the waiting room kim strode across the hall and entered the icu mirroring the previous afternoon a gaggle of doctors were pressed into beckys cubicle kim pushed his way in he saw a new face dr sidney hampton neurology dr reggis claire called kim ignored the pediatrician he muscled his way to the bedside and looked at his daughter she was a pitiful shadow of her former self lost within the wires and tubes and the technology liquid crystal displays and monitor screens flashed their information in the form of digital readouts and tracing cursors beckys eyes were closed her skin was a translucent bluish white becky its me dad kim whispered into her ear he studied her frozen face she didnt register any sign of hearing him unfortunately shes unresponsive claire said kim straightened up his breaths were shallow and rapid you think shes had a stroke every indication suggests as much sidney said kim had to remind himself not to blame the messenger the basic problem is that the toxin seems to be destroying her platelets as fast as we give them walter said its true sidney said theres no way to know if this was an intracranial hemorrhage or a platelet embolus or a combination of the two walter suggested thats a possibility sidney admitted one way or another walter added the rapid destruction of her platelets must be forming a sludge in her microcirculation were into that cascading major organ failure situation that we hate to see kidney and liver function is definitely going down arthur said the peritoneal dialysis is not keeping up kim had to steel himself to curtail his anger at this selfserving dialectic it certainly wasnt helping his daughter he tried to think and remain rational if the peritoneal dialysis is not working kim said in a deceptively calm voice perhaps we should transfer her to the suburban hospital and get her on a dialysis machine thats out of the question claire said shes too critical to be transferred well it seems to me wehave to do something kim shot back his anger bubbling to the surface i think we are doing all we can claire said were actively supporting her respiratory and kidney functions and replacing her platelets what about plasmaphoresis kim said claire looked at walter americare is reluctant to authorize it walter said screw americare kim spat if theres a chance you think it could help lets do it hold on dr reggis walter said the grayhaired man shifted his weight he was obviously uncomfortable about this issue americare owns this hospital we cant just go thumbing our noses at their rules plasmaphoresis is expensive and experimental with lay families im not even supposed to bring it up how do we go about getting them to authorize it kim questioned ill pay for it myself if it can help id have to call dr norman shapiro walter said hes the chairman of the americare review board call him kim barked right now walter looked at claire claire shrugged i suppose a call cant hurt okay by me walter said he left the room to use the phone at the icu desk dr reggis plasmaphoresis is grasping at straws claire said i think its only fair to tell you and your former wife that you should be preparing yourselves for all eventualities kim saw red he was in no frame of mind to prepare himself as claire euphemistically suggested instead he wanted to strike out at the people responsible for beckys sorry state and at that moment his nearest targets were the doctors in that very room you do understand what im saying dont you claire asked gently kim didnt answer in a suddenly clairvoyant moment he comprehended the absurdity of blaming these doctors for beckys plight especially when he knew where the fault lay without warning kim broke away from claire and rushed out of the icu he was beside himself with anger frustration and his humiliating sense of impotence he started down the hall tracy was still in the waiting room she spotted kims hasty exit and immediately knew he was in a rage when he passed by without a glance she ran to catch up to him she was afraid of what he might do kim stop where are you going she pulled on his sleeve out he said breaking away where tracy had to run merely to keep up with kims determined stride the look on his face frightened her for the moment she forgot her own grief ive got to do something he said i cant just sit here and wring my hands right now i cant help becky medically but by god im going to find out how she got sick how are you going to find out tracy asked kim you have to calm down kathleen told me the e coli problem is mainly a problem with ground meat kim said everybody knows that tracy said yeah well i guess i didnt kim said and remember when i told you that a week ago i took becky to the onion ring on prairie highway she had a burger and it was rare that had to have been when she got sick so you mean to tell me youre going to the onion ring restaurant now tracy asked incredulously obviously kim said if thats where becky got sick thats where im going right now it doesnt matter where becky got sick tracy said what matters is she is sick we can worry about the how and the why some other time it might not matter to you kim said but it matters to me kim youre out of control tracy said with exasperation just once cant you think of someone else besides yourself what the hell do you mean kim snapped feeling even more enraged this is about you not about becky its about you and your doctor ego the hell it is kim growled im in no mood to listen to any of your psychological nonsense not now youre not helping anyone by running off like this tracy said youre a threat even to yourself if you have to go at least wait until you have calmed down im going in hopes it can calm me down kim said and maybe even give me an ounce of satisfaction the elevator arrived and kim boarded but you havent even changed out of your scrub clothes tracy said hoping to find some way to delay him for his own good im going kim said right now nobodys going to stop me kim pulled into the onion ring parking lot fast enough to bottom out on the lip of the driveway there was a muffled thump and a shudder went through the car kim didnt care he took the first parking spot he came to after putting on the emergency brake and turning off the ignition kim sat in the car for a moment and looked out the windshield at the restaurant it was as crowded as it had been a week earlier the drive from the hospital had blunted the edge of his anger but not his determination he thought about what hed do once he was inside and then got out of the car passing through the main entrance he found the lines at the cash registers stretched almost to the door unwilling to wait he pushed his way to the front some of the customers complained kim ignored them once at the counter kim got the attention of one of the cashregister girls whose name tag said hi im debbie she was a nondescript teenager with bleached hair and mild acne her facial features were frozen into an expression of absolute boredom excuse me kim said forcing himself to sound calm even though it was apparent he was not id like to speak to the manager you have to wait in line to order debbie said she glanced briefly at kim but was completely insensitive to his state of mind i dont want to order kim said slowly and deliberately i want to speak to the manager hes like really busy right now debbie said she turned her attention back to the person standing at the head of her line and asked that the order be repeated kim slammed his open palm down on the countertop with such force that it caused several napkin holders to vibrate off and fall with a clatter to the floor the sound was like a shotgun blast in an instant the entire restaurant went silent like a freezeframe in a movie debbie turned pearl white i dont want to have to ask again kim said i want the manager a man stepped forward from a position next to the central island behind the row of cash registers he was dressed in a twotone onion ring uniform his name tag said hi im roger im the manager he said his head twitched nervously whats the problem its my daughter kim said she happens to be in a coma at the moment fighting for her life all from eating a hamburger here one week ago kim was loud enough to make himself heard throughout the restaurant those customers who were eating burgers eyed them suspiciously im sorry to hear about your daughter roger said but theres no way she could have gotten sick here least of all from one of our burgers this is the only place she had ground meat kim said and shes sick with e coli and that comes from hamburger well im sorry roger said emphatically but our burgers are all cooked welldone and weve got strict rules about cleanliness were inspected regularly by the department of health as abruptly as the restaurant had gone silent it returned to its high level of background noise conversations recommenced as if the collective judgment was that whatever kims problem was it didnt concern them her burger wasnt welldone kim said it was rare impossible roger contended with a roll of his eyes i saw it myself kim said it was pink in the middle what id like to ask it couldnt have been pink roger interjected with a dismissive wave its out of the question now if youll excuse me i have to get back to work roger began to turn away from the counter kim responded by lashing out and grabbing a handful of rogers onion ring shirt with his powerful arms kim pulled the startled manager over the counter so that his face was inches from kims instantly it began to empurple kims ironlike grip was restricting blood flow in rogers neck a little remorse might be appropriate kim snarled certainly not uninformed blanket denial roger gurgled incomprehensibly while he ineffectually grappled with kims locked fingers kim rudely pushed roger back over the counter and let go of him sending him to the floor the cashiers the rest of the kitchen staff and the people waiting in line gasped but stood rooted in shocked immobility kim rounded the end of the counter intending to talk directly with the chef roger scrambled to his feet and seeing kim coming into the kitchen area he tried to confront him you cant come back here he said gamely only employees are allowed kim didnt give him time to finish he simply shoved him out of the way slamming the manager into the counter the collision displaced a plastic juice machine which crashed to the tiles juice sloshed out in a wide arc across the floor those nearest jumped out of the way the restaurant again quieted a few of the patrons left hurriedly taking their food with them call the police roger croaked to the nearest cashier as he scrambled to his feet kim continued around the central island to confront the wizened paul kim took in the leathered face and the tattooed arm and wondered about the mans personal hygiene like everyone else in the kitchen paul hadnt moved from the moment kim had pounded the counter some of the burgers on the grill in front of him were smoking my daughter had a rare burger here just about this time a week ago kim growled i want to know how that could have happened roger came up behind kim and tapped him on the shoulder youre going to have to leave he said kim spun around hed had quite enough of the pesky manager roger wisely backed up he raised his palms okay okay he mumbled kim turned back to paul any ideas he asked no paul said hed seen people go crazy on oil rigs and the look in kims eyes reminded him of these men come on kim snarled you must have been the cook you have to have some idea like roger said paul asserted it couldnt have been rare i cook all the burgers welldone its policy you people are really starting to piss me off kim snapped im telling you it was rare i didnt get this secondhand i was here with my daughter i saw it but i time them paul said he pointed with his spatula to the smoking patties on the grill kim grabbed one of a halfdozen completed burgers that paul had put on the shelf above the grill for roger to place on order trays kim rudely broke the burger open and examined the inside of the meat patty it was welldone he repeated this three more times slapping the broken hamburgers back onto the plates you see roger said theyre all welldone now if youll step out of the kitchen area we can discuss this more calmly we cook them to an inside temperature higher than the one proposed by the fda paul said how do you know the inside temperature kim asked we gauge it with a special fivepronged thermometer roger said we take the temperature randomly several times a day and its always the same above a hundred and seventy degrees paul put down his spatula and rummaged in a drawer below the grill he produced the instrument and offered it to kim kim ignored the thermometer he took another hamburger and broke it open it too was welldone where do you store the patties before theyre cooked paul turned around and opened the refrigerator kim bent over and peered inside he knew he was only looking at a small portion of the meat the onion ring had to have on hand wheres the bulk of them kim questioned in the walkin freezer paul said show me kim commanded paul looked at roger no way roger said the walkin is off limits kim gave paul a shove in the chest with both hands propelling the man toward the back of the kitchen paul stumbled backward then turned and started to walk kim followed no you dont roger said hed caught up to kim and pulled on his arm only employees are allowed in the freezer kim tried to shake roger off his arm but roger hung on frustrated kim backhanded the manager across the face with significantly more force than hed intended the power of the blow snapped rogers head around split his upper lip and sent him crashing to the floor for the second time without even a glance at the fallen manager kim followed after paul who now had the freezer door open kim stepped inside fearful of kims size and impulsiveness paul gave him a wide berth paul looked back at his manager who was now sitting on the rubber kitchen mat dabbing at his bloodied lip unsure of what to do he followed kim into the freezer kim was looking at the cartons lined up on the left side of the walkin only the first was open the labels read mercer meats reg lb hamburger patties extra lean lot batch production dec use by march would a hamburger last friday night have come from this carton kim asked paul shrugged probably or one similar kim stepped back into the depths of the freezer and saw another open carton nestled among the sealed ones he opened it and looked in he could see that the wrapping was also broken on one of the inner boxes how come this carton is open he asked it was a mistake paul said were supposed to use the oldest patties first so we never have to worry about the use by date kim looked at the label it was similar to the previous one except for the production date this one said jan instead of dec could a patty have come from this one last friday he asked possibly paul said i dont remember the day it was mistakenly opened slipping a pen and piece of paper from the pocket of his white coat kim wrote down the information on the labels of the two open cartons then he took a single patty from each this wasnt easy because the patties were frozen in stacks separated by sheets of waxed paper he pocketed the patties and the paper as kim exited the freezer he was vaguely aware of the muffled sound of a siren whining down in his preoccupied state he ignored it whats mercer meats he asked paul paul closed the freezer door its a meatprocessing company that supplies us with hamburger patties he said in fact they supply the entire onion ring chain is it in the state kim asked sure is paul said its right outside of town in bartonville thats convenient kim said as kim walked back into the kitchen area the front door of the restaurant burst open two uniformed police officers came charging in with their hands resting on their holstered revolvers their faces were grim roger trailed behind them angrily gesturing toward kim with his right hand while his left held a bloody napkin against his mouth twelve saturday january th weak earlymorning sunlight slanted through the motefilled air of the courtroom and created a swath of light on the floor kim was standing in the beam and squinting from the glare in front of him judge harlowe was presiding in his black judicial robes reading glasses were perched precariously on the judges narrow knifelike nose to kim he appeared like an enormous black bird after more than twenty years on the bench judge harlowe was saying while glaring down at kim over the top of his spectacles i should not be surprised at what i see and hear but this is one strange story its because of my daughters condition kim said he was still attired in his long white coat over hospital scrubs with his surgical mask still tied around his neck but the coat was no longer crisp and clean from having slept in it overnight in jail it was wrinkled and soiled below the left pocket was a reddishbrown stain doctor i have great sympathy for you given that your daughter is gravely ill judge harlowe said what i have trouble understanding is why you are not at the hospital at her side i should be kim said but her condition is such there is nothing i can do besides i had only intended to be away for an hour or so well im not here to make value judgments judge harlowe said what i am here for is to address your behavior in regard to trespassing committing battery on a fastfood restaurant manager and perhaps most egregious of all resisting arrest and striking a police officer doctor this is unacceptable behavior no matter the circumstances but your honor i kim began judge harlowe raised his hand to quiet kim it doesnt matter that you suspect your daughters illness might have originated at the onion ring on prairie highway you of all people should know we have a department of health which is mandated to look into this kind of thing and we have courts of law am i making myself clear yes your honor kim said resignedly i hope you seek some help doctor judge harlowe said im plainly mystified by your actions knowing that youre a renowned cardiac surgeon in fact you operated on my fatherinlaw and he still sings your praises at any rate im releasing you on your own recognizance youre to return for trial four weeks hence see the court clerk judge harlowe struck his gavel and asked for the next case on his way out of the courthouse kim eyed a public phone he hesitated for a moment trying to decide whether or not to call the hospital the evening before hed tried to call tracy but hed failed to reach her with the calls he had been allotted now with a phone available he dithered he felt guilty about having been gone for so long as well as embarrassed for what had happened he was also afraid of what he might find out about becky he decided to go rather than call at a cab stand just outside the courthouse kim caught a cab to the onion ring the deserted restaurant looked completely different in the morning prior to its opening kims aging vehicle was the only one in the parking lot and there wasnt a soul in sight climbing in his car kim set out for the hospital en route he made a detour to sherring labs inside he approached a receiving counter and rang a stainlesssteel bell a woman appeared within seconds she was dressed in a lab coat kim fished the two hamburger patties now defrosted out of his left pocket and handed them to the woman id like these patties tested for e coli h he said also for the toxin the technician eyed the discolored meat warily i think it might have been better if youd refrigerated the samples she said when meats been at room temperature for more than a couple of hours its going to grow out a lot of bacteria i understand that kim said but i dont care about other bacteria i only want to know if e coli h is present the woman disappeared for a moment she returned wearing latex gloves she took the meat and put each sample into a separate container then she took the billing details kim used his office account how long will it take kim asked well have a final reading in fortyeight hours she replied kim thanked her washed his hands in a restroom and went back out to his car as he neared the hospital kim became increasingly anxious he started trembling as he parked his car the tremors grew worse as he rose up in the elevator preferring to face tracy after checking on becky he used a back route to the icu to avoid the icu waiting room as he passed through the halls people eyed him with curiosity kim could well understand considering his appearance besides his soiled attire he needed a shower and a shave and his hair needed combing within the icu kim nodded to the ward clerk but didnt offer any explanation approaching beckys cubicle he found himself making a pact with god if only becky could be spared kim slipped in by beckys bedside a nurse was changing her iv bottle her back was to him kim gazed at his daughter any faint sliver of hope of improvement he had entertained instantly vanished becky was obviously still in a coma her eyelids were taped shut and she was still intubated and being respired what was new were large deeppurple patches of subcutaneous bleeding under the skin of her face that made her look cadaverous oh my goodness you frightened me the nurse said when she caught sight of kim she put a hand to her chest i didnt hear you she doesnt look good kim said he kept his voice even in an attempt to hide the grief anger and humiliating impotence he felt im afraid not the nurse said eyeing kim with some misgivings the poor little angel has been having a terrible time kims trained ear drew his attention to the cardiac monitor screen the beeping was irregular as were the blips of the cursor she has an arrhythmia when did this develop relatively recently the nurse said it started last night she developed a cardiac effusion which quickly brought on symptoms of tamponade she had to be tapped when kim asked now he felt even more guilty for not having been available dealing with a cardiac effusion was something he knew about just after four this morning the nurse said are any of her doctors still here kim asked i believe so the nurse said i think theyre talking to the patients mother in the waiting room kim fled he couldnt stand to see his daughter in such a condition out in the corridor he paused to catch his breath and regain some composure then he walked down to the waiting room he found tracy talking with claire stevens and kathleen morgan as soon as they saw kim their conversation stopped for a moment there was silence tracy was clearly distraught her mouth was a grim line she had her knees pressed together and her hands clasped she gazed at kim with a sad confused expression reflecting both concern and contempt she shook her head youre in the same clothes youre a mess where on earth have you been my visit to the onion ring took a lot longer than i thought it would he looked at claire so becky has now developed pericarditis im afraid so claire said my god kim exclaimed what next at this stage just about anything kathleen said weve confirmed that this is a particularly pathogenic strain of e coli that produces not one but two extraordinarily potent toxins what were seeing is fullblown hus what about the plasmaphoresis kim asked dr ohanesian made an impassioned plea to the americare review board chairman claire said but as we warned the committee probably will not give the okay why not kim demanded weve got to do something and i said ill be willing to pay for it your being willing to pay doesnt matter claire said from their point of view it would set a dangerous precedent they could then be forced to offer it to families that couldnt or wouldnt pay then lets get becky to someplace where it is offered kim snapped dr reggis claire said sympathetically becky is in worse condition today than she was yesterday and yesterday she was in no condition to be transferred but plasmaphoresis is not totally out of the question theres still hope they could give the green light well just have to wait wait and do nothing kim said with a scowl thats not true claire said hotly then she caught herself and sighed talking with kim was a chore she did not relish were supporting her every way possible meaning youre sitting on your hands and treating complications kim spat claire stood up and looked at tracy and kathleen i think its time for me to see the rest of my inpatients but ill be available if needed just page me tracy nodded kathleen responded that shed be doing the same thing in a few minutes claire left kim collapsed into the chair vacated by claire and buried his head in his hands he was struggling with a roller coaster of emotions first anger and then sadness then back to anger now sadness returned he fought back tears he knew he should be seeing his own inpatients but for the moment he was incapable why did your visit to the onion ring take so long tracy asked as irritated as she was by his behavior she couldnt help but be concerned about him he looked pitiful actually i was in jail kim admitted jail if you want me to tell you that you were right you were right kim said i should have calmed down before i went why were you in jail tracy asked i lost my temper kim said i went there to find out about the possibility of tainted meat the managers selfrighteous denial drove me up the wall i dont think its the fastfood industrys fault kathleen offered with this e coli problem the fastfood restaurants are as much a victim as the patrons who are infected they get contaminated hamburger i figured as much kim said with his face still buried in his hands my next visit will be to mercer meats with beckys condition its hard for me to think tracy said but how can there be contaminated meat arent these places continually inspected i mean doesnt the usda certify the meat they certify it kathleen said but in this day and age its an unfortunate assumption to believe that its not contaminated how can that be tracy asked for a lot of reasons kathleen said chief of which is that the usda has an inherent conflict of interest kim lifted his head out of his hands how so its because of the usdas mandate kathleen said on the one hand the agency is the official advocate for us agriculture which includes the powerful beef industry thats actually the usdas main job on the other hand it has inspectional obligations obviously the two roles dont mix its a genuine case of asking the fox to guard the henhouse this sounds incredible kim said is this something you know for a fact or is it something youve heard and are just passing it along im afraid its something i know about firsthand kathleen said ive been looking into the problem of food contamination for over a year ive gotten active through a couple of consumer groups who are fighting an uphill battle to do something about it how did you get involved tracy asked it would have been hard for me not to kathleen said food contamination and the illness it causes have become a major part of my practice people in general seem to want to keep their heads in the sand about all this but its a problem that is getting worse by the day this is unbelievable kim exclaimed as anger again overcame his sadness theres more kathleen said not only is there a conflict of interest with the usda but from what ive seen the usda and the beef industry are much too close what are you implying kim asked exactly what i said kathleen added particularly in middlemanagement positions theres a kind of musical chairs with people moving back and forth to make sure the industry is interfered with as little as possible this is all for profit no doubt kim said to be sure kathleen said the beef industry is a multibilliondollar business profit maximization is its goal not the public health wait a second tracy said how can all this be true in the past the usda has uncovered problems and has done something about them i mean not that long ago with hudson foods excuse me kathleen interrupted the usda was not responsible for discovering the e coli contamination involving hudson foods it was an attentive public health official normally what happens is the usda is forced to make a show after an outbreak occurs then they make a big deal to the media to give the impression that they are on the job of protecting the public but unfortunately nothing substantial ever gets done ironically enough the usda doesnt even have the power to recall meat it finds contaminated it can only make a recommendation nothing it determines is binding you mean like with hudson foods tracy asked at first they recommended that only twentyfive thousand pounds of meat be recalled exactly kathleen said it was consumer groups that forced the usda to up the recommended recall to over a million pounds it wasnt the usda who was the instigator id had no idea about any of this tracy said and i like to think of myself as a reasonably informed person perhaps the worst part kathleen continued is that when the usda talks about contamination with its inspectional services theyre generally talking about gross contamination with visible feces the industry has fought against any microscopic or bacteriologic inspection for years now there is supposed to be some culturing but it is only a token its hard to believe tracy said i guess ive always just assumed that meat was safe its a sorry situation kathleen said with tragic consequences for a few moments no one spoke how well we know tracy said as if suddenly realizing this was no idle conversation her daughter was no abstraction a fresh tear streaked down her cheek well that settles it kim said he abruptly got to his feet settles what tracy managed where are you going now to bartonville kim said im going to pay a quick visit to mercer meats i think you should stay here tracy said with exasperation you know better than i that beckys condition is grave dr stevens and dr morgan have impressed upon me there might be some difficult decisions to be made of course i know beckys condition is grave kim snapped thats why i have so much trouble sitting here doing nothing it drives me crazy i have trouble even looking at becky knowing there is nothing i can do medically to help besides hearing all this about the beef industry and the usda makes me furious i said i was going to find out how she got sick im going to follow this e coli trail wherever it leads at least i can do that for becky what if we need you tracy asked my cellular phone is in my car kim said you can call me anyway i wont be gone that long yeah just like yesterday tracy said ive learned my lesson kim said im not going to lose my temper tracy didnt look persuaded go if you have to she said irritably kim stormed out of the icu waiting room not only was beckys relentless downward course weighing on him but so was tracy s hostility just the day before shed professed to understand his frustrations now it was as if shed forgotten shed ever said anything once on the freeway kim used his cellular phone to find tom he tried him several places before catching him in his lab at the hospital i have to ask another favor kim said hows becky tom asked to be honest shes very bad kim said ive been using a lot of denial about her condition but i cant do that anymore it doesnt look good i had no idea this e coli was so pathogenic and essentially untreatable once the toxin gets into the system anyway im not optimistic kim paused fighting tears im so sorry tom said what a tragedy what can i do to help could you follow my inpatients for a couple of days kim managed im strung out no problem at all tom said graciously ill be doing my own rounds when i finish here in the next few minutes and ill just add them on ill also tell the nurses so theyll call me if therere any problems thanks tom kim said i owe you i wish i could do more tom said me too kim said bartonville was less than forty minutes out of town kim cruised down its main street and then followed the directions hed gotten from a service station at the freeway exit he found mercer meats without a problem it was a far bigger plant than hed expected the building was all white and modernlooking but otherwise nondescript the grounds were immaculately landscaped with granitelined drives and islands of trees in the parking area the whole complex projected an aura of high profitability kim parked relatively near the front door in one of a halfdozen visitor spaces he slid out from behind the wheel and started toward the entrance as he walked he reminded himself not to lose his temper after the experience at the onion ring he knew that if he did it would only work against him the reception area looked like it belonged at the entrance to an insurance company rather than a meatpacking concern plush walltowall carpeting covered the floor the furniture was richly upholstered and there were framed prints on the walls only the subject matter of the prints gave a hint of the nature of the business they were prints of various breeds of cattle a matronly woman wearing a cordless headset sat at a circular desk in the center of the room may i help you she asked i hope so kim said whats the name of the president of mercer meats that would be mr everett sorenson the woman said would you call mr sorenson and tell him that dr kim reggis is here to see him kim said can i tell mr sorenson what this is about the woman asked she eyed kim skeptically his appearance was bordering on that of a homeless person is it necessary kim asked mr sorenson is a very busy man the woman said in that case kim said tell him its about mercer meats selling contaminated hamburger patties to the onion ring restaurant chain excuse me the woman said shed heard kim but couldnt quite believe it or better yet kim said already beginning to forget his promise to himself about maintaining his composure tell him id like to discuss the fact that my only daughter is fighting for her life after consuming a mercer meats patty perhaps youd like to sit down the receptionist said she swallowed nervously kim was now leaning over her desk resting on his knuckles ill give the president your message thank you kim said he gave the woman a forced smile and retreated to one of the couches the woman spoke into her headset while casting nervous glances in kims direction he smiled again he couldnt hear what she was saying but from the look on her face he knew it was about him kim had his legs crossed he bounced his foot five minutes dragged by the more he waited the more his anger flooded back just when he thought he couldnt sit there any longer a man appeared with a long white coat not dissimilar to the one kim was wearing except it was clean and pressed on his head was a blue baseball hat with mercer meats emblazoned above the bill he was carrying a clipboard he came right up to kim and stuck out his hand kim stood up and shook the mans hand although hed not intended to dr reggis im jack cartwright im glad to meet you wheres the president kim asked hes tied up at the moment jack said but he asked me to come out and talk with you im one of the vice presidents and among other things im in charge of public relations jack was a stocky individual with a doughy face and a slightly upturned porcine nose he smiled ingratiatingly i want to talk with the president kim said listen jack said without a beat im truly sorry to hear that your daughter is ill shes more than ill kim said shes at deaths door fighting for her life against a bacteria called e coli h i imagine this is a bug youve heard of unfortunately yes jack said his smile vanished everyone in the meat business is aware of it especially after the hudson meat recall in fact were so paranoid about it we make an effort to exceed by far all usda rules regulations and recommendations and as proof of our efforts weve never been cited for a single deficiency i want to visit the hamburgerpatty production area kim said he wasnt interested in jacks obviously canned spiel now thats impossible jack said we understandably limit access to avoid contamination but hold up kim interjected as his face reddened im a doctor i understand contamination ill be willing to put on any suit thats normally worn in the area whatever has to be done ill do but im not going to take no for an answer hey calm down jack said goodnaturedly you didnt let me finish you cant go onto the production floor but we have a glassedin observation walk so you can see the whole process whats more you dont have to change out of your street clothes thats a start i suppose kim said great jack commented follow me jack preceded kim leading him along a corridor are you only interested in hamburger production jack asked what about some other meat product like sausage just hamburger kim said fine and dandy jack said cheerfully they got to a stair and started up i want to emphasize were tigers about cleanliness here at mercer meats jack said hell the entire meatproduction area gets cleaned every day first with highpressure steam and then with a quaternary ammonium compound i mean you could eat off the floor uhhuh kim intoned the whole production area is kept at thirtyfive degrees jack said as they reached the top of the stairs he grabbed the handle of a tire door its tough on the workers but tougher on the bacteria you know what i mean jack laughed kim stayed silent they went through the door and entered a glass enclosed corridor perched a floor above the production area it ran the entire length of the building pretty impressive wouldnt you say jack said proudly wheres the patty area kim asked well get to that jack said but let me explain to you what all this machinery is doing below kim could see workers going about their business they were all dressed in white uniforms with white caps that resembled shower hats they were also wearing gloves and shoe covers kim had to admit that the plant looked new and clean he was surprised hed expected something significantly less impressive jack had to speak loudly over the sound of the machinery the glass on either side of the walkway was singlepaned i dont know if you are aware that hamburger is usually a blend of fresh meat and frozen jack said its course ground separately over there of course the frozen stuff has to be defrosted first kim nodded after the course grind the fresh and the frozen meat are dumped into the formulation blender over there to make a batch then the batch is finely ground in those big grinders jack pointed kim nodded we do five batches per hour jack said the batches are then combined into a lot kim pointed to a large rubber or plastic bin on wheels does the fresh meat come in those containers he asked yup jack agreed theyre called combo bins and they hold two thousand pounds were very particular with our fresh meat it has to be used within five days and its got to be kept below thirtyfive degrees im sure you know that thirtyfive degrees is colder than a standard refrigerator what happens to the lot kim asked as soon as it comes out of the fine grinder it goes by this conveyor below us to the pattyformulating machine over yonder kim nodded the formulating machine was in a separate room closed off from the rest of the production area they walked down the glass corridor until they were directly over it an impressive machine wouldnt you say jack said how come its in its own room kim asked to keep it extraclean and protect it jack said its the most expensive piece of equipment on the floor and the workhorse of the plant that baby puts out either regular tenthofapound patties or quarterpound jumbos what happens to the patties when they come out of the formulating machine kim asked a conveyor takes them directly into the nitrogen freeze tunnel jack said then they are handpacked into boxes and the boxes into cartons can you trace the origin of meat kim asked i mean if you know the lot number the batch numbers and the production date sure jack said thats all recorded in the pattyroom log kim reached into his pocket and withdrew the piece of paper on which hed written the information from the labels in the onion ring walkin freezer he unfolded it and showed it to jack id like to find out where the meat came from for these two dates and lots kim said jack glanced at the paper but then shook his head sorry i cant give you that kind of information why the hell not kim demanded i just cant jack said its confidential its not for public consumption whats the secret kim asked theres no secret jack said its just company policy then why keep the logs kim asked they are required by the usda jack said sounds suspicious to me kim said thinking about some of kathleens comments earlier that morning a public agency requires logs whose information is not available to the public i dont make the rules jack said lamely kim let his eyes roam around the patty room it was impressive with its polished stainlesssteel equipment and lustrous tiled floor there were three men and one woman tending to the machines kim noticed that the woman was carrying a clipboard on which she scribbled intermittently in contrast to the men she did not touch the machinery whos that woman kim asked thats marsha baldwin jack said shes a looker isnt she whats she doing kim asked inspecting jack said shes the usda inspector assigned to us she stops in here three four sometimes five times a week shes a real hardass she sticks her nose into everything i suppose she could trace the meat kim said sure jack said she checks the pattyroom log every time shes here whats she doing now kim asked marsha was bending over looking into the yawning mouth of the pattyformulating machine i havent the faintest idea jack said probably making sure it was cleaned the way it was supposed to be which it undoubtedly was shes a stickler for details thats all i know at least she keeps us on our toes three to five times a week kim repeated thats impressive come on jack said motioning with his hand for kim to follow him the only thing you havent seen yet is the boxes being packed into the cartons and the cartons being put into cold storage prior to shipping kim knew hed seen as much as he was likely to see he was convinced that he would not get to talk with everett sorenson if you have any further questions jack said back at the reception area just give a holler he gave kim a business card and flashed a winning smile then he pumped kims hand slapped him on the back and thanked him for his visit kim walked out of the mercer meats building and got into his car instead of starting the engine he turned on the radio after making sure his cellular phone was on he leaned back and tried to relax after a few minutes he rolled the window partly down he didnt want to fall asleep time moved very slowly several times he almost gave up and left he was feeling progressively guilty about having abandoned tracy in the icu waiting room but a little over an hour later kims patience paid off marsha baldwin walked out of mercer meats she was dressed in a khaki coat and carried what looked like a governmentissue briefcase in a mild panic to get to her before she climbed into her car kim struggled with his door it stuck once in a while a legacy of an old fender bender several thumps with his palm got it open and he leaped out he sprinted toward the woman by the time he got to her she had the back door open of her yellow ford sedan she was just straightening up from having stowed her briefcase on the floor of the backseat kim was surprised by her height he estimated she had to be at least five foot ten marsha baldwin kim demanded mildly surprised at being accosted by name in the parking lot marsha turned to kim and gave him a onceover with her deep emeraldgreen eyes by reflex she swept a lock of her dark blond hair off her forehead and tucked it behind her ear she was confused by kims appearance and immediately put on guard by the confrontational tone of his voice yes im marsha baldwin she said hesitantly kim took in the whole picture including the bumper sticker that said save the manatees on what was obviously a governmentissue car and the image of the woman who was in jack cartwrights words a looker kim estimated she couldnt have been much over twentyfive with coraltoned skin and cameolike features her nose was prominent but aristocratic her lips sculpted in sharp relief we have to talk kim averred really marsha questioned and what are you an unemployed surgeon or did you just come from last nights costume party under different circumstances i might think that was clever kim said i was told you are a usda inspector and who gave you this information marsha asked warily shed been warned in her training that occasionally she might have to deal with kooks kim motioned toward the mercer meats entrance by an unctuous mercer meats pr man named jack cartwright and what if i was a usda inspector marsha asked she closed the rear door of her car and opened the front she had no intention of giving this strange man much time from his pocket kim extracted the paper with the details from the labels of the patty cartons in the onion ring he held it at the top corner shoulder high i want you to find out where the meat came from for these two lots marsha glanced at the paper what on earth for she questioned because i believe one of these lots has made my daughter deathly sick with a bad strain of e coli kim said not only do i want to know where the meat came from but i also need to know where these lots were shipped to how do you know it was one of these lots marsha asked i dont know for sure kim said at least not yet oh really marsha questioned superciliously yes really kim said hotly taking offense at her tone sorry i cant get you that kind of information marsha said why not kim demanded its not my job to give such information to the public marsha said im sure its against the rules marsha started to get into her car picturing his deathly ill daughter in her hospital bed kim roughly grabbed marshas arm to keep her from getting into the car screw the rules you goddamn bureaucrat he snapped this is important youre supposed to be protecting the public heres an opportunity to do just that marsha didnt panic she looked down at the hand gripping her arm then back up into kims indignant face let go of me or ill scream bloody murder you crank convinced she was a woman of her word kim let go of her arm he was nonplussed by marshas unexpected assertiveness be nice now marsha said as if she were talking with a juvenile i havent done anything to you like hell you havent kim said if you usda people werent acting out a sham and really inspected this meat industry my daughter wouldnt be sick nor would some five hundred kids die each year now just wait one minute marsha shot back i work hard at my job and i take it very seriously bull kim spat ive been told that you people work hard at going through the motions i even hear youre in bed with the industry youre supposed to be inspecting marshas mouth dropped open she was incensed im not going to validate that comment by responding she said she climbed in behind the wheel and pulled her door shut she stuck her key in the ignition kim rapped on her window wait a sec he yelled im sorry please he ran a worried hand through his disheveled hair im desperate for your help i didnt mean anything personal obviously i dont know you after a few seconds deliberation marsha rolled her window down and looked up at kim what had appeared to her a moment previously as the visage of an eccentric oddball now looked like the face of a tortured man are you really a doctor she asked yes kim said a cardiac surgeon to be exact and your daughter is really sick very very sick kim said with a voice that broke she has an extremely bad strain of e coli im almost positive she got it from eating a rare hamburger im truly sorry to hear that marsha said but listen im not the one you should be talking to ive only been working for the usda for a short time and im at the bottom of the inspectional service totem pole who do you think i should contact kim asked the district manager marsha said his name is sterling henderson i could give you his number is he sorta what youd call middle management kim asked he could hear kathleens voice in the back of his mind i suppose marsha said im not interested kim said ive been told there are real problems with the usda inspectional services in terms of conflict of interest especially in middlemanagement positions is this something you know anything about well i know there are problems marsha admitted its all very political meaning a multibilliondollar industry like the beef industry can throw its weight around something like that marsha said will you help me for my daughters sake kim asked i cant help her medically but im sure as hell going to find out the how and the why she got sick and maybe in the process do something about it id love to spare other kids from the same fate i think one of these lots on this piece of paper has to be contaminated with a particularly dangerous strain of e coli gosh i dont know what to say marsha responded she tapped the steering wheel as she debated with herself the idea of saving some children from a serious illness had great appeal but there were risks i dont think theres any way for me to get this material without your help kim said at least not fast enough to make a difference what about calling the department of public health marsha suggested thats an idea kim said ill be willing to try that too on monday but to tell you the truth i wouldnt be optimistic going that route id just be dealing with another bureaucracy and it probably would take too long besides i kinda want to do this myself its to make up for not being able to help my daughter medically i might be putting my job on the line marsha said although maybe i could enlist the aid of my immediate boss the trouble with that is that he and i have never had what i would call a good working relationship would that be the district manager whom you mentioned earlier kim asked thats right marsha said sterling henderson id prefer we just kept this between you and me kim said thats easy for you to say marsha said the trouble is its my job not yours tell me kim said suddenly having an idea have you ever seen a child ill with this e coli problem the reason i ask is because i never did before my own daughter got sick and im a doctor i mean id read about it but it was always an abstraction a statistic no i never have seen a child sick with e coli marsha admitted then come with me to see my daughter kim said after you see her you can then decide what to do ill accept whatever decision you make if nothing else it will give added meaning to your work where is she marsha asked shes at the university med center kim said the same hospital where im on the staff kim motioned toward marshas cell phone that he could see between the two front seats call the hospital if you question what im saying my name is dr kim reggis my daughters name is becky reggis i believe you marsha said she wavered when do you have in mind right now kim said come on my car is right over there kim pointed over his shoulder you can ride with me afterwards ill bring you back here to get your car i cant do that marsha said i dont know you from adam all right kim said warming to the idea of marsha seeing becky follow me i was only worrying about where youd park once at the hospital but screw it just follow me right into the doctors lot what do you say id say you are persistent and persuasive marsha said all right kim exclaimed raising a clenched fist for emphasis ill loop around here so just follow me okay marsha said warily unsure of what shed gotten herself into jack cartwright had had his nose pressed against the window hed kept an eye on kim and had witnessed the entire confrontation between kim and marsha baldwin of course hed not heard what theyd said but he did see marsha follow his car out of the lot after the two had seemed to reach some agreement leaving the reception area jack hustled down the central corridor passing the stairwell where hed taken kim up to the observation tunnel at the far end of the hall were the administration offices is the boss in jack asked one of the secretaries he sure is she said without interrupting her word processing jack knocked on the presidents closed door a booming voice told him to come the hell in everett sorenson had been successfully running mercer meats for almost twenty years it had been under his leadership that the company had been bought out by foodsmart and that the new plant had been constructed sorenson was a big man even stockier than jack with a florid complexion small ears for his size and a shiny bald pate what the hell are you all wired up about everett asked as jack came into the room everett had a sixth sense about his minion whom hed personally elevated right off the pattyroom floor into the companys hierarchy we got a problem jack said oh everett said he tipped forward in his desk chair to lean his bulky torso on his elbows whats up jack took one of the two chairs in front of everett s desk you know that article you pointed out in the paper this morning the one about the crazy doctor carrying on about e coli and getting arrested in the onion ring restaurant on prairie highway of course everett said what about it he was just here jack said the doctor everett asked with disbelief the exact same guy jack said his name is dr reggis and ill tell you straight this guy is a nutcase hes out of control and hes convinced his daughter got her e coli from one of our patties damn everett intoned this is not what we need and it gets worse jack said i just watched him have a conversation in our parking lot with marsha baldwin afterwards they drove away in tandem you mean you think they drove away together everett asked jack nodded thats the way it looked before they left theyd talked for quite a while in the parking lot jesus christ everett said slapping the surface of his desk with one of his shovellike hands he pushed back from the desk and got to his feet to pace this is not what we need no way that goddamn baldwin bitch has been a thorn in my side from the day she was hired shes constantly filing these stupid deficiency reports thank god sterling henderson has been able to can them cant sterling do something about her jack asked like get her fired i wish everett said ive been complaining until im blue in the face with the money were paying him as if he still works here jack said youd think hed at least get her transferred in his defense its a difficult situation everett said apparently her father is connected in washington which leaves us up the creek without a paddle jack said now weve got an overzealous inspector who doesnt play by the rules teamed up with a loosecannon physician whos willing to get himself arrested at a fastfood restaurant just to make a point im afraid this guy could be like a kamikaze pilot hell sacrifice himself but hes bent on taking us with him i dont like this everett said nervously another e coli fiasco would be devastating hudson meat management didnt survive their runin with the bug but what can we do weve got to do damage control jack said and we have to do it quickly it seems to me that this is the perfect time to call into play the newly formed prevention committee i mean this kind of situation is exactly what it was formed for you know something everett said youre right it would be perfect i mean we wouldnt even be involved why not give bobby bo mason a call jack suggested ill do that everett said warming to the whole idea this type of tactical thinking and decisionmaking was why hed promoted jack to the vice presidency time is of the essence jack said ill call right away everett said maybe we can take advantage of bos dinner party tonight jack said that might speed things up i mean everybody will be there good point everett said as he reached for his phone kim parked quickly he got out in time to direct marsha into one of the spots reserved for doctors that kim was relatively confident wouldnt be used on a saturday he opened her door the moment she stopped are you sure this is a good idea marsha asked as she got out she looked up at the imposing facade of the hospital after having time to think about the plan during the drive into the city she was having second thoughts i think it is a masterful idea kim said i dont know why it took me so long to think of it come on kim took marshas arm and guided her toward the entrance she put up a token resistance at first but then resigned herself to the situation shed rarely been in a hospital and didnt know how shed respond she was afraid it might upset her more than she bargained back in the mercer meats parking lot to her surprise while they waited for the elevator in the hospital lobby she noticed that kim was trembling not she are you all right she asked to be truthful no kim admitted obviously ive been in and out of hospitals since medical school and its never bothered me even at the beginning but now with beckys situation i get this awful anxiety every time i come through the door i guess its the main reason ive not been staying here around the clock it would be different if there were something i could do but there isnt it must be heartwrenching marsha said youve no idea kim said they boarded a crowded elevator and didnt talk until they were in the corridor leading toward the icu i dont mean to be nosy marsha said but how is your wife holding up under the strain of your daughters illness were divorced kim said but were united in our concern for becky tracy my exwife is taking it hard although i sense shes doing better than i im sure shes here ill introduce you marsha shuddered having to share a mothers anguish was going to make the experience that much more disturbing she began to question why shed allowed herself to be dragged into this then to make matters worse marsha saw signs to the icu that pointed in the direction they were walking is your daughter in intensive care she asked hoping for a negative response im afraid so kim answered marsha sighed this was going to be even worse than shed feared kim paused at the threshold of the icu waiting room he saw tracy and motioned for marsha to follow him by the time be reached tracy his former wife had gotten to her feet tracy id like you to meet marsha baldwin marsha is a usda inspector who im hoping will help me trace the meat becky had tracy didnt answer immediately and seeing her expression kim instantly knew that something else had happened it seemed that every time he came back becky got worse it was like a bad movie playing over and over what now kim asked grimly why didnt you answer your phone tracy asked with weary exasperation it didnt ring kim said i tried to call tracy said several times kim realized hed left his phone in his car when hed been in mercer meats and when he had been with marsha well im here now kim said disconsolately what happened her heart stopped tracy said but they got it going again i was in the room when it happened perhaps i should leave marsha said no kim said emphatically stay please let me go in and see whats happening kim spun on his heels and ran from the room tracy and marsha regarded each other uneasily im so sorry about your daughter marsha said thank you tracy said she dabbed at the corners of her eyes with a tissue shed cried so much in the previous fortyeight hours that she was almost out of tears shes such a wonderful child i wasnt aware your daughter was quite this ill marsha said it must be a terrible burden unimaginable tracy said i feel terrible about intruding at a time like this marsha said im very sorry perhaps i should just leave you dont have to leave on my accord tracy said kim sounded emphatic that hed prefer you stay how he can even think about tracing meat at this juncture i cannot understand im having difficulty just breathing it must be because hes a doctor marsha said he made it clear to me he was interested in trying to prevent other children from getting the same problem i suppose i hadnt thought about it from that angle tracy said maybe i shouldnt be so quick to judge hes afraid theres a batch of contaminated meat out there marsha said i guess thats a real possibility tracy said but what i dont understand is why he brought you here i dont mean that to be rude i understand marsha said hed asked me to help trace the meat in some specific lots i was reluctant its really not part of my job in fact giving out that kind of information might cost me my job if my boss found out his idea was that seeing your daughter and witnessing firsthand what this e coli can do might change my mind at a minimum he thought seeing her would give added meaning to my work as a meat inspector seeing beckys suffering might make you the most conscientious inspector in the world are you still interested in knowing how sick she is itll take a bit of fortitude i dont know marsha said truthfully and as i said i dont want to intrude youre not intruding tracy said with sudden resolve come on lets make your visit tracy led marsha out of the waiting room and across the corridor she paused at the icu door stay close tracy said were not supposed to be wandering in and out of here unaccompanied marsha nodded her heart was beating rapidly and she was perspiring tracy opened the door and the two women entered tracy walked quickly toward beckys cubicle with marsha right behind her several of the nurses saw the women but said nothing tracy had become a fixture in the icu over the previous fortyeight hours im afraid its going to be difficult to see much at all tracy said as they reached the cubicles threshold besides kim there were six doctors and two nurses packed into the tiny room but it was kims voice that could be heard i understand that she has arrested several times kim yelled he was furious from a combination of fear and exasperation drawing on his vast clinical experience he knew his daughter was at deaths door but no one was giving him a straight answer and no one was doing anything but stand around and figuratively stroke their chins what im asking is why its happening kim stared at jason zimmerman the pediatric cardiologist to whom hed just been introduced the man looked off pretending to be absorbed in watching the cardiac monitor that was tracing an erratic rhythm something was terribly wrong kim twisted to look at claire stevens over her shoulder he caught sight of tracy and marsha we dont know what is going on claire admitted theres no pericardial fluid so its not tamponade it seems to me its something inherent in the myocardium itself jason said i need a real ekg no sooner had these words escaped from the cardiologists mouth than the monitor alarm sounded the cursor swept across the screen tracing a flat line becky had arrested again code blue one of the nurses shouted to alert the others out in the intensivecare unit proper jason responded by pushing kim away from the side of the bed immediately he began external cardiac massage by putting his hands together and pumping on beckys frail chest jane flanagan the anesthesiologist whod responded to the initial code and who was still there made sure the endotracheal tube remained in proper place she also upped the percentage of oxygen delivered by the respirator icu nurses brought the cardiac crash cart on the run they practically collided with tracy and marsha who had to leap out of the way inside the cubicle there was a flurry of activity as the doctors present all lent a hand it was apparent to everyone that the heart had not just stopped effective beating but that all electrical activity had ceased tracy clasped a hand to her face she wanted to flee but she couldnt it was as if she were frozen in place fated to watch every agonizing detail all marsha could do was cringe behind tracy fearful that she would be in the way kim initially stepped back recoiling in disbelief and horror his eyes swept back and forth between the monitor screen to his daughters pitiful body being savaged by the pediatric cardiologist epinephrine jason yelled while he continued his efforts the nurses at the crash cart responded by efficiently filling a syringe with the medication and handing it off after several changes of hand it was given to jason who stopped his massage long enough to plunge the needle directly into beckys heart tracy covered her eyes and moaned marsha instinctively put her arms around her but couldnt take her own eyes off the ghastly drama unfolding in front of her jason went back to the massage while he eyed the monitor there was no change in its relentless tracking straight across the screen bring the paddles jason yelled lets see if we can get some electrical activity going with a shock if that doesnt work were going to have to pace her so be prepared the experienced nurses had already charged the defibrillator they handed the paddles forward jason stopped his massage to take them everybody back he yelled while he positioned them when everyone was clear and the paddles where he wanted them he pressed the discharge button beckys pale body jerked and her white arms flailed everyones eyes went to the monitor hoping to see some change but the cursor was not cooperating it persisted in its straight flat line kim pushed forward he didnt like the way jason was doing the massage youre not getting enough excursion he said let me take over no claire said coming up behind kim and pulling him back dr reggis its not appropriate well handle this i think you should wait outside kim shook off the pediatrician his pupils were dilated and his face flushed he was not going anywhere jason responded to kims complaint as a man of small stature it was hard for him to develop much force in a standing position to make it easier for himself he climbed up onto the bed and assumed a kneeling position now he got better chest compression it was so much better that everyone present could hear several of beckys ribs snap more epinephrine kim barked no jason managed between pants i want calcium epinephrine kim repeated his eyes were glued to the monitor cursor when no syringe was forthcoming he turned to look at the crash cart wheres the epi he demanded calcium jason repeated weve got to see some electrical activity theres got to be an ion imbalance calciums coming up claire said no kim yelled he pushed through the group to stand in front of the crash cart he glared at the nurse the nurse looked from kims florid face to claires the nurse was confused as to what she should do unaccustomed to being overruled kim snapped up a syringe packet and tore it open then he grabbed a vial of epinephrine and broke off its top his trembling fingers dropped the needle he had to get another dr reggis no claire said she grabbed kims arm walter ohanesian the hematologist tried to help by grabbing kims other arm kim easily shook off both of these doctors and filled the syringe unimpeded pandemonium ensued as he tried to push his way back to the bedside both kathleen and arthur the nephrologist came to claire and walters aid the scene devolved to a shoving match with shouts and threats oh god tracy moaned what a nightmare hold it everybody jane shouted at the top of her lungs to get everyones attention the struggle stopped then jane added with urgency but in a more normal volume theres something very strange happening jasons getting good chest excursion and im up to a hundredpercent oxygen and yet her pupils are dilating for some reason theres no circulation kim shook off the hands that were impeding him no one moved or spoke except for jason who kept up with the massage the doctors were stymied they were at a temporary loss as to what to do next kim was the first to respond his training as a surgeon would not allow him to deliberate a moment longer he knew what he had to do with no circulation despite good chest excursion there was only one alternative he spun around to face the nurses at the crash cart scalpel he barked oh no claire shouted scalpel kim repeated more insistently you cant claire yelled scalpel kim screamed tossing the syringe of epinephrine aside he lunged past the others in the direction of the crash cart kim snatched the glass tube containing the scalpel he unscrewed the top with trembling fingers and extracted the sterile instrument he tossed the glass tube aside it shattered on the tile floor he picked up an alcohol swab and tore open its package with his teeth at this point only claire was willing to attempt to bar his way but her efforts were in vain he pushed her aside with a gentle but firm shove no tracy cried she wasnt a physician but her intuition told her what kim was going to do she started forward and marsha let her go kim reached the bedside and literally knocked jason off the bed he swabbed beckys chest with alcohol then before tracy could quite get to him he sliced open his daughters thorax in one decisive bloodless sweep a collective gasp rose from everyone present except for tracy her response was more of a wail she staggered back from the appalling scene and would have collapsed if she hadnt been caught by the nephrologist arthur on the other side of the bed jason struggled to his feet when he saw what was happening he too shrank back kim lost no time oblivious to the others in the tiny room the consummate surgeon used both hands to pull beckys slender ribs apart with a decisive crack then he shoved his bare hand into his daughters open chest and began rhythmically to compress her heart kims herculean effort was shortlived after only a few compressions he could feel that beckys heart had perforated and was far from normal in texture it was as if it werent muscle but rather something much softer which seemed to squish between his fingers stunned by this unexpected situation he withdrew his hand in the process he also pulled out some of the foreignfeeling tissue confused as to what it could be he brought the bloody material up to his face to inspect it a shrill agonizing whine escaped from kims lips when he realized he was holding necrotic shreds of beckys heart and pericardium the toxin had been merciless it was as if his daughter had been eaten from within the door to the icu burst open two uniformed hospital security personnel spilled into the room they had been called by the head nurse after the scuffle over the epinephrine as soon as the two men took in the scene they stopped in their tracks becky was still being respired by the ventilator her pink lungs intermittently filled the gaping incision kim stood by her his hands bloodied his eyes wild with grief he tried to gently return the necrotic tissue to beckys chest cavity when he was finished with this futile gesture he put his head back and let out a wail of anguish unlike anything ever heard in the icu before tracy had recovered enough to step forward kims anguished cry cut her to the quick she wanted to comfort him and be comforted herself but kim was blind to everyone and anything he shoved his way out of the cubicle and dashed across the icu before anyone could respond he was through the door in the corridor kim went into headlong flight people who saw him coming got out of the way one orderly didnt move quickly enough kim slammed into him sending the man and his water cart flying outside of the hospital kim ran to his car gunning the engine he shot out of the doctors lot leaving a line of rubber in his wake kim drove like a madman out to prairie highway lucky for him he encountered no police cruisers when he turned into the onion ring parking lot he was going fast enough to bottom out just as he had on his previous visit the car bounced violently until he brought it to a screeching stop directly in front of the busy restaurant yanking on the emergency brake he made the motions to get out then he hesitated a glimmer of rationality seeped into the corners of his emotionally overloaded brain the saturday afternoon crowd enjoying their burgers milkshakes and fries and oblivious to his psychic pain yanked him back to reality kim had raced to the onion ring in search of a scapegoat but now that he was there he didnt get out of the car instead he raised his right hand and stared at it seeing his daughters dark dried blood confirmed the awful reality becky was dead and he hadnt been able to do a thing to save her he began to sob all he could do was drape himself helplessly over the steering wheel tracy shook her head in disbelief of everything that had happened she ran her hand through her tangled hair as marsha baldwin patted her shoulder on top of everything else it was hard to believe she was being consoled by a stranger tracy had responded the opposite of kim instead of flying off in a blind rage shed found herself paralyzed unable to even cry right after kims precipitous departure claire and kathleen had accompanied tracy to the icu waiting room marsha had followed although at the time tracy was unaware of her presence claire and kathleen had stayed with tracy for some time to offer their sympathies and to explain what had happened they had spared no details in response to tracy s questions including how the e coli toxin had obviously attacked both beckys heart muscle as well as her pericardium the covering around the heart claire and kathleen had offered to help get tracy home but tracy had told them that she had her car and that shed be all right to drive it wasnt until the two doctors had left that tracy realized that marsha was still there and the two women had begun a long conversation i want to thank you for staying here all this time tracy said youve been a wonderful support i hope i havent bored you with all these becky stories she sounds like she was a wonderful child the best tracy said wistfully then she took a fortifying breath and sat up straight in her chair the two women were sitting in the far corner of the room by the window where theyd pulled two chairs close together outside the long shadows of a late wintery afternoon crept ever eastward you know tracy said weve been talking all this time and havent mentioned my exhusband the man whos responsible for your being here marsha nodded life is full of surprises tracy said with a sigh here i lose my beloved daughter who was the center of my life and i surprise myself by worrying about him i just hope beckys passing doesnt drive him over the edge what do you mean marsha asked im not sure tracy admitted i guess im terrified at what he might do hes already been arrested for assaulting the manager at the restaurant where he suspects becky got sick i just hope he doesnt do something really crazy and end up hurting someone or himself he does seem angry marsha said thats putting it mildly tracy said he was always such a perfectionist it used to be his anger was directed mostly toward himself it served as a stimulus for achievement but thats been changing over the last few years its a big reason why we ended up divorcing im sorry to hear that marsha said he is basically a good man tracy said egotistical and selfcentered but still a very good doctor certainly one of the best surgeons in his field im not surprised marsha said one of the things that impressed me about him was that in the middle of all this he was still thinking about other children how do you feel about helping him after what youve seen here this afternoon tracy asked it would be wonderful if he could channel his anger about becky in some positive direction id like to help very much marsha said but i guess he scared me i dont know him the way you do its hard to put his actions in any perspective i understand tracy said but i hope youll consider it ill give you his address knowing him as well as i do im sure hell hole up there until his anger and sense of injustice drive him out to do something all i can hope is that with your help his energies can be channeled into action that will make a difference marsha climbed into her car she didnt start it immediately but mulled over the events of this strange day it had all started when shed impulsively decided to put in a few hours of overtime at mercer meats marsha wondered how to go about getting the information that kim wanted the source of meat for the various lots was recorded in the pattyroom logs but reading specific entries was not within her usual province her job was just to confirm that the log was being kept knowing that someone was always looking over her shoulder she wondered how she could do it without raising suspicion the problem was she didnt want her own boss to know what she was up to and that would be tricky since mercer meats was in close contact with her superiors concerning everything she did the answer was obvious shed go after hours when only the cleaning crew was there in fact saturday was an ideal day for her to try it would be quieter than usual marsha got out the address tracy had given her and consulted the city map she had in the car kims house was relatively close she decided to pay him a visit to see if he was still interested in her help it didnt take long for marsha to find the property but when she arrived she was dismayed there wasnt a single light to counteract the gathering gloom the house was a huge black hulk silhouetted in its dense surround of trees marsha was about to leave when she caught sight of kims car parked in the dark shadows in front of the garage she decided to get out of her car and go to the front door on the off chance he was there marsha rang the bell she was surprised at the loudness and clarity of the chimes until she noticed that the front door was not fully closed when kim didnt respond to the bell she rang it again again there was no response mystified and concerned by the door being ajar in the middle of the winter marsha took a chance and pushed it open farther she leaned into the front hall and called out kims name there was no answer from where she was standing marshas eyes adapted so she could see up the staircase as well as through the dining room and all the way to the kitchen she called kims name again but again there was no response unsure what to do next marsha thought about leaving but then tracy s comment about kim possibly hurting himself came into her mind she wondered if she should call the police but that seemed a fairly extreme action to take based on so little evidence she decided to probe further before deciding what to do marshaling her courage marsha stepped into the foyer intending to go to the base of the stairs but she didnt get far halfway across the hall she stopped dead in her tracks kim was sitting in a club chair in an otherwise empty room less than ten feet away he looked like a specter in the half darkness his white doctors coat appeared to glow like the radium dial of an old wristwatch my god marsha exclaimed you scared me kim didnt respond he didnt even move dr reggis marsha questioned for a fleeting moment she wondered if he was dead what do you want kim asked in a tired monotone maybe i shouldnt have come i just wanted to offer my help and just how do you plan to help by doing what youd asked me earlier marsha said i know it wont bring your daughter back but id like to help you track the meat in those lots you think might be contaminated of course it might be futile you have to understand that in this day and age the meat in a single hamburger patty can come from a hundred different cows from ten different countries but be that as it may im willing to give it a try if you still want me to why the change of heart kim asked mainly because you were right about the effect of seeing a sick child but also because you were right to an extent about the usda i wasnt willing to admit it either but i know theres footdragging by my superiors and too much collusion between the agency and the beef industry every one of the deficiency reports ive filed for violations ive uncovered have been suppressed by my district manager hes all but told me to my face to look the other way when theres a problem why didnt you say this to me before kim asked i dont know marsha said loyalty to my employer i suppose you see i think the system could work it just needs more people like me who want it to work and meanwhile meat gets contaminated and people get sick kim said and kids like becky die unfortunately thats true marsha said but we in the business all know where the problem is its in the slaughterhouses its simply profit over safe meat when are you willing to help kim asked whenever marsha said right now if youre up for it actually tonight would be a good time for me to try because therell be less risk the only people at mercer meats now would be the overtime cleaning crew i cant imagine theyd think much if i browse through the patty room logs all right kim said youre on lets go thirteen saturday evening january th tracy felt shellshocked her divorce had been tough especially the custody battle with kim but it was nothing compared to what she was feeling now thanks to her experience as a therapist she recognized clearly the symptoms she was on the verge of slipping into a serious depression from having counseled other people in similar circumstances she knew it wasnt going to be easy but she wanted to fight it at the same time she knew she had to let herself grieve as she rounded the final bend in the road and approached her house she could see carls yellow lamborghini parked at the curb she didnt know whether shed be glad to see him or not tracy pulled into her driveway and turned off the engine carl came down the steps to meet her carrying a bouquet of flowers tracy stepped out of her car and into carls arms for a few minutes they didnt talk he just held her in the lateafternoon darkness how did you find out tracy asked with her head still pressed against carls chest being on the hospital board i hear all the news carl said im so sorry thank you tracy said god i feel drained i can imagine carl said come on lets get you inside they started walking up the pathway i hear kim really lost it that must make it extra tough on you tracy only nodded the mans clearly out of control who does he think he is god i tell you the whole hospital is in an uproar tracy opened the door without responding she and carl went in kims having a hard time tracy said ha carl commented he took tracy s coat and hung it along with his in the hall closet thats an understatement as usual youre being generous im not nearly so charitable in fact i could club him for carrying on the way he did in the onion ring restaurant last night about beckys getting sick there did you see the article in the paper its had a big effect on the onion ring share price i cant tell you how much of a paper loss ive suffered from his lunacy tracy went into the living room and collapsed on the couch she felt exhausted and yet wired and anxious at the same time carl followed her can i get you something carl asked like a drink or some food tracy shook her head carl sat across from her i spoke to some other members of the foodsmart board he said were seriously thinking about suing him if the share price continues to fall it wasnt an idle accusation on his part tracy said becky had a rare burger there the night before she got sick oh come on carl said with a dismissive wave of his hand becky didnt get sick there hundreds of thousands of burgers are made in the chain no one gets sick we cook those burgers to death tracy didnt say anything carl quickly realized what hed said im sorry that was a poor choice of words under the circumstances its okay carl tracy said wearily ill tell you what bugs me about all this carl said hamburger has gotten a bad rap with this e coli brouhaha its now like a kneejerk reaction e coli and hamburger hell people have gotten the same e coli from apple juice lettuce milk even swimming in a contaminated pond dont you think its unfair that hamburger has to take all the crap i dont know tracy said im sorry i cant be more responsive i feel numb its hard for me to think of course dear carl said im the one who should be sorry for carrying on like i am i think you should eat when was the last time you had a meal i cant remember tracy said well there you go carl said how about we go out to some quiet place tracy looked at carl in total disbelief my daughter just died im not going out how can you even ask okay carl said raising his hands in defense it was just an idea i think you should eat i suppose i could get some takeout food what about that tracy lowered her face into her hands carl was not helping im not hungry besides maybe it would be better for me to just be alone tonight im not very good company really carl questioned he was hurt yes really tracy said she raised her head im sure theres something you should be doing well there is the dinner at bobby bo masons house carl said remember me telling you about that i cant say that i do tracy said tiredly whos bobby bo hes one of the local cattle barons carl said tonights the celebration of his assuming the presidency of the american beef alliance sounds very important tracy said in contrast to how she felt it is carl said its the most powerful national organization in the business then dont let me keep you from it tracy said you wouldnt mind carl said ill have my cellular phone you can call me and i can be back here in twenty minutes tops i wouldnt mind at all tracy said in fact id feel bad if you missed it on my account the cars instrument panel splashed light on kims face marsha stole glances at him as she drove now that shed had a chance to observe him she had to admit to herself that he was a handsome man even with his twoday stubble they drove in silence for quite a ways finally marsha was able to get kim talking about becky she had a feeling it would be good for him to talk about his daughter and she was right kim warmed to the subject he regaled marsha with stories of beckys skating exploits something tracy had not mentioned when the conversation about becky lapsed marsha had talked a little about herself explaining that shed been through veterinary school shed described how she and a girlfriend had become interested in the usda and had vowed to join the agency to make a difference shed explained that after graduation theyd discovered there were obstacles for them to get into the veterinarian side of the usda the only entrylevel positions available were with the inspectional services in the end it had only been marsha whod joined the friend had decided the year or so it would take to be transferred was too big a sacrifice and had opted for private veterinarian practice veterinary school kim questioned i wouldnt have guessed why not marsha asked i dont know exactly kim said maybe you are a little too kim paused as he struggled for a word finally he said too elegant i guess i know its probably unfair but id expect someone to be more more what marsha asked as kim paused again she was enjoying kims mild discomfort i guess tomboyish kim said he chuckled i suppose thats a stupid thing to say marsha laughed too at least he could hear how ridiculous he sounded if you dont mind my asking kim said how old are you i know thats an inappropriate question but unless you are some kind of child prodigy youre not in your early twenties like id guessed heavens no marsha said im twentynine pushing thirty marsha leaned forward and turned on the windshield wipers it had started to rain it was already as dark as pitch even though it was only a little after six in the evening how are we going to work this kim questioned work what marsha asked my getting into mercer meats kim said i told you it wont be a problem marsha said the day shift is long gone along with the supervisors only the overtime cleaning crew will be there along with a security guard well the guards not going to be excited about letting me in kim said maybe i should just wait in the car security is not going to be a problem marsha said i have both my usda and mercer meats ids thats fine for you kim said but what about me dont worry marsha said they know me theyve never once even asked to see my id if it comes up ill say youre my supervisor or ill say im training you she laughed im not dressed like someone from the usda kim said marsha shot kim a glance and giggled some more what does a night security man know i think you look bizarre enough to pass for most anything you seem awfully cavalier about this kim commented well whats the worstcase scenario marsha said we dont get in and you get into trouble kim said ive already thought of that marsha said what happens happens marsha exited the expressway and started through bartonville they had to stop at the single traffic light in the town where mercer street met main street when i think about hamburger marsha said im surprised anyone eats it i was a halfass vegetarian before this job now im a committed one coming from a usda meat inspector thats not very reassuring kim said it turns my stomach when i think of what hamburger has in it marsha said what do you mean kim said its muscle muscle and a bunch of other stuff marsha said have you ever heard of the advanced meat recovery system cant say that i have kim said its a highpressure device that they use to clean every scrap off cattle bones marsha said it results in a gray slurry that they dye red and add to the hamburger thats disgusting kim said and centralnervous tissue marsha said like spinal cord that gets into hamburger all the time really kim asked absolutely marsha said and thats worse than it sounds youve heard of mad cow disease who hasnt kim said thats an illness that terrifies me the idea of a heatresistant protein that you get by eating and that is fatal is the ultimate horror thank god we dont have it in this country we dont have it yet marsha said at least it hasnt been seen so far but if you ask me its just a matter of time do you know what is thought to have caused mad cow disease in england i believe its thought to have come from feeding rendered sheep to the cows kim said sheep that were sick with scrapie the sheep equivalent exactly marsha said and in this country theres supposed to be a ban on feeding rendered sheep to cows but you know something theres no enforcement and i was told by insiders that as many as a quarter of the renderers admit in private they dont pay any attention to the ban in other words the same circumstances that resulted in mad cow disease in england are present here precisely marsha said and with spinal cord and the like routinely getting into hamburger the chain to humans is in place thats why i say its just a matter of time before we see the first cases good god kim exclaimed the more i hear about this shoddy business the more appalled i get id no idea about any of this nor does the general public marsha said the white hulk of mercer meats loomed up and marsha turned into its parking area in contrast to earlier that day there were few cars she pulled up close to the front door in the same spot shed been in that morning she turned off the engine ready she asked youre sure i should come kim asked come on marsha said she opened the door and got out the front door was locked marsha rapped on it inside the guard was seated at the round reception desk reading a magazine he responded by getting up and coming to the door he was an elderly gentleman with a thin mustache his security uniform appeared to be several sizes too big mercer meats is closed he said through the glass marsha held up her mercer meats id card the guard squinted at it then unlocked and opened the door marsha immediately pushed in thanks she said simply kim followed he could tell the guard looked at him suspiciously but the man didnt say anything he merely locked the door kim had to run to catch up to marsha who was already beyond the reception desk and briskly walking down the corridor what did i tell you she said it was no problem at all the security guard walked over to the end of the reception area and peered down the hall he watched as marsha and kim disappeared into the changing room leading to the production floor he returned to his desk and picked up the phone the number he needed was on a postit stuck to the edge of the counter mr cartwright the guard said when the call was answered that usda lady miss baldwin who you asked me to watch for just walked in the door with another guy was her companion dressed in a white lab coat something like a doctors jack asked yup the security man said when they leave get them both to sign out jack said i want proof they were there ill do that sir the guard said jack did not bother to replace the receiver instead he pressed the appropriate button on his speeddialer and waited a moment later everett s stentorian voice reverberated through the line marsha baldwin and the doctor are back at the plant jack said good grief everett sputtered thats not what i wanted to hear how the devil did you find out i left word with security to call if they showed up jack said just in case good thinking everett said i wonder what on earth theyre doing there my guess is theyre going to try to trace some meat jack said thats what he asked me to do this morning lets not guess everett said you get the hell over there and see what theyre up to then get back to me i dont want this to ruin my evening jack hung up the phone he didnt want it to ruin his evening either hed been looking forward to the dinner at bobby bos for a month and had certainly not anticipated having to go back to the plant he was in a foul mood when he got his coat and went out to the garage for his car kim stamped his feet and flapped his arms he didnt quite understand it but the thirtyfivedegree temperature of the patty room felt more like twentyfive or even fifteen hed pulled on a mercer meats white coat over his own hospital coat but they were just cotton and underneath he had on only his scrubs the three layers were not nearly enough insulation against the chill especially since he was essentially standing around the showerlike white cap didnt help at all marsha was leafing through the pattyroom logbooks and had been doing so for more than a quarter of an hour locating the specific dates lots and batches was taking longer than expected initially kim had looked over her shoulder but the colder hed become the less interested he was there were two other people in the room besides marsha and kim they were busy pulling hoses around as they cleaned the pattyformulating machine with highpressure steam they had been there when marsha and kim arrived but hadnt made any attempts at conversation ah here we go marsha said triumphantly heres december twentyninth she ran her finger down the column until she came to lot then moving horizontally she came to the appropriate batches one through five uhoh she said whats the matter kim asked he came over to look its just what i was afraid of she said batches one through five were a mixture of fresh boneless beef from higgins and hancock and imported frozen ground beef the imported stuff is impossible to trace other than maybe the country of course that would be useless for what you want whats higgins and hancock kim asked its a local slaughterhouse marsha said one of the bigger ones what about the other lot kim asked lets check that marsha said she turned the page heres the date what were the lot and batch numbers again lot six batches nine through fourteen kim said consulting his paper okay here it is marsha said hey were in luck if the january twelfth production is the culprit those batches were all from higgins and hancock take a peek kim looked at where she was pointing it indicated that the entire lot was made from fresh beef produced on january ninth at higgins and hancock wasnt there some way to narrow it down to one or the other marsha asked not according to the shortorder cook at the onion ring kim said but i dropped off samples from both production dates at the lab they should have the result by monday until then well assume its the january date marsha said because thats the only one thats going to be traceable hopefully well be able to go beyond higgins and hancock really kim questioned you mean well be able to trace the meat back further than the slaughterhouse thats the way the system is supposed to work marsha said at least in theory the trouble is a lot of cows can go into one of those twothousandpound combos of boneless beef but the idea is to be able to trace the animals through purchase invoices back to the ranch or farm they came from anyway the next step is to go to higgins and hancock give me that goddamn book jack cartwright yelled marsha and kim leaped in fright as jack lunged around marsha and snatched up the ponderous logbooks the noise from the highpressure steam had kept them from hearing the man enter the patty room and approach them now you have finally overstepped your bounds miss baldwin jack sneered triumphantly while pointing an accusatory finger into marshas face marsha straightened up and tried to regain her composure what are you talking about she asked attempting to sound authoritative i have a right to examine the logs the hell you do jack said while continuing to poke his finger at marsha you have the right to ascertain we keep the logs but the logs themselves are private property of a private company and more important you do not have the right to bring in the public under the authority of the usda to look at these logs thats enough kim said he stepped between the two if anybody is to blame here its me jack ignored kim one thing i can assure you miss baldwin is that sterling henderson the district usda manager is going to hear about this violation of yours asap kim batted jacks brutish finger to the side and grabbed a handful of the mans white coat listen you oily bastard marsha gripped kims arm no she cried leave him alone lets not compound this reluctantly kim let go jack smoothed his lapels i want you two out of here he snarled before i call the police and have you arrested kim glared back at the mercer meats vice president for a blind instant the man was the embodiment of all kims anger marsha had to pull on his sleeve to get him to leave jack watched them go as soon as the door closed he hoisted the logs up to chest height and slipped them into their appropriate shelves then he followed them into the changing room marsha and kim were already gone out in the hall he walked down to the reception area he got there in time to see marshas car leaving the lot and accelerating up the street they didnt pay me no attention the guard said i tried to tell them they had to sign out it doesnt make any difference jack said jack walked back to his office and phoned everett well what did you learn everett demanded it was just as i suspected jack said they were in the patty room looking at the pattyroom logs they werent looking at the formulation logs everett asked the guard said they hadnt gone anyplace but the patty room jack said so they couldnt have looked at the formulation logs at least thats a blessing everett said the last thing i want is for someone to find out were recycling outdated frozen patties and that might happen if someone were to snoop around in the formulation logs thats not a worry with this crisis jack said what is a worry is that this duo might end up at higgins and hancock i heard them talking about higgins and hancock before i surprised them i think daryl webster should be warned an excellent idea everett said we can mention it to daryl when we see him tonight better yet maybe ill give him a quick call the sooner the better jack said who knows what these two might do as crazy as that doctor seems to be see you at bobby bos everett said i might be a tad late jack said ive got to go all the way back home to change before i drive over there well get a move on everett said i want you there for the prevention committee meeting ill do what i can jack said everett hung up the phone and then searched for daryl websters phone number he was in his upstairs study off his dressing room halfdressed in his tuxedo when jack had called hed been struggling with his shirt studs formal attire was not a common requirement in everett s life everett gladys sorenson called from the master bedroom gladys and everett had been married for more years than everett wished to acknowledge youd better shake a leg dear were due over at the masons in half an hour i gotta make a quick call everett yelled back he found the number and quickly dialed the phone was answered on the first ring daryl everett sorenson here everett said this is a surprise daryl said the two men not only had traveled similar career paths they even resembled each other physically daryl was equally heavyset with a thick neck shovellike hands and a ruddy plethoric face the difference was that daryl had a full head of hair and normalsized ears the mrs and i are just about to walk out the door on our way to the masons gladys and i are about to do the same everett said but somethings come up you know that young painintheass inspector marsha baldwin whos been causing me grief yeah henderson told me about her daryl said a real independent troublemaker as i understand it well shes hooked up with that raving maniac doctor who got himself arrested last night at an onion ring restaurant did you see that in todays paper who could miss it daryl said it gave me a cold sweat with him carrying on about e coli you and me both everett said and now its gotten worse a little while ago she snuck into my plant with the doctor somehow hes got her to help him trace meat presumably looking for e coli daryl said undoubtedly everett said this is very scary daryl said i couldnt agree more everett said especially since jack cartwright overheard them talking about higgins and hancock were concerned they may show up at your establishment on the same crusade this i dont need daryl said were going to be talking about a longterm solution tonight everett said did you get the message i did daryl said bobby bo called me in the meantime maybe you should take some precautions everett said thanks for the tip daryl said ill call my security and alert them thats exactly what i would have suggested everett said see you in a little while daryl disconnected he held up a finger to indicate to his wife hazel that he had one more quick call to make hazel dressed to the nines was impatiently waiting at the front door while she tapped her toe daryl dialed the main number at the slaughterhouse marsha turned into kims driveway and stopped directly behind kims car she left the motor running and the headlights on i appreciate what youve done kim said he had his hand on the door but he didnt open it im sorry it didnt go more smoothly it could have been worse marsha said brightly and who knows whats going to happen well just have to see how it plays out would you like to come in kim asked my house is a wreck but i could use a drink how about you thanks but i think ill take a rain check marsha said youve got me started on something i intend to finish by the time you get the lab results on monday id like to have the meat traced as much as possible that way wed be that much farther ahead of the game when we try to make an argument for a recall are you planning on doing something now yup marsha said with a nod she glanced at her watch im going to head directly out to higgins and hancock this might be my only chance as i said earlier the district usda manager and i have never gotten along come monday when he hears about our little escapade from jack cartwright i might be out of a job of course that would mean id lose my id card gosh kim remarked if you lose your job im going to feel terrible its certainly not what i intended theres no need for you to feel responsible marsha said i knew the risk i was taking even in retrospect i think it was worth it like you said im supposed to be protecting the public if youre going to the slaughterhouse now then im coming along kim said im not going to let you go alone sorry but its out of the question marsha said i didnt think thered be a problem at mercer meats and there was its a different story at higgins and hancock i know thered be a problem heck it might be tough for me to get in there even with my usda card how can that be kim asked as a usda inspector cant you visit any meat establishment not where im not assigned marsha said and especially not a slaughterhouse they have their own fulltime contingent of usda people you see slaughterhouses are akin to nuclear installations as far as visitors are concerned they dont need them and they dont want them all they can do is cause trouble what are the slaughterhouses hiding kim asked their methods mostly marsha said its not a pretty sight in the best of circumstances but particularly after the deregulation of the eighties slaughterhouses have all pushed up the speed of their lines meaning they process more animals per hour some of them run as much as two hundred fifty to three hundred animals an hour at that speed contamination cant be avoided its inevitable in fact it is so inevitable that the industry sued the usda when the agency considered officially calling meat with e coli contaminated you cant be serious kim said trust me marsha said its true youre saying the industry knows that e coli is in the meat kim said theyre contending it cant be helped exactly marsha said not in all meat just some of it this is outrageous kim said this is something the public has to find out about this cant continue youve convinced me ive got to see a slaughterhouse in operation which is exactly why the slaughterhouses dont like visitors marsha said and thats why youd never get in well thats not entirely true slaughtering has always been a laborintensive business and one of their biggest headaches is a constant shortage of help so i suppose if you got tired of being a cardiac surgeon you could get a job of course it would help if you were an illegal alien so they could pay you less than the minimum wage youre not painting a very flattering picture kim said its reality marsha said its hard undesirable work and the industry has always relied heavily on immigrants the difference is that today the workers come from latin america particularly mexico rather than eastern europe where they came from in the past this is all sounding worse and worse kim said i cant imagine that ive never given it any thought i mean i eat meat so in some ways im responsible its the downside of capitalism marsha said i dont mean to sound like a radical socialist but this is a particularly flaming example of profit over ethics greed with a complete disregard for consequence its all part of what prompted me to join the usda because the usda could change things if change was considered desirable by those in power kim added true marsha agreed putting this all in perspective kim said were talking about an industry that exploits its workforce and feels no compunction about killing hundreds of kids a year kim shook his head in disbelief you know the total lack of ethics that this represents makes me worry even more about you how do you mean marsha asked im talking about your going off right now to visit higgins and hancock essentially under false pretenses kim said by using your usda id youll be suggesting youre there on official business obviously marsha said thats the only way i could get in well as securityminded as they are kim said wont you be taking a risk and im not talking about your job security i see what you mean marsha said thank you for being concerned but im not worried about my wellbeing the worst that could happen is that theyd complain to my boss like jack cartwright has threatened to do are you sure kim asked if there were any danger i wouldnt want you to go to tell you the truth after the episode in mercer meats i feel uncomfortable about you doing any more on my behalf maybe you should just let me do what i can if you go out there tonight ill be nervous the entire time im flattered by your concern marsha said but i think i should just go and see what i can im not going to get hurt or in any more trouble than i already am i might not even get in and as i said you wouldnt be able to do anything on your own because you certainly wouldnt be able to get in maybe i could get a job kim said like you suggested hey i was only kidding marsha said i was just trying to make a point im willing to do what i have to do kim said listen marsha said what if i take my cellular phone with me and call you every fifteen or twenty minutes then you wont have to worry and i can keep you posted about what im finding hows that its something i guess kim said without a lot of enthusiasm but the more he thought of the idea the better it began to sound the concept of his getting a job in a slaughterhouse was far from appealing but most important was marshas adamant assurances about the lack of risk ill tell you what marsha added this visit wont take me that long and after im done ill come back and have that drink you offered that is if the invitation is still open of course kim said he nodded as he went over the plan one last time then he gave marshas forearm a quick squeeze before getting out of the car instead of closing the door he leaned back in you better take my phone number he said good thinking marsha said she fumbled for a pen and a piece of paper kim gave her the number im going to be waiting right by the phone so youd better call no need to worry marsha said good luck kim said ill be talking with you soon marsha said kim slammed the car door he watched as she backed up turned and accelerated down the street he watched until the red taillights and their reflection in the rainslicked street were swallowed by the night kim turned and looked up at his dark deserted house not a single light relieved its somber silhouette he shuddered suddenly left by himself the reality of beckys loss descended the crushing melancholy hed felt earlier flooded back kim shook his head in despair at how tenuous his world had been his family and his career had seemed so substantial and yet within a relative blink of the eye it had all disintegrated bobby bo masons house was lit up like a las vegas casino to provide the proper gala atmosphere for his inaugural dinner celebration hed retained a theatrical lighting specialist to do the job and to make the scene even more festive hed hired a mariachi band to play under a tent on the front lawn a little rain certainly wasnt going to dampen his affair bobby bo was one of the largest cattle barons in the country in keeping with his image of himself as well as his position in the industry hed built a house whose flamboyant style was a monument to roman empire kitsch columned porticos stretched off in bewildering directions plastercast lifesized imitation roman and greek statues dotted the grounds some were even painted in realistic skin tones liveried valet parkers lined up at the head of the circular drive to await the arrival of the guests sixfoothigh torches bordering the drive sputtered in the light rain everett sorensons mercedes beat daryl websters lexus but only by less than a minute it was as if theyd planned it as they exited their cars they embraced as did their wives the cars were whisked away by the valets while other staff protected the guests with large golf umbrellas the foursome started up the grand staircase leading to the double front doors i trust you called your security everett said the moment after i spoke with you daryl said good everett said we cant be too careful especially now that the beef business is back to being relatively healthy they reached the front door and rang while they waited gladys reached over and straightened everett s clipon tie the double doors were whisked open the light from within was enough to make the newly arrived guests squint as it reflected off the white marble foyer in front of them stood bobby bo framed by the massive granite jambs and lintel bobby bo was heavyset similar to everett and daryl and like his colleagues he believed in his product enough to eat staggeringly large steaks he had a lantern jaw and a barrel chest he was impressively attired in a customtailored tuxedo a handtied bowtie edged with gold thread and diamond studs and cuff links his fashion idol had been the dapper don prior to his conviction and incarceration welcome folks bobby bo beamed his smile revealed several gold molars coats to the little lady and please help yourself to champagne music and gay laughter floated out from the living room the sorensons and the websters were not the first to arrive in contrast to the outside mariachis the inside music was more restrained and emanated from a string quartet after the coats had been taken gladys and hazel strolled arm in arm into the thick of the party bobby bo held back everett and daryl sterling hendersons the only one not here yet bobby bo said as soon as he is well have a short meeting in my library everyone else has been alerted jack cartwrights a bit delayed as well everett said id like him to sit in on it fine by me bobby bo said guess who else is here everett looked at daryl neither one wanted to guess carl stahl bobby bo said triumphantly a shadow of fear fell over everett and daryl that makes me feel uncomfortable everett said id have to say the same daryl said come on you guys bobby bo teased all he can do is fire you he laughed i dont think getting fired is something i want to joke about daryl said nor i everett said but thinking about it is all the more reason we have to nip this current problem in the bud fourteen saturday night january th the windshield wipers tapped out a monotonous rhythm as marsha rounded the final bend and got her first view of higgins and hancock it was a sprawling lowslung plant with a vast fencedin stockyard in the rear it looked ominous in the cold rain marsha turned into the large deserted parking lot what cars that were there were widely scattered when the threetoeleven cleaning crew had arrived the lot had been jammed with the day workers vehicles having visited the plant once during her orientation to the district marsha knew enough to drive around to the side she recognized the unmarked door that was the employee entrance above it was a single caged light fixture which dimly lit the area marsha parked set the emergency brake and turned off the engine but she didnt get out for a moment she sat and tried to bolster her confidence after the conversation with kim she felt nervous about what she was about to do prior to kims mentioning physical danger marsha had not considered it now she wasnt so sure shed heard plenty of stories of the industrys use of strongarm tactics in its dealings with its immigrant employees and with union sympathizers consequently she couldnt help but wonder how they might respond to the kind of threat her unauthorized activities would surely pose youre being overly melodramatic marsha said out loud with sudden resolve marsha unhooked her cellular phone from its car cradle she checked its battery well here goes she said as she alighted from the car it was raining harder than she expected so she ran for the employee entrance when she got there she tried to yank open the door but found it locked next to the door was a button with a small plaque that said after hours she pushed it after a half a minute and no response marsha rang the bell again and even rapped on the solid door with her fist just when she was thinking of returning to her car and calling the plant with her cell phone the door swung open a man in a brownandblack security uniform looked out at her with a confused look on his face visitors were obviously a rarity marsha flashed her usda card and tried to push into the building the man held his position forcing her to remain in the rain let me see that the guard said marsha handed the man the card he inspected it carefully even reviewing the back im a usda inspector marsha said she feigned irritation do you really think its appropriate to make me stand out here in the rain what are you doing here the man asked what we inspectors always do marsha said im making sure federal rules are being followed the man finally backed up enough to allow marsha to enter she wiped moisture off her forehead and then shook it free from her hand theres only cleaning going on now the guard commented i understand marsha said could i please have my id the guard handed back the card where are you going ill be in the usda office marsha said over her shoulder she was already on her way she walked with determination and didnt look back even though the guards reaction had surprised her and added to her unease bobby bo mason pulled the librarys paneled mahogany door closed the sound of merriment from the rest of the house was cut off abruptly he turned to face his tuxedoed colleagues who were sprinkled around the librarys interior represented were most of the citys businesses associated with beef and beef products cattlemen slaughterhouse directors meatprocessor presidents and meatdistributor heads some of these men were sitting on darkgreen velvet chairs others were standing with their champagne glasses held close to their chests the library was one of bobby bos favorite rooms under normal circumstances every guest was made to come into it to admire its proportions it was clad entirely in oldgrowth brazilian mahogany the carpet was an inchthick antique tabriz oddly this library contained no books lets make this short so we can get back to more important things like eating and drinking bobby bo said his comment elicited some laughter bobby bo enjoyed being the center of attention and was looking forward to his year as the president of the american beef alliance the issue here is miss marsha baldwin bobby bo continued when he had everyones attention excuse me a voice said id like to say something bobby bo watched as sterling henderson got to his feet he was a big man with coarse features and a shock of startlingly silver hair id like to apologize right from the top sterling said in a sad voice ive tried from day one to rein this woman in but nothings worked we all understand your hands have been tied bobby bo said i can assure you this little impromptu meeting is not to cast blame but rather to solve a problem we were perfectly happy letting you deal with it until just today whats made the miss baldwin issue a crisis is her sudden association with this crank doctor who got the medias attention with his ruckus about e coli its an association that promises trouble everett said an hour ago we caught her and the doctor inside our patty room going through our logs she brought the doctor into your plant sterling questioned with horrified surprise im afraid so everett said it gives you an idea of what were up against its a critical situation were going to be facing another e coli fiasco unless something is done this e coli nonsense is such a pain in the ass bobby bo sputtered you know what really irks me about it the goddamn poultry industry puts out a product thats almost a hundred percent swimming in either salmonella or campylobacter and nobody says boo we on the other hand have a tiny problem with e coli in what two to three percent of our product and everybodys up in arms whats fair about that will someone tell me what is it do they have a better lobby the hushed jingle of a cellular phone resounded in the silence following bobby bos passionate philippic half the occupants in the room reached into their tuxes only daryls unit was vibrating in sync with the sound he withdrew to the far corner to take the call i dont know how the poultry business gets away with what they do everett said but that shouldnt divert our attention at the moment all i know is that the hudson meat management didnt survive their e coli brouhaha we have to do something and do it fast thats my vote i mean what the hell did we form the prevention committee for anyway daryl flipped his phone closed and slipped it back into his inner jacket pocket he rejoined the group his face was more flushed than usual bad news bobby bo inquired sure as hell is daryl said that was my security out at higgins and hancock marsha baldwin is there right now going through usda records she came in flashing her usda card saying she was there to make sure federal rules were being followed shes not authorized even to be in there sterling asserted indignantly much less look at any records there you go everett said now i dont even think its a topic for debate i think our hand is forced id tend to agree bobby bo said he gazed out at the others how does everyone else feel there was a universal murmur of assent fine bobby bo said consider it done those who were sitting stood up everybody moved toward the door that bobby bo threw open laughter and music and the smell of garlic wafted into the room except for bobby bo the men filed out of the room and went in search of their consorts bobby bo went to his phone and placed a quick internal call hardly had he replaced the receiver when shanahan obrian leaned into the room shanahan was dressed in a dark suit and muted tie he was sporting the kind of earphone a secret service agent might wear he was a tall black irish fellow a refugee of the turmoil in northern ireland bobby bo had hired him on the spot and for the past five years shanahan had been heading up bobby bos security staff he and bobby bo got along famously did you call shanahan asked come in and close the door bobby bo said shanahan did as he was told the prevention committee has its first assignment bobby bo said excellent shanahan said with his soft gaelic accent sit down and ill tell you about it bobby bo said five minutes later the two men walked out of the library in the foyer they parted company bobby bo went to the threshold of the sunken living room and looked out over the crowd of revelers how come its so quiet in here bobby bo shouted what is this a funeral come on lets party from the foyer shanahan descended into the underground garage he got into his black cherokee and drove out into the night he took the ring road around the city pushing his car as much as he thought he could get away with he exited the freeway and drove due west twenty minutes later he pulled into a rutted gravel parking lot of a popular nightspot called el toro on top of the building was a lifesized red neon outline of a bull shanahan parked at the periphery leaving a wide space between his vehicle and the other mostly brokendown pickup trucks he didnt want anybody opening their doors and denting his new car even before he got near the entrance to the bar he could hear the thundering bass of the hispanic music inside it was just shy of overpowering the popular watering hole was crowded and smokefilled the patrons were mostly men although there were a few brightly dressed ravenhaired women there was a long bar on one side and a series of booths on the other in the middle were tables and chairs and a small dance floor an oldfashioned brightly illuminated jukebox was against the wall in the back was an archway through which a series of pool tables could be seen shanahan scanned the people at the bar he didnt see whom he was looking for he walked down the bank of booths with no success giving up he approached the busy bar he literally had to squeeze between people then there was the problem of getting the bartenders attention waving a tendollar bill finally succeeded where shouts did not shanahan handed the bill to the man im looking for carlos mateo shanahan yelled the money disappeared as if it were a magic trick the bartender didnt speak he merely pointed to the back of the room and mimed the motion of shooting pool shanahan weaved his way across the small dance floor the backroom was not quite as crowded as the front he found the man he was searching for at the second table shanahan had spent a good deal of time and effort recruiting for the proposed prevention committee after following up multiple leads and after a lot of interviewing hed settled on carlos carlos had escaped from prison in mexico and had been on the run six months previously hed managed to cross into the united states on his first attempt hed come to higgins and hancock in desperate need of a job what had impressed shanahan about the man was his cavalier attitude toward death although carlos was reticent concerning the details shanahan learned that the reason hed been imprisoned in mexico was because he had knifed to death an acquaintance in his job at higgins and hancock carlos was involved in the deaths of more than two thousand animals per day emotionally he seemed to view the activity of killing on par with cleaning his truck shanahan stepped into the cone of light illuminating the second pool table carlos was in the process of lining up a shot and didnt respond to shanahans greeting shanahan had to wait mierdacarlos exclaimed when his ball refused to drop he slapped the tables rail and straightened up only then did he look at shanahan carlos was a darkhaired darkcomplected wiry man with multiple flamboyant tattoos on both arms his face was dominated by bushy eyebrows a pencilline mustache and hollow cheeks his eyes were like black marbles over his torso he was wearing a black leather vest that showed off his lean musculature as well as his tattoos he was not wearing a shirt ive got a job for you shanahan said a job like we talked about you interested its got to be now you pay me im interested carlos said he had a strong spanish accent come with me shanahan directed he pointed through the archway toward the front door carlos handed off his cue stick gave a couple of crumpled bills to his complaining opponent then followed shanahan the two men didnt try to talk until they were outside i dont know how you can stand that noise in there for more than five minutes shanahan remarked how come man carlos asked its good music with the rain falling steadily shanahan brought carlos to his cherokee and the two men climbed inside lets make this fast shanahan said the name is marsha baldwin shes an attractive tall blonde whos about twentyfive carloss face twisted into a grin of pleasure making his mustache look like two dashes under his narrow nose the reason you got to move fast shanahan explained is because at this very moment shes where you work shes at higgins and hancock carlos asked thats right shanahan said shes in the admin section looking into records shes not supposed to you wont be able to miss her if you have trouble finding her ask the guard hes supposed to keep his eye on her how much you pay carlos asked more than we talked about providing you do it now shanahan said i want you to go this minute how much carlos asked a hundred now and two hundred later if she disappears without a trace shanahan said he reached into his jacket pocket and withdrew a crisp hundreddollar bill he held it up so carlos could see it it was bathed in red light from the neon bull what about my job carlos asked like i promised shanahan said ill get you off the kill floor by the end of the month where do you want to go the boning room or the carcass room the boning room carlos said so we have a deal shanahan sure carlos said he took the bill folded it and slipped it into his jeans pocket he started to get out of the car it was as if hed been asked to rake leaves or shovel snow dont screw it up shanahan said its going to be easy with her in higgins and hancock carlos said thats what we figured shanahan said lifting her arms over her head marsha stretched shed been bending over the open filecabinet drawer long enough to make her back stiff she used her hip to close the drawer and it made a definitive click as it slid home picking up her cellular phone she headed for the usda office door while she walked she punched in kims phone number as the call went through she opened the door and looked up and down the silent hall she was pleased not to see anyone while shed been going through the files shed heard the guard pass by and even hesitate outside the door on several occasions hed not bothered her but his loitering had raised her anxiety level she knew that if he approached her shed feel trapped in the seemingly deserted building shed not seen a single one of the cleaning people who were supposed to be there this better be you kim said without saying hello thats a strange way to answer the phone marsha said with a nervous laugh she closed the usda office door and started up the deserted hall its about time you called kim said i havent had any luck so far marsha said ignoring kims complaint whats taken you so long to call kim demanded hey cool it marsha said ive been busy you have no idea how much paperwork the usda requires theres daily sanitation reports disposition records livestock slaughter reports process deficiency records killorder reports and purchase invoices ive had to go through all of it for january ninth what did you find kim asked nothing out of the ordinary marsha said she came to a door with a frostedglass panel stenciled on the glass was the word records she tried the door it was unlocked she stepped inside closed the door and locked it behind her well at least you looked kim said now get yourself out of there not until i look at the company records marsha said its eightfifteen kim said you told me this was going to be a quick visit it shouldnt take me that much longer marsha said im in the record room right now ill call you back in a half hour or so marsha disconnected before kim had a chance to object she put the phone down on a long library table and faced a bank of file cabinets along one wall the opposite wall had a single window against whose panes the rain was beating it sounded like grains of rice at the far end of the room was a second door marsha went to it and made sure it was locked feeling relatively secure she walked back to the file cabinets and yanked out the first drawer after several minutes kim finally withdrew his hand from the receiver hed hoped that marsha would have called right back the conversation had ended so abruptly hed thought theyd been cut off eventually he had to accept the fact that shed hung up kim was sitting in the same club chair marsha had found him in the floor lamp next to the chair was the only light on in the house on the side table was a glass of neat whiskey that hed poured for himself and then had not touched kim had never felt worse in his life images of becky kept flooding his mind and bringing forth new tears the next instant he found himself denying the whole horrid experience and attributing it to an extension of his nightmare where becky had fallen into the sea the sound of the refrigerator kicking on in the kitchen made him think he should try to eat he couldnt remember the last time hed put anything significant in his stomach the trouble was he wasnt hungry in the slightest then he thought about taking himself upstairs to shower and change clothes but that sounded like too much effort in the end he decided hed just sit there and wait for the phone to ring the old toyota pickup had no heat and carlos was shivering by the time he turned off the paved road onto the gravel track that led around the higgins and hancock stockyard he switched off the single functioning headlight and proceeded by knowledge of the route and shadowy glimpses of the fence posts to his right he drove all the way around to the point where the stockyard funneled into the chute leading into the plant during the day this was where all the luckless animals entered he parked the truck in the shadow of the building he took off the heavy mittens he used to drive and replaced them with tightfitting black leather gloves reaching under his seat he extracted a long curved kill knife the same kind he used during the day by reflex he tested its edge with his thumb even through the leather he could tell it was razorsharp he climbed from the cab blinking in the rain he quickly climbed the fence and dropped into the trampled mud of the stockyard mindless of the cow dung he sprinted down the chute and disappeared into its dark depths with an oyster fork in one hand and a cutcrystal glass of bourbon in the other bobby bo mounted his coffee table and drew himself up to his full height in the process he knocked over an hors doeuvre plate of marinated shrimp to the delight of his two professionally cut standard poodles bobby bo loudly clanged the fork against the glass no one heard until the quartet stopped playing all right everyone bobby bo yelled over the heads of his guests dinner is served in the dining room remember to bring the number you drew out of the bucket that will be your table if you havent drawn a number the bucket will be in the foyer the crowd began to move out of the living room en masse bobby bo managed to step down from the coffee table without further mishap other than to scare one of the dogs which yelped and fled into the kitchen bobby bo was on his way to the dining room when he caught sight of shanahan obrian excusing himself he stepped over to stand beside his head of security well bobby bo whispered how did it go no problem shanahan said is it going to happen tonight bobby bo asked as we speak shanahan said i think daryl webster should be told so he can tell his security not to interfere good idea bobby bo said he smiled happily patted shanahan on the shoulder then hurried after his guests the doorbell shocked kim out of his melancholic stupor for the moment he was disoriented as to the origin of the noise he even started to reach for the phone hed expected the phone to ring and certainly not for the door to chime when he realized it was the door he looked at his watch it was quarter to nine he couldnt believe that someone would be ringing his doorbell at such a time on saturday night the only person he could imagine it might be was ginger but she never came over without calling then kim remembered hed failed to listen to his answering machine so she could have called and left a message while kim considered the possibilities of this the doorbell sounded again he did not want to see ginger but when the doorbell sounded for the third time followed by some knocking kim pushed himself out of the chair he was just thinking of what he could say when to his utter surprise he found himself looking at tracy not ginger are you okay tracy asked she spoke quietly i guess kim said he was nonplussed can i come in tracy asked of course kim said he stepped back to give tracy room sorry i should have invited you in immediately im just surprised to see you tracy stepped into the dimly lit foyer she could see that the only light in the house was in the living room next to an easy chair she slipped out of her coat and rain hat kim took them i hope you dont mind my coming over here like this tracy said i know it was a little impulsive on my part its okay kim said he hung up tracy s things i didnt want to be with anyone tracy explained she sighed but then i started thinking about you and worrying especially with how agitated you were when you ran out of the hospital i thought that since weve both lost the same daughter were the only ones that could have any idea of how we feel i guess what im saying is i need some help and imagine you do too tracy s words snatched away any remnants of denial kim was entertaining he felt a keen wave of grief hed been doing his best to avoid he breathed out heavily and swallowed as he choked back tears for a moment he couldnt speak have you been sitting here in the living room tracy asked kim nodded ill get a chair from the dining room tracy said let me kim volunteered he appreciated having something physical to do he brought the chair into the living room and placed it within the penumbra of light from the floor lamp can i get you something to drink kim managed i poured myself some scotch thank you but no tracy said she sat down heavily then leaned forward cradling her chin in her hands with her elbows on her knees kim lowered himself in the club chair and looked at his former wife her dark hair which was always wavy and full was matted against the top of her head the small amount of makeup she normally wore was streaked she was clearly pained yet her eyes were as bright and sparkly as kim remembered theres also something i wanted to tell you tracy said after i had a little time to think i believe what you did today to becky took a lot of courage she paused for a moment while she bit her lip i know i couldnt have done it even if i was a surgeon she added i appreciate your saying that kim said thank you i was appalled at first tracy admitted openheart massage is a desperate act in any circumstance kim said doing it on your own daughter is well im sure the hospital isnt looking at it the same way you are you did it out of love tracy said it wasnt hubris like i thought at first i did it because it was clear to me the external massage wasnt working kim said i couldnt let becky just fade away like it seemed she was doing no one knew why she was arresting of course now i know why and why the external massage wasnt working i had no idea this e coli could be such an awful illness tracy said nor did i kim said the phones jangle startled both people kim snapped up the receiver hello he barked tracy watched as kims face registered first confusion then irritation hold it kim snapped into the receiver cut the spiel im not interested in your companys visa card and i want you off this line he hung up forcibly it looks like you are expecting a call tracy said captiously she stood up im intruding maybe i should go no kim said but then he immediately corrected himself i mean yes im expecting a call but no you shouldnt leave tracy cocked her head to the side youre acting strange she said whats going on im a basket case kim admitted but the phone interrupted kims explanation again he snatched the receiver off the hook and said a frantic hello its me again marsha said and this time ive found something what kim asked he motioned for tracy to sit down something potentially interesting marsha said on january ninth there is a discrepancy between the usda paperwork and higgins and hancocks how so kim asked there was an extra animal slaughtered at the end of the day marsha said in the companys records its designated lot thirtysix head fiftyseven oh kim questioned is an extra animal significant i would think so marsha said it means the animal wasnt seen by the usda vet so you mean it could have been unhealthy kim questioned thats a distinct possibility marsha said and its supported by the purchase invoice this final animal wasnt a steer raised for beef it was a dairy cow bought from a man named bart winslow youre going to have to explain kim said well dairy cows often go for hamburger marsha said so thats one thing the other thing is that i recognize the name bart winslow hes a local guy whos what they call a fourd man that means he goes around and picks up downers those are dead diseased dying and disabled farm animals hes supposed to take them to the renderer to be turned into fertilizer or animal feed im not sure i want to hear the rest kim said dont tell me that they sometimes sell them to the slaughterhouse instead of the renderer apparently thats what happened with this last animal marsha said head fiftyseven in lot thirtysix must have been a downer probably sick this is disgusting kim commented it gets worse marsha said i found a company deficiency report on the same animal that had nothing to do with its being sick or not having been seen by the vet are you ready for this its revolting tell me kim urged uhoh marsha said somebody is at the door i got to get these papers back in the file kim heard a loud thump in the background he could hear the rustling of papers and then the distinctive sound of a file cabinet drawer being slammed shut marsha kim yelled marsha didnt come back on the line instead kim heard the sound of shattering glass it was loud enough to make him jump for a split second he reflexively pulled the phone away from his ear marsha kim shouted again but she didnt answer instead he heard the unmistakable sound of furniture being upended and crashing to the floor then there was a heavy silence kim pulled the phone away from his ear and looked at tracy his eyes reflected the terror he felt whats going on tracy questioned with alarm was that marsha baldwin i think shes in danger kim blurted my god danger from what tracy demanded sensing kims frenzy i have to go kim cried its my fault what is your fault tracy cried please whats going on kim didnt answer but rather spun on his heels and dashed from the house in his haste he left the front door ajar tracy ran after him demanding to know where he was going stay here kim yelled just before jumping into his car ill be right back the driver door slammed a moment later the engine roared to life kim gunned the car backward out into the street then he raced off into the night tracy ran a hand through her matted hair she had no idea what was going on nor what she should do at first she entertained the idea of getting into her car and driving home but kims frenzy worried her and she wanted to know what it was all about besides the thought of being home was not appealing shed already fled from there the cold rain finally made up tracy s mind for her she turned around and went back into the house as kim had suggested shed wait there the chase had started with the shattering of the doors glass panel a gloved hand had reached in through the jagged edges and unlocked the door the door had then burst open slamming against the wall marsha had let out a short shriek shed found herself facing a gaunt darkcomplected man wielding a long knife the man had taken a step toward her when shed turned and fled tipping over chairs behind her in hopes of hindering the mans pursuit she instinctively knew he was there to kill her frantically she unlocked the rear door behind her she could hear cursing in spanish and the crashing of chairs she didnt dare look back out in the hall she ran headlong in search of anyone even the intimidating guard she tried to yell for help but in the effort of flight her voice was hoarse she dashed past empty offices at the end of the hall she hurried into a lunchroom one of the many long tables held a small collection of lunchboxes and thermos bottles but their owners were nowhere in sight behind her she could hear running footfalls gaining on her at the far end of the lunchroom a door stood open beyond it was a half flight of stairs that terminated at a stout fire door with little choice marsha ran across the room strewing her path with as many of the lunchroom chairs as she could she mounted the stairs two at a time by the time she got to the fire door she was seriously sucking air behind her she could hear her pursuer struggling with the upturned chairs yanking open the fire door marsha darted into the vast cold room beyond this was the kill floor and in the semidarkness created by widely spaced nightlights it had a ghastly alien look especially since it had been recently steamcleaned a cold gray mist shrouded the ghostly metal catwalks the sinister hooks hanging from the ceiling rails and the stainlesssteel abattoir equipment the maze of machinery hindered marshas pace her run became a walk desperately she screamed for help only to hear her voice reverberate against the cold lonely concrete walls behind her the fire door banged open she was close enough to hear the panting breaths of her pursuer marsha took refuge behind a monstrous piece of equipment and pressed herself into the shadows created by a metalgrate stair she tried vainly to control her own breathing there was no sound save for the slow drip of water someplace near the cleaning people had to be somewhere she just had to find them marsha hazarded a glance back at the fire door it was closed she didnt see the man a sudden loud click made marsha start an instant later the room was flooded with harsh light marshas heart fluttered in her chest with the lights on she was sure to be found one more glance back at the fire door was enough to make up her mind her only chance was to flee back the way shed come pushing off from her hiding place marsha sprinted to the fire door grabbing its handle she yanked it the heavy door began to open but almost immediately she could move it no further marsha looked up over her shoulder was a tattooed arm bracing the door from opening marsha spun around and pressed her back against the door with abject fear she stared into the mans cold black eyes the monstrous knife was now in his left hand what do you want from me marsha screamed carlos didnt answer instead he smiled coldly he tossed the knife from one hand to the other marsha tried to flee again but in her desperate haste she lost her footing on the wet stained cement she sprawled headfirst on the cold floor carlos was on her in an instant rolling over marsha tried to fight by grabbing for the knife with both hands but its razorsharp edge sliced into her palm down to the bone she tried to scream but carlos clasped his left hand over her mouth when marsha tried to dislodge his hand carlos quickly raised his weapon and dealt her a vicious blow to the head with the heavy haft marsha went limp carlos stood up and took a couple of deep breaths then he crossed marshas arms so that her cut hands were on her stomach picking up her feet he dragged her across the killroom floor to the grate at the termination of the cattle chute he stepped over to an electrical junction box and threw the switch activating the rooms machinery kim drove like a madman oblivious to the rainslicked streets he agonized about what could have happened to marsha in the higgins and hancock record room he found himself hoping that she had been surprised by a security guard even if it meant her arrest any fate worse than that he didnt want to consider as he turned into the parking area in front of the immense plant kim noticed there were only a few parked cars scattered through the lot he saw marshas car at one end nowhere near the entrance kim pulled up directly opposite the front door he leaped out he tried the door it was locked he banged on it with his fist cupping his hands around his face he peered inside all he could see was a dimly lit deserted corridor there was no security guard in sight kim listened there was no sound his anxiety mounted stepping back from the door he surveyed the front of the building there were a number of windows facing the parking lot kim stepped off the concrete entrance slab and quickly moved north along the side of the building he looked into each window he came to and tried it they were all locked when he peered into the third window he saw file cabinets upended chairs and what he guessed was marshas phone on the table like the others the window was locked without a seconds hesitation he bent down and picked up one of the stout rocks lining the edge of the parking area hefting it up to shoulder height he tossed it through the window the sound of shattering glass was followed by a tremendous crash as the rock bounced off the wooden floor and collided with a number of the upended chairs carlos paused and listened from where he was standing in the headboning room the place where cattle heads were stripped of their cheeks and tongues the sound of kims rock came through as merely a muffled thump yet as an experienced burglar he knew he could not ignore any unexpected noises invariably they spelled trouble carlos closed the top of the combo bin then turned out the light he slipped out of the bloody white coat and pulled off the gauntletlength yellow rubber gloves he was wearing he stowed these items under a sink picking up his knife he moved silently but swiftly from the boning room out into the kill floor there he doused the light as well once again he stopped to listen he would have retreated up the cattle chute except he wasnt quite finished kim had climbed through the window headfirst he did his best to avoid the shards of broken glass on the floor but wasnt entirely successful as he got to his feet he had to brush a few small slivers gingerly from his palms with that accomplished he scanned the room he saw a blinking red light on a motion detector high in one corner but ignored it the abandoned cell phone the upended chairs as well as a broken panel of glass in the door to the front hall immediately convinced kim that he was standing in the room where marsha had been when she called him he also noticed the open door at the rear of the room and guessed after being surprised shed fled in that direction dashing to this second door kim looked down the length of a deserted back hallway he paused to listen there wasnt a sound a fact which only fanned his ever building anxiety kim started down the corridor rapidly opening each door he came to he glanced into storerooms cleaning closets a locker room and several restrooms at the far end of the hall he came to a lunchroom he paused at the threshold what caught his attention was the trail of overturned chairs leading to a rear door kim followed the trail out the rear door and up a half flight of steps he yanked open the fire door and stepped through kim again paused he didnt know what to do he found himself in a room filled with a labyrinth of machinery and raised metal platforms that cast grotesque shadows kim noticed a cloyingly fetid smell that was vaguely familiar his mind struggled to make the association within seconds he had the answer the odor reminded him of observing an autopsy as a secondyear medical student he shuddered against the mostly suppressed unpleasant memory marsha kim yelled in desperation marsha there was no response the only thing kim could hear were the numerous echoes of his own frantic voice to kims immediate right was a fire station with an extinguisher a long heavyduty flashlight and a cabinet with glasspaneled doors that revealed a canvas fire hose and longhandled firefighters axe kim snatched the flashlight from its bracket and turned it on its concentrated beam illuminated narrow conic sections of the room and cast even more grotesque shapes onto the walls kim set out into the alien world shining the light in fastmoving arcs he proceeded in a clockwise direction skirting past the machinery to explore more thoroughly after a few minutes he paused and again yelled out marshas name besides his echoes all he could hear was the sound of dripping water ahead the flashlight beam swept across a grate kim moved it back over the center of the grate was a dark smear advancing to the grate he bent down and shined the light directly on the smear hesitantly he reached out with his index finger and touched it a chill went down his spine it was blood carlos had pressed himself against the wall of the headboning room at the very lip of the doorless opening to the killroom floor hed been retreating from kims relentless advance carlos had first seen kim as hed come down the back hallway clearly on a searching mission carlos had no idea who this stranger was and had first hoped the man would content himself with wandering around the office area of the plant but once kim had come into the kill floor and had yelled out marshas name carlos knew hed have to kill him carlos was not dismayed contingencies were a factor in such work besides carlos figured hed be paid more maybe even double he also wasnt concerned about the strangers size and probable strength carlos had experience and the benefit of surprise and most important he had his favorite knife which at the moment he was holding in his right hand up alongside his head cautiously carlos eased his head out into the opening so he could see into the killfloor area it was easy to keep track of the stranger now thanks to the flashlight carlos saw the man straighten up from the grate at carloss workstation all at once the flashlight shined directly at carlos he retreated from the beam careful to keep the knife blade from flashing in the darkness he held his breath as the stranger edged closer again probing the kill floor with sweeping motions of his shaft of light carlos flattened himself against the wall and tensed his muscles the stranger was coming into the boning room as carlos had anticipated the searching flashlight beam flickered around the room in a progressively brighter fashion carlos could feel his pulse sky rocket as adrenaline coursed around his body it was a sensation he loved it was like popping speed kim knew he was in a slaughterhouse that had been in operation that day so finding blood shouldnt have come as a surprise yet the blood hed found was unclotted and appeared fresh he hated to think it could have been marshas the chance that it was brought back his familiar fury now he wanted to find her with even more urgency than earlier and if she were indeed injured he wanted to find the individual responsible after having searched the kill floor kim decided to widen his search to other areas of the huge plant he headed to the only open passageway hed seen on guard against the person or persons who had already spilled blood in the next instant it was his wariness that saved him out of the corner of his eye he detected sudden movement coming at him from the side reacting by reflex he leaped ahead and used the long flashlight to parry what he perceived as a thrust carlos had lunged from the shadows hoping to skewer kim in the side with a quick stab withdraw the knife and retreat hed planned to finish kim off once kim had been weakened but the knife missed its mark and only succeeded in producing a shallow cut across the top of kims hand as carlos tried to regain his balance kim hit him with the flashlight it was a glancing blow to the shoulder that didnt hurt carlos although catching him off balance it knocked him to the ground before carlos could scramble to this feet kim took off he ran through the headboning room into the main boning room this next room was almost the size of the kill floor and somewhat darker it was filled with a maze of long stainlesssteel tables and conveyer belts above was a web of metalgrate catwalks where supervisors could survey the butchering of the carcasses into known cuts of meat on the tables below kim searched frantically for some kind of weapon to counter the long knife having turned off the flashlight and afraid to turn it back on he could only grope blindly along the tables he found nothing a large empty plastic trash barrel fell over when kim stumbled against it desperately he reached out to keep it from rolling around and further giving away his position looking back at the passageway into the headboning room kim could see the silhouette of the man with the knife he was backlit for a brief instant before silently slipping into the shadows kim trembled with fear he was being stalked by an obvious killer armed with a knife in a dark totally alien environment with no way to protect himself he knew he had to stay hidden he could not let this man get near him although hed managed to elude the first thrust kim was smart enough to understand that he probably wouldnt be so lucky a second time the sudden highpitched sound heralding the startup of electronic equipment made kim jump all around him the tangle of conveyer belts commenced their noisy operation simultaneously the room was flooded with bright fluorescent light kims heart leaped into his throat any chance of remaining hidden in the mazelike room evaporated kim crouched as best he could behind the plastic trash barrel by looking beneath the boning tables he saw the tattooed man pursuing him the stranger was advancing slowly along the back aisle with both hands held up in the air his right hand clasped the knife that looked to kim to be about the size of a machete kim panicked carlos was only one aisle away kim knew the man would see him the moment he looked down the aisle kim was in it was only a matter of seconds impulsively kim leaped to his feet while grasping the plastic trash barrel with both hands shouting like a celtic warrior commencing battle he charged directly at his stalker using the plastic barrel like a shield kim collided with the knifewielding mexican carlos was bowled over although shocked by the unexpected charge and powerful impact carlos had the presence of mind to hold on to the knife kims momentum carried him well beyond carlos he tossed aside the plastic container and sprinted the length of the main boning room kim knew hed only succeeded in knocking his pursuer down hed by no means put him out of commission sensing his best chance was to again flee he passed through a second doorless opening to find himself in a cold misty dimly lit forest of cattle carcasses each had been sawed in half and hung from a hook attached to a roller system in the ceiling the only light came from widely spaced ceiling lights along a central corridor separating the long rows of cooling carcasses kim sprinted along the central corridor desperately looking for a place to hide the chill room was cold enough so he could see his breath as he panted he hadnt gone far when he came to a cross aisle down which he caught a welcome glimpse of the green glow of an exit sign he made a beeline for it only to discover that the door was secured with a chain and a heavyduty padlock kim then heard the distant but unmistakable sound of his pursuers heels clicking against the concrete floor kim could tell he was approaching and kim panicked again moving as quickly as he could along the narrow periphery of the carcass room kim hunted for another exit unfortunately when he found it it too was chained shut discouraged kim continued on the room was gargantuan squeezing between the outer wall and the hanging carcasses it took kim several minutes to reach the corner where he turned ninety degrees here his progress was faster just before he reached the central corridor that ran the length of the room he came to an interior door he tried it and to his relief it opened into a dark room next to the door was a light switch kim flipped it on the room was a large storeroom with steel shelving kim ducked into the room with the desperate hope of finding something to use as a weapon he made a quick circuit of the space but had no luck all he found were small spare parts including replacement ball bearings for the overhead rail system plus a cardboard box of rubber stamps used by the usda inspectors to grade meat select choice or prime the only sizable object was a broom thinking the broom might be better than nothing kim picked it up returning to the front of the room he was about to exit when he again heard the footfalls of his pursuer the man was close no more than twenty feet away approaching along the nearby central aisle panicking again kim pulled the storerooms door closed as quickly and as silently as possible holding the broom in both hands by the tip of its handle he flattened himself against the wall just to the right of the door the sound of the footsteps stopped kim could hear the man cursing then the footfalls recommenced increasing in intensity until they stopped just outside the door kim held his breath he gripped the broom handle harder for an agonizing moment nothing happened then he saw the door handle begin to turn the man was coming in kims heart raced the door was yanked open as soon as kim sensed the man was starting in he gritted his teeth and swung the broom at chest height with all the strength he could muster by chance he hit the man full in the face knocking him back through the door the surprise and the force of the impact dislodged the knife and it tumbled to the floor still holding the broom in his left hand kim leaped for the knife he seized it only to discover it was a flashlight not a knife freeze a voice commanded kim straightened up and looked into the blinding glare of another flashlight instinctively he raised his hand to shield his eyes now he could make out the man on the floor it wasnt the mexican but rather a man dressed in a brown higgins and hancock shirt it was a security guard and he had both hands clasped to his face blood was coming out of his nose drop the broom a voice behind the glare commanded kim let go of both the flashlight and the broom both fell to the floor with a clatter the bright beam of the flashlight was lowered and to kims utter relief he found himself facing two uniformed policemen the one without the flashlight was holding his pistol in both hands pointed directly at kim thank god kim managed despite looking down the barrel of a gun less than ten feet away shut up the policeman with the gun commanded get out here and face the wall kim was only too happy to comply he stepped out of the storeroom and put his hands against the wall as hed seen done in movies frisk him the policeman said kim felt hands run up and down his arms legs and torso hes clean turn around kim did as he was told keeping his hands raised to avoid any confusion as to his intentions he was close enough to read the officers name tags the man with the gun was douglas foster the other was leroy mchalverson the security guard had gotten up and was dabbing at his newly bent nose with a handkerchief the metal portion of the whisk had hit him with enough force to break it cuff him douglas said hey hold on kim said im not the one you should be cuffing really douglas questioned superciliously who would you suggest theres someone else in here kim said a dark wirylooking guy with tattoos and a huge knife and wearing a hockey mask no doubt douglas said scoffingly and his name is jason im serious kim said the reason im here is because of a woman named marsha baldwin the two policemen exchanged glances honest kim maintained shes a usda inspector she was here doing some work i was talking with her by phone when someone surprised her i heard breaking glass and a struggle when i got here looking for her to help her i was attacked by a man with a knife presumably the man who attacked ms baldwin the policemen remained skeptical look im a surgeon at the university med center kim said he fumbled in the pocket of his soiled white coat douglas s grip on his pistol tightened kim produced his laminated hospital id card and handed it to douglas douglas motioned for leroy to take it it looks authentic leroy said after a quick inspection of course its authentic kim said have you doctors given up on personal hygiene douglas asked kim ran a hand through his scruffy beard and glanced down at his dirty coat and scrubs hed not showered shaved or changed clothes since early friday morning i know i look a little worse for wear he said theres an explanation but for the moment im more concerned about ms baldwin and the whereabouts of that man with a knife what about it curt douglas asked the security man was there a woman usda inspector here or a strange dark tattooed man not to my knowledge curt said at least they didnt come in while ive been on duty i came on at three oclock this afternoon she was talking to me on her cell phone its in the record room thats creative douglas commented i have to give you credit for that he looked at curt do you think we could take a look i mean its on our way out of course curt said while curt led the way to the record room with kim and douglas in tow leroy went out to the squad car to make contact with the station at the recordroom threshold curt stepped aside and let the others enter once inside kim was immediately crestfallen the chairs had been righted more important the phone was gone it was here i swear he said and a number of these chairs were upended i didnt see any phone when i came in here to investigate the breakin curt said and the chairs were as you see them now what about the broken glassdoor panel kim said excitedly he pointed at the door to the front hall im sure that was the shattering noise i heard while i was on the phone with her i assumed the door was just part of the breakin curt said along with the window it couldnt be kim said i broke the window but the door panel was already broken when i got here look all the glass from the door panel is on the inside whoever did it was in the hall hmm douglas said he stared down at the broken glass at the base of the door he does have a point her car kim said getting another idea it has to be outside still its a yellow ford sedan its parked at the end of the building before douglas could respond to this new suggestion leroy returned from the squad car a wry smile lit up his broad face i just got off the radio with the station he said they ran a quick check for me on the good doctor and guess what hes got a sheet he was arrested just last night for trespassing resisting arrest striking a police officer and assault and battery on a fastfood manager currently hes out of the slammer on his own recognizance my my douglas said a repeat offender okay doc enough of this nonsense youre going downtown fifteen sunday late morning january th it was déjà vu all over again for kim he was back in the same courtroom with the same judge the only real difference was the weather outside this time there was no sun the day was cloudy with scattered snow flurries and judge harlowes mood matched the gray day kim was seated at a scarred library table alongside tracy standing before them and directly below the bench was justin devereau a lawyer and longtime friend of kims he was aristocratic in appearance a harvardtrained lawyer whod followed the old adage go west young man hed started what had become one of the largest and most successful law firms in the city his case success rate was unrivaled yet on this particular morning he looked concerned hed been fighting an uphill battle against judge harlowes ire kim looked worse than ever having spent yet another night in jail in the same outfit he still hadnt shaved or showered he was also clearly anxious about the outcome of the current proceedings the last thing he wanted to do was go back to jail justin cleared his throat allow me to reiterate that dr kim reggis has truly been the proverbial pillar of society up until the tragic affliction of his only daughter his daughters illness was the excuse for his appearance before this court yesterday counselor judge harlowe said with impatience for my weekend on call i dont like to see the same face twice its an insult to my judgment for having allowed the individual his freedom after the first infraction dr reggiss daughters recent death has caused him monumental stress your honor justin persisted thats apparent judge harlowe said whats in question is whether he is a threat to society in his current state of mind these were aberrant episodes that will not be repeated justin asserted as you have heard dr reggis is full of remorse for his rash actions judge harlowe toyed with his glasses his eyes wandered to kims he had to admit the man did look penitent as well as pitiful the judge looked at tracy the womans presence and testimony had impressed him all right judge harlowe said ill allow bail but what has swayed me is not your ivy league bombast counselor but rather the fact that dr reggiss former wife has graciously consented to come before this court to attest to his character with my probate experience i find that a convincing testimonial five thousand dollars bail and trial in four weeks next case judge harlowe struck his gavel and picked up the next set of papers excuse me your honor justin said theres no question of flight here so five thousand dollars is blatantly excessive the judge peered down over the tops of his reading glasses he raised his eyebrows im going to pretend i didnt hear that he said and i advise you not to push your clients luck counselor next case please justin shrugged and beat a hasty retreat back to kim and tracy after gathering his things he motioned for them to follow him out of the courtroom with justins help the bail was quickly posted in less than a half hour the group emerged from the courthouse out into the overcast wintery morning they paused at the base of the courthouse steps a few isolated snowflakes drifted down from the sky at first i was afraid harlowe wasnt going to give you bail justin said as the judge implied consider yourself lucky under the circumstances i have a hard time considering myself lucky kim said with little emotion but thanks for your help i apologize for getting you out on a sunday morning glad to do it justin said and im terribly sorry about becky my heartfelt sympathies to you both kim and tracy echoed their thanks well i better be going justin said he touched the brim of his hat ill see you two my best to you both at this difficult time justin gave tracy a peck on the cheek and kim a handshake before starting off he got only a few paces away when he stopped a word of advice to you kim dont get arrested again if you do i can guarantee you wont get bail backtoback arrests like youve managed obviously puts you in a special category i understand kim said ill be careful kim and tracy watched justin walk away until he was completely out of earshot they turned to each other now i want you to tell me really what happened tracy said ill tell you as much as i know kim said flatly but i have to get my car would you mind giving me a ride out to higgins and hancock not at all tracy said id planned as much well talk in the car kim said they started across the street in the direction of the parking lot im living a nightmare kim confessed as i said last night tracy responded we both need help and we might be the only people who can give it to each other kim sighed it must seem crazy to you that ive plunged headlong into this e coli crusade our daughter is dead and all i want to do is race around like some cloakanddagger sleuth he shook his head all these years i prided myself on being the strong one but now i see that really youre the one with the inner strength i know i cant avoid the fact of beckys death forever but i just cant look at it now i hope you can understand that im just not ready to deal with it tracy was silent for a while then she reached out and put a hand on kims arm i understand she said and i wont rush you ill even support you in your quest but you wont be able to deny beckys death forever kim nodded his head i know he whispered and thank you the ride went quickly kim gave tracy all the details from the time marsha showed up at his house until the police booked him and put him in jail when he described the attack by the man with the knife tracy was aghast he even showed her the shallow slice across the top of his hand what did this man look like tracy asked she shuddered she couldnt imagine the horror of being attacked in a dark slaughterhouse it happened so fast kim said i wouldnt be able to describe him very well old young tracy asked tall short for some inexplicable reason she wanted an image of this individual dark kim said dark skin dark hair i think he was mexican or at least latin american slender but wellmuscled he had a lot of tattoos why didnt you tell all this to justin she asked what good would it have done kim said he could have said something to the judge tracy persisted but it wouldnt have changed anything kim maintained in fact it might have made things worse i mean it sounds so improbable and i just wanted to get away from there so i could think of what to do so you believe marsha baldwin is still in higgins and hancock tracy asked possibly being held against her wishes that or worse kim said if it were human blood i found she could have been killed i dont know what to say tracy admitted nor do i kim said i keep hoping she got out maybe i should call my answering machine maybe she called tracy pulled the phone from its car cradle and handed it to kim he dialed and listened after a couple of minutes he put the phone back well tracy asked kim shook his head dejectedly no luck he said just ginger tell me again exactly what you heard when you were talking with her the last time tracy asked i heard the sound of breaking glass kim repeated it came right after she said someone was at the door then i heard a series of crashes which i believe were from chairs falling over i think whoever came through the door chased her out of the room and you told all this to the police tracy asked of course kim said but a lot of good that did yet its understandable they think im some kind of nut when i tried to show them the blood it had been washed away when i tried to show them her cell phone it was gone even her car wasnt in the parking lot where it had been when i got there could she have taken the phone tracy asked and driven away in the car i hope to god she did kim said i hate to think of any alternative and i feel so responsible shed gone there because of me you didnt force her to do anything she didnt want to do tracy said in the short time i had with her i could tell she wasnt the kind of person people could push around she definitely had a mind of her own what id like to do is get my hands on the guard kim said he had to know marsha was there even though he denied it if he lied to the police he certainly isnt going to tell you anything tracy said well ive got to do something kim said do you know anything about her tracy asked like where she lives or where shes from or whether she has any family in the area i know almost nothing about her kim admitted except that shes twentynine and she went to veterinary school too bad tracy commented it would be a help if you could establish for sure whether or not shes missing if she is then the police would have to listen to you you just gave me an idea kim said he straightened up from his slouch what do you think of my going to kelly anderson and getting her to help now thats not a bad idea tracy said the question is would she do it theres no way of knowing unless i approach her kim said shes caused you enough grief tracy said it seems to me she owes you something gosh the media could be a big help kim said not only with the marsha problem but also with the whole meatcontamination issue the more i think about this the better i like it tracy said maybe i can help you convince her kim looked appreciatively at his former wife with the bitterness of the divorce and the rancor of the custody issues hed forgotten how warmly attractive she was you know trace he said im really thankful that you came to court this morning and not just because you made the effort to raise the bail im just thankful youre willing to be with me after all thats happened tracy looked over at kim the remark was so out of character for him yet seeing his eyes she knew he was sincere thats a very nice thing to say she told him i mean it kim said well i appreciate your saying it tracy said i cant remember the last time you thanked me for anything in fact it must have been before we were ever married i know kim admitted youre right i had a little time to think last night in jail and i have to say that the events over the last twentyfour hours particularly concerning becky have opened my eyes opened your eyes to what tracy asked to whats really important in life kim said i suppose that sounds melodramatic but ive realized ive made a terrible mistake ive focused too much on career and competition at the expense of family and us im impressed to hear you say such a thing tracy said this did not sound like the kim shed divorced im afraid ive been selfish all my adult life kim continued its a little ironic since the whole time ive been hiding behind the facade of the charitable selfless physician like a child ive needed constant praise and constant reinforcement and being a surgeon was a perfect fit all this makes me feel sad and ashamed it also makes me want to apologize to you and wish i could take back a number of wasted years im surprised and overwhelmed tracy said but i accept im impressed by your insight thanks kim said simply he stared out the windshield they had turned onto the side road and were approaching higgins and hancock the building looked peaceful and clean under the dusting of snow is this it tracy asked kim nodded the entrance to the parking lot is coming up he said my car should be right in front of the main door at least thats where i left it tracy turned where kim indicated kims car was immediately apparent it was standing in total isolation there were only two other cars in the lot but they were all the way at the end of the plant marshas car was parked where those two cars are kim mentioned maybe theres an employee entrance over there tracy pulled up alongside of kims car she stopped and set the emergency brake kim pointed to the recordroom window that hed smashed to gain entrance into the building it had been boarded up he explained to tracy hed done it with one of the large rocks lining the parking lot whats the plan tracy asked when kim paused kim sighed ive got to get to the hospital toms agreed to look in on my patients but i have to see them too then ill go see kelly anderson i happen to know where she lives we have some decisions to make concerning becky tracy said kim nodded but looked off in the distance i know it is difficult tracy said but we have to make funeral arrangements it might even help us accept her death kim bit his lip anger and denial are part of the grieving process tracy said when kim didnt respond im guilty of using them as well as you but we do have responsibilities kim turned to face tracy there were tears in the corners of his eyes youre right he admitted but as i said i need a little more time because of whats happened would it be too much to ask for you to go ahead and make the arrangements without me i know its asking a lot ill certainly agree to anything you decide and of course ill be there for the service id just like to follow up on this kelly anderson idea immediately tracy tapped her fingers against the steering wheel while she stared at kim and pondered his request her first thought was to say no and to tell him that he was just being selfish again but then she reconsidered although she didnt want to make the arrangements by herself she knew that the service itself was far more important than making the arrangements she also recognized that at the moment she was probably more capable than he was you wont mind what day i pick tracy questioned or where a service might be not at all kim said whatever you decide all right she said but you have to promise to call me as soon as you get home i promise kim said he reached over and gave tracy s forearm a squeeze before getting out of the car ill wait to make sure your car starts tracy said good idea kim said and thanks he shut the door he waved before heading over to his car tracy waved back and wondered if she was doing the right thing kim opened his car door but didnt get right in he looked at higgins and hancock and shuddered at the memory of the previous night the terror hed felt running from the man with the knife came flooding back it was an experience he knew hed never forget kim started to get into the car but hesitated again for a brief moment he entertained the idea of talking with the guard on duty to find out how to get in touch with curt the guard from the previous night but tracy s admonition immediately came to mind and kim decided she was right if curt were willing to lie to the police about marshas presence he certainly wouldnt be apt to tell the truth to kim and the fact that he probably was lying meant there was more to this affair than might appear on the surface kims car started with ease and he waved at tracy who waved back before preceding him out of the parking lot kim followed at a distance rethinking their recent conversation he thought it was ironic that the awful events of the last few daysbeckys death and his having come close to being murderedcould end up making him feel closer to tracy than he had in years maybe even ever they parted company on the freeway kim beeped his horn in farewell tracy beeped back as she sped away toward her neighborhood kim took the exit appropriate for the med center on sundays the doctors parking lot was almost empty and kim was able to park close to the front entrance as he climbed out of his car he told himself the first order of business was for him to go directly up to the surgical locker room he wanted to clean up shave and change into the street clothes hed left there friday morning martha trumbull and george constantine were both in their early seventies and both had been faithful volunteers at the university medical center long enough to have been awarded the prestigious friends of the hospital service pins martha proudly wore hers on the front of her pink volunteer smock whereas george wore his on the lapel of his cerulean volunteer blazer martha and georges favorite assignment was manning the information desk in the hospital lobby they particularly liked to work there on sunday when they had it to themselves on the other days of the week a paid hospital employee was in charge taking their roles seriously they not only knew the layout of the hospital with the same detail as the floor plans of their own homes but they also knew the names of the entire hospital professional staff when kim came through the door on his way to the elevator they both thought they recognized him yet they werent a hundredpercent certain martha glanced at george is that dr reggis she whispered i think so george said but i cant imagine what hes been doing in that white coat unless he had to change a tire i think the beard looks worse than the coat martha said someone should tell him because hes such a nicelooking man wait a second george said werent we supposed to call dr biddle if we saw dr reggis that was yesterday martha said you think its the same today why take a chance george said as he reached for the phone to kims relief the elevator was empty when he boarded it on the ground floor and he was able to ride solo all the way to the surgical floor he wasnt quite as lucky on his transit of the surgical lounge there were a number of the or nurses and oncall anesthesiologists having coffee although no one said anything those assembled eyed him with curiosity kim was glad to get into the surgical locker room and away from the inquiring faces he was particularly pleased to find it vacant and he lost no time after rescuing his hospital id a few papers and pens plus some surgical tape from the pockets he pulled off the coat the scrubs and even his underwear everything went into the laundry hamper completely naked kim was shocked to catch his reflection in the mirror his visage was far worse than he imagined his ratty whiskers were significantly more than a five oclock shadow but far from being a beard and his hair was a mess plastered down across his forehead yet standing straight up in the back suggesting hed just gotten out of bed opening his combination lock kim got out the toiletries he kept in his locker and quickly shaved then he got into the shower with a vial of shampoo kim had his head under the jet of water when he thought he heard his name called leaning out from the stream but with his eyes closed tightly against the suds he listened someone repeated his name the voice was definitely more authoritative than friendly kim rinsed off the soap then looked toward the shower entrance he was in a common shower with four heads standing on the tiled threshold were dr forrester biddle chief of cardiac surgery and dr robert rathborn acting chief of the medical staff they made a curious pair in contrast to forresters ascetic gauntness robert was the picture of selfindulgent obesity dr reggis robert repeated when he was confident of kims attention as the current head of the medical staff it is my duty to inform you that your hospital privileges have been temporarily revoked this is a curious conversation to have while im in the shower kim said or was it your specific intent to catch me naked your glibness has never been more inappropriate forrester spat ive been warning you dr reggis you couldnt wait for five minutes kim questioned we felt it was important enough to inform you as soon as possible robert said what are the grounds kim asked for obstructive behavior during your daughters cardiac resuscitation attempt robert said three doctors and two nurses have filed formal complaints of physical intimidation by you that precluded them from carrying out their duty and i am appalled at your decision to perform openheart cardiac massage on your own daughter forrester said in my opinion it is beyond the pale of acceptable professional behavior she was dying robert kim hissed the closed chest massage wasnt effective her pupils were dilating there were other qualified people on the scene robert said sanctimoniously they werent doing crap kim snapped they didnt know what the hell was going on nor did i until i got a look at her heart kims voice broke and he looked away for a moment therell be a hearing robert said the issue here is whether you are a threat to patients or even yourself youll have an opportunity to present your side of this unfortunate episode meanwhile you are not to practice any medicine within these walls and you are specifically forbidden to do any surgery whatsoever well its good of you gentlemen to come into my office like this with such good news kim said i wouldnt be so glib if i were you forrester warned nor would i robert said this incident and our action will be communicated to the board of medicine you could very well find your medical license in jeopardy kim turned around so that he could present what he thought was the most appropriate part of his anatomy to his two guests bending forward he went back to completing his shampoo the el toro bar looked like a completely different establishment in the daylight without the red glow of the neon bull and without the lively percussive sound of the hispanic music the ramshackle building looked abandoned the only evidence it wasnt were the freshly discarded beer cans scattered about the deserted parking lot shanahan shook his head at the miserable scene as his black cherokee navigated the pockmarked parking area the rainy foggy weather didnt help as it blanketed the area with a dense pall shanahan pulled alongside carloss truck whose condition matched the surroundings carlos climbed out of his truck and came around to shanahans driversside window it was heavily tinted and carlos could only see his own reflection until shanahan lowered it with no greeting and no explanation shanahan handed carlos a hundreddollar bill carlos looked at the money then back at shanahan whats this he said you told me two hundred the womans been taken care of just like we talked about you messed up shanahan said it wasnt clean we heard about the doctor you should have done him you knew he was there looking for the woman i tried carlos said what do you mean tried shanahan asked with derision youre supposed to have this great reputation with a knife the guy was unarmed i didnt have time carlos said he set off the silent alarm when he broke in and the police got there before i could finish him i was lucky to get rid of her blood and stuff what did you do with her car shanahan asked its in my cousins garage carlos said well pick it up shanahan said i dont want anybody using it its got to be junked nobodys going to use it carlos said what about her phone shanahan asked i got that in my truck carlos said get it shanahan ordered dutifully carlos returned to his truck a minute later he was back at shanahans window carlos handed the cell phone to the security man shanahan tossed the phone onto the passenger seat i hope i dont have to ask you if you made any calls carlos raised his dark eyebrows innocently but didnt respond verbally shanahan closed his eyes put a hand to his forehead and shook his head in dismay please tell me you didnt use the phone he said through clenched teeth although he already knew the answer when carlos still didnt respond shanahan opened his eyes and stared dumbfounded at his accomplice he tried to control his rage all right who did you call dont you know theyll be able to trace the call how can you be so stupid i called my mother in mexico carlos admitted guiltily shanahan rolled his eyes and started to worry that he would now have to get rid of carlos the trouble with this kind of work was that when things started to go wrong they had a way of quickly getting out of hand but my mother has no phone carlos said i called a phone in a store where my sister works what kind of a store shanahan asked a big store carlos said it sells all sorts of things like a department store shanahan asked yeah like a department store carlos said when did you call shanahan asked last night carlos said the store is open late on saturday night and my mother always goes to walk my sister home where in mexico shanahan asked mexico city carlos said shanahan felt relieved an anonymous call to a large store in the most populous city in the world wasnt much of a lead and that was the only call shanahan asked yeah man carlos said just one call lets get back to the doctor shanahan said does he know what happened to the woman probably carlos said he saw her blood one way or the other hes a threat shanahan said hes got to go well pay you the other hundred plus three hundred extra to do the job what do you say when carlos asked tonight shanahan said we know where he lives and he lives alone its in the balmoral section of town i dont know carlos said hes a big guy with the reputation you have i didnt think that would matter shanahan said its not the killing that will be hard carlos said its getting rid of the body and the blood you dont have to worry about that shanahan said just do the trick and walk out maybe you could make it look like a robbery by taking money and valuables just dont take anything that can be traced i dont know carlos said the police dont like us mexicans driving around in the balmoral neighborhood ive been stopped up there listen carlos shanahan said he was quickly losing his patience you dont have a lot of choice at this juncture you screwed up last night as i understand it you had plenty of time to kill the doctor besides you dont even have a green card carlos shifted his weight and rubbed his upper arms against the damp cold he had no coat and was still wearing his leather vest without a shirt whats the address carlos asked with resignation thats more like it shanahan said as he handed over a typed threebyfive card defying the revocation of his hospital privileges by the medical staff as delivered by robert rathborn kim went around the hospital and visited all his inpatients he spent the most time with fridays postops as tom bridges had promised hed been following all the patients closely kim was pleased that all were doing well and without complications by the time kim left the hospital it was midafternoon kim had considered trying to call kelly anderson to arrange a meeting but then decided it would be better just to drop in besides he didnt have her phone number and he rationalized it was undoubtedly unlisted kelly anderson lived in a prairiestyle house in the christie heights section of town it wasnt quite as upscale as balmoral but it was close kim pulled to the curb and stopped he turned off the ignition and gazed at the house it took him a moment to build up his courage for kim coming to kelly anderson was akin to conniving with the devil herself he felt he needed her but certainly didnt like her kim trudged up to the front door realizing that there was a very good chance he would not even make it across the threshold caroline kellys precocious daughter opened the door for a moment kim could not find his voice the child brought back the unwelcome image of becky in the icu kim heard a mans voice from inside the house asking caroline who was there i dont know caroline yelled back over her shoulder he wont talk im doctor reggis kim managed edgar anderson appeared behind his daughter he was an academicappearing fellow with heavy dark rimmed glasses he was wearing an oversized elbow patched cardigan sweater a pipe hung from the corner of his mouth can i help you edgar inquired kim repeated his name and asked to speak to kelly anderson edgar introduced himself as kellys husband and invited kim inside he showed him into the living room which had the appearance of never being used ill let her know you are here edgar said please sit down can i offer you anything coffee no thank you kim said he felt selfconscious as if he were a mendicant he lowered himself onto an immaculate couch edgar disappeared but caroline stayed to stare at kim from behind a club chair kim could not look at her without thinking about becky kim was relieved when kelly swept into the room my my she intoned this is curious the fox chasing the hound sit down please kim had gotten to his feet when shed entered she plopped into the club chair and to what do i owe the pleasure of this unexpected visit she added could we speak alone kim asked acting as if she had been unaware caroline was in the room kelly told her daughter to find something entertaining to do as soon as caroline had left kim started by telling about beckys death kellys glib demeanor changed immediately she was obviously deeply moved kim told kelly the whole story including the details of the discussions hed had with kathleen morgan and marsha baldwin he told her about his visit and arrest at the onion ring restaurant he even told her about the harrowing episode in higgins and hancock culminating in his second arrest when kim fell silent kelly exhaled and leaned back she shook her head what a story she said and what a tragedy for you but what brings you to me i assume there is something you want me to do obviously kim said i want you to do a story about all this its something the public needs to know and i want to get out the message about marsha baldwin the more i think about it the more im convinced theres a conspiracy here if shes alive the sooner shes found the better kelly chewed the inside of her cheek while she pondered kims request there were some intriguing elements to the story but there were also some problems after a few moments she shook her head thank you for coming by and telling me all this but im not interested from a professional point of view at least not at this time kims face fell as hed told the story hed become progressively convinced of its merit and kellys rapid negative decision came as a disappointing surprise can you tell me why he questioned sure kelly said as much as i sympathize with you about the tragic loss of your darling talented daughter its not the kind of tv journalism i generally do i go after harder bigger stories if you know what i mean but this is a big story kim complained becky died of e coli h this has become a worldwide problem true kelly admitted but its only one case thats the point kim said only one case so far im convinced she got it at the onion ring restaurant on prairie highway im afraid shes going to turn out to be the index case of what could be a big outbreak but an outbreak hasnt happened kelly said you said yourself your daughter got sick over a week ago if there were going to be an outbreak there would have been more cases by now but there havent been but there will be kim said im convinced of it fine kelly said when there are more cases ill do a story i mean one isolated case is not a story how can i say it more clearly but hundreds of kids die each year from this bacteria kim said people dont know that that might be true kelly said but these hundreds of cases are not related but they are kim said with exasperation almost all of them get it from ground beef the meat industry that produces the hamburger is a threat to everyone who eats ground beef its a situation that has to be exposed hey where have you been kelly asked with equal exasperation its already been exposed particularly by the jackinthebox outbreak and the hudson meat recall this e coli has been in the news just about every month its been in the news but the media has been giving the wrong message kim said oh really kelly questioned superciliously i suppose that in addition to being a cardiac surgeon youre also a media expert i dont profess to be a media expert kim said but i do know that the media coverage of this issue has given two important false impressions one that the presence of this dangerous e coli in ground meat is unusual and two that the usda is on the job inspecting meat to guarantee its safety both these messages are false as evidenced by the deaths of up to five hundred kids a year whoa kelly commented now youre out on very thin ice i mean now youre making a couple of major accusations how can you back it up what kind of proof do you have my daughters death kim said with obvious anger and the cdcs reports of the other deaths im talking about the accusation you made about e coli being so common and the usda failing to inspect the meat i dont have specific proof right now kim said thats what i expect you to find when you do the story but so many kids wouldnt be dying if it wasnt true and all this was substantiated by marsha baldwin ah of course kelly said dubiously how could i forget the mysterious usda inspector who you say has been missing for less than twentyfour hours the one you feel has fallen victim to foul play exactly kim said they had to silence her kelly cocked her head to the side she wasnt a hundredpercent sure she shouldnt be afraid of kim especially considering his double arrests she had the sense his daughters death had done something to his mind he seemed paranoid and she wanted him out of the house tell me again kelly said the reason you think miss baldwin is missing is because of the interrupted telephone call and the blood you found in the slaughterhouse exactly kim repeated and you told all this to the police who arrested you kelly asked of course kim said but they didnt believe me and i can see why kelly said silently to herself all at once she stood up excuse me dr reggis she said out loud im afraid were going around in circles this is all hearsay and therefore smoke and mirrors as far as im concerned id like to help you but i cant at the moment at least not until you have something tangible something that a story could be based on kim pushed himself up off the low couch he could feel his anger returning but he fought against it although he didnt agree with kellys position he had to admit he understood and the realization only renewed his determination all right kim said resolutely ill get something substantive and ill be back you do that kelly said and ill do the story im going to hold you to that kim said i always keep my word kelly said of course i have to be the one who decides if the evidence is sufficient ill make sure therere no ambiguities kim said kim exited the house and ran down to his car parked at the curb he wasnt running because of the rain although it had increased in intensity while he had been in the anderson house he was running because hed already decided what he was going to do to satisfy kellys need for proof it wasnt going to be easy but kim didnt care he was a man with a mission kim made a uturn and stomped on the accelerator he didnt notice kelly standing in the doorway of her house or see her shake her head one final time as he sped away as soon as kim made it onto the freeway he punched in tracy s phone number on his cellular phone trace kim said with no preamble when she answered meet me at the mall there was a pause at first kim thought the connection had been broken just when he was about to resend the call tracy s voice came over the line i took you at your word ive made arrangements for a funeral service kim sighed at times he was able to put becky entirely out of his mind thank god for tracy she was so strong how could he face this tragedy without her thank you he said at last it was hard to find the words i appreciate your doing it without me it will be at the sullivan funeral home on river street tracy said and it will be on tuesday thats fine kim said he just couldnt bring himself to think too long or hard about it id like you to meet me at the mall dont you want to hear the rest of the details tracy asked at the moment meeting me at the mall is more important kim said he hoped he didnt sound too cold then id like to ask if youd come back with me to our old house how can going to the mall be more important than our daughters funeral tracy asked with exasperation trust me kim said you can give me the details of the arrangements when i see you kim whats going on tracy asked she sensed an excited anticipation in his voice ill explain later kim said where at the mall tracy asked with resignation its a big place connolly drugs kim said inside the store when tracy asked im on my way kim said get there as soon as you can it will take me more than a half hour tracy said and you know they close at six tonight i know kim said thats plenty of time tracy hung up the phone she wondered if she was hurting kim more than she was helping him by having let him avoid participating in the funeral arrangements but she didnt have much time to dwell on it just then despite their bitter divorce thinking about kim brought out the mother in tracy she found herself wondering when kim had eaten last she knew she wasnt hungry but guessed it would be best if they both had something so before leaving for the mall tracy threw some food into a bag and carried it out to the car on the way to the mall tracy decided that she would insist that kim participate in finalizing the plans for beckys service it would be best for both of them since it was late afternoon on a cold rainy sunday there was no traffic and tracy made it to the mall faster than she estimated even the parking area was relatively empty it was the first time tracy had ever been able to get a spot within a few steps of the main entrance inside the mall was more crowded than she expected given the number of cars outside just beyond the door she was confronted by a group of senior citizens bearing down on her while doing their version of powerwalking tracy had to step into the lip of a shop for a moment to avoid being trampled walking on to the center of the mall she assiduously avoided looking at the skating rink for fear of the memories it would invariably evoke connolly drugs was as busy as ever particularly at the prescription counter where there were upwards of twenty people waiting tracy made a rapid trip around the store but didnt see kim on a slower transit she located him in the hairproducts section he was carrying a box containing a pair of hair clippers and a bag from one of the malls trendy clothing stores ah tracy kim said just in time i want you to help me pick out a hair rinse ive decided to go blond tracy lifted her hands onto her hips and regarded her former husband with bewilderment are you all right she asked yeah im fine kim said he was preoccupied looking at the panoply of hair products what do you mean you want to go blond tracy asked just what i said kim asserted and not just dirty blond i want to be very blond kim this is crazy tracy said you have to know it and if you dont im even more worried theres nothing to worry about kim said im not decompensating if thats what you think all i want to do is disguise myself im going undercover tracy reached out and gabbed kim by the shoulder to steady him she leaned forward suddenly transfixed by his earlobe whats this she questioned youre wearing an earring im pleased you noticed kim said i had a little time before you got here so i got an earring i thought it was sufficiently out of character i also got a leather outfit he held up the shopping bag what are the hair clippers for tracy asked those are for you to give me a haircut kim said ive never cut anyones hair tracy said you know that that doesnt matter kim said with a smile im aiming for a skinhead look this is bizarre tracy complained the more bizarre the better kim said i dont want to be recognized why tracy asked because i visited kelly anderson kim said and she refuses to lend us her investigative journalistic skills until i supply her with some incontrovertible proof proof of what tracy asked proof of the allegations kathleen morgan and marsha baldwin made about the meat industry and the usda and how is a disguise going to help you do that tracy asked its going to help me get a job kim said marsha baldwin told me slaughterhouses like higgins and hancock dont allow visitors but she suggested i could get a job especially if i were an illegal alien i dont mean to say im trying to look like an illegal alien just some marginal member of society who needs to earn some money i cant believe this tracy said you mean you are going to go into higgins and hancock to try to get a job after someone tried to kill you in there im hoping the employment officer and the man with the knife are two different people kim said kim this is no laughing matter tracy said i dont like the idea at all especially if your fears about marsha are true it might be a little dicey if they recognize me kim admitted thats why i want the disguise to be good marsha contended that higgins and hancock is always in need of help because turnover is so high so im counting on their not being particularly choosey i dont like this one bit tracy said i think its too risky theres got to be another way what if i talk to kelly anderson shes not going to budge kim said she was clear about that ive got to go in higgins and hancock risk or not even if there is risk i think it is worth it for beckys sake for me its a way to make her loss less meaningless kim felt tears spring to his eyes besides he managed to add i have the time now that im unemployed im on a forced temporary leave from the hospital because of what happened in the icu tracy questioned uhhuh kim said apparently you were the only person who thought my action was courageous it was courageous tracy asserted she was impressed kim had come around onehundredeighty degrees he really wanted to do something for beckys sake and was willing to risk his career and reputation to do so she couldnt argue with his motives or his goal without another word tracy turned to the shelving and walked along the aisle until she found what she considered the best bleaching rinse carlos had waited until dusk before driving his dilapidated pickup into the balmoral neighborhood he liked the fact that the streets were dark the only lights were at the corners over the street signs having looked at a map it didnt take him long to find edinburgh lane and eventually kims house carlos turned off his single working headlight before gliding to a stop in the shadow of some trees lining the street he switched off the ignition and waited from where he was parked he could see the silhouette of kims house against the darkening sky carlos was pleased the lack of light suggested that kim was not home once again carlos would have the benefit of surprise only this time it would be even better kim would be caught totally offguard carlos waited in his truck for twenty minutes before he felt comfortable enough to get out he heard a dog bark and he froze the dog barked again but it sounded farther away carlos relaxed he reached into his truck and extracted one of the long killfloor knives from beneath the seat he slipped it under his coat skirting around the front of his aged toyota carlos entered the trees that separated kims house from its neighbor wearing a black leather coat and dark trousers carlos was all but invisible as he silently slipped through the thicket carlos was pleased when he got a full view of the back of kims house like the front there wasnt a light on in any window now he was certain the house was empty hunched over carlos ran from the protection of the trees across kims backyard and flattened himself against the house again he waited for any suggestion that his presence was known the neighborhood was deathly quiet even the dog that hed heard earlier had fallen silent staying within the shadow of the house carlos approached kims screened back porch the knife flashed briefly in the dim light as carlos cut a slit in the screen just long enough for him to silently slip through burglary was carloss true forte the killing talent had been born of necessity kim turned off the main road and drove through the gate marking the boundary of balmoral estates he glanced in the rearview mirror to see tracy s car follow suit he was pleased that she was willing to help him with his hair more for her company than from need he was also pleased about her offer to make them something to eat kim couldnt remember the last time he had an actual meal although he guessed it had been thursday night after parking his car in front of his garage kim gathered his bundles and went back to meet tracy as she climbed from her car it was raining harder than ever in total darkness they navigated the black pools that had formed along the front walk when they reached the cover of the porch tracy offered to hold the packages while kim got out his key no need kim said the doors unlocked thats not very wise tracy commented why not kim said theres not much in the house to take and it makes it easier for the realtor i suppose tracy said unconvinced she opened the door and they entered the foyer they took off their coats and wiped the moisture from their foreheads then they carried their parcels into the kitchen ill tell you what tracy said while putting her bag of groceries onto the countertop im happy to make us something to eat and help you with your hair but first id really like to take a shower and warm up would you mind mind kim questioned not at all help yourself its sad to say tracy added but the shower is the only thing i miss about this house i understand completely kim said it was the only thing we made our own theres a robe in with the towels if youd like of course you also have some clothes here but i moved them out to the hall closet dont worry ill find something tracy said i had a shower at the hospital kim said so ill start a fire in the fireplace here in the family room maybe it will make this empty house a little less depressing while tracy headed upstairs kim got out a flashlight from the kitchen junk drawer and headed down to the basement where the firewood was stored he turned on the light but the single bulb had never been adequate to light the huge cluttered cellar kim had never felt comfortable in basements because of a disturbing experience hed had in the basement of the home where hed grown up when kim was six his older brother had locked him in an unused wine cellar and then forgot about him with the insulated door no one had heard kims hysterical cries or his frantic pounding it was only after his mother became worried hed not appeared for dinner that his brother had remembered where he was kim could not go down to the basement without remembering the terror hed felt thirtyeight years previously when he heard a thump in a neighboring storeroom as he loaded wood in his arms the hairs on the back of his neck stood up he froze and listened he heard the noise again steeling himself against the desire to flee kim put the wood down taking the flashlight he walked over to the door to the storeroom it took strength of will to make himself push the door open with his foot and shine the light in a half dozen pairs of tiny red ruby like points of light stared back at him before scampering off kim breathed a sigh of relief he went back to the woodpile to finish loading up tracy had climbed the stairs feeling a twinge of nostalgia it had been some time since shed been on the second floor of the house outside of beckys room shed paused gazing at the closed door and wondering if she dare enter compromising she merely opened the door and stood on the threshold beckys room had not changed since tracy and kim shared custody tracy had gotten new furniture for her daughter and left the old where it was becky didnt mind and preferred to leave what she considered her childhood objects in her old room shed not even taken her stuffed animal collection the idea that becky was gone was inconceivable to tracy shed been the center of tracy s life particularly after tracy s relationship with kim had deteriorated tracy took a deep breath and pulled the door closed as she walked down toward the master suite she wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes with her knuckle she knew from her professional experience how difficult the next few months would be for her and for kim tracy entered the master bath directly from the hall instead of going around through the bedroom once inside she flicked on the light and closed the door behind her she surveyed the room it wasnt nearly as clean as it had always been when she lived in the house yet it was still beautiful with its granitetopped vanity and marble shower leaning into the shower stall she turned on the water and adjusted the showerhead to deliver a pulsating jet then she opened the generous closet and got out a large bath towel along with a turkish robe placing them on the vanity she began to remove her damp clothes carlos heard the shower and smiled this job was going to be easier than hed imagined he was standing in the walkin closet in the master bedroom intending to wait until kim unknowingly opened the door but hearing the shower running he thought it would be better to corner the doctor in such a conveniently confined space escape would be impossible carlos cracked the door and a sliver of pale light fell across his face he looked out the bedroom was still mostly dark with the only light coming from the bathroom carlos was pleased about this as well it meant he would not have to worry about being seen as he approached the bathroom for what he had to do surprise was an important element carlos opened the door wide enough to step out into the room he had his knife in his right hand moving like a cat advancing on its prey carlos inched forward with each step he could see progressively more of the bathrooms interior through the open passageway connecting the rooms he saw a hand flash by and drop clothing onto the counter taking one more step carlos had a full view of the bathroom and he froze it wasnt kim it was a strikingly lithe sexy woman in the process of unhooking her bra in an instant her soft white breasts were revealed the woman then hooked her thumbs beneath the elastic of her panties and pulled them off carlos was transfixed by this unexpected but welcome spectacle as tracy turned her back toward him and climbed into the billowing mist coming from the shower stall she closed the moisturestreaked glass door behind her and threw her towel over a bar at the showers rear carlos moved forward as if drawn to a siren he wanted a better view tracy put her hand under the water spray then pulled it clear it was much too hot which was what she expected it had been her intent to turn the shower stall into a modified steam bath reaching behind the stream of water she adjusted the mixing valve while she waited for the water temperature to change she glanced at the soap dish and noticed it was empty the bar was out at the sink tracy opened the door to get the soap when a flicker of light caught her attention it had come from the bedroom at first she couldnt believe her eyes and she blinked there was the spectral image of a man in black standing just within the penumbra of the bathroom light the flash had come from the blade of an enormous knife in the mans right hand for a beat the two people stared at each other tracy in shocked horror and carlos in libidinous interest tracy was the first to react she let out a horrendous scream as she yanked the shower door shut then she snatched the tubular towel bar from its brackets and passed it through the ushaped handle of the heavy glass door to prevent it from opening carlos reacted by springing forward into the bathroom he wanted to get to her before her scream brought kim switching the knife to his left hand he grasped the handle of the shower door and yanked frustrated by not being able to get inside he put up a foot to give himself more leverage the light tubular towel bar slowly dented under his effort and began to bend when tracy s scream sounded through the house kim was on his way up the cellar stairs with his armload of firewood already on edge from the runin with the mice kims heart leaped into his throat he dropped the firewood with a tremendous clatter as the logs tumbled back down the stairs knocking all sorts of things off the steps that had been inappropriately stored there afterward kim would not even remember how he got through the kitchen dining room foyer and up the stairs as he reached the upper hallway he heard tracy scream again and he redoubled his efforts he hit the thin paneled bathroom door at a full run and shattered it on his way through kim burst into the bathroom and skid on the shag rug as he tried to stop he saw carlos with his foot up against the glass shower stall apparently trying to open it he saw the knife and immediately realized he should have brought something to defend himself carlos reacted by spinning around and slashing out with the knife the tip of the blade caught kim across the bridge of his nose as he backed up carlos tossed the knife into his right hand and turned his full attention to kim kims eyes were glued to the knife as he backed up toward the broken door to the hall tracy struggled with the dented towel bar to extract it from the showerdoor handle when she finally was able to do it kim and carlos had disappeared out into the hallway she grasped the towel bar at one end and frantically pushed out of the shower naked she rushed after the two men carlos was still forcing kim to back up by menacing him with his blade kim had picked up a broken door stile and was using it in a vain attempt to counter carloss repeated thrusts blood from the cut over kims nose was running down his face without hesitation tracy ran up behind carlos and clubbed him several times over the head with the towel bar the hollow tube was not enough to hurt carlos but he had to defend himself against the repeated blows he turned around to take a few swipes at tracy who immediately backed up kim took the opportunity to grab the leg of a small console table he ripped the table from the wall and then smashed it over the banister to free the leg by the time carlos turned to face him kim was brandishing the leg like a truncheon with kim on one side and tracy on the other carlos decided that his lethal weapon was trumped he bolted down the stairs kim followed with tracy close behind carlos threw open the front door and ran down across the front lawn kim was close behind but he stopped when tracy yelled for him he looked back she was standing in the doorway come back tracy yelled its not worth it kim turned in time to see carlos leap into a truck parked in the shadows an instant later exhaust billowed out of the tailpipe and the vehicle lurched forward and picked up speed kim hurried back up to the house and pushed open the door tracy was standing in the foyer shed pulled on her coat to cover her nakedness kim enveloped her in his arms are you okay he asked urgently youre the one whos hurt tracy said the laceration that stretched across kims nose and into one eyebrow was gaping and still bleeding kim let go of tracy to step into the powder room where he examined himself in the mirror he was surprised to see how much blood was involved over his shoulder he saw tracy s face shed come up behind him gosh it was close kim said redirecting his attention to his wound this could have been serious first he cut my hand and now right between the eyes are you suggesting this was the same man who attacked you last night tracy asked with astonishment theres no doubt kim said i would have had trouble describing him but i didnt have any trouble recognizing him tracy shuddered and then couldnt stop kim could see in the mirror that she was shivering despite her coat kim spun around and grasped her shoulders whats the matter youre okay arent you i mean you didnt get cut or anything physically im all right tracy managed its just the reality of what happened is finally dawning on me that man wanted to kill us he wanted to kill me kim said i have a feeling you were a surprise and enough of one to have saved my life thank god you werent hurt tracy twisted out of kims grasp ill call the police she said on her way to the family room kim caught up to her and grabbing her arm he pulled her to a stop dont bother to call the police he said tracy eyed kims hand clasped around her upper arm then looked up into his face she was incredulous what do you mean dont bother she questioned come on kim urged gently pulling her back toward the stairs lets get my gun i doubt the guy will be back but theres no sense in taking any chance of not being prepared tracy held back why dont you want to call the police she questioned it doesnt make any sense they wont do anything kim said well end up spending a lot of time for nothing undoubtedly theyll attribute this episode to a failed burglary whereas we know what it is about we do tracy asked of course kim said i said it was the same guy from higgins and hancock obviously what i was afraid had happened to marsha did happen and the people responsible whether theyre from higgins and hancock or the meat industry in general are afraid of me that seems like all the more reason to call the police tracy said no kim said emphatically not only wont they do anything they might cause trouble above all i dont want them interfering in my attempt to get evidence for kelly anderson in their eyes im already a felon they think im a nutcase they dont think im a nutcase tracy said they might kim said as soon as you tell them youve been spending time with me you think so tracy questioned that was a point shed not considered come on kim urged lets get the gun tracy followed kim out to the foyer they started up the stairs she was confused but for the moment allowed kims determination to sway her yet the attack by the man with the knife terrified her im having serious second thoughts about your getting more involved in all this tracy said not me kim said i feel even more committed any residual benefit of doubt id felt has flown out the window now that i know what theyre willing to do to protect themselves they passed the broken door to the bathroom tracy could hear the shower still running she shuddered anew at the image of the killer separated from her by a mere layer of glass tracy followed kim into the bedroom he went directly to the bedside table and took out a small smith amp wesson thirtyeightcaliber pistol he checked the cylinder it was loaded he slipped the gun into his jacket pocket and looked over at the open door to the walkin closet that prick must have been hiding in there kim said he walked over and switched on the light most of the drawers had been emptied onto the floor kim pulled out the drawer where he kept his minimal jewelry thats nice he added he helped himself to my fathers piaget kim i think we should forget about this whole thing tracy said i dont think you should try to get a job in higgins and hancock i dont have any choice at this point kim said im not going to give up my fathers watch without a fight this is no time for jokes tracy said im being serious its too dangerous what would you have us do kim asked move away to some foreign country thats a thought tracy said kim laughed mirthlessly wait a sec he said i was just kidding where would you want to move someplace in europe tracy said i had another conversation with kathleen after the three of us talked she told me there were some countries like sweden where the food is not contaminated seriously kim questioned thats what she said tracy offered they may pay a little more for the extra scrutiny but theyve decided its worth it and youd seriously think of going to live in another country kim asked i hadnt thought about it until you mentioned it tracy said but yes id consider it given what happened to becky id like to be public about ituse the move to make a statement about the food situation in this country and it certainly would be a lot less risky i suppose kim said he thought about the idea for a moment but then shook his head i think running away is too much of a copout for beckys sake im going to see this to the bitter end are you sure youre not doing this just to avoid coming to grips with beckys death tracy asked she took a nervous breath she knew she was touching a sensitive area the old kim would have reacted with rage kim didnt answer immediately when he did his voice didnt sound angry ive admitted as much already but i think im doing this for beckys memory as well in that sense part of her legacy would be preventing other kids from sharing her fate tracy was touched she went up to kim and put her arms around him he truly seemed to be a different man come on kim urged get out of that coat and back into your clothes well get the stuff we bought and get the hell out of here where will we go tracy asked first to the hospital kim said i have to get this laceration sutured up or ill be looking at it the rest of my life once thats done we can go on to your house if you wouldnt mind i think well feel a lot safer there than we will here now who the hell is that bobby bo mason asked he and his wife along with their two children were having a small sunday night dinner of sirloin steaks doublebaked potatoes peas and corn muffins their chewing concentration had been broken by the frontdoor chimes bobby bo lifted the tip of his napkin to blot the corners of his lips the other end of the napkin was tucked into his shirt just below his sizable adams apple he looked up at the clock it was just a few minutes shy of seven want me to get it dear darlene asked darlene was bobby bos third wife and mother of his youngest children he also had two kids at the state agricultural school ill get it bobby bo grumbled he pushed back from the table stuck out his lantern jaw and headed for the front door he wondered who had the nerve to ring his bell during dinner but he guessed it had to be important because whoever it was had gotten through security down at the gate bobby bo pulled open the door it was shanahan obrian the man was literally holding his hat in his hand you dont look happy bobby bo said im not shanahan admitted its not good news bobby bo glanced over his shoulder to make sure darlene hadnt followed him to the door come on into the library bobby bo said he stepped aside to let shanahan enter then he preceded his security head into the library he closed the door after them all right bobby bo said whats the scoop i just had a call from carlos shanahan said he didnt get the doctor i thought this guy was supposed to be some kind of ace with a knife bobby bo complained thats what id been told shanahan said carlos insists this doctor is just lucky he broke into the doctors house hed been told that the doctor lived alone but when the doctor came home this time he apparently had a woman with him big deal bobby bo said this carlos is supposed to be a killer what difference does it make if a woman was there she apparently confused him shanahan said he caught her naked and enough bobby bo said raising his hand i dont want to hear any more details the fact of the matter is this amateur wetback botched it up thats the long and short of it shanahan said damn bobby bo said he slapped the edge of his desk and began to pace and loudly curse shanahan let his boss blow off some steam hed learned over the years it was best to say as little as possible when bobby bo was irritated well bobby bo said while still walking back and forth in front of the fireplace this all goes to show how stupid it is to save a few bucks by relying on a novice so much for the vaunted protection committee lets call the professional up in chicago and get him down here asap to straighten out this mess whats his name again derek leutmann shanahan said but he is expensive i think we should let carlos have one more crack at it how expensive bobby bo asked at least five k shanahan said hell five k is cheap if it prevents another major meat recall bobby bo said i mean were talking about hundreds of millions of dollars if not the viability of the industry as we know it if the public learns the true extent of this e coli problem itll be a thousand times worse than james garner having to have bypass surgery after touting meat for us bobby bo giggled at his own joke im worried about the doctor causing trouble in relation to marsha baldwin shanahan said yeah well that too bobby bo said what about carlos shanahan asked hes really angry at this point hes willing to do it for nothing its become a matter of pride whats been the upshot of this last botched attempt bobby bo asked have the police been called do i have a lot of media nonsense to look forward to apparently not shanahan said weve monitored the scanner all afternoon and evening theres been nothing thank god for small favors bobby bo said ill tell you what make the arrangements with leutmann but if the situation presents itself let carlos have one more chance what do you think leutmann will demand a down payment just to come here shanahan said its not the kind of thing we can get back so we save two and a half k bobby bo said plus we have our bases covered one way or the other well be rid of this pesky doctor okay shanahan said ill get right on it good bobby bo said just make sure that the next time you talk to me its good news ill make it my personal responsibility shanahan said one other thing bobby bo said get some bio on this doctor when leutmann gets here i want him to know how to find him without screwing around the emergency room at university medical center was as busy as usual kim and tracy were in the waiting room sitting in seats close to where theyd been when theyd waited with becky kim was holding a sterile fourbyfour gauze pad against his laceration this is a rather unpleasant déjà vu kim commented seems like a year ago since we were here tracy said wistfully i cant believe so much could happen in so few days in some respects it seems like a long time and in others like a blink of the eye kim said he gritted his teeth i cant help but wonder if things wouldnt have turned out much differently if becky had been seen quicker on that first visit and cultures taken i posed that question to dr morgan tracy said she didnt think it would have mattered that much it seems hard to believe kim said why didnt you want to call one of your surgical friends to sew you up tracy asked for some of the same reasons i didnt want to call the police kim said i just want to have it stitched and be done with it i dont want there to be a big rigmarole with a friend thered be questions and id feel guilty about lying theyll undoubtedly ask you how it happened even here tracy said what will you tell them i dont know kim said ill think of something how long do you think well have to wait tracy asked according to david washington not long kim said by chance theyd run into the evening er head when theyd first arrived hed heard about beckys passing and had offered his deepest sympathies hed also promised to get kim in and out of the er as soon as possible and was unconcerned when kim told him he wanted to use an alias for a while they sat in silence while mindlessly watching the pathetic parade of the sick and injured that passed in front of them tracy was the one who broke the silence the more time i have to think about what we just experienced the less inclined i am to allow you to go through with what youre planning i mean its plainly selfdestructive for you to even consider going into higgins and hancock after everything thats occurred what do you mean allow me kim questioned irritably while still musing about the er visit with becky what are you going to do physically stand in my way please kim tracy said im trying to have a conversation with you because of whats happened to becky im worried about whether youre capable of making reasonable decisions it seems clear to me that getting a job in higgins and hancock is too risky it might be risky kim said but theres no other choice its the only way to get the media involved and the media is our only hope of doing anything about this sorry situation what can you hope to accomplish in higgins and hancock to justify the risk tracy said i mean specifically that i cant say until i get in there kim admitted never having been in a slaughterhouse i dont know what to expect but i know what im interested in and what the issues are the first concerns how becky got sick marsha baldwin discovered something about the head of the last animal slaughtered on january ninth i want to find out what it was the second issue is marsha baldwins disappearance somebodys got to know something and lastly there is the issue about how e coli generally gets into the meat marsha suggested it has something to do with the way they slaughter the animals i want to see it with my own eyes and then document it once i have ill get kelly anderson involved exposing the usda angle will be up to her tracy stared off in the middle distance youre not going to respond kim commented after a short silence sure tracy said as if waking from a mini trance you make it all sound so reasonable but ill tell you something im not going to allow you to go by yourself ive got to be involved in some form or fashion so that i can help if need be even if i have to get a job too youre serious kim said he was amazed of course im serious tracy said becky was my daughter too i dont think you should be the only one taking the risk well thats an interesting idea kim said now it was his time to stare off while he pondered i wouldnt even have to worry about a disguise tracy added theyve never seen me i dont know whether you could get a job kim said at least not easily why not tracy asked if you could get a job why couldnt i marsha said they were in constant need of help but only in the actual slaughtering side of the business kim said i dont think youre ready for that no but maybe they could use me as a secretary or something along those lines tracy said we dont know unless i try ive got a better idea kim said remember lee cook who worked for me back at the samaritan i think so tracy said wasnt he that clever technician who could fix anything electronic and who kept all the sophisticated electronic equipment functioning at the hospital you got it kim said after the merger he retired hes building his own airplane in his basement and doing other odd jobs but im sure he could wire me up with a bug in that way you can be in the car in the parking lot listening in real time then if need be you can use your cell phone to call for the cavalry you mean so i could hear you all the time tracy asked yeah continuously kim said could i talk with you tracy asked well i dont know about that kim said id have to have an earphone of some kind that might be a giveaway i cant imagine too many higgins and hancock employees wear earphones i could even record what you say tracy said warming to the idea thats true kim agreed what about video tracy asked hey maybe so kim said i know they have some tiny cameras nowadays maybe that could be the documentation well need for kelly anderson mr billy rubin a voice called out over the heads of the waiting crowd kim raised his free hand and stood up tracy did likewise an er resident dressed in all white saw them and walked over he was carrying a clipboard with kims er registration sheet attached mr billy rubin the resident repeated his name tag said dr steve ludwig emergency medicine resident he was a brawny fellow with a ready smile and closely cropped thinning dirtyblond hair did you know that bilirubin is a medical term no kim said i didnt have any idea it is steve commented it comes from the breakdown of hemoglobin anyhow lets take a look at your laceration kim pulled away the fourbyfour due to swelling the wound was more gaping now than earlier whoa steve intoned thats one nasty cut wed better get that sewn up how did it happen shaving kim said tracy couldnt help but repress a smile sixteen monday january th tracy shifted her weight impatiently she had her arms folded and was leaning against the plaster wall of the upstairs hall shed positioned herself directly across from the door into the guest bath shed been there for almost five minutes well tracy called through the door are you ready kims voice answered ive been ready tracy answered open the door the door squeaked open tracy s hand shot to her mouth and she let out an involuntary giggle kim looked completely different his hair was unevenly cut short teased to stand mostly upward and bleached platinum blond his eyebrows matched his hair in color and formed a stark contrast with the dark stubblecovered face the sutured laceration wrapping over the bridge of his nose and extending through one blond eyebrow gave him a frankenstein look he was dressed in a black doubleflap pocket corduroy shirt over a black tshirt with black leather pants he had a black leather belt and matching bracelet decorated with stainlesssteel rivets the outfit was topped off with a fake diamondstud earring in his left earlobe and a tattoo of a wolf with the word lobo on his right upper arm so what do you think kim asked you look bizarre tracy said especially with the black silk stitches id hate to run into you in a dark alley that sounds like the effect i was striving for kim said you certainly dont look like anybody id want to know tracy added in that case maybe i should swing by the hospital kim suggested maybe with this outfit theyll reinstate my privileges without a hearing a doctor is the last thing id suspect you were tracy said with another laugh i particularly like the tattoo kim lifted his arm to admire his handiwork pretty cool huh he said the directions guaranteed it would last for three or four days provided i dont shower can you imagine wheres the microphone tracy asked right here under my collar kim said he rolled over the upper edge of the shirt a tiny microphone was safetypinned to the underside too bad video was out of the question tracy said hey remember its not completely out of the question kim said lee said hed work on it and when he says that nine times out of ten he comes through it just wont be for a few days lets test the audio system tracy suggested i want to make sure its working as well as it did last night in lees garage good idea kim said you hop in your car and drive down to the corner that should be just about right lee said it would work up to two hundred yards where will you be tracy asked ill move around inside the house kim said ill even try going down into the basement tracy nodded and went down to the hall closet she got out her coat then called back up the stairs dont forget to put in your earphone too i already have it in kim yelled tracy went out into the crisp morning a wind had come up during the night blowing the storm clouds to the east in their place was pale blue sky tracy got into her car started it and drove to the corner as theyd discussed she pulled to the side of the road and turned off the engine next she opened her driversside window and put a makeshift antenna on the roof of her car inside the car tracy slipped on a pair of stereo earphones that were attached to an oldstyle reeltoreel tape recorder the tape recorder was wired to an amplifier which in turn was connected to a transformer sitting on top of a freestanding car battery a red light on the front panel of the amplifier illuminated when tracy turned the unit on she heard some brief static in her earphones but it cleared quickly on top of the amplifier was a microphone tracy picked it up after glancing outside her car to make sure none of her neighbors were watching she spoke into the microphone kim can you hear me she asked kims voice came back so loud tracy winced i can hear you like you were standing right next to me he said tracy quickly turned down the volume and pressed the start button on the tape recorder hows your volume tracy asked you were much too loud on this end its fine kim said where are you tracy asked im in the back part of the basement kim said if it works here im pretty sure its going to work anyplace it is surprisingly clear tracy admitted well come on back kim said lets get this show on the road tenfour tracy said she had no idea what the expression meant but had heard it in lots of movies and tv shows she took off the headphones and stopped the tape she rewound it and then played it she was pleased that both sides of the conversation came through perfectly clearly by the time tracy got back to the house kim had everything they intended to take waiting by the front door theyd packed lunches and filled thermos bottles banking on kim being hired on the spot they also had a blanket and extra sweaters for tracy kim was sure it would be cold sitting in the car all day they stowed everything in the backseat kim climbed in the back too since the front passenger seat was taken up by the electronic equipment tracy slid behind the wheel and was about to start the car when she thought of something else wheres your gun she asked its upstairs in the guestroom kim said i think you should have it tracy said i dont want to carry a gun in the slaughterhouse kim said why not tracy asked god forbid what if you have to face that creep with the knife again kim considered the suggestion there were reasons against taking it first kim was afraid the gun might somehow be discovered second hed never once fired it and didnt know if he could actually shoot someone but then he remembered the panic hed felt when hed been chased by the man with the knife and how hed wished hed had some kind of weapon all right kim said he opened the door took tracy s keys and returned to the house a few minutes later he climbed back into the car and handed the keys to tracy tracy started the car and was about to back up wait a sec kim said theres something else tracy turned the ignition key the engine coughed and died with a confused expression she faced around at kim what now she asked kim was staring up at the house i was just thinking about that creep being in my house when we arrived last night kim said i dont want to be surprised like that again its not entirely inconceivable that they could trace me here what do you propose tracy asked with a shudder are any of your neighbors particularly nosy kim asked these houses are all pretty close together theres mrs english across the street tracy said shes an elderly widow who i swear must spend the whole day looking out the window thats a start kim said lets ask her to keep an eye out until we get back would you mind not at all tracy said but thats not enough kim said we got to have backups its got to be onehundredpercent sure how many doors into the house just the usual front door and back door tracy said what about the basement kim asked the only way into the basement is through the house tracy said the guy last night came through the back sliders kim said while thinking out loud this house has no sliders tracy said good he got out of the car tracy did the same why not do something to the doors so wed know if theyd been opened tracy suggested i mean for someone to get in theyd have to break a window or go through one of the doors when we get back we can cheek thats a good idea kim said but then what would we do well we sure as hell wont go in the house tracy said where would we go kim asked we wouldnt want to be followed tracy shrugged a motel i guess i know what well do kim said on the way out to higgins and hancock well stop by the bank well pull out our savings as a fallback if were really worried about being followed credit cards arent the best idea wow you really are thinking ahead tracy said in that case we might as well grab our passports too listen im being serious kim complained so am i tracy said if it gets to the point that were that worried i want the option of going far away fair enough kim said lets do it it took them a half hour to do everything they had in mind around the house and another half hour to stop at the bank they used separate tellers to speed things up but it didnt work kims teller had been nonplussed by his appearance and had to go back to a manager to get the signature authenticated i feel a little like a bank robber tracy said as they walked out to the car ive never carried this much cash i was afraid they werent going to give me my money kim said maybe ive overdone it a little with this disguise the fact that they didnt recognize you is the important point tracy said it was midmorning by the time they got on the freeway en route to higgins and hancock the day that had started out so clear was already becoming veiled with high cirrus clouds midwestern winter weather rarely saw long periods of sunlight what did you say to mrs english kim asked from the backseat i didnt have to say much tracy said she was delighted with the task its nasty to say but i think weve given her life new meaning when did you say youd be back kim asked i didnt tracy said lets review our high school spanish kim said out of the blue surprised at this suggestion tracy glanced at kims reflection in the rearview mirror in the last twentyfour hours she couldnt tell when he was kidding and when he was being serious i want to try to speak with a spanish accent kim explained marsha said that a lot of the slaughterhouse workers are hispanic mostly mexican for the next few minutes they counted in spanish and constructed simple sentences neither could remember much vocabulary they soon fell silent let me ask you something tracy said after theyd driven for a few miles without conversation shoot kim said if all goes well tracy said and we succeed in getting kelly anderson to cover the story and make it a big expose what would you hope would happen id like to see no market for the twentyfive billion pounds of ground meat produced each year kim said and then what tracy asked well kim said while he put his thoughts in order id want the public to demand that meat and poultry inspection plus farmanimal feed approval be taken away from the usda it would be better if it were given to the fda which doesnt have a conflict of interest or better still id like to see the system privatized so that thered be a true competitive incentive for finding and eliminating contamination you dont put much stock in this new meat irradiation movement tracy asked hell no kim said thats just the industrys way of copping out allowing meat irradiation is just an invitation for the industry to allow that much more contamination to get in during processing in the hopes it will all be killed with the gamma rays at the end youll notice even with irradiation the industry insists the onus is on the consumers to handle and cook the meat in a way the industry considers proper that was kathleen morgans position as well tracy said it should be any thinking persons position kim said weve got to get the media to make people understand that contamination must not be tolerated even if it means the product will cost a little more this is all a very tall order tracy commented hey we might as well aim high kim said and its not impossible after all meat and poultry werent always contaminated its a relatively recent phenomenon in the distance stockyards came into view consistent with its being a workday herds of cattle could be seen milling about the muddy enclosure its kinda sad tracy said looking out over the sea of animals its like theyre all facing the death penalty tracy turned into the higgins and hancock parking lot in contrast with their visit the previous morning it was mostly full a large proportion of the vehicles were aged pickup trucks how about dropping me off near the front entrance kim said then i suggest you drive over to the end of the building you wont be so noticeable there and the entire plant will be well within two hundred yards tracy pulled over to the curb she and kim looked at the building the recordroom window that kim had broken was unboarded and its missing glass and mullions were apparent standing in the flowerbed in front of the window was a man in overalls and a red plaid shirt taking measurements i feel like i should offer to help kim said dont be silly tracy said the front door opened tracy and kim instinctively slid down low in their seats two men came out of the front door engrossed in conversation then the pair walked away the plant was obviously in operation tracy and kim straightened up they looked at each other and smiled nervously were acting like a couple of teenagers preparing to pull off a prank kim said maybe we should talk this over some more tracy said time for talk is over kim said he leaned toward tracy and gave her a kiss it was the first time theyd kissed for a longer time than either cared to remember wish me luck kim added i dont know why i agreed to all this tracy said she looked out at the slaughterhouse with misgivings you agreed out of civic responsibility kim said with an impish smile hell if we can pull this off well be saving a million times more lives than i could with a lifetime of surgery you know what i find the most amazing about all this tracy said looking back at kim within a couple of days youve gone from a narcissist to an altruist from one extreme to another i used to be under the impression that personalities couldnt change ill let you psychologists worry about that kim said as he opened the car door be careful tracy admonished i will kim said he climbed out of the car but then leaned back inside remember im only going to put my earphone in my ear on rare occasions for the most part this is going to be a oneway conversation i know tracy said good luck thanks kim said see ya he waved goodbye tracy watched kim saunter toward the door in character with his outrageous disguise despite her apprehensions she had to smile he had the carefree brazen look of a punkrock drifter with the car back in gear tracy drove down to the end of the plant as kim had suggested and parked behind a van after rolling down the window she put the antenna on top of the car with the stereo headphones in place she turned on the amplifier after the experience that morning with the volume she had the dial all the way down carefully she turned it up when she did she immediately heard kims voice with an overdone spanish accent i need a job any job kim was saying drawing out his vowels im flat broke i heard in town you were hiring tracy hit the start button on the tape recorder then tried to make herself comfortable kim had been both impressed and encouraged by the speed with which hed been escorted into the office of the killfloor supervisor his name was jed street he was a nondescript man with a slight paunch bulging his long white bloodstained coat on the corner of his desk was a yellow plastic construction helmet in front of him was a large stack of cattle purchases receipts jed had looked quizzically at kim when kim had first come through the door but after a few moments hed seemingly accepted kims appearance and made no mention of it whatsoever have you ever worked in a slaughterhouse before jed asked he rocked back in his desk chair and played with a pencil with both hands no kim said casually but theres always the first time do you have a social security number jed asked nope kim said i was told i didnt need one whats your name jed asked josé kim said josé ramerez where are you from brownsville texas kim said with more of a southern drawl than a spanish accent yeah and im from paris france jed said seemingly oblivious to kims verbal faux pas he rocked forward look this is hard sloppy work are you ready for that im ready for anything kim said do you have a green card jed asked when are you willing to start hey im ready to start right now kim said i havent eaten anything for a day and a half thats probably a good thing jed said considering youve never been working in a slaughterhouse before im going to have you start out sweeping the killroom floor its five bucks an hour cash with no social security card thats the best i can do sounds good kim said one other thing jed said if you want to work you gotta work the threetoeleven cleanup shift too but just for tonight one of the guys called in sick what do you say i say okay kim responded good jed said he got to his feet lets get you outfitted you mean i have to change clothes kim asked anxiously he could feel the gun pressing up against his thigh and the audio systems battery packs pressing against his chest nah jed said you only need a white coat boots hard hat gloves and a broom the only thing you have to change are your shoes to get the boots on kim followed jed out of the supervisors office and along the back corridor they went into one of the storerooms kim had looked into saturday night kim got everything jed had mentioned except the broom for the boots he had to settle for elevens they were out of ten and a halfs they were yellow rubber and came to midcalf they werent new and didnt smell good jed gave kim a combination lock and took him to the locker room off the lunchroom he waited while kim changed into the boots and stored his shoes once kim had on the hard hat the yellow gauntletlength gloves and the white coat he looked like he belonged thats quite a cut you got on your nose jed commented what happened a glass storm door broke kim said evasively sorry to hear that jed said well you ready for the plunge i guess kim said jed led kim out through the lunchroom and up the half flight of stairs to the fire door there he paused and waited for kim to catch up he took something out of his pocket and extended his hand to kim i almost forgot these buggers jed said he dropped two small weightless objects into kims waiting palm what are these kim asked earplugs jed said theres a lot of noise out on the kill floor from the overhead rails and the power skinners and saws kim examined one of the small coneshaped spongerubber like earplugs they too were yellow listen jed said your job is to move around the floor and push the shit on the floor into the grates shit kim asked yeah jed said you have a problem with that real shit well a mixture of cow shit barf and gore jed said whatever falls down from the line this isnt a tea party and by the way watch out for the moving carcasses suspended from the rails and of course watch out for the slippery floor falling down is no picnic jed laughed kim nodded and swallowed he was really going to have to steel himself for the gruesome aspects of this job jed checked his watch its less than an hour before we stop the line for the lunch break he said but no matter itll give you a chance to get acclimated any questions kim shook his head if you do jed said you know where my office is right kim said it seemed jed was waiting for an answer arent you going to put in those earplugs jed said oh yeah kim said i forgot kim pushed the little spongy plugs into his ear and gave a thumbsup sign to jed jed threw open the door even with the earplugs kim was initially bowled over by the cacophony of noise that exploded into the stairwell kim followed jed out onto the kill floor it was a far different place than it had been on saturday night kim thought hed prepared himself for the experience awaiting him but he hadnt instantly he turned green at the sight of the overhead conveyer carrying the suspended hot thousandpluspound carcasses combined with the whine of all the power machinery and the horrid smell the thick warm air was laden with the stench of raw flesh blood and fresh feces kim was equally overwhelmed by the visual impact of the spectacle the powerful roof air conditioners vainly struggling to keep the room temperature down caused the fifty or so skinned dead animals currently in kims line of sight to steam hundreds of workers in bloodspattered white coats were standing on the raised metalgrate catwalks elbow to elbow laboring on the carcasses as they streaked by power lines draped about the space in a bewildering fashion like pieces of a huge spider web it was a surreal danteesque image of the inferno a hell on earth jed tapped kim on the shoulder and pointed at the floor kims eyes lowered the kill floor was a literal sea of blood pieces of internal organs vomitus and watery cow diarrhea jed tapped kim again kim looked up jed was about to hand him a broom when he saw the color of kims face and that kims cheeks were involuntarily billowing outward jed took a cautionary step backward while hastily pointing off to the side kim retched but managed to slap a hand to his face he followed jeds pointing finger and saw a door with a crudely painted sign that read gents kim made a beeline for the bathroom he yanked open the door and dashed to the sink leaning forward on the cold porcelain he convulsively vomited up the breakfast hed shared with tracy that morning when the retching finally stopped he rinsed out the sink and raised his head to look at himself in the cracked dirty mirror he was paler than hed ever remembered emphasized by his reddened congested eyes beads of perspiration rimmed his forehead supporting his torso against the sink he fumbled with the earphone that he had coiled beneath his shirt with trembling fingers he plucked out one of the earplugs jed had given him and pushed in the earphone tracy are you there kim questioned with a raspy voice ive got my earphone in you can talk what happened tracy asked was that you coughing it was more than coughing kim admitted i just lost my breakfast you sound terrible tracy said are you all right im not great kim admitted im embarrassed at my reaction with all my medical training i didnt think id react quite so viscerally this place is well its indescribable he looked around the room which was the filthiest mens room hed ever been in the walls were covered with stains and smutty graffiti mostly in spanish the tiled floor looked like it had never been mopped and was covered with a film of blood and other debris tracked in from the kill floor you want to call it quits tracy asked i cant say id mind not yet kim said but ill tell you i was only out on the kill floor for twenty seconds and i think ive become an instant vegetarian the sudden sound of a flushing toilet in one of the two stalls lining the side of the mens room made kim jump hed not bothered to check if either of the toilets was occupied he yanked out the earphone tucked it and its wire back under his shirt and turned to the sink to pretend he was washing behind him he heard the stall door bang open kim worried what the stranger had heard and for the moment he didnt look in the mans direction in the mirror he saw the man pass slowly behind him studying him quizzically and kims heart leaped up into his throat it was the man whod attacked him first there at higgins and hancock and then again in his own home slowly kim turned around the man had proceeded to the door but hadnt opened it he was still staring at kim inscrutably for an instant kim locked eyes with the stranger kim tried to smile as he pretended to look for paper towels there was a dispenser but its front was ripped away and its interior was empty kim hazarded another glance at the stranger his enigmatic expression had not changed kims right hand sought the comfort of the gun in his pocket seconds seemed like minutes to kim the mans cold black impenetrable eyes remained riveted on him the man was like a statue it took all of kims selfcontrol not to say something to break the uncomfortable silence to kims utter relief the man suddenly broke off the confrontation pushed open the door and disappeared kim exhaled hed not even been aware that hed been holding his breath bending his head down he whispered into his concealed microphone good lord the knifewielding madman was in one of the toilet stalls i dont know what he heard he stared at me but didnt say anything lets hope to hell he didnt recognize me after splashing some cold water on his face and replacing the earplug kim took a deep breath and pushed out through the bathroom door to return to the kill floor he tried to breathe shallowly through his mouth to avoid the smell his legs felt a little rubbery just in case the stranger was waiting for him he had a hand in his pocket gripping the snubnosed pistol jed was standing close by obviously waiting for kim kim looked for the stranger and he thought he caught sight of him off to the side just disappearing around the edge of a distant piece of machinery you all right jed shouted over the din kim nodded and tried to smile jed gave him a wry smile in return and handed him the longhandled stiffbristled broom you must have had more in your stomach than you thought he said then he patted kim on the back before walking off kim swallowed and shuddered to stave off another wave of nausea he put his head down to avoid looking at the line of headless skinless carcasses moving rapidly in front of him on their way to the cooler grasping the broom in both hands he tried to concentrate on pushing the offal that covered the floor toward one of the many grates i dont know if you can hear me with all this noise kim said with his mouth close to his microphone obviously the guy with the knife works here which when i think about it doesnt surprise me i think i better locate him kim ducked as one of the thousandpluspound steaming carcasses brushed by him by not looking where he was moving hed inadvertently gotten in the way of the overhead conveyer now his white coat had a blood stain just like everyone elses in the vast room kim straightened up and after judging the speed of the carcasses stepped through the line he was intent on following the route taken by the man whod attacked him obviously ive been given the worst job in the place kim commented hoping that tracy could hear him despite the general racket im the lowest of the low but at least it gives me the opportunity to move around its like an assembly line for all the other workers they stay in the same place while the carcasses move kim moved around the monstrous piece of machinery hed seen the stranger disappear behind the floor in this area of the room was relatively clean there was only a small amount of blood that had seeped beneath the equipment to kims left was a wall kim continued forward ahead in a darker area of the room where there were no ceiling fluorescent lights he could see several men working a new sound emerged from the general background noise it was an intermittent percussive sound that made kim think of the kind of air gun used in carpentry to shoot nails kim continued to sweep with his broom although there was little debris on the floor after another twenty feet and rounding another piece of equipment he could see what part of the room he was in ive come to where the live animals enter the building kim said into his microphone theyre funneled into single file when the lead animal comes abreast of an elevated platform a man presses what looks like a jackhammer against the top of its head it sounds like a nail gun it must shoot a bolt into their skulls because i can see brain tissue spatter out kim looked away for a moment as a man whod dedicated his life to saving lives this unabated carnage made him feel weak after a moment he forced himself to look back the cows immediately collapse onto a large rotating drum that throws them forward and upends them kim continued then a worker hooks them behind the achilles tendon and they are hoisted up onto the overhead conveyer if and when we get madcow disease in this country killing the animals like this will not be a good idea its undoubtedly sending emboli of brain tissue throughout the cows body since the cows hearts are still beating despite his revulsion about what he was witnessing kim forced himself to move forward he now had an unobstructed view you know something kim said these hapless steers somehow know whats coming they must smell death in here theyre defecating all over each other as they come down the chute that certainly cant help the contamination kim stopped in midsentence to his right and only twenty feet away was the knifewielding stranger instantly he knew why the man favored knives he was one of two people who stepped beneath the newly killed animal as it was hoisted up with a deft flick of the wrist he or his partner slit the throat of the animal and then jumped free of the tengallon shower of hot cow blood the blood came in giant pulsating squirts as the animals heart pumped out its life force the blood then disappeared into a grate in the floor in the next second kims heart leaped in his chest already tense from seeing his attacker so close he overreacted when someone tapped him on the shoulder before he could stop himself he threw an arm up defensively luckily it was jed and he didnt look happy kims reaction had scared him as much as he had scared kim what the hell are you doing over here jed shouted over the noise the repeated concussion of the highpressure killing instrument sounded like an evil metronome im just trying to get oriented kim yelled he shot a glance back at his attacker but the man either hadnt seen kim or didnt care about him hed stepped off to the side and was in the process of sharpening his knife with a grindstone while his partner took over the throatslitting kim could see the knife clearly it was similar to the one the man had used when hed attacked kim hey im talking to you jed yelled irritably he poked at kim with an insistent finger i want you to get your ass around to where theyre eviscerating thats where the shit is and thats where i want you to be kim nodded come on ill show you jed said he motioned for kim to follow him kim cast one last look at his attacker who was holding up the knife to inspect its razor edge a flash of light glinted off the blade he didnt look in kims direction kim shuddered and rushed after jed they soon came to the moving line of carcasses kim was impressed by jeds nonchalance when he ducked through he actually pushed the bodies aside like clothes on a rack rather than waiting for a moment to dart through an opening kim was reluctant to touch the hot bodies he had to hesitate like a jumper waiting to enter a jump rope that was being rapidly whipped around by two friends this is where i want you jed yelled when kim caught up to him jed made a sweeping motion with his hand heres where the dirty work is done and this is where you and your broom should hang out understand kim nodded reluctantly while fighting against another wave of nausea he was now in the area where the internal organs were being removed huge snakelike coils of intestines were sloshing out of the suspended carcasses onto stainlesssteel tables along with quivering masses of liver grapefruitsized kidneys and friable strips of pancreas most of the intestines appeared to be tied off but some werent either they hadnt been tied or the tie had come loose one way or the other there were also a lot of cow feces on the tables and on the floor mixing with the rivers of blood kim lowered the head of his broom to the floor and started pushing the slop toward one of the many grates as he worked he was reminded of the myth of sisyphus and the cruel kings terrible fate no sooner had kim cleared an area of its filth than it became refouled with a fresh deluge of blood and offal kims only solace was the fact that his disguise must have been adequate he was relatively confident that the man with the knife had not recognized him kim tried his best to ignore the more grisly aspects of this ghostly workplace instead he concentrated on his immediate task at hand for the next step in his undercover investigation hed wait until the lunch break at the window shanahan could see a jumbo jet laboriously lumber down the runway and then ever so hesitantly lift its nose seemingly going much too slowly it became airborne and headed off toward a distant destination shanahan was at gate thirtytwo on concourse b waiting for the flight from chicago it had not been easy getting there the people at security had tried to deny him access to the concourse without a ticket since hed made specific plans to meet leutmann at the gate shanahan knew he had to get there unfortunately no amount of arguing or cajoling had swayed the security people to solve the dilemma shanahan had had to purchase a ticket on a flight he didnt intend to take shanahan and derek had never met to overcome that difficulty shanahan had described himself so that derek might recognize him but to make certain derek would identify him shanahan had also said hed carry a bible derek had said hed thought a bible was a nice touch he added that hed be carrying a black briefcase the door to the jetway for the chicago flight opened and was secured by an agent almost immediately the passengers began disembarking shanahan picked up the bible and stood he gazed at each passenger expectantly the tenth person looked promising although the individuals appearance was not anything like shanahan had expected the man was thirtyish slender blond and deeply tanned he was dressed in a pinstriped business suit and carried a black ostrich briefcase sunglasses were perched on top of his carefully coiffed head the man halted just inside the terminal and swept the area with his blue eyes sporting shanahan he walked directly over mr obrian derek questioned he had a slight english accent mr leutmann shanahan said he was taken aback from dereks phone voice hed expected a dark heavyset physically imposing individual the man in front of him resembled an english aristocrat more than a hired killer i trust you brought the money derek said of course shanahan said would you mind handing it over derek said here in the terminal shanahan questioned he looked over his shoulder nervously shanahan had hoped to discuss the money issue in the privacy of his car in the parking garage he was supposed to try to negotiate down both the down payment and the fee either were in business or not derek said its best to find out immediately to avoid hard feelings shanahan removed the envelope he had in his inner jacket pocket and gave it to derek it contained five thousand dollars half of the ten k the killer had demanded there was no way shanahan was going to try to bargain in public to shanahans horror derek put down his briefcase blithely tore open the envelope and counted the money shanahan anxiously looked around although no one appeared to be paying them any attention shanahan was acutely uncomfortable excellent derek commented before pocketing the cash were in business what are the details you are supposed to provide me could we at least start walking shanahan managed to say despite a dry throat dereks nonchalance was unnerving of course derek said he gestured down the concourse why dont we proceed to baggage claim thankful to at least be moving shanahan started out derek stayed abreast treading lightly on crepesoled loafers you have checked baggage shanahan asked it was something else he didnt expect of course derek said the airlines frown on firearms in the cabin in my line of work one has little choice they were walking along with a stream of other arriving passengers to their left passed an equal number of people clutching tickets and hurrying in the opposite direction there was no privacy we have a car for you shanahan said excellent derek said but at the moment im more interested in the identity of the quarry whats the name reggis shanahan said dr kim reggis once again he scanned the faces around them thankfully there were no signs of interest or recognition heres a recent photo shanahan said he handed the picture to derek it wasnt very good it had been copied from a newspaper article this is quite grainy derek said im going to need more information ive put together a bio shanahan said he handed the paper to derek youll notice it has a physical description of the man theres also the year model and type of his car along with the tag number you have his address but we have reason to believe hes not staying there at the moment this is more like it derek said as he scanned the sheet yes indeed very complete we believe dr reggis spent last night at his former wifes residence shanahan said she bailed him out of jail yesterday morning jail derek questioned sounds like the doctor has been misbehaving thats an understatement as far as we are concerned shanahan said they reached the baggage carousel and pressed in among the other passengers the baggage from dereks flight was just beginning to appear theres one thing that i think you ought to know shanahan said there was a botched attempt on the doctors life last night thank you for your forthrightness derek said that is indeed an important point what you mean to say of course is that the man will be highly vigilant something like that shanahan said a shrill beeping sound made the tense shanahan jump it took him a moment to realize it was his pager surprised at being paged since bobby bo knew where he was and what he was doing shanahan snapped the pager off his belt and glanced at the small lcd screen he was further confused because he didnt recognize the number would you mind if i used a phone shanahan said he pointed to a bank of pay phones lining a nearby wall not at all derek said he was contentedly studying the information sheet on kim finding a few coins in his pocket en route to the phone shanahan quickly dialed the mysterious number the phone was picked up on the first ring it was carlos the doctor is here carlos said in an excited forced whisper where the hell are you talking about shanahan asked here at higgins and hancock carlos said keeping his voice low im using the phone in the lunchroom this has to be fast the doctor is working here as a slop boy he looks crazy man what are you talking about shanahan asked he looks weird carlos said he looks like an old rock singer his hairs cut short and whats left is blond youre joking shanahan said no man carlos insisted hes also got stitches on his face where i cut him its him i know it is although i had to look at him for a couple of minutes before i was sure then he came all the way around to my station and stood there for a couple of minutes until the boss came and dragged him away what boss shanahan asked jed street carlos said did the doctor recognize you shanahan asked sure why not carlos said he was staring at me for a minute i was thinking he might come after me but he didnt if he had i would have done him in you want me to do it anyway i can get him while hes here no shanahan shouted losing control of himself for a moment he knew that if carlos killed kim in the middle of the day with a hundred witnesses it would be a disaster shanahan took a deep breath and then spoke quietly and slowly dont do anything pretend you dont recognize him just stay cool ill get word to you understand i want to do this guy carlos said i told you i dont want the money thats very generous of you shanahan said of course you were the one who screwed up to begin with but thats not the point at the moment ill get word to you okay okay carlos said shanahan hung up the phone he kept his hand on the receiver while he looked over at derek leutmann this was a quandary for the moment he didnt know what to do an unexpected tapping on the driversside window made tracy s heart skip a beat during the time that shed been parked at the end of the slaughterhouse shed seen occasional people coming and going from their vehicles but no one had come near her car hastily tracy pulled off the stereo headphones and turned to look out the window standing next to the car was a grisly man clad in soiled overalls and a dirty turtleneck on his head was a baseball hat turned backwards glued to his lower lip was an unlit cigarette that bobbed up and down as he breathed through his open mouth tracy s first impulse was to start the car and drive away that idea was abandoned when she remembered the antenna teetering on the roof feeling she had little choice she cracked the window i saw you from my truck the man said he pointed over his shoulder at a neighboring van oh really tracy responded anxiously she didnt know what else to say the man had a vivid scar that ran down the side of his face onto his neck whatcha listening to the man asked not much tracy said she looked over at the tape recorder it was still rolling just some music i like country music the man said you listening to country music no tracy said with a weak smile this is more new age actually im waiting for my husband hes working here ive been doing some plumbing work here myself the man said they got more drains and pipes here than anyplace in the county anyhow i was wondering if youve got a light i cant find my lighter noplace sorry tracy said i wish i could help you but i dont smoke and i dont have any matches thanks anyway the man said sorry to bother you no bother tracy said the man walked away and tracy breathed a sigh of relief she rolled up the window the episode made her realize how tense she was shed been on edge from the moment kim had disappeared inside but her anxieties had skyrocketed ever since kims confrontation with the killer in the bathroom the fact that shed not been able to talk to kim didnt help she truly wanted to tell him to get out of there it just wasnt worth it after a furtive glance around to make sure no one else was watching her tracy slipped the stereo headphones back on and closed her eyes the problem was she had to concentrate to hear what kim was saying the general din inside the plant had forced her to turn the volume down quite low kim had moved all the way around the eviscerating area and now had a view of the whole slaughtering process he could see the cows being killed hoisted up and their throats being slit next they were skinned and decapitated with the heads going off on a separate overhead conveyer system after the evisceration the carcasses were sawed in half lengthwise by a frightful saw far beyond the gruesome conceptions of hollywood horror movie producers kim glanced at his watch to time the rapidity with which the wretched animals were killed he was astonished with his chin down on his chest he spoke into his microphone lets hope lee cook can come up with an appropriate video system he said its going to be a snap to document marshas major point she said the problem concerning contamination in the meat industry was in the slaughterhouse she said it was simply profit over safety i just timed the activity here theyre slaughtering the cattle at the unbelievable rate of one every twelve seconds at that speed theres no way to avoid gross contamination and talk about collusion between the usda and the industry its even evident on this operational level up on the catwalks there are a few inspectors they stand out like black sheep they wear red hard hats instead of yellow and their white coats are comparatively clean but theyre doing more laughing and joking with the workers than inspecting i mean the inspecting is pure sham not only is the line moving too fast these guys are hardly even looking at the carcasses as they whip by kim suddenly caught sight of jed street nosing around the eviscerating tables and sinks kim recommenced his sweeping with his push broom he moved away from jed in a counterclockwise direction and soon found himself in the decapitation area the beheading was done by another saw only slightly less appalling than the saw used to cut the carcasses in two just before the spine was completely severed by the man wielding the saw another man caught the hundredpluspound head with a hook dangling from the head conveyer rail it was a process that required coordination and teamwork continuing his cleaning efforts kim followed the line of the skinned heads with their lids gone the lifeless eyes gave the heads a curiously surprised look as they clanked along kim followed the head conveyer to a point where it disappeared through an aperture into an adjoining room kim immediately recognized the room as the place where hed been attacked saturday night glancing over his shoulder he looked for jed when he didnt see him in the pandemonium kim took a chance that jed wouldnt miss him and walked through the doorless opening into the headboning room ive come into the room where the heads go kim said into his microphone this is potentially important in how becky happened to get sick marsha had found something in the paperwork about the head of the last animal on the day the meat for beckys hamburger might have been slaughtered she said it was revolting which i now find curious since i find the whole process revolting kim watched for a moment as the head conveyer dumped a head every twelve seconds onto a table where it was attacked by a team of butchers knives similar to the ones used to slit the animals throats quickly cut out the huge cheek muscles and the tongues the workers took this meat and tossed it into a twothousandpound combo bin similar to those kim had seen at mercer meats im learning something every minute kim said there must be a lot of cow cheeks in hamburger kim noticed that after the cheeks and tongues were removed the cow heads were pushed onto a flat conveyer belt that dumped them ignominiously into a black hole that presumably led to the basement i think i might have to visit the basement kim said reluctantly he had the sense that his childhood fear of basements would be put to the test so far it had been a good day as far as jed street was concerned despite its being monday hed had a great breakfast that morning had gotten to work early enough to sit and have a second cup of coffee with several of the other supervisors and had had to face fewer absenteeisms than usual finding and keeping decent help was jeds biggest headache with none of his key day employees having called in sick jed was confident that his team would have processed close to two thousand head by the lunch break that made jed happy because he knew it would make his immediate boss lenny striker happy jed slipped out of his white coat and hung it up wanting to catch up on his paperwork hed retreated to his office with his third cup of coffee of the day he walked around his desk and sat down pen in hand he went to work he had a considerable number of forms that had to be filled out each and every day jed hadnt been working long when his phone rang he reached for his coffee before picking up the receiver he was relatively unconcerned about getting a call so late in the morning and could not imagine it would be particularly serious at the same time he knew there was always a chance being in charge of something as potentially dangerous as a kill floor he knew that disaster was never far away hello jed said overemphasizing the first syllable he took a sip of coffee jed street this is daryl webster do you have a moment to speak with me jed spat out his coffee then scrambled to wipe the brew off his forms of course mr webster jed sputtered hed worked for higgins and hancock for fourteen years and during that time the real boss had never called him i got a call from one of bobby bos people daryl explained he told me that weve employed a new slop boy just today thats correct jed said he felt his face heat up hiring illegal aliens was tacitly condoned while the official policy was that it was forbidden jed hoped to god he wasnt going to end up being a scapegoat whats this mans name daryl asked jed frantically searched through the papers on his desk hed written the name down although not on any employment forms he breathed a sigh of relief when he found it josé ramerez sir jed said did he show you any identification daryl asked not that i recall jed said evasively what did he look like he is a little strangelooking jed said jed was confused he couldnt fathom what difference it made what the man looked like could you give me an idea daryl asked kind of punk jed said trying to think how his fourteenyearold son would describe the man bleached hair earring tattoos leather pants is he a fairly big guy daryl asked yeah over six feet for sure and he has some stitches on his face yeah he did jed said how did you know that sir did he say where he was living daryl asked no and i didnt ask jed said i have to say hes been quite appreciative of getting the work hes even agreed to work a shift and a half you mean hes working tonight daryl asked as part of the cleanup crew yup jed said we had someone call in sick just this morning thats good daryl said thats very good good job jed thank you sir jed said is there something youd like me to do or to say to mr ramerez no nothing at all daryl said in fact keep this conversation of ours confidential can i count on you for that absolutely sir jed said jed recoiled when he heard the line disconnected it had been so precipitous he looked quizzically at the phone for a second before hanging up not wanting to be caught in the headboning room where there was nothing to sweep kim had retreated back to the main kill floor he still had no clue as to what marsha was talking about when she mentioned that last head now that hed followed the trail through most of the plant the only unknown was what happened to the heads after disappearing down the black hole kim went back to the evisceration area and reswept parts of the floor hed already cleaned several times the frustrating part was that in certain areas it only took about fifteen minutes to look like hed never been there despite his earplugs he suddenly could hear a sustained raucous buzz he straightened up from his work and looked around he immediately saw that the cattle had been halted in the chute no more animals were being killed the pitiable cows close to the executioner had been given a momentary reprieve the executioner had put aside his tool and was in the process of coiling the highpressure hose the animals that had already been killed advanced through the line until the final one had been eviscerated at that point the line was stopped and the tremendous din was replaced by an eerie silence it took kim a few moments to realize that part of the silence was due to his earplugs when he took them out he heard the noises of the power tools being stowed and a buzz of animated conversation workers started swinging down from the catwalks while others used stairs and ladders kim stopped one of the workers and asked him what was going on no speak english the worker said before hurrying off kim stopped another do you speak english he asked a little the man said whats happening kim asked lunch break the man said before hurrying after the first kim watched as the hundred or so workers streamed from the catwalks and lined up to pass through the fire door they were en route to the lunchroom and the locker area an equal number of employees came from the main boning room via the headboning room despite the pall of death and the stench the camaraderie was evident there was much laughter and friendly jostling how anyone could eat is beyond me kim said into his microphone kim saw the man whod attacked him along with his partner they walked by without a glance to join the everlengthening queue kim felt even more confident about his disguise kim stopped one of the eviscerators whose damp white coat had become variegated with shades of pink and red he asked the man how to get to the basement in return kim got a look that suggested he was crazy do you speak english kim inquired sure man i speak english the eviscerator said i want to go below kim said how do i get there you dont want to go downstairs the man said but if you did youd go through that door he pointed to an unmarked door with an automatic closer mounted on its upper edge kim continued sweeping until the last worker had passed through the fire door after all the noise and chaotic activity when the line was in operation it was strange for kim to be alone with forty or fifty suspended steaming carcasses for the first time since kim had arrived the floor around the evisceration area was free of gore putting his broom aside kim walked over to the unmarked door the man had pointed out after a quick glance over his shoulder to make sure he wasnt being observed he pulled the door open and stepped inside the door closed quickly behind him the first thing that kim was aware of was the smell it was ten times worse than the kill floor which had sickened him so quickly earlier what made it so awful was the added stench of putrefaction although he retched a few times he didnt vomit he assumed it was because his stomach was empty kim was standing on a landing above a flight of cement stairs that descended into utter blackness over his head was a single bare lightbulb on the wall behind him was a fire extinguisher and an industrialsized emergency flashlight kim yanked the flashlight from its brackets and turned it on he aimed the concentrated beam down the stairs revealing a long flight descending to a deep cellar the walls were stained with large rorschachlike blotches in brown the distant floor looked smooth and black like a pool of crude oil kim got one hand free from his rubber glove and located his earphone after removing his earplug he slipped it into his ear can you hear me trace kim said if you can say something i just put in my earphone its about time tracy said irritably her voice was loud and clear despite kims being surrounded by reinforced concrete walls i want you to come out here immediately whoa kim said what are you all wound up about youre in this slaughterhouse with someone who has tried to kill you twice tracy said this is ridiculous i want you to give up this madness ive got a little more investigating to do kim said besides the knife guy hasnt recognized me so calm down where are you tracy asked why havent you put your earphone in until now its been driving me crazy not to be able to talk to you kim started down the stairs i cant risk the earphones except when im alone he said as to where i am at the moment im heading down into the basement which i have to admit is no picnic its like descending into the lower circles of hell theres no way i could describe the smell i dont think you should go into the basement tracy said i like being able to talk with you but its safer if you stay in a group besides youre probably not supposed to be in there and if someone catches you therell surely be trouble everybodys at lunch kim said being caught down here is not my worry breathing through his mouth to help avoid the stench kim reached the bottom of the stairs he shined the flashlight beam around the vast pitchblack space it was a warren of vats and dumpsterlike containers each was connected with a duct that led upward through the ceiling to catch the blood unwanted guts and discarded bones and skulls this is where they store everything until it gets trucked to the rendering plant kim said obviously from the odor its all in various stages of decay theres no refrigeration down here although its hard to imagine as bad as it smells now it must be worse in the summertime it sounds disgusting tracy said its hard to believe that waste like that would have any use the renderer turns it into fertilizer kim said and disgustingly enough cattle feed the industry has forced our unwitting cattle into becoming cannibals uhoh kim mumbled as he felt a shiver descend his spine whats the matter tracy demanded anxiously i just heard a noise kim said then get yourself out of there tracy said anxiously kim shined his light in the direction of the noise in a fashion strikingly similar to the episode in his own basement the night before a number of pairs of diabolically ruby eyes stared back at him a second later the eyes disappeared and kim caught sight of a group of animals the size of house cats scampering off unlike the night before they werent mice its okay kim said its just some monster rats oh thats all tracy said sarcastically just a group of friendly monster rats kim stepped out onto the cellar floor and discovered that not only did the floor surface look like crude oil it had approximately the same consistency his boots made a rude sucking sound each time he picked up his feet this is certainly a nightmare image of postindustrialization kim commented cut the philosophizing tracy snapped come on kim get out of there what on earth are you doing down there anyway i want to find the chute for the heads kim said he slogged forward among the tanks and vats trying to estimate where the headboning room lay above he came to a concrete block wall which he assumed was contiguous with the wall above that meant the chute he was looking for would be on the other side kim shined his light along the wall until he located an opening walking down to it he ducked through he shined his light around this second space it was smaller than the first and cleaner it also had what hed guessed to his immediate right was a chute connected to a particularly large dumpster this looks promising kim said i think i found it its about the size of a construction dumpster with the flashlight beam he followed the chute up to where it penetrated the ceiling he estimated the diameter of the chute to be about the same as the aperture hed remembered above okay wonderful tracy said now come out of there in a second kim said im going to see if i can look inside kim stepped over to the rusted filthy dumpsterlike container in this area of the basement there was no sucking sound as he walked around the side of the container near where the chute was attached was a small metal platform accessible by four steps kim climbed up he could now see the top of the dumpster right in front of him was a hatch secured with a metal latch he moved the latch to the side but then couldnt open the hatch at least not with one hand putting the flashlight between his knees he got both hands under the edge of the hatch with a squeak it lifted holding it with his left hand he raised the flashlight with his right and shined it inside it was not a pretty image the container was almost brimming with rotting skinned cattle heads in contrast with the newly slaughtered bloody heads upstairs here the eyes were shriveled and the attached shards of gristle were black in many of the heads the gaping hole made by the air gun was plainly visible disgusted by the view as well as the smell kim was about to lower the hatch into place when an involuntary cry of horror escaped from his lips the flashlight beam had found a particularly gruesome sight partially buried by a subsequent avalanche of fresh cow skulls was marshas severed head the shock caused kim to let go of the heavy hatch and it slammed shut with a deafening crash in the confined space the booming sound echoed repeatedly off distant unseen concrete walls what happened tracy demanded frantically before kim could respond a horrid screeching noise tortured both kims and tracys ears the crashing hatch had activated some automatic machinery kim snatched up the light and shone it in the direction of the dreadful noise he saw a rusted steel overhead door rising kim could hear tracy repeatedly demand to be told what was going on hut he couldnt answer her he truly didnt know behind the rising door was a filthy forklift vehicle that suddenly came to life like a horrible futuristic mechanical creature red lights on its front began to flash washing the room with the color of blood as soon as the overhead door reached its apogee the driverless vehicle began to give off highpitched intermittent beeps as it rolled forward in a thunderous jerky fashion terrified of the imminent collision kim leapt from the platform and pressed himself against the wall the forklift crashed into the dumpster causing a boom even louder than the sound of the slamming hatch the dumpster shuddered and then raised as the forklift backed up the chute connecting the container with the headboning room above became detached when the dumpster was completely free from the space a second empty dumpster waiting next to the first slid into place with another thunderous crash the chute automatically snapped into place the forklift stopped pivoted then rumbled off into the inky blackness kim i dont know if you can hear me or not tracy shouted but im coming in no kim cried into his microphone im okay i inadvertently activated some automatic removal equipment im coming out so dont come in you mean youre coming out here to the car tracy asked hopefully yes kim said i need a breather it wasnt that derek leutmann didnt trust shanahan obrian but he knew there was more to this aggravating story than hed been told besides derek had a set methodology in his work killing people was a business in which one could not be too careful rather than going directly to kims former wifes house as shanahan had initially suggested derek went to kims he wanted to test the reliability of shanahans information as well as learn more about his supposed quarry derek drove into balmoral estates and directly to kims property without hesitation he knew from experience that such behavior was far less suspicious than cruising the neighborhood derek parked in the driveway in front of the garage he opened his metal zero halliburton valise that was resting on the passenger seat next to him reaching in he pulled out a ninemillimeter automatic from its customcut pocket in styrofoam with trained ease he attached a silencer and then slipped the gun into the right pocket of his camelhair coat the pocket had been altered to accommodate the long weapon derek got out of the car holding his ostrich briefcase he took a quick peek into the garage it was empty then he strode up the front walk appearing for all the world like a successful businessman or an elegant insurance adjuster he rang the bell only then did he glance around at the neighborhood from kims porch he could see only two other houses both appeared unoccupied at that moment he rang the bell again when no one answered he tried the door he was surprised but pleased to find it unlocked had it not been it wouldnt have made much difference derek had the tools and the expertise to handle most locks without a moments hesitation derek entered the house and closed the door behind himself he stood for a moment listening there wasnt a sound still carrying his briefcase derek made a rapid silent tour of the first floor he noticed some dirty dishes in the sink they looked as though theyd been sitting awhile climbing up to the second floor derek saw the splintered door leading into the master bath he took in the broken console table stepping into the bath he felt the towels it was clear that none had been recently used so at least that much of shanahans information seemed accurate in the walkin closet in the master bedroom he glanced down at all the clothes littering the floor he couldnt help but wonder exactly what had gone on during the botched hit that shanahan had mentioned back down on the first floor derek entered the study and sat down at kims desk without removing his gloves he began to go through some of the correspondence to see what he could learn about the man he had been brought all the way from chicago to kill tracy had backed up so that she could see along the front of higgins and hancock shed thought about driving back to the entrance but was afraid to do so because she and kim had not discussed where shed be when he came out she was afraid kim might come out one of the other doors and then be searching for her but she soon saw him emerge from the front door and jog in her direction he was dressed in a white coat and had a yellow plastic construction helmet on his head he ran up to the car and after glancing back over his shoulder he climbed into the backseat youre paler than ive ever seen you tracy said she was turned around in her seat as much as the steering wheel would allow but i guess the blond hair emphasizes it ive just seen one of the worst things in my life what tracy asked with alarm marsha baldwins head kim said its probably all thats left of her along with a few bones as disgusting as it sounds im afraid most of her must have gone for hamburger oh god tracy murmured her eyes locked with kims she saw tears appear and it made her respond in kind first becky and now this kim managed i feel so damn responsible because of me one tragedy had to lead to another i can understand how you feel tracy offered but as ive already said marsha was doing what she wanted to do what she thought was right it doesnt justify her death but its not your fault tracy reached out toward kim he took her hand and squeezed it for a few moments a wordless but powerful communication passed between the two people tracy sighed shook her head in despair then took her hand back she twisted around in the seat and started the engine before kim had gotten to the car shed already hauled in the antenna one thing is for sure tracy said while putting the car into gear were getting out of here no kim said he reached forward and put a restraining hand on her shoulder ive got to go back im going to see this to the end now its for both becky and marsha kim this now involves proven murder tracy said evenly its time for the police its only one murder kim said and one murder pales against the murder of up to five hundred kids a year that this industry is guilty of in the name of increased profit responsibility for the children might be hard to prove in court tracy said but finding the head of a person makes a startlingly clear case i found the head but i dont know where it is now kim said it was in with the cow heads but when i slammed the cover i activated the system to take them away its on its way to the renderer so thered be no corpus delicti even if we wanted to blow the whistle on marshas death obviously my word at the moment means nothing to the police they can start their own investigation tracy said maybe theyll find other bones even if they did kim said the issue here is not to prosecute one lowlevel thug like the guy who tried to kill me its the industry i want to do something about tracy sighed again and turned off the engine but why go back now youve accomplished what you set out to do youve learned that it will be easy to document how the meat gets contaminated tracy tapped the tape recorder this tape alone might be almost as good as a video i can tell you its powerful stuff the way you described whats going on in there im sure kelly anderson will jump on it i want to go back mainly because ill be working the threetoeleven cleanup as you heard kim said im hoping that sometime during that shift i can get into the record room marsha found what she called a deficiency report that involved the head of a sick animal she said she was putting it back into the file and i heard her do it i want to find that paper tracy shook her head in frustration youre taking too much of a risk she said if kelly anderson gets on the case let her find the deficiency report i dont think im taking any risk at this point kim said the guy with the knife looked me right in the eye in the mens room if i were to be recognized that would have been the moment in fact i dont even want this gun anymore kim struggled to get the pistol out of his pants pocket he handed it to tracy at least keep the gun tracy said kim shook his head no i dont want it please tracy said tracy im carrying enough stuff with these battery packs kim said and i think having it is more of a risk than a comfort reluctantly tracy took the gun and put it down on the car floor i cant talk you out of going back in there i want to follow this through kim said its the least i can do i hope you understand that sitting here while you are taking all this risk is driving me crazy i can understand kim said why dont you go home and just come back for me at eleven oh no tracy said that would be worse at least this way i can hear whats going on okay kim said its your call but id better get back the lunch break is almost over kim got his legs out of the car before leaning back inside can i ask you to do something sometime this afternoon he said of course tracy said as long as i dont have to leave the car would you call sherring labs with your cell phone kim asked ask about the results on the meat i dropped off they should be ready about now fine tracy said kim gave her shoulder a squeeze thanks he said before climbing out he closed the door waved and walked away derek leutmann slowed down as he neared tracy s house the numbers on some of the neighboring houses were not very apparent and he did not want to drive by as the house came into view he saw the mercedes parked at the head of the drive not wishing to block it derek did a uturn and parked across the street taking out the information sheet given to him by shanahan derek checked the license number of the mercedes his suspicions were substantiated it was the doctors car after going through the same preparations as hed done outside of kims house derek emerged into the light rain that had begun to fall he snapped open a small collapsible umbrella before taking out his briefcase with the briefcase in one hand and the umbrella in the other he crossed the street and glanced into the car he was surprised to see it there thinking that it should have been with kim at his office of course that suggested kim was not at his office derek knew a lot more about kim now than he did earlier he knew that he was a cardiac surgeon who was extremely well regarded he knew that he was divorced and was paying considerable alimony and child support what he didnt know was why obrian and his boss in the cattle business wanted the man dead derek had asked shanahan that very question and had gotten a vague answer derek never wanted to know the details of any of his clients dealings with a potential mark but he wanted to know the generalities it was another way of reducing risk not only during the hit but after hed tried to press shanahan but to no avail all he was told was that it involved business the curious thing was that derek had found no connection between the doctor and cattle or beef and derek had found a lot of information in the doctors desk most of dereks work stemmed from problems involving money in some form or fashion with competition gambling divorce and unpaid loans leading the list most of the people were scum whether they were clients or marks and derek liked it that way this case seemed significantly different and a sense of curiosity was added to dereks other strong emotions what derek disliked the most was to be underestimated and taken advantage of hed not gotten into the business in the usual way via mob association hed been a mercenary in africa back in the days when there had been good guys and bad guys before any of the national armies had had any training derek climbed the steps to the porch and rang the bell with kims car in the drive he expected an answer but there wasnt any derek rang again he turned and surveyed the neighborhood it was quite different from kims from where derek was standing he had a good view of five houses and a reasonable view of four more but there was not a lot of activity the only person he saw was a woman pushing a stroller and she was heading away from him despite a painstaking search of kims correspondence and records derek had failed to come up with any evidence suggesting the doctor had a gambling problem so derek reasoned that gambling couldnt have been the stimulus for shanahans offering him the contract divorce was out because the former wife had gotten a good settlement besides she and the doctor were apparently getting along fine otherwise she certainly wouldnt have bailed him out of jail as shanahan reported a loan seemed equally unlikely since there had been no indication in kims records that he needed money and even if he had why would he borrow from a cattleman that left competition but that was the most unlikely of all kim didnt even own any stock in the beef industry except for a few shares in a fastfood hamburger chain it was indeed a mystery derek turned around and examined the door it was secured with a standard throwbolt and lock a mere inconvenience given his experience the question was whether there was an alarm putting down his briefcase derek cupped his hands to peer through the sidelight he saw no keypad taking out his locksmith tools from his left pocket he made quick work of the locks the door opened and swung inside he looked along the inside of the jamb there were no contacts stepping within the small foyer he looked for a keypad on the portion of the walls that hed not been able to see from the porch there was none then he glanced up around the cornice for motion detectors he relaxed there was no alarm derek retrieved his briefcase before closing the door he made a rapid tour of the first floor before climbing to the second in the guestroom he found a small overnight bag with a shaving kit and clothes he guessed belonged to kim in the only bathroom he found several sets of damp towels derek went back downstairs and made himself comfortable in the living room with kims car in the driveway and his things in the guestroom derek knew that the doctor would be back it was only a matter of waiting carlos butted the unsuspecting adolpho out of the way and got his time card into the time clock before his partner it was an ongoing joke theyd been playing for months ill get you next time adolpho joked he made a point of speaking in english because carlos had told him he wanted to learn to speak better yeah over my dead body carlos replied it was one of his favorite new phrases it had been adolpho whod gotten carlos to come to higgins and hancock and then helped him bring his family adolpho and carlos had known each other since they were kids back in mexico adolpho had come to the united states several years before carlos the two friends emerged into the afternoon rain arminarm along with an army of other workers they headed for their vehicles you want to meet tonight at el toro adolpho questioned sure carlos said bring a lot of pesos adolpho advised youre going to lose a lot of money he mimed using a cue stick to shoot pool it will never happen carlos said slapping his partner on the back it was at that moment that carlos saw the black cherokee with its darkly tinted windows the vehicle was next to his own and fumes were rising languidly from its exhaust pipe carlos gave adolpho a final pat on the back he watched his partner get into his truck before carlos headed for his own carlos took his time and waved to adolpho as he drove by at that point he detoured toward the cherokee and approached the driversside window the window went down shanahan smiled i got some good news he said come around and get in carlos did as he was told he shut the door behind him youre going to have another chance to do the doctor shanahan said im very happy carlos said he smiled too when tonight shanahan said the doctor is working here i told you carlos said i knew it was him theres been a bit of luck shanahan said with a nod and best of all hes working the cleanup tonight it will be arranged that he will clean the mens room next to the record room do you know where that is i dont ive never been in higgins and hancock yeah i know where it is carlos said were not supposed to use that room well tonight you will shanahan said with a wry smile it will be late probably after ten make sure youre there ill be there carlos promised it should be easy shanahan said youll be dealing with an unarmed unsuspecting person in a small room just make sure the body disappears like marsha baldwin i do what you say carlos said just dont screw up this time shanahan said ive gone out on a limb for you and i dont want to be embarrassed again no problem carlos said with emphasis tonight i keeelll him seventeen monday night january th straightening up with a groan kim stretched his back abandoning his heavy woodenhandled mop he put his hands on his hips to get maximum extension kim was by himself mopping the front hall starting from the reception area hed had his earphone in for the last ten minutes complaining to tracy how exhausted he was tracy was sympathetic the cleaning had been extensive the whole crew had started with highpressure steam hoses on the kill floor it was backbreaking work since the hoses weighed several hundred pounds and had to be hauled up onto the catwalks after the kill floor they had moved into the boning rooms cleaning them had taken the rest of the shift up until the dinner break at six at that time kim had gone back out to the car and even had had the stomach for some of the lunch he and tracy had packed that morning after the dinner break kim had been sent out on his own on various jobs around the plant as the others had slowed down hed volunteered to mop the front hall im never going to complain about surgery being hard work again he said into his microphone after all this experience ill hire you to do my house tracy quipped do you do windows what time is it kim asked he was in no mood for humor its a little after ten tracy said less than an hour to go are you going to make it ill make it all right kim said i havent seen any of my cleaning colleagues for the last hour its time for the record room be quick tracy urged your being in there is going to make me anxious all over again and i dont think i can take too much more kim stuck the heavyduty mop into his bucket and pushed the contraption down the hall to the record room door its broken central panel was covered by a piece of thin plywood kim tried the door it opened with ease he reached in and turned on the light except for a larger sheet of the same plywood over the sashless window facing the parking lot the room looked entirely normal the broken glass and the rock hed tossed in had all been taken away the left side of the room had a long line of file cabinets at random kim yanked out the nearest drawer it was jammed full of files so tightly that not another sheet of paper could have been added gosh kim said they sure do have a lot of paperwork this isnt going to be as easy as id hoped the end of an el producto cigar burned brightly for a few moments and then faded elmer conrad held the resulting smoke in his mouth for a few pleasurable moments and then blew it contentedly at the ceiling elmer was the threetoeleven cleaning crew supervisor hed held the job for eight years his idea of work was to sweat like crazy for the first half of the shift and then coast at that moment he was in the coasting mode watching a sony watchman in the lunchroom with his feet up on a table you wanted to see me boss harry pearlmuter asked poking his head into the lunchroom from the back hall harry was one of elmers underlings yeah elmer said wheres that queerlooking temp guy i think hes out in the front hall mopping harry said at least thats what he said he was going to do do you think he cleaned those two bathrooms out there elmer asked i wouldnt know harry said you want me to check elmer let his heavy feet fall to the floor with a thump he pushed himself up to his full height he was over sixfeetfive and weighed two hundred forty pounds thanks but ill do it myself elmer said i told him twice he had to clean those heads before eleven if he hasnt done them he will hes not leaving here until theyre done elmer put down his cigar took a swig of coffee and set out to find kim what was motivating him was that hed received specific instructions from the front office that kim was to clean the bathrooms in question and he was to clean them alone elmer had no idea why hed gotten such an order but he didnt care all he cared about was that it was carried out this isnt going to be so hard after all kim said into his microphone i found a whole drawer of process deficiency reports they go from nineteen eightyeight to the present now all i have to do is find january ninth hurry up kim tracy said im starting to get nervous again relax trace kim said i told you i havent seen a soul in an hour i think theyre all back in the lunchroom watching a ball game ah here we are january ninth hmmm the folders jammed full kim pulled a clutch of papers from the folder he turned around and put them down on the library table pay dirt kim said happily its the whole group of papers marsha talked about kim spread the papers out so that he could see them all heres the purchase invoice from bart winslow for what must have been a sick cow kim glanced through the other papers finally picking one up heres what im looking for its a process deficiency report on the same cow what does it say tracy asked im reading it kim said after a moment he added well the mystery has been solved the last cows head fell off the rail onto the floor of course i know what that means after the work ive been doing today it probably fell in its own manure and then went in to be butchered for hamburger meat this cow could have been infected with the e coli thats consistent with what you found out from sherring labs this afternoon indicating that the patty made from the meat butchered on january ninth was heavily contaminated in the next instant kim was startled enough to let out a whimper to his utter shock the process deficiency report was ripped from his hands he spun around to find himself facing elmer conrad while hed been talking hed not heard the man come into the room what the hell are you doing with these papers elmer demanded his broad face had become beetred kim felt his heart race not only had he been caught looking at confidential documents but he had the microphone in his right ear to try to keep the wire out of elmers line of sight he kept his head turned to the right looking at elmer out of the corner of his eye you better answer me boy elmer growled they were on the floor kim said desperately trying to think of something i was trying to put them back elmer glanced at the open drawer to the file cabinet then back at kim who were you talking to was i talking kim asked innocently dont mess with me boy elmer warned kim put his hand on his head then gestured ineffectually at elmer but no words came out of his mouth he was trying to think of something clever to say but couldnt tell him you were talking to yourself tracy whispered okay kim said i was talking to myself elmer looked askance at kim almost the same way kim was looking at elmer you sounded like you were having a goddamn conversation elmer said i was kim offered just with myself i do it all the time when im alone youre one weird dude elmer said whats wrong with your neck kim rubbed the left side of his neck with his left hand its a little stiff he said too much mopping i guess well you got some more to do elmer said remember those two restrooms next door here remember i told you that you had to clean them i guess that did slip my mind kim said sorry but i can get right to it i dont want you doing a crappy job elmer said so take your time even if you have to work past eleven understand theyll be pristine kim promised elmer tossed the process deficiency report onto the table and roughly pushed all the papers together while he was occupied kim pulled the earphone out of his ear and tucked it under his shirt it felt good to straighten his neck out well leave these papers for the secretaries to deal with elmer said he reached over to the file cabinet and pushed the open drawer shut now get the hell out of here youre not supposed to be in here in the first place kim preceded elmer out of the room elmer hesitated at the door to look around one final time only then did he put out the light and close the door taking out a large ring of keys he locked it kim was busy rinsing out his mop when elmer turned to him im going to keep my eye on you boy elmer warned and im going to come back and inspect these two restrooms after youre done so dont cut corners ill do my best kim said elmer gave him one final disapproving look before heading back toward the lunchroom kim slipped his earphone back into his ear as soon as elmer disappeared from view did you hear that whole exchange kim asked of course i heard it tracy said have you had enough of this nonsense now come on out no i want to try to get those papers kim said the problem is the bum locked the door why do you want them tracy asked with exasperation its something more to show kelly anderson kim said we already have the results from the lab tracy said that should be enough for kelly anderson to make a case for a recall thats what you want isnt it of course kim said at a minimum mercer meats entire january twelfth production has to be recalled but those papers also show how the industry is willing to buy sick cows avoid inspection and then allow a grossly soiled cow head to continue in production do you think that was how becky got sick tracy asked emotionally theres a good chance kim said with equal emotion that and the fact that her burger wasnt cooked through it makes you realize how tenuous life is that it could be snuffed out by something so trivial as a cows head falling on the floor and a hamburger not cooked enough it also underlines the importance of what were doing here kim said how do you think you can get the papers now that the recordroom door is locked tracy asked i dont know exactly kim admitted but the door has a thin piece of plywood covering a hole it probably wouldnt be too hard to knock it off but it will have to wait until i make a stab at these two restrooms i expect elmer to wander back here in a few minutes so i better get busy kim looked at the two doors they faced each other across the hall he pushed open the mens room door careful to avoid tipping over his bucket he maneuvered it over the raised threshold and onto the tile he gave it a shove into the room and let the door close behind him the room was a generous size with two toilet stalls and two urinals on the right and two sinks with mirrors over them to the left there was a series of coat hooks just inside the door the only other objects in the room were two paper towel dispensers and a trash container in the middle of the far wall was a window that looked out onto the parking lot at least this mens room isnt very dirty kim said i had fears that it was going to look like the one on the kill floor i wish i could come in there and help tracy said i wouldnt mind that at all kim said kim grabbed the handle of the mop stepping on the wringers foot pedal he wrung out the mop head then he walked over to the window and started mopping the door to the bathroom burst open with enough force for its knob to crack the wall tile the sound and the movement shocked kim and his head shot up to his utter dismay he now found himself staring at the man who had attacked him previously once again the man was brandishing a killfloor knife the mans lips slowly curled back into a cruel smile we meet again doctor only this time there will be no police and no woman to help you who are you kim demanded eager for the man to continue talking why are you doing this to me my name is carlos ive come to kill you kim kim tracy shouted in kims ear whats going on to help him think kim tore the earphone from his ear now tracy s frantic voice sounded as if she were yelling from a great distance carlos took a step into the room while holding up the knife so that kim could appreciate its size and curving shape the abused door swung shut kim had a hold of the mop and he instinctively raised it carlos laughed to him the idea of a mop against a killfloor knife was ludicrous with no other alternative kim dashed into one of the open toilet stalls and bolted the door carlos lunged forward and kicked the door fiercely the stall shuddered under the impact but the door held kim frantically backed up and straddled the toilet beneath the stall door he could see carlos feet as he prepared to kick the door again tracy panicked she fumbled with the ignition key before getting the car started throwing the vehicle into gear she stomped on the accelerator the car shot forward with enough speed to press her into the seat the antenna shed balanced on top skidded off the back of the car and bounced along the pavement on its wire tether tracy fought with the steering wheel to bring the speeding car around a tight turn misjudging the closeness of a neighboring vehicle she ricocheted off its side throwing her own car up onto two wheels for a split second the car thudded to earth and with squealing tires rocketed along the front of higgins and hancock tracy had no plan initially her only thought was to try to get to the mens room where kim was cornered apparently by the same man whod been in kims house the night before she knew she had little time she could see the mans horrid face in her minds eye as hed tried to force his way into her shower stall with his knife for a moment tracy contemplated crashing her car into the front entrance of the building but she decided it wouldnt necessarily do the trick she had to get into the mens room itself that was when she remembered the gun and swore at kim for not having kept it with him slamming on the brakes tracy brought her car to a shuddering halt just opposite the window to the record room she reached down onto the floor and snatched up the gun clutching it in her hand she jumped from the car and ran over to the recordroom window remembering how kim had gained entry she put down the gun and picked up one of the rocks edging the pavement using both hands she threw it against the plywood it took two smacks but she succeeded in knocking the plywood free of its temporary nails then she yanked it off tracy snatched up the gun and tossed it through the window then she followed it headfirst once inside the dark room she had to grope around for the gun on her hands and knees as she searched she could hear intermittent thumps behind the wall to the right as if a metal partition was being kicked repeatedly the noise increased her frenzy her fingers finally brushed up against the weapon where it had come to rest at the base of a table leg she seized it and then moved as fast as the darkness would allow to the vaguely illuminated door to the hall tracy unlocked the door from having listened to the conversation between kim and elmer she knew the mens room had to be close to the record room she decided to follow the sound of the thumping she made a right after running only a few steps she saw the mens room sign without a seconds hesitation tracy crashed through the door using her shoulder she had the gun clasped in both hands and pointed it into the depths of the room shed had no idea what to expect what she saw was carlos less than ten feet away with one leg raised in preparation for kicking a toilet stall door in the door was already bent as soon as he spotted her carlos made a flying leap for tracy like the night before he had a large knife clasped in his hand tracy had no time to think closing her eyes against the hurling figure she pulled the trigger in quick succession two shots rang out before carlos careened into her slamming her against the door and knocking the gun from her hand she felt a stabbing pain in her chest as she crumbled beneath the mans weight tracy desperately tried to breathe and to wriggle free as the mans weight settled on top of her but he had her easily pinned to tracy s surprise the killer moved off her she looked up expecting to see him standing over her with his knife raised for a deadly stab instead she was looking at kims distraught face oh god kim cried tracy hed pulled the killer off her and had thrown him aside as if the man were no more than a sack of potatoes frantic over the amount of blood spreading across tracy s chest he dropped to his knees and ripped open her blouse as a thoracic surgeon hed treated stab wounds to the chest and he knew what to expect but what he found was a bloodsoaked bra tracy s skin was intact there was no sucking chest wound with air rushing in as hed feared kim leaned closer to tracy s face she was still struggling to catch the breath that had been knocked out of her are you all right kim demanded tracy nodded but still couldnt speak kim turned his attention to the killer the man was writhing and groaning and had managed to turn himself over on his stomach kim rolled him back over and recoiled at such close range both of tracy s wild shots had found their mark one had gone through carlos right eye to exit out the back of his skull the other had hit him in the right chest which explained the blood all over tracy the man was foaming at the mouth and jerking uncoordinatedly it was clear to kim he was about to die is he hurt tracy managed wincing against the pain in her chest she pushed herself to a sitting position hes as good as dead kim said he stood up and began searching for the gun oh no tracy moaned i cant believe it i cant believe i killed someone wheres the gun kim demanded oh god tracy managed she couldnt take her eyes off carlos who was agonally choking the gun kim snapped he got down on his hands and knees he found carloss knife but not the gun moving over to the stalls he bent down again at last he saw it behind the first toilet reaching in he pulled it out stepping over to the sink he grabbed a paper towel and wiped the weapon clean what are you doing tracy asked through anguished tears getting rid of your fingerprints kim said i want only my prints on this thing why tracy demanded because whatever comes of this mess im taking responsibility kim said he gripped the weapon then tossed it aside come on were getting out of here no tracy said she went after the gun im in this as much as you kim grabbed her and pulled her upright dont be foolish im the accused felon here lets go but it was in selfdefense tracy complained tearfully its terrible but its justifiable we cant trust what kind of spin the legal profession might put on this kim said youre trespassing and im here under false pretenses come on i dont want to argue now shouldnt we stay here until the police come tracy asked no way kim said im not going to sit in jail while this all gets sorted out come on now lets go before anybody gets here tracy doubted the wisdom of fleeing the scene but she could also tell that kims mind was made up she let herself be led from the mens room kim looked up and down the hall surprised that the shots had not brought any of his cleaning crew colleagues how did you get in here kim whispered through the recordroom window tracy said the same window you broke good kim said he took tracy s hand together they dashed to the recordroom door just as they were entering they heard approaching voices kim motioned for tracy to be silent as he quietly closed and locked the door in the darkness they first went to the library table where kim snatched up the incriminating papers then they made their way to the window through the wall they heard commotion in the mens room followed by running footsteps down the hall kim climbed out first then he helped tracy together they dashed for tracy s car let me drive kim said he jumped behind the wheel while tracy got into the backseat he started the car and drove quickly out of the parking lot for a while they drove in silence who could have guessed it would have turned out like this tracy said at last what do you think we should do maybe you had the right idea back there kim said maybe we should have called the police ourselves and faced the consequences i suppose its not too late to turn ourselves in although i think we should call justin devereau first ive changed my mind tracy said i think your first instinct was correct youd certainly go to jail and probably me too and it would probably be a year before there even was a trial and then who knows what would happen after the oj simpson case i have zero confidence in the american court system we dont have a million dollars to throw away on johnny cochrane or barry scheck what are you implying kim asked he cast a quick glance at tracy in the rearview mirror she never failed to surprise him what we talked about last night tracy said lets go far away and deal with this mess from abroad someplace where the food is uncontaminated so we could continue our fight against that issue as well are you serious kim asked yes im serious tracy said kim shook his head theyd mentioned the idea and even had their passports but hed truly not taken it seriously in his mind it had been more of a desperate scheme of last resort something to consider in a worstcase scenario of course thanks to the killing he had to admit things couldnt have turned out much worse than they had of course we should call justin tracy added hell have some good suggestions he always does maybe hell know where we should go there are probably some legal issues relating to extradition and all that you know what i like best about the idea of us going to a foreign country kim said after a few minutes of silence he looked up to make eye contact with tracy in the rearview mirror whats that tracy asked that youre suggesting we do it together kim said well of course tracy said you know kim said maybe we shouldnt have gotten divorced i have to admit the idea has crossed my mind tracy said maybe something good will come from all this tragedy kim said if we did get remarried i know we couldnt have another becky but it would be nice to have another child youd really want to kim asked id like to try silence again reigned for a time as the former lovers struggled with their emotions how long do you think we will have before the authorities catch up with us tracy asked its hard to say kim said if youre asking to know how long we have before we have to make up our minds about what were going to do id say we dont have much time i think we have to decide in twentyfour to fortyeight hours at least that allows us time for beckys services tomorrow tracy said choking up all over again kim felt tears arise in his own eyes with the mention of beckys imminent funeral despite his best efforts to avoid facing it kim could no longer deny the horrible fact that his beloved daughter was gone oh god tracy whimpered when i close my eyes i can see the face of the man i shot its something ill never be able to forget itll haunt me the rest of my life kim wiped the tears off his check and took an uneven breath to pull himself together you have to concentrate on what you said back in the mens room it was justified if you hadnt pulled the trigger and shot him he would surely have killed you and then he would have killed me you saved my life tracy closed her eyes it was after eleven oclock when they pulled into tracy s driveway and parked behind kims car they were both completely drained physically mentally and emotionally i hope youre planning on staying here tonight tracy said i was hoping i was still invited kim said they got out of the car arminarm they walked up the path toward the house do you think we should call justin tonight tracy asked lets wait until morning kim said as wired as i am i dont know whether ill be able to sleep but i need to try at this point i really cant think much beyond taking a long hot shower i know what you mean tracy said they climbed onto the porch tracy got out her key and opened the door she stepped inside and made way for kim she closed the door and locked it only then did her hand grope for the light switch wow that seems bright kim said squinting at the overhead light tracy used the dimmer to cut the glare im a basket case kim admitted he slipped out of his higgins and hancock white coat and held it out at arms length this thing should be burned its probably got e coli plastered all over it just throw it away tracy said but its probably best to throw it in the trash barrel outside in the back i can only imagine what its going to smell like in the morning she took off her own coat and winced at the pain in her chest something hard had struck her just to the left of her sternum when carlos had collided with her at the time the pain had been so acute shed thought shed been stabbed are you all right kim asked seeing her reaction gingerly tracy felt along the edge of her breastbone is there anything that can break in here she asked of course kim said you could have fractured either a rib or the sternum itself oh great tracy said what should i do doctor some ice wouldnt hurt kim said ill get some after getting rid of this white coat kim started for the back door via the kitchen tracy opened the hall closet and hung up her coat and kicked off her shoes after closing the door she started for the stairs halfway she suddenly froze and let out a screeching gasp kim had only made it to the threshold of the kitchen when he heard tracy s cry he came running back he was relieved to discover her unharmed in the center of the front hall she was calm but she seemed oddly transfixed at something in the living room kim tried to follow her line of sight at first he saw nothing and was perplexed but then he too saw what she was looking at he was equally as startled in the shadows of the halfdarkened room was a man he was sitting motionless in the wing chair next to the fireplace he was dressed in a dark suit and tie a camelhair coat was draped carefully over the back of the chair his legs were casually crossed the man reached up and turned on a floor lamp tracy let out another plaintive whine on the coffee table in plain sight and within the mans easy reach was a black automatic pistol with an attached silencer the man was the picture of serenity which only made him that much more terrifying after turning on the light his hand returned to the armrest his expression was stern almost cruel you have made me wait much longer than i had intended he said suddenly breaking the silence his voice was angrily accusatory who are you tracy asked hesitantly come in here and sit down he snapped kim looked to his left judging how quickly he might be able to shove tracy behind the arched wall of the foyer and possibly out of harms way he didnt see how he could be quick enough especially since shed then have to get out the front door derek responded to their hesitation by snapping up the handgun and training it on them dont aggravate me further he warned this has been a bad day and im in a cross mood ill give you two seconds to come in here and sit on the couch kim swallowed hard but his voice came out in a hoarse whisper i think wed better sit down kim urged tracy forward while he berated himself for not having checked the house when theyd arrived hed made the effort that morning to be able to tell if anyone had come in while they were away but then after the death of carlos hed not even thought of it tracy sat down first kim took a seat next to her they were on the couch diagonally opposite the wing chair derek calmly replaced his gun on the coffee table and leaned back his hands returned to the upholstered arms of the chair with his fingers slightly curled like a gunfighter ready to draw it was as if he were daring the people in the room to try to flee or take the gun thereby giving him an excuse to shoot them who are you tracy repeated what are you doing in my house my name is immaterial derek said why im here is another matter i was brought to this city to kill the doctor both kim and tracy swayed slightly dereks frightening revelation made them momentarily dizzy they were speechless in their terror the man was a hired killer but something went wrong derek said they brought me all the way to this godforsaken city and then withdrew the contract without any real explanation other than to say they had someone else who was going to do the job they even had the gall to ask for the down payment back after i flew all the way out here derek leaned forward and his eyes blazed so not only am i not going to kill you dr reggis im going to do you a favor now i cannot figure out why these beef people want you dead i can tell you kim offered anxiously he was more than willing to cooperate derek raised his hand theres no need for me to know the details at this point he said i tried to find out but i gave up its your business what you should know is that these people want you dead enough to hire me or someone like me my way of getting back at them for taking advantage of me is to tell you that you are in grave danger what you do with the information is entirely up to you am i making myself clear perfectly kim said thank you no reason to thank me derek said im not doing this for altruistic reasons derek stood up the only thing i ask in return is that you keep this conversation just between us otherwise i might have to come back and visit either one of you again and i hope thats just as clear i should warn you that i am very good at what i do dont worry kim said we wont discuss this with anyone excellent derek said now if you will excuse me i am going to try to get home kim made a move to get up from the couch dont bother derek said motioning kim to stay put i saw myself in ill see myself out kim and tracy watched dumbfounded as derek slipped on his camelhair coat he picked up his handgun and slipped it into his pocket then he picked up his briefcase i wouldnt have been quite so rude if youd gotten home at a decent hour derek said good night good night kim said derek walked out of the living room kim and tracy heard the door open and then slam closed for several minutes neither spoke this is all so incredible its as if im in a nightmare and just cant wake up tracy said its a nightmare that keeps on going kim agreed but we have to do what we can to end it do you still think we should go to a foreign country tracy asked kim nodded at least i should it seems im a marked man in fact lets not even stay here tonight where will we go tracy asked hotel motel what does it matter kim asked eighteen tuesday january th as soon as earlymorning daylight began to creep around the edges of the cheap curtains kim gave up trying to fall back asleep he eased out of bed to avoid disturbing tracy gathered up his clothes and padded silently into the sleeprite motels bathroom he closed the door as quietly as possible then turned on the light kim looked at himself in the mirror and cringed between his ridiculous blond hair and sutured laceration framing sunken red eyes he hardly recognized himself despite his exhaustion hed slept fitfully and had awakened for the final time just after five all night hed reviewed the previous days horrific events agonizing over what to do the idea of being pursued by hired killers was almost too much to comprehend kim shaved and showered thankful for simple tasks to divert his mind for a few moments brushing his hair down flat he thought he appeared significantly more presentable after pulling on his clothes kim cracked the door he was glad to see that tracy had not budged he knew shed slept equally poorly and was pleased that she was now getting some real sleep kim was thankful for her presence but ambivalent about allowing her to share the current risk kim went to the desk and used the pad by the phone to scribble a short note to tell tracy that hed gone to bring back some breakfast he put the note on the blanket on his side of the bed then he picked up the car keys it was more difficult to get the entrance door open silently than it bad been with the bathroom door because the entrance door was metal and it had a chainlock and a throwbolt in addition to its regular lock once outside kim reminded himself that he was being pursued by hired killers the thought made him acutely paranoid despite being relatively certain he was safe for the moment he and tracy had used assumed names when they had checked in at the motel and had paid in cash kim went to the car and climbed in he started the engine but didnt pull out immediately he watched the man whod checked them in six hours earlier hed seen kim come out of the room but had gone back to his chores he was busy sweeping in front of the office kim wanted to make sure the man didnt do anything suspicious before he left tracy alone like suddenly run back inside the office to use the phone recognizing his paranoia kim chided himself he knew he was going to have to pull himself together or risk making the wrong decisions putting the car in gear he backed up before driving out of the parking lot a few miles down the road was a donut shop where kim ordered two coffees two orange juices and an assortment of donuts the place was nearly full of truckers and construction men while kim stood in line at the cash register many of them eyed him skeptically from their point of view no doubt he was quite a sight kim was happy to leave as he stepped off the curb on his way to his car his eye saw the headlines of the paper placed behind the window of the dispenser it said in bold capital letters berserk doctor seeks revenge by murder then along the bottom of the page in smaller print was the once respected professional now a fugitive from justice a shiver of fear descended down kims spine he quickly went to the car and deposited the food and drink heading back to the dispenser he sought the proper coins from his pocket with a trembling hand he got out one of the papers the door to the dispenser clattered shut any lingering hope the story did not concern him was dashed when kim saw a photo of himself below the headlines it was several years old with his normal shock of dark hair ducking back into the car kim turned back the front page of the newspaper the story was on page two exclusive to the morning sun times dr kim reggis a respected cardiac surgeon and the former head of the department at the samaritan hospital and now on staff at the university medical center has taken the law into his own hands vigilante style in response to the tragic death of his daughter on saturday he allegedly disguised himself with blond hair color got a job at higgins and hancock under a false name and then brutally murdered another worker by the name of carlos mateo it is thought that the motive for this unprovoked killing is that dr reggis believed his daughter died of meat slaughtered at higgins and hancock mr daryl webster the president of higgins and hancock has told the times that this is a preposterous allegation he also said that mr mateo was a valued worker and a devoted catholic who tragically leaves behind an invalid wife and six young children kim angrily tossed the paper onto the passenger seat he didnt have to read any further to be disgusted and concerned he started the car and drove back to the motel carrying the food and the paper he entered tracy heard him come in and poked her head around the bathroom door she was toweling her wet head having just gotten out of the shower youre up kim commented he put down the food on the desk i heard you go out tracy said im glad to see you back i was a little afraid you might leave me here with the idea of sparing me promise me you wont do that the idea crossed my mind kim admitted he sank dejectedly into the only chair whats the matter tracy asked although she knew there was more than enough on kims mind he seemed far more despondent than she expected kim held up the newspaper read this he said is it about the man at higgins and hancock tracy asked fearfully she wasnt sure she wanted to read the details yes and about me too kim said oh no tracy cried with dismay youre already associated with it she stepped into the room while wrapping herself in the thin towel she took the paper and read the headlines slowly she sank onto the edge of the bed turning the page to read the rest it didnt take tracy long when she was finished she closed the paper and put it aside she looked at kim what a character assassination she said somberly they even included mention of your recent arrests and that your hospital privileges have been suspended i didnt get that far kim said i only read the first two paragraphs but it was enough i cant believe this has all happened so quickly tracy said someone must have recognized you at higgins and hancock obviously kim said the man we killed wasnt trying to kill jose ramerez and when he failed to kill me the people who were paying him opted to destroy my credibility and possibly send me to jail for life kim laughed mirthlessly and to think i was worried about the legal ramifications i never even considered the media it surely gives you an idea of the money and power of this industry in this town that they can manage to distort the truth like this i mean there was no investigative reporting in this article the paper just printed what the meat industry told them they have me murdering a godfearing family man in cold blood in a fit of revenge this means we dont have twentyfour to fortyeight hours to decide what were going to do tracy said i should say not kim said he stood up it means we should have decided last night and for me it also means theres no longer a question ill fight this travesty but definitely from afar tracy stood up and stepped over to kim theres no longer a question for me either she said well go together and fight this together of course it will mean well miss beckys service kim said i know tracy said i think shell understand i hope so tracy managed i miss her so much me too kim said kim and tracy looked into each others eyes then kim reached out and put his arms around his former wife tracy put hers around kim and they hugged pressing themselves against each other as if theyd been involuntarily separated for years another long moment passed until kim leaned back to look tracy in the eye its like old times to feel close to you like this very old times tracy agreed like in a previous life kelly anderson looked at her watch it was almost onethirty she shook her head hes not coming she said to brian washington brian adjusted the tv camcorder on his shoulder you really didnt expect him to did you he asked he loved his daughter kelly said and this is her funeral but theres a policeman right outside brian said theyd arrest him on the spot the guy would have to be crazy to come i think he is a little crazy kelly said when he stopped in to my house to get me interested in his crusade he had a wild look in his eye he even scared me a little that i doubt brian said ive never seen you scared in fact i think you have ice in your veins especially with as much iced tea as you drink you more than anyone should know its just an act im scared every time i go on the air bull brian said kelly and brian were standing in the foyer of the sullivan funeral home there were a few other people milling about and whispering discreetly bernard sullivan the proprietor was standing near the door he was clearly anxious and glanced repeatedly at his watch the funeral service had been booked for one oclock and he had a tight schedule for the day did you think dr reggis was crazy enough to kill someone like they said in the paper brian asked lets put it this way kelly said i think he was pushed to his limit brian shrugged i guess you just never know he said philosophically maybe the good doctors absence is understandable kelly said but for the life of me i cant understand where tracy is she was beckys mother for gods sake and she has no reason to avoid the law ill tell you this has me worried what do you mean brian asked if the good doctor has really lost it kelly said it wouldnt be so farfetched to think that he might blame his former wife in some twisted way for his daughters death oh geez brian said i never thought of that listen kelly said suddenly making up her mind you go call the station to get tracy reggiss address ill go have a chat with mr sullivan and ask him to page us if tracy reggis shows up you got it brian said brian headed back to the funeralhome office while kelly walked over to the funeral director and tapped him on the ann twenty minutes later kelly and brian were in kellys car gliding to a stop in front of tracy s house uhoh kelly said whats the matter brian asked that car kelly said she pointed to the mercedes i think thats the doctors car at least its the car he was driving when he came to visit me what should we do brian asked i dont want any madman running out of the house with a baseball bat or a shot gun brian had a point following her scenario reggis could very well be in the house holding his former wife as a hostage or even worse maybe we should go around and talk to the neighbors kelly suggested somebody might have seen something at the first two houses they approached no one responded to the front doorbell the third bell they rang was mrs englishs and she answered the door promptly youre kelly anderson mrs english said excitedly after taking one look at kelly youre wonderful i see you on tv all the time mrs english was a diminutive silverhaired lady who looked like the quintessential grandmother thank you kelly said would you mind if we asked you a few questions

said anyway tracy didnt come to talk with me like she said she would she just went into the house with the second man and then what happened they were all inside for a while then the first man came out and drove away a little while later tracy and the other man came out with suitcases suitcases like they were going on a trip yes but it was a strange time to go on a trip it was nearly midnight i know because it was the latest ive stayed up for as long as i can remember thank you mrs english kelly said youve been most helpful kelly motioned for brian to leave am i going to be on tv mrs english asked well let you know kelly said she waved and walked back to her car she climbed in brian got into the passenger seat this story keeps getting better kelly said i wouldnt have guessed in all the world but tracy reggis has apparently decided to go on the lam with her fugitive former husband and to think she seemed like such a sensible person im blown away by three oclock the chaos of the lunchtime rush finally faded in the onion ring restaurant on prairie highway and the exhausted day shift gathered up their things and left everyone except for roger polo the manager as conscientious as he was he couldnt leave until he was sure there was a smooth transition to the evening shift only then would he turn things over to paul the cook who acted as the supervisor in rogers absence roger was busy installing a new tape in one of the cash registers when paul arrived at his station behind the grill and began arranging the utensils the way he liked them much traffic today roger asked while snapping the registers cowling shut not bad paul said was it a busy day here very busy roger said there must have been twenty people waiting to get in when i opened the doors and it never let up did you see the mornings paper paul asked i wish roger said i didnt even have a chance to sit down to eat you better read it paul said that crazy doctor that came in here friday murdered a guy out at higgins and hancock last night no kidding roger blurted he was genuinely dumbstruck some poor mexican guy with six kids paul said shot him through the eye can you imagine there was no way roger could imagine he leaned on the countertop his legs felt wobbly hed been mad about being struck in the face now he felt lucky he shuddered to think of what might have happened had the doctor brought a gun when hed come to the onion ring when your times up its up paul said philosophically he turned around and opened the refrigerator looking into the patty box he could see it was almost empty skip paul yelled hed seen skip out in the restaurant proper emptying the trash containers do you have the newspaper roger asked yeah paul said its on the table in the employee room help yourself whats up skip asked hed come to the outer side of the counter i need more burgers from the walkin paul said and while youre at it bring a couple of packages of buns can i finish what im doing first skip asked no paul said i need em now i only have two patties left skip muttered under his breath as he rounded the counter and headed to the restaurants rear he liked to finish one job before starting another it was also beginning to bug him that everybody in the whole place could boss him around skip pulled open the heavy insulated door to the freezer and stepped into the arctic chill the automatic door closed behind him he pushed back the flaps of the first carton on the left but found it was empty he cursed loudly his colleague equivalent on the day shift always left him things to do this empty carton would have to be cut down for recycling skip went to the next carton and found that one empty as well picking up both cartons he opened the door and threw them out of the freezer then he walked into the depths of the walkin to locate the reserve patty cartons he scraped the frost off the label on the nearest one he could find it said mercer meats reg lb hamburger patties extra lean lot batch production jan use by apr i remember this baby skip said out loud he checked the flaps sure enough the carton had been opened to be certain there werent any older patties skip scraped off the frost from the label of the final carton the date was the same grabbing the first carton by its flaps skip dragged it to the front of the freezer only then did he reach inside to pull out one of the interior boxes as hed expected this box had been opened as well skip carried the patty box back to the kitchen and after squeezing by paul who was busy scraping the residue off the grill skip put the patty box in the refrigerator were finally using those burgers i opened by accident a week or so ago skip said as he slammed the refrigerator door thats cool as long as the other ones are finished paul said without looking up from his labors i checked skip said the older ones are all gone the large wall clock on the wall of the wene newsroom gave kelly the exact time it was the local news had been on since fivethirty her segment was scheduled to begin at and the technician was still fumbling with her microphone as usual kellys pulse was racing one of the large tv cameras suddenly was rolled into place directly in front of her the cameraman was nodding and speaking softly into his headphone got of the corner of her eye she saw the director pick up his microphone wire and hear in her direction in the background she could hear the anchor marilyn wodinsky finishing a wrapup of the national news good grief kelly snapped she pushed away the technicians hand and rapidly secured the microphone herself it was a good thing because within seconds the director held up five fingers and gave the countdown ending by pointing at kelly simultaneously the camera in front of kelly went live good evening everyone kelly said we have an indepth report this evening concerning a sad local story a story that plays like a greek tragedy a year ago we had a pictureperfect family the father was one of the countrys most renowned cardiac surgeons the mother a psychotherapist highly regarded in her own right and the daughter a darling talented tenyearold considered by some as a rising star in figure skating the denouement started presumably with the merger of the university hospital and the samaritan apparently this put pressure on the marriage soon after a bitter divorce and custody battle ensued then a few days ago on saturday afternoon the daughter died of a strain of e coli which has surfaced in intermittent outbreaks around the country dr kim reggis the father pushed to the limit by the sad disintegration of his life decided that the local beef industry was responsible for his daughters death he became convinced that his daughter had contracted the toxin from an onion ring restaurant in the area the onion ring chain gets its burgers from mercer meats and mercer meats gets a significant amount of its beef from higgins and hancock the distraught dr kim reggis disguised himself as a blond drifter obtained employment under an alias at higgins and hancock and shot dead another higgins and hancock employee the deceased is carlos mateo who leaves behind a disabled wife and six young children wene has learned from the authorities that a gun left at the scene had been registered to the doctor and that his fingerprints were found on it dr reggis is now a fugitive and is being actively sought by the police in a bizarre twist to the story his former wife tracy reggis has apparently joined him in flight at this time it is unknown if she is being coerced or acting under her own volition to follow up on this story wene interviewed mr carl stahl ceo of foodsmart incorporated i asked mr stahl if becky reggis could have contracted her e coli from an onion ring restaurant kelly breathed a sigh of relief a makeup person appeared from behind the background screen and adjusted a few wisps of hair and powdered her forehead meanwhile carl stahls face appeared on the studios monitor thank you kelly for this opportunity to speak to your viewers carl said solemnly first let me say that having known tracy and becky reggis personally im crushed by this sad affair but to answer your question there is no way miss reggis could have contracted her illness from an onion ring restaurant we cook our burgers to degrees interior temperature which is higher than what is recommended by the fda and we our chefs check this temperature twice a day insist e director again pointed at kelly and the red light on top of the camera in front of her blinked on i posed the same question to jack cartwright of mercer meats kelly said looking directly into the camera once again kelly visibly relaxed as the monitor came back to life this time it was jack cartwrights image mercer meats supplies the onion ring chain with their hamburger patties jack said they are made from the finest extra lean ground beef so there is no way that someone could have gotten sick from one of their burgers mercer meats adheres to in fact surpasses all usda requirements for meat processing in terms of sanitation and sterilization the onion ring restaurants have the finest ingredients that money and technology can buy without a seconds hesitation kelly cut in at the conclusion of jack cartwrights taped interview and finally i posed the identical question to mr daryl webster acting head of higgins and hancock the monitor came alive for the third time the onion ring makes its burgers from the best meat in the world daryl said contentiously poking his finger at the camera and i dare anyone to dispute that we here at higgins and hancock are proud to provide their supplier mercer meats with their fresh beef and let me say this i think its a tragedy that one of our best employees has been murdered in this coldblooded fashion all i can hope is that this fruitcake is brought to justice before he kills someone else kelly raised her eyebrows as the camera in front of her went live again as you can see emotions are running high in the aftermath of this murder and a young girls tragic death so there you have it the story of the reggis family and its tragic consequences wene will bring you more as soon as it is available over to you marilyn kelly exhaled loudly and detached her microphone in the background marilyns voice could be heard thank you kelly for that heartbreaking and disturbing story now on to other local news kelly activated the automatic garage door and then stepped out of her car as it began to shut she slung her shoulder bag over her shoulder and climbed the three steps from the garage into the house the house was quiet she had expected to see caroline sitting on the gingham couch watching her half hour of allotted television but the tv was off and caroline was nowhere in sight all kelly could hear was the faint clicking of a computer keyboard coming from the library kelly opened the refrigerator and poured herself some juice glass in hand she passed through the dining room and poked her head into the library edgar was at the computer walking in she gave him a peck on the cheek which he accepted without taking his eyes off the monitor that was an interesting piece you did on dr reggis edgar said he doubleclicked his mouse and looked up you think so kelly said without a lot of enthusiasm thanks a sad story for everyone involved edgar said to say the least kelly said a year ago he could have been a poster boy for american success as a heart surgeon he had it all respect a beautiful family a big home all the trappings but it was a house of cards edgar said apparently kelly said she sighed whats with caroline did she get her homework done mostly edgar said but she wasnt feeling too good and wanted to go to bed whats the trouble kelly asked it was rare for caroline to miss her tv nothing overwhelming edgar assured her just some stomach upset with cramps she probably ate too much and too quickly she insisted we stop at an onion ring restaurant after her skating practice and the place was mobbed im afraid her eyes were bigger than her stomach she ordered two burgers a shake and a large fries kelly felt an uncomfortable stirring in the pit of her stomach which onion ring kelly asked hesitantly the one out on prairie highway edgar said do you think caroline is already asleep kelly asked i wouldnt know for sure edgar said but she hasnt been up there very long kelly put down her juice she left the room and climbed the stairs her face reflected her anxiety she stopped to listen outside of carolines room once again all she could hear was the clicking of the computer keyboard drifting up from downstairs quietly kelly cracked the door the room was dark opening the door further she stepped inside and silently walked over to her daughters bedside caroline was fast asleep her face looked particularly angelic her breathing was deep and regular kelly resisted the temptation to reach out and hug her daughter instead she just stood there in the semidarkness thinking about how much she loved caroline and how much caroline meant to her such thoughts made her feel acutely vulnerable life was indeed a house of cards backing out of the room kelly closed the door and descended the stairs she returned to the library collected her juice glass and sat down on the leather couch she cleared her throat edgar looked over knowing kelly as well as he did he knew she wanted to talk he switched off his computer what is it he asked its the dr reggis story kelly said im not satisfied with it i said as much to the news director but he overruled me saying it was tabloid fodder not hard news and that i wasnt supposed to waste any more time on it but im going to do it anyway why do you feel this way edgar asked there are some gnawing loose ends kelly said the biggest one involves a usda inspector by the name of marsha baldwin when kim reggis stopped here on sunday he told me that he thought the woman had disappeared he implied that foul play may have been involved i assume you have been looking for her edgar said sort of kelly admitted i really didnt take kim reggis too seriously as i told you i thought hed gone over the edge after his daughters death i mean hed been acting bizarre and according to him the woman had only been missing for a few hours anyway i attributed his allegations to raving paranoia so you havent found the woman edgar said no i havent kelly said monday i made a few isolated calls but i wasnt really into it but today i called the usda district office when i asked about her they insisted i talk to the district manager of course i didnt mind talking to the head honcho but then he didnt give me any information he just said that they hadnt seen her after i hung up i thought that it was curious that i had to speak to the head of the office to get that kind of information it is curious edgar admitted i called up later and asked specifically where shed been assigned kelly said guess where i havent a clue edgar said mercer meats kelly said interesting edgar said so how are you going to go about investigating all this i dont know yet kelly said of course id love to find the doctor seems like ive always been chasing him well ive learned to respect your intuition edgar said so go for it one other thing kelly said keep caroline out of the onion ring restaurants particularly the one on prairie highway how come edgar asked she loves the food for the moment lets just say its my intuition youll have to tell her yourself edgar said i dont have a problem with that kelly said the door chimes surprised both of them kelly glanced at her watch whos here ringing our bell at eight oclock on a tuesday she questioned beats me edgar said while getting to his feet let me get it be my guest kelly said kelly rubbed her temples as she gave more thought to edgars question about how she would look into this reggis situation without the doctor it wasnt going to be easy she tried to remember everything kim had said when hed visited on sunday out in the front hall she heard edgar talking with someone and being told where to sign a few minutes later he returned he was clutching a manila envelope staring at the label you got a package he said he shook it something was moving around freely inside whos it from kelly asked she didnt like getting mystery packages theres no return address edgar said just the initials kr kr kelly repeated kim reggis edgar shrugged i suppose its possible let me see it kelly said edgar handed her the package she felt through the paper well it doesnt feel dangerous it feels like a reel of something padded with paper go ahead and open it edgar said kelly tore open the envelope and pulled out a bunch of officiallooking forms and a recording tape attached to the top of the tape was a postit on it was written kelly you asked for documentation and here it is ill be in touch kim reggis these are all papers from higgins and hancock edgar said with attached descriptions kelly shook her head as she scanned the material i have a feeling my investigation just got off to a flying start epilogue wednesday february th the dilapidated recycled ups van coughed and sputtered but the engine kept going the van climbed a gradual incline after fording across a small stream by golly thats the deepest that cricks been since ive been in these parts bart winslow said he and his partner willy brown were driving along an isolated country road trying to get back to the main road after picking up a dead pig it had been raining for almost two days and the road was awash and the potholes full of muddy water i been thinking bart said after spitting some tobacco juice out the driversside window benton oaklys not going to have much of a farm if his cows keep getting the runs like the one we picked up before the pig sure as shootin willy said but you know this ones not much sicker than the one we picked up a month ago what do you say we take it to the slaughterhouse like we did the other one i suppose bart said the problem is we gotta drive all the way out to the vnb slaughterhouse in loudersville yeah i know willy said that tv lady got higgins and hancock to close for a couple of weeks for some kind of investigation well the good part is that vnb is a hell of a lot less choosey than higgins and hancock bart said remember that time we sold them those two cows deader than a thanksgiving turkey right out of the oven sure do willy said when you reckon higgins and hancock gonna reopen i hear by monday next cause they didnt find nothing but a handful of illegal aliens bart said figures willy said so what you think about this cow we got lets do it bart said fifty bucks is bettern twentyfive in anybodys book afterword a basic requirement for the pursuit of happiness is good health and the minimum requirement for good health is clean water and uncontaminated food human beings as a civilization have been struggling with the former since urbanization only in recent times has civil engineering led to sustainable solutions tragically the circumstance with the latter is the opposite after significant technological progress with food preservation particularly in regard to refrigeration we have been losing ground due to the pressure for increased food quantity and lower prices intensive farming and animal rearing practices have actually created new frightful forms of contamination and threaten to spawn more it is a problem that cries out for attention for those people who would like to learn more about this serious situation and the havoc it wreaks i strongly recommend they read fox nicols spoiled what is happening to our food supply and why we are increasingly at risk basic books penguin
