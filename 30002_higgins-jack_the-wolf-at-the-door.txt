jack higgins the wolf at the door the wolf at the door is your greatest danger and not only in winter russian proverb at fiftyeight his black hair flecked with gray blake johnson still had a kind of rugged charm the air of a man capable of looking after himself he certainly didnt look old enough to have served in the marines in vietnam though he had with considerable honor and the medals to prove it johnson was personal security adviser to the president and had been so for more years than he cared to remember presidents came and presidents went but he went on forever or so it seemed blake thought ruefully as he stood in the wheelhouse of a sport fisherman named lively jane on the late afternoon it all began he peered through the window at long island a light rain blowing against the glass it was almost six hed have to hurry he had a beach house in quogue supposedly for holidays which hardly ever came and this time looked to be no different vladimir putin prime minister of the russian federation was speaking at the united nations in new york and the president wanted him to attend and report in not only on the speech but on the general attitude of the russian delegation the british prime minister wasnt coming either but interestingly hed sent his personal troubleshooter harry miller to the speech presumably to do the same thing blake was doing with him was sean dillon once a feared enforcer with the provisional ira now a security adviser himself and a friend to blake in good times and bad dillon amp miller blake smiled dillon would have said it sounded like a cabaret act he throttled back and coasted in between the boats so that the lively jane nudged against the pier a man was on the pier in a yellow oilskin coat the hood pulled up against the rain which was driving down now blake emerged from the wheelhouse and picked up the line to throw it can you give me a hand catch the line and tie her up and ill switch off i dont think so ill be needing that engine to drop you into the sound the man in the hood said his hand came out of his right pocket holding a beretta and blake his senses sharpened by years of hard living was already hurling himself over the rail aware of the muffled sound of the silenced weapon fired twice and a burning sensation in his right shoulder and then he was diving down into twenty feet of murky water he swam under the boat his back scraping the keel and surfaced on the other side as she drifted the engine still throbbing he saw the man at the stern leaning over the rail and emptying the beretta into the water then ejecting the magazine and taking another from his pocket blake heaved himself over and scrambled into the wheelhouse there was a flap under the instrument panel and it opened at his touch held by two clips inside was a shortbarreled smith amp wesson and he was holding it as he turned the man in the hood was frantically shoving the magazine up the butt of the beretta blake said dont be stupid its over not that it did any good fug you the man said and his hand came up and blake shot him between the eyes knocking him back into the water it was very quiet out of season nobody around even the little cafe on the pier was closed so he did the only thing he could he switched off the engine went along the deck and managed to loop a line to one of the pier rings then went below his shoulder was hurting now hurting bad he sat down in the kitchen area and scrambled out his special mobile and called in the familiar voice answered the presidents favorite secret service man clancy smith its blake clancy i just came in to the pier on the lively jane and a guy was waiting with a beretta for gods sake blake what happened ive taken a bullet in the shoulder but i put him over the rail he was lightheaded now hell clancy theres nobody here closed down for the season just hang in there ill have the police there in no time hold on blake hold on ill call you back blake reached into a cupboard pulled the cork on a bottle of very old brandy and swallowed deeply hold on he muttered thats what the man said he took another gulp from the bottle fainted and slid to the floor at the same time in london it was an hour before midnight at the garrick club where a dinner for twenty ministers from various commonwealth countries was drawing to a close general charles ferguson for his sins had been asked to deliver a speech on the economic consequences of terrorism in the modern age and he couldnt wait to leave the affair had been expected to finish at ten but it was now eleven thanks to a certain amount of squabbling during the questionandanswer sessions and naturally and to his great annoyance ferguson had been involved hed had to call his driver on three separate occasions until at last the whole sorry business came to an end he made his escape as fast as possible found a string of limousines waiting and his not among them his beloved daimler had suffered damage and was being refurbished and the cabinet office had provided an amara and a driver named pool who now came forward anxiously and whats this ferguson demanded ominously we kept getting moved on by security im two streets away in venable row he had a cockney accent but with a slight whine to it that ferguson didnt like for gods sake man just lead the way i want to get home to bed pool scuttled away ferguson sighed poor sod it wasnt his fault when you thought of it but what a bloody evening as pool reached the end of the street a limousine came around the corner and ran through a large puddle splashing the driver severely it kept on going and he shouted after it holy mother of god youve soaked me you bastards his voice was quite different more irish than anything else and he turned to ferguson and called hurriedly sorry sir and disappeared around the corner what in the hell is going on ferguson asked softly and turned into venable row there was some construction going on there a cleared area and a fence around it with an opening for an entrance along with a couple of diggers and a work truck it was dark in there just a little light in the glare of a streetlight the silver amara was parked some yards inside and pool was standing beside it here we are sir ferguson moved closer and as he approached pool turned and started to run away and the amara blew up the explosion echoing between the buildings on either side and setting off their fire alarms ferguson was hurled backwards by the blast lay there for a moment then stood up aware that he was in one piece but that the amara was burning furiously the explosion had come from the trunk and pool had been closer to the rear of the car ferguson lurched towards him dropped to his knees and turned pool over there was a great deal of blood and his face was gashed pools eyes opened ferguson said steady old son youll be fine help coming pools voice was very weak i messed up all my fault nonsense ferguson said the only person to blame is the bastard who put that bomb in my car not that pool heard him for hed already stopped breathing and ferguson knelt there a feeling of total desolation passing through him aware of the sirens of the police and the emergency services approaching holding a hand already turning cold not your fault old son he said softly not your fault at all as he got to his feet the first police car roared into the street in new york harry miller and sean dillon were enjoying a drink in the woodpaneled oak bar of the plaza hotel where they were sharing a suite i like this place dillon said the edwardian splendor of it they say it was mark twains home away from home i had a drink in this very bar on my first trip to new york the small irishman was wearing slacks of black velvet corduroy and a black armani shirt that seemed to complement the hair so fair it was almost white he looked calm and relaxed with the half smile of a man who couldnt take the world seriously the ira must have been generous with their expenses i presume you were after some wretched informer on the run from belfast as a matter of fact i was dillon said still smiling another one why not but then youd better get changed you are after all representing the british government at the un i think ill stretch my legs while you do miller was dressed formally in a navy blue suit a blue trench coat on the seat beside him he was a little under six feet with saturnine gray eyes dark brown hair and a scar bisecting his left cheek god bless your honor for reminding me the simple irish boy i am what do you think putins up to god knows miller said if he thought his presence at the un was going to force the president and the prime minister to attend as well hes been sadly misinformed the waiter provided two more bushmills whiskeys and departed dillon said gloomily sometimes i wonder what the un is for anymore not enough muscle i suppose well it has eighteen acres of land alongside the east river and its own police force fire department and post office miller said i suppose theyll have to be content with that he swallowed his whiskey stood up and pulled on his trench coat im going across the street for a stroll in central park the embassy car will be here in an hour better take care that place can be tricky that was then this is now sean these days new york is safer than london if you say so major dillon toasted him see you later miller accepted the offer of an umbrella from the doorman crossed to central park and entered there were few people around in the fading light of late afternoon just before the early evening darkness he realized suddenly that he was alone except for voices somewhere in the distance a dog barking hollowly and then the footfalls of someone running up behind him he glanced over his shoulder a man in a dark green tracksuit wearing gloves and a knitted cap came up fast and swerved to one side he said hello and kept on going turning through the trees at the end of the path a moment later he reappeared paused to look at miller then walked forward miller dropped his umbrella as if by accident and under cover of picking it up reached down and found the colt in the ankle holder he straightened up raised the umbrella again and turned to go the man called hey you weve got business to discuss he ran forward then slowed his right hand sliding into a pocket of his tracksuit and what would that be miller asked wallet cards mobile phone in any order you please he was up close now his right hand still in his pocket miller took two quick steps so that the two of them were good and close then held the silenced colt almost touching the mans left knee and fired the man cried out lurching back as miller pushed him towards a park bench at the side of the park oh jesus the man cried and miller reached in the tracksuit pocket and found a silenced pistol which he tossed into the bushes wallet cards mobile phone wasnt that what you said the man had grasped his knee with both hands blood pumping through what have you done to me they didnt say it would be like this ive crippled you you bastard miller said hollowpoint cartridges now speak up or ill give it to you in the other knee as well whos they i dont know im a free lance people contact me i provide a service you mean youre a professional hit man thats it i got a call i dont know who it was there was a package i dont know who from a photo of you staying at the plaza with instructions and two thousand dollars in hundreds and you dont know who the client was thats hard to believe why would they trust you you mean trust me with the money thats the way it works take the money and run and id be the target next time now for the love of god man help me wheres the money in the bank well there you go miller said ill keep your wallet and cards and leave you your mobile call an ambulance and say youve been mugged no point in trying to involve me for what you tried to pull youd get twenty years in ossining or maybe youve already done time there maybe youre a threetime loser just fuck off the man said yes i thought youd say that miller turned and walked rapidly away leaving the man to make his call in the twobedroom suite they were sharing at the plaza dillon was standing at his bathroom mirror adjusting a tie as black as his shirt his jacket like his slacks was black corduroy and he reached for it and pulled it on will i do he asked as miller walked in the door in that outfit putin is going to think the undertakers come for him away with you you hardly ever see old vladimir wearing anything but a black suit its his personal statement the hard man you mean never mind that now we need to talk what about miller put his right foot on the edge of the bathtub eased up the leg of his slacks and removed the ankle holder what the hell is that for dillon said id like to remind you its the united nations were going to you wouldnt have got inside the door wearing that true but i never intended to try on the other hand a walk in central park is quite another matter it seems so its a good thing i was carrying as always with dillon it was as if a shadow passed across his face that in the briefest of moments changed his entire personality tell me miller did brief and succinct because of the soldier in him and when he was finished he took out the wallet hed taken from his assailant and offered it a folded computer photo of me no credit cards a social security card plus a drivers license in the name of frank barry with an address in brooklyn i doubt any of it is genuine but there you are i need a shower and a fresh shirt and were short on time he cleared off to his own bedroom and dillon took the items from the wallet and unfolded the computer photo it showed miller walking on a relatively crowded pavement one half of a truck in view and behind it the side of a london cab now where had that come from a long way from central park dillon went to the sideboard and poured himself a whiskey thinking of frank barry the hit man poor bastard he hadnt known what he was up against miller was hardly your usual politician hed served in the british army during some of the worst years of the irish troubles for some of that time an apparent deskman in the intelligence corps but dillon knew the truth miller had long ago decided that summary justice was the only way to fight terrorism since the death of his wife the victim of a terrorist attack aimed at miller himself he had grown even more ruthless dillon folded the computer photo and tried to slide it back into the wallet it refused to go because there was something there he fiddled about and managed to pull out a card that was rather ornate gold around the edges with a sentiment inscribed in curling type holy mary mother of god pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death we who are ourselves alone miller came in ready to go what have you got there something you missed in the wallet the card was creased and obviously old and dillon held it to his nose candles incense and the holy water what in hell do you mean miller held out his hand and examined the card so barry is a catholic so what such cards are very rare they go back in history to michael collins the easter rising the card begs the virgin to pray for we who are ourselves alone the irish for ourselves alone is sinn fein miller stared at the card frowning and you think thats significant maybe not but barry is an irish name and you told me that after you shot him he said they didnt say it would be like this thats true but he claimed he didnt know whod hired him even when i threatened to put one through his other knee dillon shrugged maybe he lied in spite of the pain he took the card from millers fingers and replaced it in the wallet miller said are you saying there could be a smell of ira here dillon smiled i suppose anything is possible in the worst of all possible worlds you were right not to kill him though hell stick like glue to the story of being the victim of a mugging he wouldnt want the police to think anything else and the ira connection if there was one its done them no good at all he put the wallet in his inside pocket an intriguing present for roper when we get back to london now can we get moving putin awaits us at the un that evening there was no sign of blake johnson which surprised dillon because blake had said hed be there but maybe hed decided he just had better things to do vladimir putin said nothing that he had not said before the usual warning that if the us went ahead with a missile defense system the russians would have to deploy in kind and implying that the russian invasion of georgia was a warning shot delving deep into history he warned the us about overconfidence in its military might rome may have destroyed carthage but eventually it was destroyed by barbarians thats a good one miller murmured i know dillon said though i dont know if equating russia with the barbarians is really a good idea for him putin then moved on to britain turning to look at the british ambassador to the un as if addressing him personally britain was guilty of granting asylum to some who had been traitors to the russian people london had become a launching pad to fight russia in the end it seemed impossible to have normal relations anymore and on and on many people sitting there obviously agreed with him and there was applause the british ambassador answered robustly pointing out that the british security service had identified russia as a menace to national safety the thirdmostserious threat facing the country after al qaeda terrorism and iranian nuclear proliferation at the champagne reception afterwards miller said the trouble is vladimir putin is dangerously capable afghanistan iraq chechnya not to mention his career with the kgb i agree dillon nodded but in a way the most significant thing about him is that hes a patriot he believes what he says thats what makes him the most dangerous of all he nodded towards the russian delegation who were hanging on putins every word as he spoke to a hamas representative anyone of special interest over there actually there is miller said the scholarly looking man with the rather weary face and auburn hair gray suit about fifty colonel josef lermov new head of station for the gru at the london embassy at least thats the whisper fergusons heard he only told me yesterday and pulled out lermovs photo i see dillon said so theyve given up on finding his predecessor dear old boris luzhkov it seems so its hardly likely they would have succeeded considering he went into the thames with a bullet between the eyes ferguson had the disposal team fish him out the same day dillon told him ashes to ashes miller said if he couldnt take the consequences he shouldnt have joined lermov is coming this way lermov was even his smile seemed weary major miller i believe josef lermov he turned to dillon and held out his hand so nice to meet you mr dillon how flattering to be recognized dillon told him oh your reputation precedes you miller smiled hows luzhkov still on holiday lermov gave no sign of being fazed i understand he is in moscow being considered for a new post as we speak what a shame dillon said he loved london he must regret leaving after all those years time to move on lermov told him and his number two man major yuri bounine was it time for him to move on a loaded question from miller if ever there was one considering that said yuri bounine having defected was being held by ferguson in a secure location in london lermov said patiently he is on special assignment that is all i can say i can only speak for my own situation in london and not for moscow you spent enough time serving in british army intelligence to know what i mean oh i do miller beckoned to a waiter now join us in a glass of champagne josef we could celebrate your london appointment most kind of you a brief smile flickered as if he was amused at millers familiarity dillon said it isnt vodka but it will do to take along he raised his glass to vladimir putin that was quite a speech you think so lermov said a bit of a genius if you look at it dillon said miller smiled definitely a man to keep your eye on lermov said your friend blake johnson i expected him to be here too i wonder whats happened to him ah well i suppose hes moved on also he smiled that odd smile and walked away at mercy hospital on the upper east side the man known as frank barry lay in a room on the fifth floor where he had been prepped to get the bullet out of his knee his eyes were closed and he was hooked up to everything in sight the only sounds electronic beepings a young intern entered dressed for the operating room a nurse behind him he raised the sheet over barrys left knee and shuddered christ thats as bad as ive seen this guys going to be crippled barry didnt move hes been thoroughly prepped i take it the anesthetist on this one is dr hale the guy was in such agony he was begging for mercy mind you i caught him making a phone call earlier in spite of the pain so i confiscated it its on the side there he said his name is frank barry and he lives in the village mugged in central park just when i thought it was safe to go there hale said the police have been notified nobodys turned up yet but theyve been told hes going into the or so i suppose they think they can take their time okay the intern said twenty minutes he went out and the nurse followed him it was quiet in the corridor the man who emerged from the elevator at the far end wore green scrubs a skullcap and a surgical mask he took his time checking the names on doors almost casually found what he was looking for and went in barry was out there was no doubt about that as the man produced a hypo from his pocket ready charged exposed the needle and injected its contents in barrys left arm the man stood there looking down for a moment noticed barrys mobile phone on the bedside table picked it up and turned to dump the hypo in the wastebasket the door suddently opened and the nurse came in she was immediately alarmed who are you what are you doing he dropped the hypo in the bin and punched her brutally knocking her to the floor he went out hurried along the corridor and as an alarm sounded behind him didnt bother with the elevator but took the stairs plunging down fast finally reaching the basement parking garage a few moments later he was driving out upstairs of course it was pandemonium on the fifth floor with the discovery of the unconscious nurse but it would be some time before she would be able to explain what had happened the only certainty was that the man known as frank barry was dead it was just before midnight in london when major giles roper of the bombscarred face sitting at his computer at the holland park safe house got the phone call from ferguson little late for you general never mind that some bugger just tried to blow me up after id been to that do at the garrick roper turned his wheelchair to the drinks table poured a large scotch and said tell me which ferguson did the whole affair including the death of pool im at rosedene now he said naming the very private hospital he had created for his people in london a place of absolute total privacy and security headed by the finest general surgeon in london bellamys insisting on checking me thoroughly i was knocked over by the blast youve been lucky roper said ruefully and im the expert but not pool from what youve told me theres a story with him that bears investigation you could be right he wasnt my usual man and the cabinet office uses hiredcar companies when its under pressure ive told the antiterrorism people at scotland yard to play it down as much as possible fault in the car petrol explosion that kind of thing dont want the press leaping in and implying muslim bombs maybe it was well we dont want another public panic bellamys had pools body brought here and george langley will do the postmortem ill stay till hes done after hanging up roper sat there thinking about it and tony doyle the military police sergeant on night duty came in still at it major what am i going to do with you that was general ferguson he was going to his car when it blew up the drivers dead my god doyle said softly takes you back to ireland in the troubles like someones walked over my grave he shivered can i get you anything sustenance tony thats what i need get me a bacon sandwich id better get in touch with miller and dillon in new york christ theyll go berserk those two he went out roper poured another whiskey then phoned miller on his codex miller and dillon were walking back to their limousine outside the un discussing where to go for dinner when miller took the call he listened his face grim then said tell dillon he handed his codex over and dillon listened his face darkening youre sure the old sods okay so it would appear not the driver though something fishy there i think then youd better investigate what are you going to do i dont know harrys in charge im just his minder as if he needs one certainly not on this trip he went for a walk in central park and some bastard had a go mugged him you mean not sure there could have been a bit more to it than that tell me about it which dillon did and afterwards roper said very strange especially the prayer card youve got a point sean ill check it online okay talk things over and let me know what you decide dillon handed the codex back what do you want to do lets go back to the hotel and talk but just as soon as they got back to the plaza and reached the suite the room telephone sounded it was clancy smith i heard you were in town good to hear from you dillon said and put the phone on speaker not this time sean i believe you and major miller were expecting to see blake we certainly were he missed quite a speech hes in a hospital on long island suffering from a gunshot wound im with him now but hes just had surgery so hes not exactly in top shape the police recovered the body of his assailant a man named jack flynn an irish name dillon said his voice grim weve recovered his social security card and drivers license and an american passport and they look kosher to me place of birth new york well check to see if hes got a record which i expect he has somethings odd about all this blake rambled a lot to the receiving doctor and said the guy started to fire at him the moment he got on the boat he seemed intent on killing him from the word go i see dillon frowned anything else anything about this flynn character that would help with his background not really clancy said except for one thing he appears to have been of a religious turn of mind there was a sort of prayer card in his wallet dillon said holy mary mother of god pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death we who are ourselves alone how in hell do you know that clancy was truly shocked the irish for ourselves alone is sinn fein clancy are you saying this has got something to do with the ira clancy this is miller the major interrupted early evening before we left for the un i took a walk in central park i was carrying a colt in an ankle holster and good job i was okay clancy said tell me the worst miller did i could have killed this barry guy but i didnt it seemed unlikely hed want to make a police case out of it it was only later when dillon was looking at the computer photo of me barry had in his wallet that he discovered the prayer card it seemed like a curio but now that we have two of them it gets more interesting it sure does clancy said ill make careful inquiries with the nypd and find out where this barry guy ended up then move him so we can get some answers i can assure you that you will be kept out of it major well that eases my mind miller told him you seem on top of your game clancy id better get moving when are you returning to london sooner than wed expected miller said because weve got more news for you just after eleven oclock london time general ferguson was leaving a function to go home and his car blew up clancy was horrified what happened to him he was blown over by the blast as he walked towards the limousine theyve been checking him out at rosedene and he seems all right unfortunately the driver was killed i think he was closer to the car and the bomb went off prematurely dillon said fergusons going to play the whole thing down as some sort of engine failure leading to the explosion no talk of bombs well that makes sense i can see where hes going but for this to happen to charles ferguson on top of everything else tonight is hardly a coincidence which is why im going to call our two pilots now were leaving instantly well dont let me hold you gentlemen ill stay in touch perhaps an hour and a half later their gulfstream lifted out into the atlantic leaving the lights of new york behind and rose to thirty thousand feet and headed east miller and dillon sat on either side of the cabin in wide comfortable seats and parry one of the pilots entered the cabin if theres anything you want its in the kitchen area you know where the drinks cabinet is sean youre too kind dillon told him how long the weather in the midatlantic isnt perfect but at the worst id say well make farley field in six hours he went out and dillons codex sounded it was clancy have i got news for you dillon put his phone on speaker and leaned towards miller i traced barry to mercy hospital and get this he was waiting to go into the operating room when some guy in scrubs turned up and stuck a hypodermic in him a nurse discovered him and he knocked her out and ran for it long gone my friends whoever was behind barry didnt trust him to keep his mouth shut dillon said but how did they find out where he was so quickly ive seen the nurses statement when he was in great pain and waiting to be prepped she heard him call somebody on his mobile very worked up very agitated he said its me you bastard im in mercy hospital with a bullet in my knee and youd better do something about it or else she said she took the phone from him and put it on the bedside table dont tell me dillon said its gone so no way of tracing who his employer was no point in showing the nurse any faces the guy was in green scrubs a face mask skullcap the works oh the police will go through the motions but id say thats it youre still out of it major which is the main thing stay in touch and if you make any sense out of the prayer card thing let me know dillon switched off his phone got up went to the kitchen found a half bottle of krug champagne in the icebox thumbed off the cork took two glasses and returned to his seat he filled one glass and handed it to miller then filled the other are we celebrating something miller asked not exactly its just that champagne always concentrates my mind wonderfully drink up and well decide whos going to call roper roper listened with considerable calm under the circumstances but then as the man constantly at the center of the storm at the holland park safe house communications center he had long since stopped being surprised at anything so one prayer card is certainly interesting and two more than a coincidence exactly dillon said and three would be enemy action george langleys doing the postmortem now on pool so fergusons still at rosedene ill give him a call and ask him to have a look in pools wallet ill be back there you go dillon said to miller mystery piles on mystery well wait and see miller told him what about a little shuteye on a plane never dillon rose and picked up the empty half bottle of krug im sure there was another half bottle in the kitchen ill go and see at rosedene maggie duncan the matron a nononsense scot produced pools ravaged and bloodstained suit in the anteroom next to the operating room where professor george langley was performing the postmortem on the corpse of the unfortunate chauffeur she wore latex gloves as did ferguson and gingerly emptied the pockets and laid the contents on a towel spread on a table a halfempty pack of cigarettes a plastic lighter what looked like house keys on a ring a comb a car key with a plastic blackandgold tab with a telephone number on it but no name do you want to examine the wallet general she asked no just take out what you find she did there was cash fortyfive pounds in banknotes a drivers license a national insurance card a premier credit card and a cheaply printed business card that she found in one of the pockets and handed over ferguson examined the business card henry pool private hire green street kilburn he put it down on the towel and as he did she extracted another card from the wallet this is interesting she said holy mary mother of god pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death we who are ourselves alone ferguson took it from her is it important she asked it certainly is my dear ferguson put the card down took out his codex and called roper its here he said when the major answered also a business card henry pool private hire green street kilburn check it out and let dillon and miller know and heres an interesting point that i just remembered pool had a slight cockney accent but when i was following him along the pavement from the garrick and a limousine drove past and splashed him he got very angry and abused them i remember what he said because his accent suddenly sounded a little irish he said holy mother of god youve soaked me you bastards then he turned to me as if embarrassed and said he was sorrybut with the cockney back again curiouser and curiouser especially since his address is in kilburn the irish quarter of our city since time immemorial ill see you soon doyle brought roper a mug of tea as the man in the wheelchair worked his keyboard making progress major i think so look at this henry pool born in london in mother irish mary kennedy she came to england in the second world war worked as a cook married a londoner named ernest pool who served in the army was wounded in april fortyfive and received a medical discharge plus pension they moved to green street kilburn he must have got down to work sharpish old ernest for the baby to be produced in the bad news is he died of a stroke two years later roper said the wound had been in the head poor sod tony said the mother never remarried according to her social security records she continued as a cook until her late sixties died four years ago aged eighty lung cancer and henry worked as a driver of some sort delivery vans trucks was a blackcab driver for years then started being referred to as a chauffeur continued to live at the same address through all the years wife family no evidence of a marriage it sounds like a bad play if you ask me tony said the old woman widowed all those years and the sona right cozy couple just like norman bates and his mum in the movie could be ropers fingers moved over the keys again so hes been in the privatehire business for twelve years on the ministrys approved list for the last six owned a firstclass amara limousine approved by the cabinet office at grade a level which explains somebody as important as the general getting him and yet it just doesnt add up how long have you been in the military police tony seventeen years you know that well you dont need to be sherlock holmes whats the most interesting thing here yes tell us sergeant they both glanced around and found ferguson leaning in the doorway aside from the cards the nature of the targets doyle said blake johnson major miller and you generalyouve all worked together on some very rough cases in the past i agree which means major ferguson said to roper we need to take a look at the various matters weve been involved in recently as you say general im still intrigued by the religious element in the prayer cards though and the ira element his fingers moved over the keys again the borough of kilburn appeared on the screen drifted into an enlargement there we are green street roper said and the nearest roman catholic church would appear to be holy name only three streets away the priest in charge monsignor james murphy i think we should pay him a visit it might be rewarding in what way said ferguson pool would have been a parishioner at this holy name place the priest might be able to tell us where he comes into it all right go talk to him but you know what catholic priests are like seal of the confessional and all that stuff hell never tell you anything true roper said but he might talk to a fellow irishman dillon yes as i recall he lived in kilburn for a while in his youth didnt he have you spoken to him about what you just found out about pool not yet well get on with it for heavens sake ferguson turned to doyle lead on to the kitchen sergeant i need a pot of coffee very hot and very strong as you say general they went out and roper sat there thinking about it then called dillon who answered at once any progress to report im afraid youve got enemy action roper said ferguson found a prayer card in the driver pools wallet dillon reached over and shook miller awake youd better listen to this miller came awake instantly and listened to the call on speaker can you explain anything more i mean the driver and so on roper went straight into henry pool his background the facts as known when he was finished dillon said this notion you have about seeing the priest at holy name ill handle that i agree it could be useful on the other hand pool was only half irish through his mother theyre sometimes the worst de valera had a spanish father and was born in new york but his irish mother was the making of him well be seeing you round breakfast time wed better have words with clancy smith i promised to call him back he switched off and miller said sean you were a top enforcer with the ira and you never got your collar felt once do you really think this is some kind of ira hit not really most men of influence in the provisional ira are now serving in government and the community in one way or the other of course there are splinter groups still in existencethat bunch called the real ira and rumors that the irish national liberation army still waits inla miller said the ones who probably killed mountbatten and certainly assassinated airey neave coming out of the underground car park in the house of commons true dillon said and they were the great ones for using sleepers middleclass professional men sometimes university educated accountants lawyers even doctors people think theres something new in the fact that islamic terror is able to recruit from the professions but the ira was there long before them do you believe ira sleepers still exist miller asked i guess we cant take the chance they dont im going to call clancy clancy said this really raises the game once they reached him im sitting at blakes bedside now ill let you talk to him but dont talk too long by the way weve established that flynns american passport was a firstclass forgery blake said that you sean it sure is old stick dillon said clancy filled me in about miller and me and some sort of possible ira link with these prayer cards and weve now discovered the same card in fergusons drivers wallet and i hear the guy who tried to waste you flynn had a false american passport blake laughed weakly ill tell you something funny about him sean when i had him covered and told him to give up he didnt say fuck you he said fug you i only ever heard that when i was in northern ireland which shows you what gentlemen we are over there take care old son and sleep well dillon switched off and turned to miller you heard all that so there we are miller glanced at his watch two hours to go ill try to get some sleep he closed his eyes and turned his head against the pillow behind him reaching to switch off the light dillon simply sat there staring into the shadows the verse from the prayer card repeating endlessly in his brain remembering a nineteenyearold actor who had walked out of the royal academy of dramatic art to accept an offer to work with the national theatre and the night when the local priest in kilburn called to break the news to him that his father on a visit to belfast had been caught in a firefight between pira activists and british troops and killed a casualty of war sean father james murphy of the holy name church had said you must say your prayers not only the hail mary but this special one on the prayer card i give you now it is a comfort for all victims of a great cause holy mary mother of god pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death we who are ourselves alone he tried closing his eyes but it still went around and around in his brain and he opened them again filled with despair just as he had felt it that day desolation turning into rage a need for revenge that had taken the nineteenyearold on a violent path which had shaped his whole life a path from which there could be no turning back yet as always he was saved by that dark streak of gallows humor in him jesus sean he told himself softly what are you going to do cut your throat well you dont have a razor so lets have a drink on it they landed at farley just past six in the morning bad winter weather gray and rainy miller and dillon went their separate ways for miller had a mercedes provided by the cabinet office his driver arthur fox waiting tony doyle had driven down from holland park under ropers orders in dillons own mini cooper im going home sean to see to my mail knock out a report on my impressions of putin and the russian delegation at the un then take it to downing street the prime minister will want to see me personally but he likes things on paper hes very precise will you tell him of your exploits in central park ive no reason not to it happened to me sean i didnt happen to it if you follow me the way its being handled there is no story not for the press anyway the whole thing is an intelligence matter that needs to be solved hell understand hes a moralist by nature but also very practical he wont be pleased at whats happened and hell expect a result well lets see how quickly we can give him one dillon got in the mini beside tony doyle and they drove away miller got in the back of the mercedes and discovered a bunch of mail good man arthur he opened the first letter thought youd like to get started major traffics building up already could take us an hour to get to dover street no problem i can save a lot of time here due to your usual efficiency dillon arrived at holland park just after seven im going to shower and change and then im going to partake of maggie halls jamaican version of the great british breakfast hey i could give you that doyle said for he was of jamaican stock born in the east end of london dillon went into the computer room but there was no sign of roper and then henderson the other sergeant entered wearing a tracksuit good to see you back sir major ropers in the wet room having a good soak were also hosting general ferguson hes in one of the secondfloor suites no sign of movement if youll excuse me ill get back to the major fine im going to my room tell him ill join him for breakfast at dover street miller told arthur to get a breakfast at the local cafe and come back in an hour once inside the house he went straight upstairs to the spare bedroom which was now his it was a decent size for an eighteenthcentury town house and had its own shower room the magnificent master bedroom suite at the end of the landing once shared with his wife he had kept exactly as it was before her murder but the door was locked and opened only once a week by the housekeeper seeing to the room and keeping it fresh he stripped his clothes off left them in the laundry basket showered and shaved pulled on a terrycloth robe and went down to the kitchen he ate two bananas drank a glass of cold milk from the refrigerator went into his study sat at his computer and produced his report satisfied he went upstairs and changed ready for arthur exactly on time as ordered he called in at downing street showing his face at the cabinet office where he was greeted with enthusiasm by henry frankel a good friend who had smoothed the way for miller in many ways in the terrible days following the death of his wife you look well harry how was vladimir worrying henry to be honest i think i find him rather impressive on occasion and im not supposed to certainly not miller handed him his report all there but i expect the pm saw it on television not the same sweetheart said henry his gayness breaking through occasionally who believes in tv anymore youve got a genius for seeing things as they really are lermov was with putin i hear hes the new head of station in kensington i believe hes expected this weekend i wonder what theyve done with boris luzhkov god knows miller said there were few things henry frankel didnt know about but boris luzhkov ending up dead in the thames was one of them the boss is in and hes expecting this so ill deliver it now he said youre to wait so help yourself coffee all kinds of tea juices weve got a miracle machine now just press the right button which miller did and also glanced at the times frankel was in and out several times but it was thirtyfive minutes before he came over to him and smiled everything on the go this morning but hell see you now miller followed him frankel opened the door of the office and stood to one side come in harry the pm was behind his desk take a chair firstclass report thank you prime minister putin didnt say anything he hasnt said before but he does have this dangerous gift of sounding quite reasonable as i know to my cost but i must tell you that ive had charles ferguson on the phone a terrible business this incident with his car and the death of the driver i dont know what the general has told you prime minister but it now seems certain that the driver was party to the whole affair it would seem likely that the device whatever it was exploded prematurely unfortunately for him general ferguson is handling the matter as if it was an accident not a bomb so there should be no problem with the media yes thats the last thing we need fergusons also filled me in on the unfortunate business on long island and on your own brush with death in central park he sighed trouble follows you everywhere i send youkosovo washington lebanon you always end up shooting someone you are the most irregular member of parliament i have ever known hardly my fault prime minister when you send me to places where people are liable to do a bit of shooting themselves a valid point all those years in the intelligence corps dealing with the wild men of ulster made you spectacularly good at violent solutions your decision to leave the army on your fathers death and put yourself up for his seat in parliament has proved most fortuitous although it would have been slightly more convenient if wed both been members of the same political party well you cant have everything miller said im aware of that no one in the cabinet has any kind of military experience whatsoever which is why i broke the rules and made you an undersecretary of state you can be on occasion a thoroughly ruthless bastard and there are times when thats something thats needed but i am attached to you prime minister and that makes all the difference flattery gets you nowhere miller im due in the house soon so youve got fifteen minutes to explain this whole damn mess and what you and ferguson intend to do about it which miller did rapidly and fluently covering everything thats it i think and quite enough prayer cards killings a bombing and to top all that this suggestion of an ira link that cant be possible ive enough on my plate with all these banks failing plus the worst recession in years i know there are a few crackpot organizations out there still demanding a united ireland but enough is enough sort it harry sort itand quickly he stood up the door opened behind miller as he rose and henry frankel ushered him out how do you know when people are leaving dillon asked are you a magician or something absolutely love take care miller went out calling arthur on his mobile as soon as you like and well make it holland park dillon after a shower and change went to the canteen where he discovered roper hair still damp sitting in his wheelchair in a blue tracksuit enjoying breakfast and immensely cheerful ferguson was sitting opposite enjoying scrambled eggs there you are you devil what went on in new york then you were supposed to be his minder its a miracle he was wearing that ankle holster which i knew nothing about maggie hall entered with scrambled eggs and withdrew diplomatic immunity covered us when we landed in the gulfstream obviously but he couldnt have worn it to the un probably just a whim ferguson said theres no question of him going into parliament with it but i suspect he does in other places in london he glanced at dillon do you agree dillon reached down to his right ankle and produced a colt all the rage these days i wouldnt be without one roper said a damn good job he was carrying when he took that walk in the park dillon reached for toast and marmalade and said cheerfully oh i suspect hed have thought of something ghastly as an alternative a man of infinite resource and guile our harry you can say that again he took a piece of dillons toast and his codex sounded it was billy salter that you roper im at the dark man weve had a right old business down here some geezer tried a little arson in the early hours roper waved a hand at the others and turned his codex on speaker say again billy wed all gone to bed earlyruby harry me joe baxter and sam hall he continued naming the salters minders joe was still dressed and watching a latenight movie on television when he heard a noise from the bar he knocked on sams door to alert him then smelt petrol so he moved into the bar turned on the lights and found this guy emptying a can of petrol all over the place the till rifled cash drawers open who was it how do i know theyre just fishing him out of the thames he was wearing a black tracksuit and ski mask joe said and he looked like a terrorist from central casting joe had his smith and wesson with him he wasnt keen on firing in case the petrol ignited so the guy threw the can at him and legged it sam had joined joe by then and they went after him what happened the old ford van at the end of the wharf it always has a key in it not worth stealing i reckon hed checked it out previously because he ran straight for it was in and driving off but the wrong way there was no place to turn and he simply ran over the edge of the wharf in the dark with him in it the police are here now theyll have a recovery team get the truck later but a police divers been down and hes found the guy hes gone down again with another diver to try and get him harrys here and hed like a word the unmistakable cockney voice of billys uncle echoed around the canteen harry salter a gangster for most of his life and now a property millionaire said well this is nice roper we could all have been roasted in our beds what the hell was the bugger playing at there was a grand in the till wasnt that enough it was ferguson who said its me harry and dillons just back from new york with the strangest story youve heard in a long time he turned to roper you explain which roper did standing on cable wharf in wapping near his beloved pub the dark man harry said jesus christ roper this is incredible but true harry the guy who shot blake the one who attacked miller and then the generals rogue driver last night all were in possession of the same prayer card tell me again what it says roper did the police will search your arsonists body when they get him up billy can use some muscle by flashing his mi card see where it gets you and call back ferguson said an interesting one gentlemen what is harry miller entered at that moment well it goes something like this roper began at the end of cable wharf were three patrol cars and a mediumsized police truck the sign on one side reading salvage amp recovery there were two divers down there in scuba gear four uniformed policemen and an inspector who had turned up and gone to inspect the bar harry and billy were standing by watching with baxter and hall and ruby moon who was wearing a reefer coat two sizes too large the inspector emerged from the bar and approached nasty business mr salter stinks in there youll have to close for a while could have been very nasty if hed dropped a match harry had known him for years a real evil bastard had to be to do a thing like that we could have all ended up cooked for breakfast sure you havent been annoying anyone lately on my life parky those days are long gone i own most of the developments round here and my nephew billys got an mi warrant card in his pocket yes i heard theyd taken him on i was impressed id always understood they wouldnt accept anyone with a record true parky it was the folly of youth where billy was concerned but all wiped clean now you must have friends in high places these days billy oh i do inspector billy said and heres my warrant to prove it he offered it as you know im involved in cases where the highest security and the welfare of the nation is involvedso id like to check the identity of the man whos being hauled up at this moment it could explain the severity of his intentions are you saying you could have been his target its possible billy said and at that moment an ambulance rolled up two paramedics emerged opened the rear door and pulled out a stretcher which they took forward to where the four policemen were hauling up the drowned man in a sling water poured from the man as they laid him down on the stretcher and one of the paramedics removed the balaclava revealing the unshaven face handsome enough eyes closed in death dark hair with silver streaks in it good god i know this one parky said he used to live round here when i was a young constable bagged him coming out of a booze shop hed broken into on wapping high street costello fergus costello he went down the steps for two years petty criminal when he got out irish bloke drunk and disorderly that kind of thing always getting arrested can you remember what happened to him billy asked not really its so long ago they watched as a police officer went through the dead mans pockets producing a bunch of skeleton keys a folded flickknife and a smith amp wesson revolver which they handed to parky he certainly meant business a passport came next which turned out to be irish see i was right parky said but frowned when he opened it john docherty and theres a dublin address he shook his head and handed the passport to billy even though hes dead you can see from the photo its the same man youre right billy gave it to harry must be a forgery lets see whats in the wallet parky went to his car opened the wallet and took out the wet contentsa drivers license a social security card and a credit card all in the name of john docherty and an address in point street kilburn so he was living under a false name harry said parky nodded you know i remember now its all coming back he used to get in a lot of trouble over the drink and then there was a refuge opened run by catholics they used to get visits from a priest who had a big influence on the boozers there i cant remember his name but as i recall costello stopped getting into trouble and started churchgoing and then he cleared off the officer who had been searching the pockets said theres this sir tucked away he offered the damp card and parky examined it ive seen something like this before its a prayer card billy took it from him and read it aloud holy mary mother of god pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death we who are ourselves alone harry said but what the hell does it mean parky smiled i told you hed turned to religion didnt i so i was right you certainly were billy said ill hang on to this and the passport you can keep the rest they met in the computer room at holland park all of them ferguson presiding and harry salter was a very angry man indeed i mean what in the hell is going on its simple harry said dillon youve been targeted you and billy just like blake johnson general ferguson and major miller maybe somebody thinks its payback time all very well harry pointed out but that bastard costello or docherty or whatever he called himself was prepared to torch the pub just to get at billy and me whoever these people are theyre highly organized and totally ruthless the wouldbe assassin in central park frank barry called somebody and told them where he was the instant response was an executioner exactly miller put in and one professional enough to remember to snatch barrys mobile before departing so details of that call couldnt be traced ive spoken to clancy smith brought him up to speed including the arson attack on the pub roper said his people have established that flynns passport was an extremely good forgery as was his drivers license and social security card so theres no way of checking if he had a police record ferguson put in exactly roper carried on his address in greenwich village is a oneroom apartment sparsely furnished basic belongings not much more than clothes an old lady on the same floor said he was polite and kept to himself shed no idea what he did for a living and was surprised to hear he had an american passport as shed always thought he was irish shes a catholic herself and often saw him at mass at the local church miller said interesting that costellocumdocherty has a forged irish passport too and his religion had been the saving of him according to inspector parkinson a passport which claims he was born in dublin yet we know from his other identity documents that his address is in point street kilburn dillon said and henry pool from green street kilburn ferguson said too many connections here this would appear to be a carefully mounted campaign another point worth remembering roper said ive processed the computer photo of major miller that was in barrys wallet his fingers worked the keys and the photo came on screen just a crowded street but thats definitely the side of a london black cab at the edge of the pavement the photo was definitely taken in london id say careful preparation beforehand by someone who knew i was going to new york miller said yes and remember that blake was only visiting his place on long island because he was going to the un roper shook his head its scary stuff when you think about it salter said but nobody had a go at you dillon when you were in new york why not because i wasnt supposed to be there it was only decided at the last moment that i should join harry nobody has had a go at me either roper told him but that doesnt mean theyre not going to exactly ferguson said which raises the point againwhat in the hell is this all about lets face it billy said weve been up against a lot of very bad people in our day al qaeda a wide range of islamic terrorists hamas hezbollah weve been in lebanon hazar bosnia kosovo and you older guys talk about the cold war but the cold war is back it seems to me so we can add in the russians which adds up to a lot of enemies dillon put in lermov wholl be the new head of station for the gru here was at the un reception with putin and we were talking to him baited him really asked after boris luzhkov and was told he was in moscow being considered for a new post six pounds of gray ash that bastard billy said and when i asked after yuri bounine he said hed been given another assignment he knew something miller said im sure of it well if he knows that bounine is guarding alex kurbsky at his aunt svetlanas house in belsize park were in trouble ferguson told him they were all silent at the mention of the famous russian writer whose defection had caused so much mayhem recently but of whom theyd all become unaccountably fond dillon said were going to have to do something general they could be in harms way im aware of that dillon ferguson snapped but you could widen the circle to include a lot of people whove been involved with us he turned to miller what about your sister major she helped us out in that business involving the ira in county louth last year she even shot one of them millers sister lady monica starling an archaeologist and cambridge don had indeed proved her mettleand in the process had become as close a friend to dillon as a woman could miller frowned and turned to dillon hes got a point sean we should speak to her roper said if the rest of you can shut up for a moment ill get her on the line he was answered at once she sounded fraught her voice echoing through the speakers who is this no need to bite my head off darling said miller its your big brother its so good to hear from you harry i was going to call i thought you and sean were still in new york whats happened where are you im at the hospital here in cambridge for gods sake tell me monica there was a faculty party at a hotel outside cambridge last night dear old professor george dunkley was desperate to go i volunteered to drive him there so he could enjoy his port and so on six miles out into the countryside a bloody great truck started to follow us and just stayed on our tail it didnt matter what i did it wouldnt go away and then when we came to a wider section of the road it came alongside and swerved into us are you okay yes but george has his left arm broken we were hurled into a grass verge and crashed against a wall i called the police on my mobile and they were there in no time and the truck oh he crashed farther on they found the wreck but the driver had cleared off the police sergeant whos been dealing with me says the truck was stolen from somewhere in london george is going to be in hospital for a while a terrible thing at his age and you are coming to dover street to stay at the house with me thats sweet of you harry but ive got seminars and theres my book to hell with your seminars and you can work on your book at dover street harry whats happening dillon cut in monica my love listen to the man its no coincidence whats happened to you bad things have been happening to all of us we need you safe and among friends her voice was quiet whats going on sean ill explain when i pick you up miller said we should be there in round two hours go straight back to your rooms pack and dont go out again if you say so harry the line cleared and everyone was silent for a moment miller said sorry general i must go of course you must so get moving miller went out fast and roper said open warfare they certainly mean business whoever they are do you think theres an ira touch to this dillon nodded since the peace process the ira hands have fanned out looking to make money he said weve dealt with plenty of them in the past desperate for work whove offered their skills to various countries in the russian federation worked with the plo hamas hezbollah then there was kosovo and chechnya iraq roper said plenty of money to be made there one way or another for the kind of men who were members of the provisional ira with all their military skills which is exactly the kind of thing i was doing for years until the general here made me an offer i couldnt refuse dillon shook his head thats what this all smells like to meira for hire ill take myself off to kilburn and see what i can find out would you care for some company billy said why not what about you harry salter got up you go with dillon billy ill take your alfa and get back to the dark man and see how rubys coping with the cleaning he went out and ferguson said on your way then you two im going to have a word with clancy at the white house then ill visit our russian friends in belsize park he turned to roper whenever youre ready major call clancy on his personal line clancy answered at once nine oclock on a washington morning general how are things theyve moved at some speed but before i fill you in how is blake what would you expect from an old vietnam hand hes being airlifted in a medical corps helicopter to a hospital in washington this afternoon give him our best let me tell you whats happened now which he did and clancy was horrified this is incredible whoever these people are they certainly dont take prisoners everything thats already happened and now the attempted arson attack on the dark man and the assault on monica starling shows were up against truly ruthless people and i take your point about who could be next exactly alexander kurbsky his aunt svetlana and their friend katya zorin kurbskys a marked man hes still posing as a leukemia victim on chemotherapy and the change in his physical appearance is remarkable but if the russians get wind of his location that wont hold them for long kurbsky had originally been sent in by the gru to penetrate british intelligence but once hed found out how his bosses had duped him about his sister hed had a change of heart in particular hed saved blake johnsons ass when hed been kidnapped in london and then he and bounine had saved the vice presidents life from a crazed luzhkov as i recall said clancy there was a presidential promise of asylum in the us if kurbsky ever wanted it im sure that would be honored if you think its a good idea what would you suggest we have a list of facilities but heron island off the florida coast would be perfect the secret service use it only for the most special cases a hundred percent security the staff vetted in every possible way decent climate and the house im thinking of is spectacular how soon could you arrange all this twentyfour hours i assume youll handle your end it may not be forever general but i can promise theyll be safe on heron island with luck well take care of the threat between us in a few weeks and then we can think again thank you old friend ferguson told him ill be back to you roper had of course heard everything sounds good are you going up to see them now yes i think so one less problem if they agree and ferguson went out his daimler was back and with it martin his usual driver and they drove to belsize park ferguson going through everything that had happened still had not found a solution when martin parked in the mews beside chamber court at the side entrance of the high stone wall ferguson announced himself to the intercom and the gate buzzed and swung open the garden was beautifulrhododendron bushes cypress trees plane trees more bushes surrounding a lovely curving lawn as he advanced towards the conservatory bounine stepped out of the bushes wearing overalls holding a baseball bat menacingly in his hand its general ferguson you idiot kurbsky emerged from the trees a sad gaunt figure with the skull and the haunted face of someone on chemotherapy although in his case he took drugs to make him look that way whats up ferguson asked weve had an intruder kurbsky said yesterday after supper we were going to watch television with the ladies i stepped out of the conservatory to have a smoke and thought i heard something over by the garage so i went to investigate someone jumped me a man in a bomber jacket and jeans he was closer to the garage than me and made the security lights come on what happened he pulled a flickknife and sprung the blade so i smacked him about a bit he was on the ground after i took the knife so i relieved him of his wallet and i moved over to the garage security lights to inspect it bounine came out on the terrace and called which distracted me the guy scrambled up ran like hell and got over the wall were the ladies alarmed obviously the security alarms sound inside the house but they were easily reassured russian women are tough as nails the wallet were the contents interesting not particularly fiftyfour pounds a social security card and a credit card all in the name of matthew cochran did he live in kilburn no close though camden town sixty lower church street and thats it nothing like holy mary mother of god pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death we who are ourselves alone the prayer card bounine said to kurbsky you forgot that kurbsky frowned and said why is it important it means you are all in great danger lets find the ladies and ill spell it out for you and he led the way along to the terrace and the conservatory in the victorian conservatory crammed with plants there was silence when ferguson finished talking kurbsky had produced cochrans wallet and taken out the prayer card which lay on a small iron table beside it svetlana kelly kurbskys aunt sat in a wicker chair katya zorin svetlanas partner a handsome fortyyearold with cropped hair who was an artist and theater scene designer sat close to her holding the older womans right hand these are terrible things you tell us general such violence is too much to bear but it must be faced my dear the prayer card was involved with all these attacks ive just discussed except for the business involving monica starling its hardly a coincidence and when i come here i find this he picked up the prayer card and held it high i repeat you are in great danger if you stay here or stay in london for that matter i think you should take the americans offer of sanctuary to leave my home is a terrible prospect all my beautiful things the world is so untrustworthy these days svetlana was distressed ferguson threw down the card youve heard the full story blake is in the hospital badly wounded four of the cardholders are violently dead the attempt to burn down salters pub could have killed everybody in it he turned to kurbsky please alex just go and take them with you and leave us to hunt down whoever is behind this kurbsky bent down and kissed svetlana on the head hes right babushka my decision we go and we go tonight is this not so general youll take the gulfstream from farley field nobody will know you have gone she was weeping now and katya kissed her on the cheek all will be well my love alexander is right we must go ferguson said ill make a deal with you svetlana its important for alex to go if there are strange and wicked people stirring but you neednt worry about your paintings or your antiques ill arrange for a caretaker to live here and take care of them all right now i must go kurbsky walked to the gate with him ferguson opened it and turned it really is the smart move until we get to the bottom of all this kurbsky said im sure youre right its just that ive never been very good at running away on this occasion you must think of the women ill see you off from farley roper will be in touch to confirm the timing as martin got out of the daimler ferguson said ill sit beside you martin got the door open it started to rain and ferguson scrambled inside the big man slid behind the wheel and drove away thank god thats sorted ferguson said things looking a bit better general martin inquired not really ferguson said actually the road ahead looks pretty bloody stony but there it is he leaned back called roper and filled him in so the intruder at belsize park definitely makes their departure a top priority ill organize it at once and that man kurbsky tangled withmatthew cochran wasnt it camden town sixty lower church street we should check on him too youre right see to it when roper made the call dillon and billy were in a bar on camden high street dillon had suggested a luncheon sandwich but the truth was he was thinking ahead about what was waiting for him in kilburn billy suspected that dillon needed a drink and went along with the suggestion though billy never drank he was a bit alarmed though when the irishman downed his second large bushmills then roper called dillon obviously couldnt put it on speaker in the pub so he listened then said okay well handle it were in camden high street now he relayed to billy what roper had just told him well go and look this guy cochran up do you know the address no but the sat nav will billy said so lets move it they twisted and turned through a number of side streets finally reaching one called church there was no number and beyond the street was a vast site obviously cleared for building there was a convenience store on the corner called patels freshly painted incongruous against the old decaying houses wait for me dillon said and got out of the cooper the store was crammed with just about everything you would ever need and the stocky indian in traditional clothes was welcoming can i help you sir i was looking for an address lower church street ah long gone many streets were knocked down last year and lower church street was one of them they are to build flats i was looking for a man named matthew cochran who used that address but i remember number well it was a lodging house thanks very much dillon returned to the cooper no joy there lower church street was knocked down last year and the address was just a lodging house lets move on like many areas of london kilburn was changing new apartment blocks here and there but much of it was still what it had always been streets of terrace houses dating from victorian and edwardian times even rows of backtoback houses it was the favored irish quarter of london and always had been it always reminds me of northern ireland this place we just passed a pub called the green tinker so thats catholic and were coming up to the royal george which has got to be protestant just like belfast when you think about it billy said nothings changed dillon told him he thought back again to his mother dying when he was born his father raising him with the help of relatives mainly from her family until in need of work his father moved to london and took him with him dillon was twelve years old and they did very well together right here in kilburn his father made decent money because he was a cabinetmaker the highest kind of carpenter he was never short of work dillon went to a top catholic grammar school which led him to a scholarship at rada at sixteen onstage with the national theatre at nineteenand then came his fathers death and nothing was ever the same again billy said where did you live near here lodge lane a victorian backtoback he opened up the attic my father did put a bathroom in a little palace by the time he had finished with it do you ever go back nothing to go back to the fella who tried to incinerate you costellodocherty his address was point street well take a look will you still know your way like the back of my hand billy so just follow what i tell you which billy did ending up in a street of terrace houses doors opening to the pavement there were cars of one kind or another parked here and there but it was remarkably quiet this is going back a few years billy said as they drew up the door of number was interesting for two reasons first there was yellow sceneofcrime police tape across it forbidding entrance second a formal black mourning wreath hung from the door knocker interesting dillon said and got out and billy followed the curtain twitched at the window of the next house lets have words knock them up billy did the door opened and a young woman in jeans and a smock holding a baby appeared what is it she asked with what dillon easily recognized as a derry accent billy flashed his mi warrant card police were just checking that everythings okay your lot have been and gone hours ago they explained that docherty had been killed in a car accident i dont know why theyve sealed the door to stop anyone getting in he lived on his own kept himself to himself what not even a girlfriend i never even saw him with a boyfriend though he was of that persuasion if you ask me dillon turned on his belfast accent is that a fact girl dear but one friend surely to leave that mourning wreath she warmed to him at once ah thats caitlin daly for you a heart of gold that woman and goodness itself well god bless her for that dillon told her a fine child youve got there why thank you she was beaming now they got in the cooper and billy drove away you dont half turn it on when it suits you fifteen green street now just follow my directions billy did as he was told whats the point we know pool lived on his own i thought you wanted to go and look up the local priest well get to that so just do as i say and dillon gave him his directions the houses in green street were substantial edwardian and semidetached with a small garden in front and a narrow path around the side leading to a rear garden this is better billy said no garages though people who lived here in had no need for garages dillon opened a gate and walked up to the front door through the garden followed by billy the door was exactly the same as the one in point street with the police tape across it and the black mourning wreath hanging from the knocker caitlin daly again it would appear the door of the adjacent house was within touching distance over the hedge it opened now and a whitehaired lady peered out dillon turned on the charm again this time pulling out his own warrant card police he told her just checking that all is well the woman was very old he could see that and obviously distressed such a tragedy the police sergeant this morning told me he died in a terrible crash somewhere in central london i cant understand it ive driven with him and he was so careful a professional chauffeur yes its very sad dillon told her i knew his mother mary so well a lovely irish lady she was rambling now widowed for years a nurse it was a great blow to him when she died eightyone she was from cork dillon said gently i know it well wasnt michael collins himself a cork man who she said im sorry and me thinking you were mrs caitlin daly she looked bewildered the mourning wreath on the door oh im not caitlin and i saw her leave it earlier her mother was a wonderful friend to me died last year from lung cancer only seventyfive she was still living with caitlin at the presbytery by the church but caitlin isnt married never was shes been housekeeper to father murphy for years used to teach at the catholic school now she just looks after the presbytery and father murphy and two curates she was very fey now oh dear ive got it wrong again hes monsignor murphy now a wonderful man dillon gave her his best smile youve been very kind god bless you they went back to the cooper and billy said as he settled behind the wheel dillon youd talk the devil into showing you the way out of hell the information you got out of that old duck beggars belief a gift billy dillon told him modestly youve got to be irish to understand get stuffed billy told him sticks and stones dillon said but everything that befuddled old lady told me was useful information i heard pool was wonderful so was his mother this caitlin bird is beyond rubies and as for the good monsignor murphy from the sound of it they got him from central casting he turned left on dillons instructions mind you he must be good to get that kind of rank in a local church where hes their priestincharge turn right now dillon told him and what would you be knowing about it ive never talked much about my childhood dillon my old man was a very violent man killed in gang warfare when i was three my mum was married to harrys brother and she was an exceptional lady who died of breast cancer when i was nineteen i really went off the rails after that which is understandable it was harry who pulled me round and you you bastard when you entered our lives you introduced me to philosophy remember gave me a sense of myself so where is this leading dillon asked the cooper turned another corner and pulled up outside their destination church of the holy name it said on the painted signboard beside the open gate along with the times of confession and mass the building had a victoriangothic look to it which made sense because it was only in the victorian era that roman catholics by law were allowed to build churches again dillon saw a tower a porch a vast wooden door bound in iron in a failed attempt to achieve a medieval look they stayed in the car for a few moments billy said the thing is my mother was a strict roman catholic not our harry he doesnt believe in anything he cant put his hand on but she really put me onstage when i was a kid i was an acolyte i tell you dillon it meant everything to her when it was my turn to serve at mass i know dillon said scarlet cassock white cotta dont tell me you did that im afraid so and billy ive really got news for you i did it in this very church were about to enter i was twelve when my father brought me from northern ireland to live with him in kilburn that means it was thirtyseven years ago when i first entered this church and the priest in charge is the same man james murphy as i recall he was born in which would make him eighty but why didnt you mention that to ferguson and the others whats going on i knew something was dillon talk to me dillon sat there for a moment longer then took out his wallet and from one of the pockets produced a prayer card it was old creased slightly curling at the golden edges holy mary mother of god pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death we who are ourselves alone jesus dillon billy took it from him where the hell did this come from it was father james murphy as he was then who first received the news of my fathers death in that firefight in belfast an incident that turned me into what i am shaped my whole life a casualty of war he told me gave me the card and begged me to pray he smiled bleakly took the card and replaced it in the wallet so here we are lets go in shall we i see from the board someones hearing confessions in there although it may not be the great man himself he got out and billy joined him his face pale i dont know what to say they entered and walked through the cemetery which was also victoriangothic and rather pleasant marble effigies winged angels engraved headstones and cypress trees to one side i used to like this when i was a boy liked it more than i liked it inside the church in a way its what we all come to when you think of it dillon said for christs sake cut it out billy said youre beginning to worry me he turned the ring on the great door and dillon followed him through there was faint music playing something subdued and soothing the whole place was in a kind of half darkness but was unexpectedly warm no doubt because of central heating the usual church smell so familiar from childhood filled his nostrils dillon dipped his fingers in the holy water font as he went past and crossed himself and billy after hesitating did the same the sanctuary lamp glowed through the gloom and to the left there was a mary chapel the virgin and child floating in a sea of candlelight the place had obviously had money spent on it in the past victorian stained glass abounded carvings that looked like medieval copies and a christ on the cross which was extremely striking the altar and choir stalls too were ornate and it had to be admitted beautifully carved a woman was down there wearing a green smock arranging flowers by the altar fifty or so dillon told himself a strong face with a good mouth handsome in a jane austen kind of way the hair fair and well kept with no gray showing although that was probably due more to the attentions of a good hairdresser than nature she wore a white blouse and gray skirt under the smock and halfheeled shoes she held pruning scissors in one gloved hand and she turned and glanced at them coolly for a moment then returned to her flowers dillon moved towards the confessional boxes on the far side there were three of them but the light was on in only one two middleaged women were waiting and billy sitting two pews behind them beside dillon leaned forward to decipher the name card in the slot on the priests confessional door youre all right it says monsignor james murphy a man in a raincoat emerged from the box and walked away along the aisle and one of the women went in they sat there in silence and she was out in not much more than five minutes she sat down and her friend went in she was longer more like fifteen minutes then finally emerged murmured to her friend and they departed here i go dillon whispered to billy got up opened the door of the confessional box entered and sat down please bless me father he said to the man on the other side of the grille conscious of the strong aquiline face in profile the hair still long and silvery rather than gray murphy said may our lord jesus bless you and help you to tell your sins oh that would be impossible for they are so many the head turned slightly towards him when did you last make a confession my son so long ago i cant remember are your sins so bad that you shrink from revealing them not at all i know the secrets of the confessional are inviolate but acknowledging the deaths of so many at my hands in no way releases me from the burden of them murphy seemed to straighten ah i think i see your problem you are a soldier or have been a soldier as with so many men these days thats true enough then you may certainly be absolved but you must help by seeking comfort in prayer oh ive tried that father saying holy mary mother of god pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death we who are ourselves alone there was a moment of silence then murphy turned full face trying to peer through the grille who are you god bless you father but isnt that breaking the rules still ill let it go for once and put you out of your misery sean dillon as ever was thirty years since you last saw me i was nineteen and you were the man the police asked to break the news that my father was dead killed accidently while on a trip to belfast you told me he was a casualty of war sean murphys voice quavered i cant believe it what can i say i think you said it all thirty years ago when you urged me to pray particularly the special one on a prayer card you gave me the prayer ive just quoted to you yes i recollect now the voice was unsteady a wonderful prayer to the virgin mary i remember you saying it would be a comfort for all victims of a great cause which made sense as the prayer is directed at we who are ourselves alone and ourselves alone in irish is sinn fein so it had a definite political twist to it urging a nineteenyearold boy whose father had ended up dead on a pavement in the falls road to get angry clear off to belfast and join the provos to fight for the glorious cause now arent you proud of me the door to dillons half of the confessional box was yanked open and the woman in the green smock was there blazingly angry come out of there she shouted and grabbed at him behind her billy moved in to pull her off you got good and loud sean only her and me in the place and we heard most of what you said she pulled away from billy and glared at dillon get out of here before i call the police billy produced his warrant card dont waste your breath mi and hes got one too the other door opened and murphy came out an imposing figure at six feet with the silver hair dressed in a full black cassock an alb violet stole draped over his shoulder leave it caitlin this is sean dillon as a boy of nineteen i had to tell him his father was murdered by british soldiers in ulster he left for belfast for his fathers funeral and never returned there were rumors that he had cast in his lot with the provisional ira if so i cant see that it in any way concerns me as to the prayer card that i gave him as a comfort it may be found on the internet if you look carefully sean and has been available to all since easter we have a hope of mary hospice and refuge where the card is readily available he put a hand on dillons left shoulder you are deeply troubled sean that is so obvious your dear father worked and did so much for the church in his spare time the lectern in beechwood by the high altar was his work if i can help you in any way i am here not right now dillon said but before i go the score for dead cardholders right now is four henry pool john docherty frank barry in new york jack flynn on long island what on earth are you talking about murphy looked shocked dont listen to him hes lost his wits entirely caitlin moved close to dillon and slapped his face get out my but youre the hard woman come on billy lets go billy opened the great door and dillon turned and murphy and caitlin were standing close he with his head inclined while she whispered to him dillon called if you know anybody named cochran tell him we found his wallet and the prayer card too god bless all here and caitlin daly snapped completely get out you bastard her voice echoed around the church and dillon followed billy to the cooper and they drove away do you think theres anything doing billy asked oh yes dillon said however bizarre it sounds i think theres something going on there if thats so dont you think youve given a lot away i intended to back to holland park billy and he leaned back in his seat and closed his eyes thinking about it at the sacristy caitlin daly leaned against the door and fumbled in her shoulder bag pushed aside a belgian leon semiautomatic pistol produced an encrypted mobile phone and punched in a number it was answered at once a mans voice the slightest tinge of a yorkshire accent caitlin just listen she said weve got trouble she quickly told him what had taken place what are we going to do how did murphy take it how do you expect hes too good for this bloody world all he feels is pity for dillon well he would wouldnt he leave it with me ill handle it somehow the church was very quiet now when she returned and murphy knelt before the altar his head bowed in prayer and she sat in a front pew and waited when he stood up and walked to her she said youve been praying for dillon havent you of course so sad that business of his fathers death in belfast all those years ago his life has so obviously been a hard and bitter one what else can i do but pray for him she stifled her anger with difficulty sometimes monsignor i think youre much too forgiving but take my arm and well go back to the presbytery for tea he did as he was told and as they walked away he said poor boy he seems completely unhinged a little earlier miller and his sister had been on their way to dover street since becoming aware that her dearly loved brother was a man of dark secrets monica had also learned that anything he told her however dangerous and extreme was very probably true for an academic like her there was an undeniable thrill to it all especially her involvement with sean dillon when miller picked her up at her rooms in cambridge she was already packed and waiting for him and he filled her in on everything as he knew it right up to that moment her reaction to the event in central park was highly practical well all i can say is thank god you were carrying he grinned i see youve picked up the slang of our dark trade already i dont have any option not with you and sean round ive checked on george dunkley by the way and hes doing fine thank god they were halfway to london when roper called him and filled him in about belsize park and what was to happen what about sean roper said he went to see what he could dig up in kilburn took billy with him is something wrong monica asked him when he hung up you could say that he told her about the intruder at belsize park so this guy cochran got away but lost his wallet and they found another copy of that prayer card we might as well call in at holland park instead of going straight to the house theyll be finalizing the gulfstreams departure from farley this evening and then theres sean god knows what hes getting up to in kilburn but knowing him its bound to be interesting he leaned over and said to fox change of plan arthur as youve just heard as you say major poor svetlana monica said that beautiful house and all those lovely antiques and paintings its going to break her heart i appreciate that but its not going to be forever and shes got katya to support her and theyll be safe thats the important thing whoever were up against theyre pretty nasty and alexander maybe in america he can get back to writing another war and peace perhaps which hes perfectly capable of producing she said primly and the mercedes approaching the holland park safe house pulled up at the security gates and waited for them to open they found roper in the computer room and ferguson on his phone he waved to them then walked out still talking roper said hes been on and off the phone all afternoon half a dozen times with clancy but everything is set now we pick them up at belsize park at seven itll take forty minutes to get to farley field and theyre all off by eight where are they heading miller asked andrews air force base where theyll refuel and then move on to another base in florida and then proceed by helicopter to the island monica went and kissed him and ruffled his hair you look tired love i always do these days its my new look sorry about dunkley there seem to be bad people out there are you okay a few bruises here and there it could have been worse i suppose so at least with kurbsky and the ladies out of it well have a level playing field and we can just concentrate on discovering who these people are maggie hall appeared from the kitchen face beaming and how are you lady monica its real nice to see you again mr dillon will be smiling i know that can i get you some tea i know youve been traveling ferguson loomed up behind her well all have tea my dear and some of those delicious chocolate biscuits that you seem to have an inexhaustible supply of you can have anything you want general she departed and ferguson held monica for a moment and kissed her cheek sorry about having to drag you away from cambridge like this but its for your own good im afraid has it been made plain to you what were up against its been made plain to me whats happened the behavior of the wretch who drove his truck into me was proof enough of what were up against youre armed i trust ferguson asked she opened her shoulder bag and produced a colt as provided by roper when i first signed up hollowpoint cartridges at all times we are really going to war my dear he turned to roper any sign of dillon and billy not yet ill call them if you like no need ferguson said heres the tea maggie put her tray on the table and poured tea for everyone and distributed biscuits smiling and cheerful and made ferguson roper and miller all laugh too monica thought how strange it was that these men she had come to know so well including the brother she had never really known properly until now these men who were so civilized and jolly were all in the death business had all killed people she felt slightly unreal for a moment and roper with that ravaged face glanced at her and stopped smiling are you all right yes fine ill have a drink if you dont mind long journey and im tired she moved to the drinks cabinet found a shot glass opened a bottle of whiskey filled the glass and swallowed it went straight to her head releasing some lightness in her and as she turned dillon entered along with billy he had a paleness to him the eyes dark a look that she had never seen before this man she had got to know well enough to love was suddenly a stranger and she knew something must have happened he came and put a hand around her waist and kissed her lightly on the mouth its good to see you girl id like to kill that bastard in the truck for what he did to you she ran her hand up and down his arm a couple of times it could have been worse he could have succeeded george is knocked about a bit but hell get over it she looked at him searchingly youre angry i think you could put it that way then tell us about it ferguson said billy and i went hunting first of all in camden in search of cochran turns out that address has been a brickfield since last year waiting for a housing project a helpful indian storekeeper in the next street told me he remembered the address well because there used to be a lodging house there i already checked on the computer said roper it only threw up two matthew cochrans one a chemist at the school of oriental medicine and the other a headmaster at a high school in bayswater so another false name ferguson said what else is new what about kilburn did you discover anything useful i think you could say that for gods sake dillon billy exploded get it off your chest he turned to the others that priest you found roper near pools address roper nodded monsignor james murphy dillon knew him when he was nineteen and his dad was killed in belfast it was murphy the police asked to break the news to him which he did right there in holy name church and he gave him one of the prayer cards there was a kind of stillness and monica took a step closer and reached for dillons hand sean ferguson said dillon i dont think youve been completely straight with us on all this thats nonsense the card first reared its ugly head hidden in frank barrys wallet i found it and showed it to harry immediately i also explained its significance isnt that true harry miller nodded gravely yes i admit it is but what you didnt mention was your personal experience with the card because id had the wind knocked out of my sails harry it was a bad memory of a terrible night in the life of a nineteenyearold boy all those years ago in kilburn so i got on with the business in new york and tried to push the bad memory away for a while and then things started to happen i left kilburn forever when i went to belfast for my fathers funeral frankly ive always avoided it and id no idea that murphy was still at holy name well one things for sure hell remember your return billy said what happened ferguson asked i got angry and you might say i let rip at least thats what billy would tell you because he heard but it was all on purpose i figured a little acting job was called for so if youll all take your seats and roper turns on his recorder well begin it took no more than twenty minutes and when they were finished roper switched off and ferguson said extraordinary i find particularly interesting the remark murphy made to you when he gave you the card that it would be a comfort for all victims of a great cause it certainly indicates where his political sympathies lay then and no doubt still do miller put in but its hardly illegal so it influenced an impressionable youth which was what dillon was then and now hes angry about it most people would say so what he turned to his sister come on monica as an archaeologist you constantly have to analyze the past based on very little what have you got to say its seems simple to me so far four people are dead and various others have been put in harms way and the one constant has been that prayer card which first turned up in frank barrys wallet at the plaza hotel miller said no harry she said as far as im concerned it first turned up on that evening in when father james murphy gave it to sean hes the one we have to look at next i absolutely agree ferguson turned to roper ill get right on to it monica said to miller id like to go to dover street now harry and settle in is that all right with you we could see kurbsky svetlana and katya off later a good idea she brushed dillons cheek with a kiss and went out followed by her brother billy decided to pay a visit to the dark man and ferguson retired to his office it was suddenly quiet only a low hum from the equipment roper said youre too wound up sean relax go and have a sauna it wasnt good dillon said i was surprised how violent i felt towards him and that bloody woman i dont know a thing about her except what the old lady next door to pools house in green street said about her a hard bitch i know that having met her but the old woman described her as a kind of mother teresa well well see whos right so off you go and leave it to uncle roper dillon returned to the computer room hair damp but looking refreshed wearing an opennecked black shirt black bomber jacket and black velvet jeans not bad roper told him but its time you saw the barber never mind that dillon poured two whiskeys and handed one over what have you got for me youre going to love it ive found a good deal about murphy and the lady whos fifty by the way good god dillon was genuinely astonished id never have believed it shes a handsome woman i agree with you her pictures coming up now from an identity card there she is at least she doesnt look like a prison warden to summarize her mother mary ryan was born in derry in she trained as a nurse married a patrick daly when she was twentyfive caitlin her only child was born in in with the civil rights business there was serious marching in northern ireland the dalys were in a mixed housing area and armed men in hoods broke in one night and shot patrick daly dead in front of the mother and caitlin who was ten at the time the family had friends in london so they fled to kilburn dillon looked grim not good not good at all her mothera trained nurse remembergot a job at the cromwell road hospital and they lodged in kilburn with a cousin who was a widow as caitlin is a year older than you i wonder if you ever knew each other i came to kilburn later than that when i was twelve but i cant recall a daly what did she do then went to st marys college london to train as a teacher member of the students union president of fairness for ireland committee leftwing activist vice president of the civil rights committee thirdclass honors degree in english teaching certificate spent too much time marching dillon observed teacher in various catholic schools then in her mother packed it in as a nursing sister and took the job of housekeeper at the church and they moved in together and so continued until the old lady died last year and caitlin is still there still teaching it would seem and still without a man not true shes got one in a way listen to murphys story and her position is explained but not in the way you might think ill roll his file round and read it particularly the year my father was killed can you remember the date of course i can november thirteen how could i forget that well murphy went on secondment to londonderry in january for six months to be a priest with them at the little sisters of pitys st marys priory read it which dillon did he shook his head i never realized that id stopped going to church and i was finished at rada by then kilburn was pretty working class so i was used to keeping my head down about being an actor so you lost touch with him but ive got a report he sent to his bishop telling him how bad it was in the war zone and how impressed hed been with the priory as a nursing home and the efforts of the nuns to help the sick and needy against the odds his intention was to have a hospice called hope of mary and he intended to recruit nuns from the little sisters of pity this would cost money but the bishop responded to his enthusiasm murphy registered a charitable trust called requiem and the church agreed to buy a suitable house on mortgage for him on the condition he was responsible for raising the operating costs and he has presumably in spades see the photo of him here in full regalia another when he was made monsignor he proved irresistible to many businessmen and a sensation in the city the hospice is paid off including all improvements and theyve started ones in west belfast dublin and now one in the bronx in new york thats a hell of a lot of money when you look at it a hell of an achievement i wonder where it came from he certainly seems to have the golden touch and where does caitlin figure in all this her mother worked at the housekeeping post at the presbytery till she was seventy at that time caitlin just carried on obviously by arrangement with murphy helping out but still teaching when her mother got cancer she packed in her job to nurse her becoming more and more involved with hope of mary the old lady died over a year ago and caitlin is still doing her job but twins it with being executive director at the hospice fascinating stuff what else have you got costellocumdocherty who tried to torch the dark man inspector parkinson recognized him as a petty thief and drunk named fergus costello whod apparently gotten religion over twenty years ago at a refuge for drunks and downandouts in wapping high street it was interfaith but parkinson spoke of a charismatic priest who turned up there on occasion so guess who it was oh im at the stage where im prepared to believe anything you say but why the fake irish passport i dont know he had a prison record as costello maybe he wanted to start fresh he must have known the right people the passport was an absolute ringer but our irish connection falls down when we consider henry pool doesnt it i know his wife was from cork but his father was a cockney soldier as i recall so badly wounded in april in germany he was immediately discharged and went to live in kilburn with his wife who produced henry in poor old ernest he died of a stroke two years later but ive discovered an irish connection that wasnt immediately apparent his wife mary kennedy her father was killed by the highly irregular british police force known as the black and tans god help us dillon said the scum of the trenches theyd frighten the devil himself so when we consider pool and the life he led at the beck and call of an embittered old woman who probably blamed him for being half english and drummed guilt into him every day of his life i suppose you could say hed be capable of leaving a bomb in the back of an english generals limousine i take your point but pool was the driver yes but ferguson did say pool appeared to be running away dillon sighed a hell of a tragedy it would have been charles fergusons sainted mother being from cork herself actually i did know that but they say there are round eight million people of some sort of irish extraction in the english population exactly dillon said more than there are in ireland itself he shook his head so where does it all lead god knows roper replied and then ferguson walked in there you are dillon said when do we get going for farley we dont ferguson said i decided a little extra security was called for so i did a little sleight of hand i apologize for not telling you but i figured the fewer people who knew the better svetlana katya alexander and bounine were all picked up by an emergency ambulance from the royal marsden hospital transferred to an anonymous people carrier and delivered to raf biggin hill in north london they took off about twenty minutes ago so thats that now ive contacted miller and the salters and suggested that they join us to go over the new information i asked monica too but shes not feeling too good she took a bit of a battering remember she thought shed have an early night it was no more than half an hour later that the salters arrived in the alfa and as they walked in the gate opened again behind them and fox delivered miller who followed them in to the computer room where they found ferguson roper and dillon talking quietly so what is all this harry salter demanded what about kurbsky and the ladies departed some time ago and if youll all sit down ill explain the circumstances he repeated what hed told the others emphasizing that what had alarmed him was the intruder at belsize park he was not an ordinary thief bent on burglary we know that because of the prayer card kurbskys makeover was very effective so im inclined to believe that he wasnt the target cochran was probably intent on obtaining what information he could from the women how he learned about them i dont know but thats why i felt we had to take extra precautions i agree dillon said the russians were behind the plot for kurbskys original false defection since then they havent heard a word from him or luzhkov or yuri bounine it must be making someone very angry indeed and angry enough to do something about it ferguson said so you think it is the gru seeking revenge if they cant find answers its the gru ive always worried about because russian military intelligence is as good as it gets roper nodded there are six of us sitting here and four have experienced serious attempts to kill them blake and monica make six miller said you and dillon must feel left out well it would be difficult to get at me here in my wheelchair but im always ready he produced a walther from the side pocket of his chair and turned to dillon why theyre leaving sean alone i dont know ive already told you dillon said if i hadnt gone to new york at the last minute it could have been different so thats it the bleeding russians again harry salter said what are we going to do about it hold on theres something id like you to see first ferguson said dillon and billy visited kilburn earlier in the afternoon to explore the irish connection and wheres this taking us harry salter asked to a hospice known as hope of mary which has a website if you can believe it featuring a familiar prayer card it has an executive director caitlin daly a charity called requiem behind it and a priest responsible for the whole package called monsignor james murphy ropers prepared a very interesting fact file so watch and learn as they pulled chairs forward and roper adjusted his equipment harry salter said in a low voice to dillon waste of time all this theres got to be more to it than kilburn you think so of course i do he sat down shooting blake on long island bombing the generals car in london all these other thingsthis is major stuff and it takes organization i think youre absolutely right dillon its the gru getting their own back for kurbsky and i bet theyve been planning it ever since he scarpered and he was absolutely right in the beginning the kremlin two weeks before prime minister vladimir putins appearance at the un and the events surrounding it colonel josef lermov of the gru had been enjoying a six months leave of absence to work on a book on international terrorism a subject on which he held a formidable reputation in russian security circles lermov had had scholarly leanings as a younger man but he came from a military familyhis father had been an infantry general in his timeand so in spite of lermovs undoubted promise the army it had to be his wife had died at forty from breast cancer he was childless and his parents were both dead leaving him with nothing to do but devote himself to his duty a basic knowledge of arabic had on three occasions led to covert operations and his actions during them had left no doubt of his courage with the decorations to prove it he was sitting at a desk in the university library now auburn hair falling over his forehead steelrimmed glasses on his nose an air of weariness with life in general about him when a young gru captain tapped him on the shoulder and whispered in his ear i regret to disturb you colonel but ive orders to take you to the kremlin i have a car waiting outside the kremlin lermov didnt understand what on earth for the prime minister wishes to see you lermov was shocked and said the first thing that came into his head but im on leave the young captain smiled slightly it would appear not colonel of course then if i may retrieve my greatcoat and briefcase from the cloakroom i am at the prime ministers orders twenty minutes later after a drive through miserable weather the captain at the wheel early winter at its worst sleet and rain he was delivered to the rear of the kremlin the captain whose name was ivanov knocked on a small postern door which was opened by an armed soldier who said nothing and stood to one side as the captain brushed past him and led the way along numerous corridors until they reached one with an armed guard sitting on a chair with a machine pistol on his lap the captain opened a door into an unexpectedly grand room furnished in the french style of the seventeenth century painted walls and fine paintings this is rather remarkable i must say lermov commented it was the office of general volkov the captain said special security adviser to the prime minister unfortunately no longer with us i had the pleasure of knowing him his death will make him sorely missed by all in the gru there was a sideboard with drinks of most kinds available and a fine desk close to the fireplace with a dvd on it a tv in the corner the information on the dvd is classified on a strictly eyesonly basis the prime ministers orders are that you should watch it and take on board all the facts when you feel you know what youre talking about press the button on the desk he will discuss the matter with you then do you know whats on it i helped put it together colonel whats it about just tell me briefly peter ivanov hesitated and lermov said humor me captain all right to put it like the americans would theres been a turf war going on in london for the past four or five years and our people have not been doing very well the opposition being british intelligence an elite group known as the prime ministers private army he quickly ran down its members for lermov and gave him a precis of the bloody history of the past few years all leading up to the current state of play and the disappearance of kurbsky luzhkov and major yuri bounine but theres more on the dvd judge for yourself i will lermov moved to the sideboard and as ivanov left helped himself to vodka then sat down to watch ivanov had been right there was a great more detail and it was a good thirtyfive minutes before it finished he pressed the button on the desk and it was surprising how quickly the door in the paneled wall opened and vladimir putin himself entered he was wearing an excellent black suit a white shirt and a conservative striped silk tie prime minister lermov said its an honor to be here im a great admirer of yours colonel you have a remarkable mind now sit and tell me what you think i havent got long im meeting the french ambassador this feud with charles fergusons people in london its better than a movie though the body count has been appalling on our side then this whole thing with kurbsky he arrives in londonand then three days later he vanishes two days later colonel luzhkov and major bounine disappeared five days for the whole thing quite a puzzle putin stood up and what would you like me to do about it prime minister solve it for me the ministry of arts has put out a story that kurbsky is somewhere in the depths of the country working on a novel in private likewise the word on luzhkov and bounine is that they have been withdrawn from london to work on secret assignments at gru headquarters which means london will need a new head of station thats you putin said i authorized your appointment this morning your colleagues will envy you but youre not there to enjoy yourself lermov youre there to find out what the hell has been going on and thats not all i also expect you to find a way of ridding ourselves of the curse of ferguson and companypermanently ill do my best lermov told him i expect you to do better than that i expect you to give me exactly what im asking for but there is no need for you to go to london straightaway take your time use our resources learn the enemy of course lermov said ive arranged for ivanov to assist you hes clever but also quite ruthless and ambitious so watch him if you find him satisfactory you can take him to london with you he took an envelope from his pocket i think youll find this of great assistance use it well he opened the door in the paneling and was gone lermov opened the envelope took out the letter and read it from the office of the prime minister of the russian federation at the kremlin the bearer of this letter acts with my full authority all personnel civil or military will assist colonel josef lermov in any way demanded signed vladimir putin the door opened and ivanov entered i hope things went well i think you could say that lermov offered him the letter which ivanov read you are in favor colonel ive also just been appointed head of station for london lermov plucked the letter from ivanovs hand put it back in the envelope and slipped it into a breast pocket the prime minister has given me quite straightforward orders he continued i am to solve the mystery of kurbsky luzhkov and bounine is that all ivanovs smile was slightly mocking no he also expects me to come up with a way of ridding us of what he terms the curse of ferguson oh dear ivanov sighed based on past history id say that will prove difficult apparently meanwhile im going to go over everything again all the information we have ill need a hotel as close as possible to gru headquarters theres an old hotel called the astoria close by which was taken over especially to accommodate gru personnel im already billeted there the limousine we came in is allocated to you im yours to command yes so the prime minister said he also said if you prove satisfactory i can take you to london would you like that like it ivanovs eyes sparkled colonel five years ago the gru sent me there supposedly as a student on a sixmonths total immersion course in english for foreigners it was a pure pleasure id be happy to return well lets get started lermov said the astoria was acceptable far better than most army accommodation there were individual bedrooms with showers that worked dull but functional what had been the restaurant was more like a canteen now and run by the military and the food was simple and sustaining as you would expect it to be in lermovs case he had an excellent goulash with a glass of a rough red wine to wash it down he sat there thinking about things over a second glass and ivanov appeared did you want lunch lermov asked i grabbed a couple of sandwiches and went up to headquarters ive booked us an office for privacythe main records department is about the size of a cathedral and just as public every file there ever was lines of computers poor sods in uniform hunched over it looks like some stalinist movie god forbid lermov said and stood up lets get going and see what we can do ivanov had been right about the central research hall but it was surprisingly quietdisciplined reallythe occasional voice in the distance a constant low hum from the machines the office was fine two desks each with a computer most of the data obviously is on computer these days ivanov said even the old stuff has been transferred but we can explore original documents if we want its still stored elsewhere now where do we start im interested by the speed at which events moved kurbsky arrives in london hes received at holland park and then hes out on the street walking round and speaking to bounine twentyfour hours after that hes in mayfair and shooting some chechnyan named basayev with whom hes apparently had history he calls bounine afterwards tells him what hes done and says hes returning to holland park bounine tells luzhkov and luzhkov tells putin and then kurbsky vanishes and two days later so do luzhkov and bounine lermov stood concentrating you have a look at all the traffic to and from the london embassy starting with the thursday kurbsky was received and the few days after transcripts of every kind if a conversation looks odd or interesting listen to the recording and you im going to find out more about kurbsky he switched on his computer and went quickly through kurbskys life in january kurbsky aged nineteen had been staying in london with his aunt svetlana a famous russian actress and defector when news came of student riots in moscow blood on the streets and many dead amongst them his sister tania kurbsky their father a kgb colonel had used his influence to have her buried in minsky park military cemetery to cover his shame apparently too late for her funeral alexander kurbskys response had been to join the paratroopers in the ranks and go to afghanistan and then chechnya and then iraq hed excelled then boris luzhkov had recruited him for his mission to penetrate british intelligence his bait that tania kurbsky wasnt dead at all but sentenced to life in the worst gulag in siberia station gorky if kurbsky cooperated his sister would go free he sat thinking about it and then using gru operational passwords accessed prisoners lists and files at station gorky when he tapped in the name of tania kurbsky however the screen said code restriction he turned to ivanov busy at his own computer and asked whats a code restriction ah youve got to tania kurbsky i ran into the same roadblock it means above most secret which when i inquired of major levin out there in the end office means you cant have it whoever you are and whatever it is well see about that lets go and have a word major levin was impressed enough when faced with a full colonel of gru to get to his feet can i assist in any way colonel lermov im engaged in an essential intelligence matter and my inquiry is blocked by the words code restriction im afraid it would be impossible to help you colonel lermov took the envelope from his pocket extracted putins letter and passed it across levin read it eyes bulging of course you could phone through to the prime ministers office in the kremlin or you could simply unlock the information right here on your own screen would do of course sir im most happy to oblige if you would be kind enough to show me what it is you seek i can insert the correct password excellent lermov turned to ivanov you will oblige me captain i wouldnt look if i were you major ivanovs fingers flew expertly the prisoners lists at station gorky appeared with tania kurbskys name again blocked major levin scribbled a password and passed it over and ivanov tapped it in the screen was filled with the sad haunted face of a wretched woman looking about a hundred years old it read tania kurbsky died of typhoid aged on march have you got what you wanted gentlemen levin inquired yes i think so he got up and levin said is there anything else i can do yes make sure you forget about this it would seriously displease the prime minister if he heard youd been uncooperative at first they returned to the office and ivanov said i dont think ill forget that face in a hurry she was only seventeen when she went in that means she endured that place for eleven years i agree so luzhkov was lying when he said she was still alive do you think the prime minister knew id like to think he didnt but who knows the real question is this what would alexander kurbsky do if he found out the fact that his old bastard of a father had lied when he said she was dead in the first place must have deeply shocked him but to discover the awful truth about his sister and realize how cruelly he had been duped he shook his head i dont think angry would be strong enough to describe how he would feel and how he would react is anyones guess do you think that perhaps he did find out ivanov asked thats what we need to discover did you come across anything else just one thing you remember the big four meeting the other month of course the american vice president had unexpectedly flown in from paris for top secret talks with the prime minister the israeli prime minister and the president of palestine to broker a deal on gaza you remember they met on a large boat on the thames well according to some reports it got a little dangerous out there in the mist some small riverboat exploded an overheated gas tank or something and the point it was the last day anyone at the embassy saw either luzhkov or bounine interesting lermov said you think it was related you said to look for anything odd said ivanov and heres another thing apparently luzhkov knew the vice president was flying in i found a message about it from the paris embassy at approximately midnight on the night before it was received by a junior lieutenant named greta bikovand signed for by boris luzhkov hmm that doesnt really tell us anything though tell me whos been holding the fort for gru in london since the disappearances a major ivan chelek they sent him over from paris i know him he worked for me in iraq some years ago slow but sound you speak to him explain youre acting under my orders find out what hes been doing to investigate and inquire about greta bikov any special reason ivanov asked because she was there peter received that transcript as night duty officer and conveyed it to luzhkov what was his reaction was there anyone with him bounine could have been there for all we know you were right to bring this matter to my attention at your orders colonel ivanov produced an encrypted mobile and lermov got up and wandered outside there was something here just below the surface of things he was certain of that and that feeling tantalized him an old woman with her head in a scarf and wearing a white coat pushed a tray along the walkway as he leaned on the rail and smoked an american marlboro there was a samovar on the trolley that looked as old as her and sandwiches and pies she paused and looked at him a leftover from another age youre not allowed to smoke here comrade just give me a hot cup of tea with lemon babushka and a currant bun and you can have these theyre american i shouldnt be smoking them anyway she smiled youre a good man i like you she pocketed the cigarettes gave him what hed asked for and pushed her trolley away lermov ate the bun which was excellent and was drinking the tea when ivanov found him you might have got me one never mind that what did he say no sign of any of them hes even had assets we can rely on in the london underworld to check the morgues but theyve gotten nowhere he congratulates you on your elevation to head of station and says please come soon as he misses paris and greta bikov it seems she was very upset by the whole business of luzhkov and bounine she took it badly cried a lot and went round looking stressed and anxious other staff said she was a favorite of luzhkov and the general opinion was that he was having it off with her how delicately put lermov said did you speak to her i couldnt she wasnt there she got very depressed so the embassy doctor decided to place her on sick leave and when was this four days ago shes right here in moscow her mother is a widow lives in an apartment on nevsky prospekt overlooking the river some fine old houses there lermov said okay lets say she was a naughty girl and luzhkovs bit of skirt as her colleagues seem to think she was used to being overfamiliar with her commanding officer in and out of his office putting up with the older mans indifferent kiss the quick grope i think i see where youre going with this ivanov said bad things happen the boss disappears a lot of pressure and questions coming your way leading to considerable stress of the sort induced by fear so you show that face to the doctor who puts you on sick leave and sends you home to mummy and all the comforts of home ivanov grinned but what is it shes afraid of i would imagine her overfamiliarity with luzhkov led to her sticking her nose into things she shouldnt she may have enjoyed having him on a string leading him on if you like taking advantage of an aging fool who couldnt keep his fly closed and now with this strange business of his disappearance shes seriously worried about her misdeeds whatever they are surfacing then its time to find out what they are lermov took the putin letter from his pocket and passed it to him go down to the cell block order the commanding officer to provide you with two military police sergeants women but the type who look like prison officers proceed to lieutenant greta bikovs home you will remind her she is still an officer in the gru and that duty calls the sergeants will assist her into her uniform if necessary there was a kind of admiration on ivanovs face of course colonel ill give you an hour then ill present myself in the cell block and start her interrogation so get on with it ivanov went away almost running and the old tea woman came back along the walkway she paused another tea colonel you look stressed whats wrong its the acting babushka it always takes it out of me playing somebody im not lermov told her what you need is another glass of tea i dont think so he smiled but you can give me one of those cigarettes if you like the house overlooking the river was definitely tsarist in origin as ivanov had expected the bikov apartment was on the top floor and served by an ancient lift with a metal lattice door before going up ivanov gave his two forbiddinglooking women police sergeants instructions i doubt if you will ever handle a matter of greater importance than this he produced the putin letter opened it and held it before them we are here at our prime ministers bidding to arrest a serving officer of the gru who needs to answer grave charges one greta bikov neither woman showed any emotion not a flicker on the face the senior said how do we handle the matter captain no need to get too physical sergeant stransky lets just frighten the hell out of her put her in the right frame of mind for her interrogation the bell sounded like a distant echo from another time but the maid who answered it was young dressed in jeans and a smock rubber gloves on her hands obviously engaged in cleaning a look of dismay appeared on her face sergeant stransky barked with infinite menace lieutenant greta bikov she moved straight past the girl and led the way along a short corridor which opened into an arched entrance with drapes on either side and beyond a large sitting room there was a piano a fine carpet too much oldfashioned furniture and wingback chairs having studied greta bikovs service record ivanov knew that the woman in the wheelchair beside the fire was the mother crippled with rheumatoid arthritis in spite of being only fifty years of age greta was sitting opposite her wearing a bathrobe and what looked like pajama bottoms shed been holding a cup in both hands and in scrambling to her feet spilled some of its contents her face was wild with fear her mother cried out who are you what do you want peter ivanov saluted with infinite courtesy you must excuse the intrusion madam but your daughter must return to duty this is nonsense mrs bikov told him she is ill to greta confronted by ivanov in that magnificent uniform with all the medals it was as if the devil himself had come to fetch her she said desperately im on indefinite sick leave terminated on the orders of colonel josef lermov now head of station for the gru in london no surely it cannot be she said faintly ivanov took out the putin letter unfolded it and held it up in front of her the prime minister himself requests your presence she seemed to stagger clutching at the back of her chair ivanov nodded to stransky and her partner who came forward and took an arm each dont be alarmed these women are simply here to assist you to dress you must make your appearance in uniform go with them now they took her away to her bedroom her mother had started to weep holding a handkerchief to her mouth she said brokenly but what has she done that is not for me to say madam it is what a military inquiry will decide she buried her face in her hands crying even more but he ignored her there were various bottles and glasses on the sideboard he selected a bottle of vodka and poured one drank it then beckoned to the maid does she drink yes captain do you live in yes i have a room upstairs excellent make sure you keep the vodka flowing and look after her see to her now im going to make a call he went into the kitchen closed the door called lermov on his mobile and described what had happened so whats your opinion of her state of mind lermov asked very fragile and frightened to death theres something worrying her im sure of that it just needs the right shove well lets see if we cant give it to her ill see you soon ivanov noticed another bottle of vodka on the side by the sink obviously the maids and poured another thinking about greta it wouldnt be necessary to get physical with her from what hed seen she would break very quickly there was a knock on the door and stransky looked in were ready for you excellent ivanov told her and went out what lermov found when he went downstairs to the cell block was pure theater the two female police sergeants were supremely menacing as they stood on each side of the door ivanov had a look of the ss about him and greta bikov seemed terrified as he walked in ivanov saluted reporting as ordered colonel he barked with lieutenant greta bikov he turned to her on your feet she managed to stand trembling with fear pretty enough with tightly bound blond hair undeniably attractive in uniform one could understand her appeal to most men luzhkov had probably found her irresistible her face told it all a touch of the slav to it she sat there shaking a little confronted by this highly unusual man someone with the gravitas of a scholar a university professor perhaps the worldweary face of a man who had seen most things that life had to offer and had long since ceased to be amazed she took a deep breath which seemed to steady her a little my god shes assessing him ivanov thought trying to make sense of what kind of man he is but its his rank thats giving her pause for thought full colonel then the medals including the one for bravery under fire when he volunteered for that spetsnaz job in iraq nothing comes higher than that she tried a shy smile and ivanov felt like smiling too his thoughts confirmed silly girl this one isnt another luzhkov to be charmed by you crossing one silk knee over the other and allowing your skirt to slide a little lermov sat opposite her ivanov leaned against the wall to the left side arms folded lermov started lieutenant bikov there is no specific charge against you but i am under orders from prime minister putin to investigate the disappearance of colonel boris luzhkov and his secondincommand major yuri bounine captain ivanov has shown you the warrant signed by the prime minister indicating that i operate with his full authority yes colonel to business you were posted to london nine months ago which was when you first met colonel luzhkov yes colonel there was a kind of impatience in her voice lermov made eye contact with ivanov who moved in and major bounine what about him he only appeared a few weeks ago a posting from dublin her impatience broke through obviously fueled by anxiety ive been asked these questions before colonel by major chelek he was very thorough and appeared perfectly satisfied that i had no idea what happened to either of them ivanov playing the bad guy to the hilt homed in on her harshly if you think that major chelek is perfectly satisfied with you youre very much mistaken not when he discovered that most of your colleagues were of the opinion that you were having an affair with colonel luzhkov her face became very pale she hammered on the table with a clenched fist but it was unconvincing and her voice was weak when she said i protest colonel malicious lies and rumors put about by those who envied my friendship with colonel luzhkov he was the kindest of men leaving all that to one side lets have a look at one of your dealings with colonel luzhkov now your main duties were as an intelligence assistant in the code room where your expertise was necessary to handle transcripts encrypted material and so on thats what i was trained for at gru headquarters and you acted as colonel luzhkovs personal secretary some of the time lermov asked patiently quite frequently but much of the work in the code room tends to come in at night so i often operated the night shift i was the highestrated code expert on staff there was a touch of defiance there lermov took a sheet from the pile in front of him and passed it across do you recall receiving that transcript it has your name and also luzhkovs signature of receipt she glanced at it i remember very well do you want me to read it out no just tell us the gist of it he leaned back and waited it came in minutes before midnight on a sunday and i was on the night shift it was a mostsecret from the paris embassy the american vice president was in paris for a un thing and was flying back to washington on monday morning next day once in the air the plan was to divert to london for a meeting with the british prime minister the israeli prime minister and the president of palestine to try and broker a deal for peace in gaza and you took it straight to luzhkov i knew he was in his office with major bounine having a drink and what did he say he couldnt believe it asked me if i was sure it was true but i pointed out that as you can see in the second half of the transcript the information came from a highly regarded asset in french intelligence who was on the gru payroll in paris it also said the word was that the meeting was going to take place on a riverboat on the thames for security reasons but the source didnt know which boat and what was his reaction to all this greta paused for a long moment as if suddenly realizing where things were going and it was ivanov who jumped in you heard the colonel its a simple enough question he was very excited he he said what a sensation the death of the four of them would make it would rock the world the silence was so heavy it filled the room and then lermov said and major bounines reaction he said surely youre not thinking of something like that and luzhkov cut him off and made an amazing speech about the wall coming down and the death of communism and the evils of capitalism he kept saying things like the communist order must be restored he was quite drunk and you were still there listening ivanov asked i felt as if id been forgotten and asked what he wanted me to do and he said the moment we knew which riverboat was being used i had to notify him at once i got the impression that major bounine wasnt very happy but he told me to go and get on with it on my way out of the door i heard luzhkov say to bounine we need a man to deal with our problem satisfactorily but that was as the door was closing she sat there strangely composed that edge of defiance again so there you are lermov turned and raised his eyebrows to ivanov who came and put both hands on the table his face only a couple of feet away from her what do you mean there you are thats total nonsense there isnt a human being in the world who having heard what luzhkov was beginning to say could have resisted holding on for a few seconds to hear the rest so dont be stupid and tell the colonel what it was she came apart tears starting all right then he said we need a man to deal with our problem satisfactorily a bad man who is also a madman something like that it sounded crazy but like i said he was drunk she paused and ivanov pushed her again go on bounine said do you know of such a man and colonel luzhkov said that he did and he told bounine to go get his coat and put a pistol in his pocket and he would introduce him to the man i closed the door at once and hurried away to the code room i was worked up by the whole business so i opened the door to a small balcony by one of the coderoom windows and lit a cigarette and i saw them go down to the staff car park get in luzhkovs mercedes and drive away and that was that no actually you should have another transcript in the file it came in about an hour and a half later from the same source saying that the riverboat was called the garden of eden and they would be boarding her at the cadogan pier chelsea have the meeting go downriver and disembark at westminster pier and that preparations were already in hand to prepare the boat at chelsea and you forwarded it to luzhkov i called him on my mobile but bounine answered and i gave him the information and youve no idea where they were i swear on my life i dont know there wasnt even traffic noises it had started to rain incredibly that night and continued for twentyfour hours the whole thing the following day was bedeviled by rain and heavy mist you couldnt see across the river and you didnt see them again lermov asked id worked the whole night shift remember i needed sleep i went to my room in the staff block down the road the two of them just disappeared as i understood it sometime in the afternoon thats all i can say look im tired i need the bathroom of course you do lermov got up and said to ivanov a word they went out and ivanov said this is quite a story if its true i want you to contact major chelek in london shes just told us she didnt see them again after their night on the town because shed gone down to staff quarters and gone to bed see if he can confirm that also ask him to confirm the question on this slip of paper ill see to it anything else yes tell sergeant stransky to commiserate with her womantowoman let her have a shower and general cleanup and see that she gets a decent meal and a drink have her back here in an hour and a half what for ivanov asked because theres more peter much more and i havent got time to waste im trying to think of absolutely the worst consequence i can threaten her with ill let you know when ive decided what it is ivanov said with awe im beginning to think i dont know you at all sir frequently i think i dont know me lermov said but for now im going back to the office where with luck the old tea lady may be operating and she was there still plying her trade he purchased two ham sandwiches made with rough black peasant bread had scalding tea in a tall glass and sat in the office and went through the loose file from beginning to end feeling already that he almost knew it by heart academic work was all hed had time for when it came to writing books but he loved fiction at any level had considered it an essential part of his work in the intelligence field it had taught him that individuals were what they were could continue to act only in that way so that it was possible to tell in advance exactly how they would behave in any given situation he was absolutely certain that applied to greta bikov the door opened and he glanced up ivanov moved in and dropped a transcript on the desk how the hell did you know when you leave the code room you sign out if you are junior staff you also sign out at the front door of the embassy just down the road are staff quarters and you sign in there and sign out when you leave and sign in again at the embassy heres the answer to your query too stupid stupid girl lermov sighed as he read it all what are you going to do with her make her tell the truth lermov said all of it greta was standing by the desk when they went in stransky and her colleague on either side of the door and she looked renewed again her hair bound a touch of lipstick trim and attractive in her uniform sit down lieutenant i trust you feel refreshed of course colonel youve been very kind and youve been very stupid he said softly took off his glasses and polished them what is this she was angry now and allowing it to get the better of her you lied to me you didnt go off to the hostel to go to bed the only place you booked out of when a colleague took over was the code room weve been on to london and had your comings and goings checked she was thoroughly unsure now i was in the canteen enough of this ill tell you what you are a tramp who has shared the bed of an infatuated fool whos indulged you at every turn you stuck your nose into everything indulged yourself by perusing documents that were eyesonly or mostsecret listened in on his telephone calls oh yes ive had that aspect of luzhkovs office and the outer office checked by gru in london there are three different systems linking both offices that would allow someone to eavesdrop she was thoroughly worked up now its not true i swear it and then theres the safe im sure he showed that off to you stuffed with thousands of pounds sent to fund covert gru operations i would imagine you purchased your underwear at harrods damn you to hell she screamed no hell is where you are going lermov took a folded document from his breast pocket and opened it on the desk you are dismissed from the gru with disgrace and sentenced to life imprisonment in station gorky if ever there was horror on a human face it was on hers you cant do that she broke down sobbing uncontrollably what can i do to stop this dreadful thing happening admit everything and not just what weve been talking about but anything else that you overheard in the past she tried to compose herself but i wasnt always acting as his secretary all right there were some other strange things that happened he was crazy in a way and a great drunk but most of the time i was in the code room start by telling us what happened on monday morning you werent in the code room then tell me exactly what you did the second transcript that came from paris the phone with the information about the garden of eden and chelsea came in when i was still on duty youve told us that you called luzhkov and bounine answered and you didnt see them again i presume that wasnt true i was curious about the whole business there was no way i could have gone to sleep there was no sign of the mercedes in the car park its not against regulations to take a restroom break which i did and had a shower while i was in there to liven myself up and i had my alarm which would alert me if anything came through i returned to the code room looked out at the car park and saw the mercedes was there again it was just before my six am relief and another transcript came through from paris and what was that a confirmation that the garden of eden would host a party for a hundred people and would slip its moorings at onethirty for the trip to westminster and you of course passed it straight on to him i wasnt sure if he might have gone to his quarters down the road but when i tried the office he was there and told me to read the transcript over the phone so what did you do after that as i told you i was intrigued about the whole business so i went and got a tray at the canteen coffee and so on an excuse to go to the office and i saw major bounine approaching he was in a robe a towel round his neck and his hair damp as if hed been in the shower and he looked angry he totally ignored me and went straight into the outer office and you of course followed yes and you operated one of the recording devices in the outer office that enabled you to eavesdrop what was being said i cant remember everything but the colonel told bounine about the time the garden of eden was leaving and bounine said have you informed ali selim about that luzhkov said he had and that selim was very happy about it a hunter scenting his prey lermov glanced at ivanov what do you think peter that incredible as it sounds luzhkov was planning some sort of a hit he turned to greta how did bounine react to all this he brushed it aside and said he had something more important to discuss she shook her head look i wasnt making notes so i can only recall the gist of it go on lermov said just do your best well it seemed to concern alexander kurbsky it what ivanov was astounded major bounine asked the colonel if he was aware that tania kurbsky had died of typhoid in station gorky in the colonel said that was nonsense and bounine told him the putin files and the dvd were all fake the colonel sounded upset and said something about kurbsky having done everything for nothing ivanov was looking stunned by now and lermov said to her gently my dear greta station gorky recedes already now carry on did anything else strike you about that conversation she frowned trying to think back and then nodded i remember now bounine said to the colonel that the man in the black hood who saved blake johnson wasnt dillon at all it was kurbsky who couldnt stand the idea of someone else ending up in station gorky like his sister and that was all she frowned trying her best and then smiled in a kind of triumph bounine said that ferguson and roper had probably found out that kurbskys defection was false incredible ivanov said and what happened then lermov asked bounine walked out ignoring me so i took the coffee in to luzhkov he was drinking vodka as usual and thanked me for the coffee the fact that i was still there didnt seem to surprise him i went back in the office busied myself with some filing and then he got another call and i checked it out and who was it general ferguson it was a shouting match and he called colonel luzhkov a bastard she shook her head i only remember bits he threatened to have a lot of gru people packed off to moscow he said he knew all about kurbsky and intended to help him in any way he could he said kurbsky had already done the united states a big favor by saving this blake johnson and afterwards he was sitting in there drinking vodka for ages and then he sent for bounine and you listened again he said to bounine that in view of what had happened that maybe it would be a good idea to cancel ali selim and gave bounine fifty thousand pounds to give selim for his time and bounine went yes i was at my desk he left without a word carrying a holdall with a shoulder strap she was obviously uncomfortable again i need a rest colonel please were coming to the end youve been very good bounine returned did he yes the morning had flown it was certainly past noon he came straight through my office and went in to the colonel and once again you listened bounine said ali selim had told him he had cancer and had only three months to live and wasnt interested in the money or canceling hed go out in a blaze of glory she paused and lermov said go on girl im sorry colonel through the glass windows to the corridor i saw olga the staff supervisor approaching she was obviously going to come in so i switched off dear god dont let it be true ivanov put in with great emotion calm yourself peter lermov told him give her a chance he leaned forward how long did she stay three or four minutes and as soon as shed gone i switched on and heard bounine say you must face him the colonel said that bounine must go with him and find an opportunity to shoot selim and what did bounine say he agreed to go said theyd leave in twenty minutes and went out and luzhkov followed him a bit later telling me that he and major bounine had an appointment and hed be back later in the afternoon i left the office and went upstairs to a window overlooking the car park saw them walk to the mercedes get in and drive away bounine at the wheel well he would be ivanov commented luzhkov awash with vodka like he was greta bikov seemed to straighten her back and clasped her hands together on the table in front of her and that colonel was the last time i clapped eyes on colonel boris luzhkov and major yuri bounine so help me god lermov smiled i believe you completely lieutenant bikov all sins forgiven colonel she asked to be frank i would find it difficult to recommend you to any officer of rank for secretarial duties but i will overlook that as your misconduct has provided me with information beyond price we are not finished yet of course but i think youve earned another break lermov sat opposite ivanov in a secluded corner of the officers bar and indulged in the finest vodka to be had and cold as ice excellent lermov said as he drank the first one i really needed that it surely freezes the brain ivanov told him your threat to send her to station gorky for life was what did the trick the silly girl fell for it but i meant it peter there is no room for empty threats in my world people imagine physical force is always necessary to break down the subject of an interrogation and you dont agree in the years of the third reich the germans were the masters of europe from the english channel to the urals and yet in britain where the nazi spy system was totally destroyed torture was unthinkable no physical force used at all so what was the secret the doublecross system they turned spies so that their german masters thought the spies were still working for them and believed in their radio traffic how did the british do that certainly not torture and according to their ethos you could never depend on any kind of physical force their spy catchers offered a simple choice delivered in the english of the upper classes saying what ivanov asked lermov delivered his answer in english so perfect there was only the hint of a russian accent sorry to hear you cant help us old man too bad theyll take you back to your cell now no point in prolonging things youll be hung in the prison yard at nine oclock in the morning good god ivanov replied in reasonable english though not as excellent as lermovs they actually did that oh yes the salutaryshock approach the knowledge of that nine oclock appointment concentrated the minds wonderfully i see now where you were coming from with greta bikov you scared the pants off her dont feel sorry for her peter her behavior in london was appalling who else has she been listening in on he shook his head shes not fit for anything as far as the gru is concerned but still is for us of course but lets review what weve learned so far boris luzhkov who appears to have been a drunken idiot most of the time heard of the unexpected meeting of the big four and decided to cover himself with glory by arranging to have them assassinated by a man called ali selim whom hed obviously dealt with frequently i get a hunch that bounine was not too happy about this but agreed to go along not really having any choice after midnight monday morning they met ali selim the hit was set up and they returned to the embassy whats the next step bounine appeared in luzhkovs office to ask him if he knew that tania kurbsky who was supposed to be alive had actually died of typhoid in january and luzhkov said he didnt lermov said lets accept that luzhkov genuinely didnt know that tania was dead which would mean bounine didnt either so where had he got the truth about tania from id say from kurbsky ivanov said he and bounine were comrades in afghanistan he had access to bounines encrypted mobile phone he phoned bounine with news about a shooting in mayfair they may have been more in touch than we realize and where did kurbsky get it from lermov nodded as if to himself but of course major giles roper no one more qualified to unlock the secrets of cyberspace ivanov smiled wryly i shouldnt imagine a code restriction held up roper for very long i agree lermov said and then we have the shouting match with general ferguson who threatens the embassy with reprisals and says he knows all about kurbsky would help him in any way he could and mentions that the americans were grateful hed helped blake johnson we know how valuable johnson is to the white house so where are we ivanov said i tell you one thing im certain alexander kurbsky is out there in the hands of ferguson and his people luzhkov and bounine im not sure what do you think youre the expert on terrorism and covert operations kind of you to say so but ive always fancied the idea of writing a novel and this whole business would be a thriller kurbsky the gallant hero blackmailed because the sister he thought dead is serving life and he agrees to infiltrate the enemy elite group his reward being her release who turns out to be dead not really very funny when you think about it lermov said a man like kurbsky what would he do when he found out that hed been used so badly go on the warpath id say of course he would and like you i believe hes out there and very probably with ferguson and his people bounine was his close friend we know that so perhaps hes gravitated to kurbsky luzhkov is a total mystery still but we can find out about this ali selim its a common name but he probably has a record go and get that moving and you colonel im going to have another session with greta im intrigued by this blake johnson business and the man in the black hood not being dillon but kurbsky whats that all about be off with you and you can join me when youve seen to the ali selim thing so once more to the interrogation cell where greta bikov waited under the impassive gaze of sergeant stransky and her colleague she was seemingly calm and yet a nerve twitched in her right cheek and she stirred in her chair as if uncomfortable she made the mistake of starting before lermov did i dont think theres anything more i can tell you colonel i seem to have covered everything you will allow me to be the judge of that lermov said and the door opened behind him and ivanov entered he took up his position again leaning against the wall everythings in order colonel theyre processing the ali selim query now as soon as anything turns up well know about it im obliged to you captain ivanov lermov opened his file and gave greta his full attention everything youve told us so far has made sense though aspects of it cant be fully confirmed now i would like you to cast your mind back to tell us how bounine told colonel luzhkov of the death of tania kurbsky you said that he also referred to a man in a black hood yes but ive already told you about that refresh my memory lermov said he said the man in the black hood whod saved blake johnson wasnt dillon at all it was kurbsky who couldnt bear the idea of someone else ending up in station gorky like his sister and had you heard any reference to a man in a black hood before yes it was earlier i think something had gone wrong involving two gru guys called oleg and petrovich a moronic couple who provided a little muscle when it was needed the embassy has a deal with a private airfield in essex called berkley down we book falcons out of there for the moscow run luzhkov told me to have one standing by on sunday and said oleg and petrovich would be escorting somebody there for an onward flight to moscow and youve no idea who god no it was a highsecurity thing but late on sunday night when bounine was with him i listened in why oleg and petrovich had phoned in from out of town asking for transport and when they arrived they were in a damaged state petrovich had an injured hand and oleg was holding a bloodstained rag to his right ear they ended up in sick bay and what did you hear luzhkov say he was very angry and threatened to have them transferred to a penal regiment bounine asked him if he believed the man in the hood was dillon and luzhkov said that dillon was famous for shooting off half an ear and thats all absolutely lermov nodded thinking about it then said that will be allfor the moment anyway suddenly her anger flared youre not putting me into a cell overnight lieutenant you are a serving officer in the russian army we may not have penal regiments for females but there are other things that could happen to you so take care im sorry she said desperately he ignored her take her she went out totally dejected between the two sergeants ivanov said what now check with london again id be interested to know if oleg and petrovich are still on the roster we should be able to get that on our computer staff records colonel it will only take a minute he hurried out and lermov sat there thinking about it things were certainly coming together but of course you always needed luck in any kind of investigation and he got exactly that a few minutes later when ivanov returned excellent news colonel oleg and petrovich were transferred from london two months ago indifferent fitness reports theyre right here in moscow attached to the field infantry training school on general police duties and still gru yes colonel something of a comedown i would have thought go and arrest them peter and if anyone objects use this he produced the putin letter and passed it over my pleasure colonel ivanov told him and rushed out a little later ivanov called in ive got them colonel a thoroughly unpleasant couple greta bikov was right to describe them as moronic did they give you any trouble not really theyve been drinking and theyre generally surly and cocky the duty officer at the training school was only a lieutenant so as i outranked him he accepted the situation without fuss i didnt have to use the letter where are you almost with you im in a standard military police secure van im up front with the driver ive put them in the rear with two police sergeants and they thought that was a great joke its the booze of course well lets try to wipe the smiles off their faces ill wait for you in the interrogation cell we used for greta bikov he went out on the walkway and found the old tea lady pushing her trolley towards him she stopped and poured a glass of tea from the samovar without a word he accepted it and gave her a banknote i cant change that she said he drank the hot tea gratefully thats all right babushka maybe you still have a cigarette to spare from that packet i gave you she produced the pack of marlboros from her smock pouch and extracted one carefully they wont like you smoking it then they can lump it babushka im a colonel a full colonel she produced a plastic lighter and flicked it on for him and as he blew out smoke she smiled for the first time since hed known her i like you tovarich she said and why do you like me babushka because the truth about you is that you dont give a toss absolutely right babushka he was laughing as he walked away when he went into the interrogation cell he found a police sergeant on either side of the door and oleg and petrovich sitting behind the table still handcuffed ivanov was sitting near the door and jumped up prisoners present as ordered colonel they were so drunk they started to laugh and oleg said is he taking the piss i mean this has gone far enough were lieutenants in the gru or hadnt you noticed lermov walked around the table slowly the cigarette still in his mouth and stood looking down at them then gently stubbed it out and said to the two sergeants at the door who were looking grim and flexing their clubs the left leg first on each of them if you please they moved in clubs swinging and both of the men howled and went down the sergeants pulled them on their feet ivanov had seldom seen two drunks sober up so fast oleg was actually sobbing lets get one thing clear the sergeants will be quite happy to move to your right leg and then each arm in turn but i detest violence so listen carefully captain ivanov if you please ivanov read the letter when he was finished lermov said my warrant from prime minister putin gives me total authority over your destiny i shall now question you on certain matters relating to your service in the london embassy that involved you if you do not tell me the exact truth about what happened you will be reduced to the ranks and posted to a penal regiment they stared at him dumbly total dismay on their faces lermov held up the putin letter this warrant from your prime minister gives me the power to do this i have no more time to waste give me your answer anything colonel petrovich mumbled thats right sir oleg joined in just tell us what you want to know then sit down and lets get started from then on it was easy and they fell over themselves to pour out the truth colonel luzhkov had offered them this very special job to kidnap an american blake johnson who had just arrived in town and was staying in a topfloor suite at a hotel in mayfair a truck that did laundry pickups in the area was available to them and uniforms to go with it they explained how theyd gone up in a service elevator abducted blake johnson returned to the truck hid him in the rear and driven away their destination a private airfield at berkley down where a russian falcon was waiting to fly him to moscow and onwards to station gorky then came the business of the truck being forced to stop an unexpected passenger in the rear the man in the black hood who spoke the kind of russian youd expect from a mafia lowlife who shot petrovich in the hand and blew away half of olegs right ear then drove off with blake johnson in the truck and left them to phone the embassy for help luzhkov had been furiously angry had referred to the man in the black hood as someone named dillon because this dillon had a reputation for shooting half an ear off people who offended him so that was it all there a perfect piece of the jigsaw they sat there broken and humble and lermov didnt even feel grateful animali the italian word for scum was the only way to describe them blake johnson was the enemy and lermov knew him only by reputation but that didnt mean one couldnt feel distaste for what had been planned for him he considered it all then stood and said to the sergeants take these men to a holding cell he turned to ivanov put the necessary documentation in hand for their demotion to the ranks and transfer them to an appropriate penal battalion both men gasped in disbelief but you promised colonel that if we told you the truth wed be all right yes i lied but you thoroughly deserve it he went to the door which one of the sergeants opened for him and walked out back in the corner of the officers bar he sipped tea and reviewed the situation it was certainly all coming together thanks to patient questioning and sound detective work they were almost there and then ivanov came in and sat down opposite him an edge of excitement to him he put a transcript on the table just in from london excellent stuff so i spoke to major chelek to confirm lermov poured another glass of tea just tell me gru computer experts said the london embassy can access scotland yard files and no one named ali selim has a criminal record the computer checked on other people of that name resident in london and found several but one seemed particularly interestingbecause he was dead lermov said explain remember the garden of eden sailed downriver on monday afternoon well this ali selim was fished out of the river at wapping two days later drowned of course no his throat was cut i see what is the source of this information grafton street morgue in wapping where the body was delivered by the paramedics who recovered it its all there in the morgue records a brief report of the recovery of the body identity and address in a wallet found on the body he lived at a place called india wharf on the thames the autopsy report indicated that due to possible contamination of the body cremation was urgent and this took place at the morgue facility the same day i must say ferguson is definitely turning out to be the ruthless bastard of legend is that everything major chelek has gone down himself to this india wharf where selim lived to see what he can find out hell be in touch as soon as possible then lets have something to eat until he does an hour in the canteen a heavy vegetable broth that was a meal in itself with black bread and once again a glass of the rough red wine peasant food lermov said in spite of the delights of the modern world we still love the kind of food our grandparents enjoyed they went back to the office and ten minutes later ivanovs secure mobile sounded put it on speaker lermov ordered ivan cheleks voice was clear and firm well here i am on india wharf looking out over the thames ivanov its raining im here also lermov told him well make this a conference call so where are we at it seems to be an anchorage surrounded by old victorian warehouses most of them boarded up just waiting for a developer to knock them all down four motorboats tied up for the winter with canvas covers no sign of any kind of habitation so ali selim didnt live there oh yes he did theres a lane at the top with a few old terrace houses and a corner shop i walked up tried the shop and struck gold go on lermov told him the people living in the houses are all islamics of one kind or another and the shop was their general store run by an aging arab named hussein we had the place to ourselves im an old iraq hand as no one knows better than you so i went and locked the front door took a pistol from my pocket and five hundred pounds in fifties and put them on the counter i told him in arabic that he had a clear choice he could answer my questions or i would blow his brains out and lermov said proved a mine of information ali selim was born in london his father was a seaman off a freighter in the old days when the pool of london was thriving he met and married a cockney white woman it seems ali was a very frightening and violent man from his youth he went to prison on many occasions for robbery assault that kind of thing and yet there is no police record on him at scotland yard ivanov observed obviously his record had been wiped clean lermov said as if he never existed he existed all right chelek said apparently he had relatives in afghanistan who helped with the poppy trade and he was into the drug business and made big money was he interested in the islamic movement not at all he drank very heavily and made strange remarks when he was drunk deriding islam and mocking such things as the bombing attacks in london by britishborn muslims saying that hed done far more that they ever could imagine he once said to hussein that they should have come to belfast with him in the old days and seen some real action did he indeed lermov said so weve established that he was a thoroughly frightening individual who would appear to have some sort of terrorist links in his past and thats if he is to be believed is that it then not quite ali selim lived in a barge anchored in the basin here he also had an orange motorboat with a huge outboard motor it was called running dog and he boasted it could do forty knots both vessels have disappeared has hussein got any explanations for that lermov asked yes he sometimes looks after an old greyhound for his son on the monday that the meeting was taking place on the garden of eden he locked up his shop at one oclock and walked the dog down the street leading to the wharf as he got to the end of the wharf he drew back because he saw two men in fluorescentyellowandblack jackets being urged off the barge by ali and pushed towards the running dog the thing is their hands were tied ali was wearing a similar jacket and carrying a large canvas bag were they talking it looked like it but hussein couldnt hear a thing he said the weather was terrible pouring rain and mist so thick that the running dog disappeared as it roared away ivanov said and hussein turned right round and went straight back to the shop and minded his own business id say a sensible thing to do considering his experience of the kind of man ali selim was lermov told him so what does all this say to us chelek asked lermov said to ivanov i recall you telling me about a small riverboat exploding an overheated gas tank or something chelek said you think that was the running dog ive never been so certain of anything in my life lermov said this is how i write the story ali selim sets out in the running dog to attack the garden of eden probably with a bomb of some kind i feel that his two prisoners were kurbsky and bounine but what happened to luzhkov ivanov demanded i cannot answer that but what do you feel most probable ali selim is the person most likely to have had the answer his barge has obviously been spirited away by charles ferguson who has also had his criminal file at scotland yard wiped clean its as if he never existed the crematorium at grafton street morgue has taken care of that reducing him to six pounds of gray ash it was possibly an oversight on fergusons part not to have the morgue records wiped out too so its all over chelek said not at all lermov replied i must make my report to the prime minister but what do i tell him that alexander kurbsky is alive and well and safe in the hands of a most bitter enemy of russia and that charles ferguson has won again when can i expect to see you in london chelek asked ill only know that when ive seen him and he confirms my task then ill need time to work out a plan of action in the meantime you must continue to run things over there ivan how did you end things with hussein i told him that i had it on good authority that ali selim was dead and what did he say to that he shrugged and said in arabic it was his time i suppose it was take care old friend ivanov switched off his mobile so what now the prime minister no avoiding it lermov patted him on the shoulder youve done well and i definitely intend to take you with me to london when i go but theres still work to be done here so lets get started ill summarize whats happened and you can take it down on your laptop then what forward it to the prime ministers office and request an i nterview it was lightly snowing on the way to the kremlin but pleasantly warm in what had once been volkovs office theyd presented themselves in good time for the interview but were still waiting an hour after the designated time do you think hes making us wait deliberately were not important enough peter well i believe that we are still one of the greatest nations on earth ivanov said and considering the state of the world today that he has time for us at all surprises me i agree but i think it only proves how passionately he is involved with events in london the door in the paneled wall swung open and vladimir putin entered immaculate in the black suit and white shirt he favored my apologies gentlemen one economic crisis after another seems to be the norm for the world we live in i did find time to read your resume of the kurbsky affair succinct and to the point colonel captain ivanovs help has been invaluable and i intend to take him with me when i take up my duties in london excellent he sat down at the desk i agree with the conclusions in your report colonel luzhkov was foolish and stupid and like you i believe he has paid the ultimate price kurbsky and possibly bounine are alive and well and in the care of charles ferguson and his people they have all been a thorn in our side for too long one attempt after another to eliminate them has failed and its time we do it right so what do you want me to do as i said before colonel destroy them charles ferguson and all his people finish them off colonel once and for all the british are not our friends they grant asylum to dissidents traitors to our country the british government allows their territory to be used as a launching pad to fight russia this will send them a message if i may there are still many russians living in london many of them oligarchs and friends lermov said but the world financial crisis has altered things many who had billions have lost billions theyre keeping their heads down and trying to recoup they wouldnt like an ill wind blowing in from the motherland i havent the slightest sympathy for those bastards if you do need help in that area remember that the state owns belov international and the chief executive officer is max chekhov hes the only oligarch i have any time for and thats because hes in my pocket ill bear that in mind think of the moscow mafia colonel someone tries to rock the boat by moving into someone elses territory and what does the boss do he sends for an expert a specialist usually a stranger from out of town to handle it ill take that on board and consider it prime minister but at your soonest colonel at your soonest you have my letter use it dont allow anyone to stand in your way he got up to go opened the door in the paneling and paused those fools oleg and petrovich i approve of you dumping them in a penal regiment it seemed appropriate lermov said but what about this greta bikov that her confessions have been of great assistance cant be denied but she is totally untrustworthy her behavior speaks for itself and what would you suggest prime minister i have a perfect solution there is a small gru detachment at station gorky am i right i understand so transfer her to it on a oneyear detachment he was gone ivanov turned poor silly little bitch will you tell her or do you want me to do it ill do it and in a way putins right it could be the making of her at least shes not being kicked out of the army lets get out of here weve got a lot to do anything special for me yes max chekhov dig out everything about him and what are you going to do give greta bikov her new orders which was not as bad as he expected sergeant stransky had brought her into the interrogation cell again where she had found lermov waiting and he told her the worst her face was blank eyes fixed and staring as he delivered the news this is the personal decision of the prime minister of all things there was not only a kind of relief but a slight smile putin himself im honored im sure that hes only thinking whats best for me i know i did wrong she smiled fully after all its only a year youve been very kind colonel she rose and turned to stransky who took her arm and led her away my god lermov said softly she thinks shes got away with it he laughed wryly as it suddenly occurred to him that she had and he got up and went in search of ivanov he found him sitting at his computer lermov paused and then asked how did it go with greta i got the impression she thinks shes come up smelling of roses god help the male members of staff at station gorky shell wreak havoc what have you got max chekhov age fifty married but no children wife lives with her widowed mother in st petersburg but he never visits a university degree in general engineering he worked as a road builder and military engineer in afghanistan wounded in a roadside ambush and sent home when we still thought we were winning the war worked for many construction firms and then came the crazy years oil and gas in siberia and all the other things like with most oligarchs it just happened and there he was a billionaire he loves london booze and women in that order but hes a shrewd operator which is why putin made chekhov chief executive officer when the state took over belov international i suppose the argument is that as a rich man in his own right hes to be trusted lermov said where does he live theres a company house off south audley street in mayfair which he never uses personally but leaves to visiting dignitaries his personal treat is an exclusive apartment on park lanewhere apparently he was shot in the knee one night by a hit man delivering flowers its thought to be the work of these gangsters the salters well they do get round dont they anything else a place off the west sussex coast called bolt hole its reached by a causeway passing through a marsh and its private there was an article about chekhov buying the place and wanting to build a helicopter pad and the authorities forbidding it because of the marsh and the birds being protected theres a photo of him if you want to see it he agreed not to build the helicopter pad and said hes fallen in love with the island show me lermov said and ivanov obeyed chekhov wore a reefer coat and leaned on a walking stick had long hair and dark glasses he looks pleased with himself well he would be having bought that place ivanov said it looks bloody marvelous to me heres another photo from the same newspaper a strange name bolt hole i wonder what it means probably saxon or something like that lermov said i think id like to see chekhov handle it for me speak to him and get him here now lets go have a drink in the bar ivanov said so it seems the prime minister wont be content with anything less than the destruction of ferguson and his entire group which has been tried before and failed but it doesnt have to you just need the right weapon if you want to be certain of hitting the bullseye you must be able to put the muzzle of your weapon against it and pull the trigger difficult when the target is people not really the man who tried to assassinate ronald reagan walked right up to him and fired in spite of the crowds and the security people lermov pointed out but that implies sacrifice ivanov suggested of course the principle beloved of suicide bombers but your truly professional assassin plans to perform the act and survive to do it again like carlos the jackal look how long he lasted i see what you mean ivanov said my studies of revolutionary movements and terrorism covers anarchist bombings in tsarist times fenian dynamiters when queen victoria was on the throne and in the twentieth century everyone from the ira to al qaeda one thing is clear except for religiously motivated suicide bombers seeking an imagined salvation the majority of terrorists would much prefer to survive and live to fight another day exactly so how many are we talking about ferguson roper the salters dillon and miller ivanov began plus millers sister monica starling shes dillons girlfriend now but working for ferguson lermov nodded blake johnson that adds up to eight ivanov said ten if kurbsky and bounine are still alive and well and in fergusons hands an invitation to a dinner party and a bomb under the table would take care of it ivanov said very amusing but nothing is that certain in life somebody tried a bomb under a table at wolfs lair in the hope of catching hitler out and it was a conspicuous failure sorry colonel i was obviously joking and the prime minister isnt what do you make of that advice he gave you when he said think of the moscow mafia and what they do when somebodys giving them a problem send for an expert a specialist usually a stranger from out of town who nobody knows yes ive been thinking about that it sounds like a plot from a movie but life often is lermov said because cinema in its simplicity gets straight to the point by leaving out all the boring bits im not certain what you mean colonel ivanov said warily that the prime minister could be right what we need is just such a man and i know where he is and where is that ivanov was totally bewildered the lubyanka prison his name is daniel holley hes british ivanov asked oh yes an extraordinary man and an even more extraordinary killer daniel holley his story looking back at his life daniel holley always felt it had started when he was twentyone when he had gone to belfast to take a masters degree in business but that was only because what had happened before was so ordinary he had been born in the city of leeds in yorkshire where his father luther holley taught at the grammar school an occupation he could afford for there was money in the family and he had inherited early at a rugby club dance one night he had met a young nurse who had just finished her training at leeds infirmary her name was eileen coogan and she came from a town called crossmaglen in ulster a hotbed of nationalism just across the border from the irish republic in spite of the fact that she was a roman catholic he married her for as his first name implied he was a protestant though no one had ever known him to go to church it was enough to make him refuse to allow the boy to be christened into the catholic faith no popery here was his rather illogical cry but his wife well used to his bullying ways let it be she exacted payment from him when she discovered that she could have no more children and insisted on returning to nursinga kind of victory as it turned out for she did well over the years and was a nursing sister when her husband suffered a pulmonary embolism one night was rushed to hospital and pronounced dead on arrival daniel a bright boy was accepted at leeds university at seventeen and by the time he was twenty he was halfway through his final year studying business and financial planning he took those subjects not because they were the greatest things in life but because he seemed to have a talent for it in actuality having served in the otc at school he was attracted to the idea of joining the army and entering sandhurst for the weapons training hed undergone in otc appealed to him but once again his father had said no and then his father had died there was a good turnout at lawnswood cemetery where they had the funeral a few teachers from the school and old pupils through the forest of umbrellas as people paused outside the entrance to the crematorium he noticed a stranger standing on the edge of the crowd about thirty years old from the look of him with a handsome rugged face he wore a raincoat and tweed cap and he looked like he was waiting for someone and then daniels mother rushed to him flung her arms around his neck and hugged him fiercely daniel hesitated then approached she turned crying oh what a blessing this is my nephew liam coogan come to pay his respects all the way from crossmaglen he was smiling as he took daniels hand in a strong grip a bad day for it with the rain but grand to see my only aunt after all these years and to meet you daniel he gave daniel a strong hug to be honest i didnt make a special trip your mother phoned mine with the news and me on the ferry from belfast to heysham en route to london lucky i called home they gave me the sad news so ive diverted as you can see youll stay the night with us eileen said god bless you i cant even come with you for the wake im delayed already for important business in london so i must be away it was just that as i was over by chance maybe it was a sign from god that i came to you in your hour of need and bless you for a kind deed she kissed him and turned to daniel take the car and see your cousin to the railway station now that would be wonderful liam said theres an express to london in fortyfive minutes then lets get going daniel said and led him to the car as he was driving daniel started to speak theres something i want to get straight he said all these years when we never saw you never had any contactthat wasnt us my mother and me it was my father and his obsessive hatred of catholics daniel dont we all know that at crossmaglen god help us but the old bugger must have really loved her to marry her in the first place he was an overbearing bully who liked his own way but i never doubted his love for her and hers for him he never allowed you to be christened i heard thats right jesus ive got a bloody prod for a cousin your mother did keep in contact over the years writes regularly to my mother always telling her not to write back but she made telephone calls maybe they can get together now daniel said my mother could visit in crossmaglen liam was still smiling but different now you wouldnt want to do that crossmaglen is ira to the hilt daniel its what the army calls bandit country itd be a bad idea to come back to ulster at this stage of the troubles he changed tack i heard some of the guests talking and you were mentioned only a few more months to your graduation and you only twenty business and financial planning well thats useful what about you i went to queens in belfast economics politics i taught for a while and now this and that wheeling and dealing they drove into the car park at the main railway station you have to turn your hand to anything you can in belfast these days he took out a wallet and produced a business card it said liam coogan finance amp business consultant you can get me at that number anytime its an answering service for some reason daniel felt emotional if im ever over there i will it was kind of you to do that for my mother you and she are family daniel and thats the most important thing in the world he was out and gone hurrying through the crowd and daniel switched on the ignition and drove away in with a firstclass honors degree under his belt it seemed natural to proceed to an mba and when he checked a list of suitable universities queens at belfast jumped out at him he was after all a half ulsterman though not born there but there were roots and perhaps it was time he sought them out his mother recently appointed a matron was slightly dubious some terrible things happen over there she said god knows its the country of my birth but im happy to be out of it and thats the truth well let me see for myself daniel told her ill get in touch with your nephew and see what he thinks it was three months since his fathers funeral and he had never tried to call the number on the card his cousin had given him as liam had said it was an answering service but it took his message and liam called back an hour later its grand to hear from you and congratulations on your firstclass honors how did you know that your mother talking to mine theyre at it all the time since your dad passed away so what are you going to do she was saying if it hadnt been for your dad youd have tried for sandhurst and the army yes i enjoyed my time with the otc at school but thats all in the past im thinking of coming to queens and doing an mba what do you think there was a long pause then liam said jesus daniel with your academic success you could take your pick of universities where life would be a lot less stressful im not knocking queens its a damn good university but belfast is still a war zone and youre english no im not im half irish daniel said youre english every time you open your gob liam said and that wont go down well with a lot of people so youre telling me not to come over now why would i do that the coogans have never taken kindly to being ordered what to do and youre half a coogan let me know when its definite but let me give you a piece of advice make sure you have a passport with you when you come but ulster is part of the united kingdom surely you dont need a passport when you enter the country security is the name of the game here the police and army have got complete power to stop search and question you anytime they choose its useful to have your passport with you as an identity card take careand let me know what you decide im going to come liam thats a given stubborn young bastard arent you on your own head be it just stay stum when you come and dont tell people what you are he started his course at queens later than usual at the beginning of november winter on the horizon it seemed to rain a lot although he didnt let that put him off venturing downtown with a raincoat and umbrella obviously sticking to the city center at first in spite of the bad weather he found himself enjoying what many people called the most dangerous city in the world that was a matter of opinion of course but it was true that the europa close to the railway station was the most bombed hotel in the world he ventured in for a drink one time and marveled at the extraordinary feats of bravery that had taken place there on the part of bombdisposal experts his room in a hall of residence was a short walk from the university a great deal of his work was personal research but there were occasional seminars and lectures so he did get the chance to sit in with people there were students from all over the world and from all over england but for the majority of them the accent of ulster was unmistakable you couldnt tell who was catholic and who protestant and yet the war being waged in the streets outside was as much about the religious divide as anything else sitting in the common room of the students union or drinking in the bar and observing his fellows there didnt seem to be any difference but there was and occasionally it surfaced after a general seminar one day he stayed on to discuss something with his professor visiting the bar afterwards he was hailed by two thirdyear students named graham and green whod also taken part in the seminar they were local students from derry which was all he knew about them except that they didnt appeal particularly green with his greasy unkempt hair and shabby jeans his liking for the drink was also clear a nasty piece of work daniel had decided and he tried to avoid him come on man green said you need a drink what a bloody bore wilkinsons seminar was he gets worse all the time get us some beers why dont you daniel joined them with reluctance returning with three bottles from the bar determined to be off of there in ten minutes green was already edging into drunkenness hows it going my english friend someone said you were from yorkshire remembering liams advice daniel hadnt advertised his ulster roots thats right are the girls any good where you come from daniel shrugged the same as they are anywhere no different nice girls are they decent not like those cows over there he indicated two girls sitting in the corner chatting over coffee they were perhaps eighteen in denim skirts and jumpers i dont understand daniel said carefully theyre fenian sluts green said theyd shag anybody graham nodded seriously youd need a condom there theyve probably got the pox because theyre catholics daniel asked its a known thing green said so watch it but how do you know im not a catholic graham said well youve got a yorkshire accent he roared with laughter then paused here youre not are you what the hell has it got to do with you what i am daniel turned and went out angry and thoroughly depressed he walked back to the residence hall and discovered a message for him pinned to the bulletin board it was from liam asking him to get in touch so he did and waited and liam came back to him half an hour later hows everything daniel took a deep breath and swallowed his anger there was no way he could tell liam what had happened fine liam its working out very well thats good listen ive a surprise for you my wee sister rosaleen is in town this weekend staying with friends shes a teaching assistant in an infant school shes coming home monday but shes free sunday night daniel and a charmer shed love to meet you and id love to meet her lets make it at my residence hall since weve never met thats the easiest ill give you my verdict and she was a charmer young and pretty with black hair reminding him totally of the dark rosaleen of irish legend they called his room to tell him he had a visitor but as he was going downstairs he knew it must be her the first time he saw her she carried an umbrella for it was raining outside and wore a dark blue overcoat over a dress and ankle boots a bag hanging by a strap from her left shoulder she smiled as he took her hand and reached up to kiss his cheek its so grand to meet you daniel the only fly in the ointment were green and graham who appeared from the common room at that moment they looked astounded whats this holley where have you been hiding it obviously the worse for drink again and he took her hand come on rosaleen well go down the road and have a bite to eat as they wandered out behind them green said rosaleen did you hear that shes a fucking fenian daniel started to turn and she pulled him around never mind them theyre just protestant shites that cant keep their gobs shut she was calmly fierce so he gave in offered his arm and they went down the road together where would you like to go oh fishandchips in a cafe will do me fine with a cup of tea and you can tell me all about yourself they spent two hours enjoying the simple meal and discovering each other he was extolling the joys of wharfedale in the west riding of yorkshire she the beauty of the south armagh countryside and they vowed to exchange visits it was ten oclock when they left the rain had stopped but the streets were sundaynight empty if we walk back to my residence hall i could call a taxi he said belfast taxis anytime of night cost a fortune and thats when you can get one its not all that far to where im staying fifteen minutes she laughed well maybe twenty nothing at all he said offered her his arm they waited for a white van that had been parked across the street to start up and drive past them and then they began to walk it began to rain again and she got the umbrella up laughing and they hurried on and there was only the odd car passing and then nothing as they turned into an empty street its shops locked up with their lights on and bare of parked cars a police regulation to discourage bombers a white vanwas it the same oneeased out of a street behind them passed and then braked the driver and his passenger wearing black hoods the rear doors burst open and two more men jumped out wearing hoods one of them holding a revolver rosaleen cried out and daniel closed in on the man holding the revolver grabbing for it with one hand and in the struggle tearing off the hood revealing green daniel shoved him away still trying to wrench the weapon from greens grasp but another man had run around the van and grabbed him from behind what the hell do you think youre doing daniel shouted as he struggled but green laughing madly cried ill tell you what were doing you fugger were red hand commandos and were going to teach you and that fenian bitch some manners behind him green struggled to force rosaleen into the back of the van and daniel heard it and her cry of despair and then green reversed his grip on the gun and struck daniel a heavy blow across the side of the head and that was the end of it daniel came to in subdued darkness his head throbbing and matted with blood and discovered that he was in the back of the van street light filtering in from the windscreen he tried to sit up and found that his wrists had been tied in front of him with some rough cord raising his hands he could see that the knot was large and had obviously been done in a hurry he had no difficulty in getting his teeth into it and was free in a couple of minutes heavy rain drummed on the roof and he slid to the rear and pushed open the doors with his feet aware of the vans tool kit to one side he opened it and found a tire iron he hefted it in his hand for a moment then got out he was in a cobbled courtyard a wide gate behind him standing open a streetlight beyond showing old and towering warehouses he turned and found a fourstory building a light over a large painted sign revealed bagley ironworks white lane belfast the whole place looked old and decrepit but there was a dim light inside and he went up some stone steps and pushed the door open there were workbenches a jumble of machinery hoists hanging from above rain drifting in and a woman crying then begging and pleading he stood there frozen then she screamed and somebody shouted be quiet you bitch and there was the sound of a heavy blow as he started upstairs the tire iron ready in his hand he heard a sudden desperate cry no please not that shut your gob was followed by sustained blows and a voice saying stop it you bugger youll kill her daniel reached the top of the stairs and found the door half open green was sitting at a table an open whiskey bottle beside him fiddling with the smith amp wesson a door was open behind him and suddenly it seemed very quiet a voice said jesus you fool you have killed her green turned to the open door daniel lurched forward and smashed him across the skull with the tire iron then picked up the revolver just as graham appeared in the doorway and shot him in the heart at pointblank range as graham was hurled backwards daniel took two quick paces forward and shot the next man he saw in the back of the head as the man started to turn the fourth man was old and wizened and shaking in terror for pitys sake dont i never laid a finger on her then whys your belt undone and your fly open you lying bastard daniel stepped close and put a bullet between the old mans eyes the sight of rosaleen now was something that would stay with him always and change his life forever make him a different man for dead she was beyond any doubt and lying on what was presumably some janitors bed he found an old rug to cover her broken and defiled body he went back into the other room and he heard a moan green was stirring and almost without thinking about it daniel shot him in the head he picked up the open bottle of whiskey raised it swallowed some down and emptied the rest of it over greens corpse you prod bastard green he said well im a prod bastard too looking around he realized the place must have been an office of sorts in its day there was a wall phone by the far door and he went and tried it and by some miracle it still worked so he did the obvious thing and called liam liam called back surprisingly quickly for once now then daniel how are things going with you and rosaleen and daniel told him he was sitting at the table clutching the revolver the blood oozing from the side of his skull when liam arrived almost an hour later patted daniel on the shoulder and went straight into the janitors room when he came out the look on his face was terrible to see there were half a dozen hardlooking men with him and two paramedics in green liam kicked greens corpse and said get rid of this rubbish and his pals round the back in the river will do he eased the gun from daniels grip ill have that now son i couldnt save her liam you did your best id say four kills is a remarkable number for a beginner and youre an expert so you would know thats right cousin ive been with the provisional ira since the beginning red hand commandos are protestants closely linked to the uvf well make them pay nobody can make them pay for what they did to her i know son i know behind him two men brought rosaleen out in a black body bag supervised by a paramedic what is this daniel asked we have an ambulance below the police dont stop ambulances at night were going to take you to a convent down in the country where the nuns are a nursing order and good friends of ours the other paramedic came forward and examined his head thats not good at all weve got to do something about that and fast he called to a couple of men just take him down which was really the end of it because although daniel remembered being on a stretcher in the ambulance across from the black bag he couldnt recall a single thing about the journey afterwards st marys priory it was called and the mother superior a sister bridget blaney was a qualified surgeon for they were little sisters of pity a nursing order whose help was there for all who needed it and in troubled times that was bound to include the ira coming to his senses daniel found himself coming out of an anesthetic in a recovery room sister bridget herself still wearing scrubs over her habit was smiling gently liam anxious behind her youll be fine daniel she said the faintest of cracks on the side of your forehead fifteen stitches will give you an interesting scar but what you need is a solid weeks rest in bed liam has told me of the circumstances here everything daniel said weakly rosaleen god rest that childs soul for i knew her well she is in heaven now and i shall pray for her and so must you he smiled weakly im not baptized in the faith sister my father wouldnt have it but my mother is a good catholic and a matron at a hospital in leeds well im sure she mentions you in her daily prayers and i will too even though im a protestant even that she said cheerfully but you must rest now and liam has to leave to take rosaleen home to crossmaglen and her family so say your goodbyes she went out and liam said now do as she says and take it easy ill be back daniel said just tell me one thing you and provos what about it youre not just another volunteer youre bigger fish than that liam took his right hand and held it tight after what you did for my beloved sister i count you closer than any brother no secrets between us ever so yes i am daniel nodded weakly i understand eamon de valeras father was spanish and it was his mother who was irish its the same for me if you think of it except my father was yorkshire liam frowned slightly what are you saying that maybe you could use me i know im still on morphine and things are a little fuzzy but i dont think theres a place in my life for the old daniel anymore i killed four men a few hours ago facetoface and as close as you could get and it didnt bother me god bless rosaleen and i hated them for what they did to her but to be able to do what i did liam he shook his head there was a devil inside me deep and hidden but hes found his way out liams face was grave rest son thats what you need ill take your love to the family and i can tell you now you have theirs for eternity rosaleens funeral was on wednesday afternoon three days after liam left with her body and the following morning to daniels astonishment there was a knock on his door it opened and his mother entered liam behind her my god i cant believe it daniel said she kissed him and pulled a chair forward your aunt spoke to me the moment she received the news from liam theres a direct flight to belfast from leeds bradford airport i was able to be at the funeral i know daniel the whole dreadful story and what those swine did to my beloved niece and what i did to them daniel said trouble violence the gun is the history of ireland daniel i was born to it and the history of the coogan family is full of it what you did had to be done a terrible deed how could i love you the less for it but i agree with liam its best you go away for a while leave the country in case theres even the slightest chance of this being held at your door it was interesting that liam had said it to her but he let that go as she got up youre away then yes liam has one of his men taking me to the airport now i love you dearly keep in touch any way you can and she was away the shock of my life that daniel said now whats all this about me going away liam now took the chair what you were saying about joining us now that your heads clear do you still feel the same way more than ever i have a suggestion we cant manage sandhurst for you though i know you had an interest in going there but we do have good relations with our islamic friends weve sent people with great success to algiers where we have an excellent contact all this costs money but we have plenty of that coming in from the states and qaddafis been more than friendly to us what happens when i get to algiers youll be passed from hand to hand until you reach a training camp deep in the desert by the time theyve finished with you youll be an expert in weaponry of every description explosives the mechanics of bomb making handtohand fighting assassination he shrugged what else can i say youre academically gifted you could get a job in the city of london anytime you wanted or you could do this that was then this is now my path has changed liam i must follow it your choice daniel ive had one of my people in belfast remove your things from your room and weve dropped a beautifully presented letter with a scrawled signature to professor charles wilkinson saying youre having to leave for urgent family reasons well thats it then daniel smiled when do i go as soon as sister bridget says youre fit can i keep in touch with you no problem im your control you have my card remember it was a good thing you had your passport in your pocket that night ill be back for you as soon as she agrees and then its over the border and well see you off from dublin the person who emerged from the desert oasis of shabwa at the age of twentythree bore little resemblance to the daniel holley who had entered it he was a thoroughly dangerous man in every way as he reported as ordered to the man in algiers who had received him in the first place one hamid malik a shrewd businessman whose line was general shipping in the mediterranean it was a front for darker matters and he handled the needs of a number of organizations involved as he liked to describe it in the death business the pira were clients and their money was good which was all that mattered for he was never a man to make judgments sitting opposite daniel in the heat of his office in algiers with an electric fan spinning on the desk he said remarkable daniel you went in a troubled boy and the reports from the camp say you are now a man to be reckoned with so what comes next thanks to the good offices of colonel muammar qaddafi the kantara with a substantial cargo of assorted weaponry is waiting in the harbor now for you to board her her destination is the coast of county down in northern ireland he pushed a large canvas bag across there are fifty thousand pounds in there qaddafis gift to your cause and the arms are free theres also a letter from liam coogan for you which you probably opened i am a careful man daniel and you have much to prove allah protect you the kantara proved to be a rust bucket with a crew of ten reasonably villainous arab seamen who showed a certain amusement when he boarded the captain was named omar and he smiled a lot ah the moneyman he nodded at daniels bag a little large for my safe but we can squeeze it in they were standing at the bridge rail thats not necessary daniel told him presumably theres a key for the cabin door certainly you will find it on the inside the crew grouped below seemed to find the whole thing funny muttering amongst themselves and laughing one of them a somali in a soiled white tshirt and jeans said a chicken for the plucking this one what will they send next daniel didnt react he understood exactly what the man had said and the implied threat a legacy of his time at the training camp was reasonable arabic but as his chief instructor had always said it was sensible to keep quiet about it prepared for trouble armed with information an enemy didnt know you had on the first day at sea lying on the bunk in his cabin with the bag in a locked cupboard underneath he listened to the drunken voices of the crew who were squatting under deck lights in the stern it was obvious that as far as they were concerned he was never going to reach his destination he reached under his pillow took out a browning pistol pushed it into the waistband at the back of his linen slacks and went out the ships bosun hussein had the wheel and omar was in the stern having a drink and laughing with the men daniel slid down the short ladder hands on the rails and they all were suddenly aware of him the somali spoke before anyone else so here he is the boy trying to do a mans job daniel produced the browning and shot him between the eyes knocking him against the rail the skull fragmenting the shock was complete and the crew cowered not knowing what to expect the kantara itself started to veer to port and daniel swung around to find that hussein had left the wheelhouse and was raising an ak rifle he shot him twice and hussein bounced against the front of the wheelhouse the rifle flying from his hands he fell across the bridge rail and tumbled to the deck daniel turned to omar and said in arabic im sure you like a neat and tidy ship so i suggest the crew dispose of these two over the side and wash the deck down and that you get up that ladder and behind the wheel we appear to be going round in circles and that wont do because my destination is northern ireland eight days later they drifted in to the county down coast fishing nets draping the deck as per liams instructions in the letter that malik had given daniel in the early darkness two trawlers came alongside and tied up liam leading the way the man with him joining with the crew of the kantara to transfer the cargo liam embraced daniel and followed him to his cabin where the bag was passed over what the hells been going on this radio message to malik two men lost overboard but proceeding i had trouble with the crew but i made my point early you mean the two over the side had a bullet in them i do anyway i dont feel disposed to the return passage thats fine we can send you back by air i dont know what happened here daniel but malik is straight as a die then he should take more care about who he hires in future can i stay liam is there anything active i can do not in ireland we invented the term informer and sooner or later most things surface if what you did at the bagley ironworks that night ever came out there are those on the other side whod hunt you down if it was the last thing they ever did in any case the army is bringing in the sas more and more and were feeling the effects good men being killed or ending up in maze prison youve trained me to be a soldier remember that yes and a hard man you can be we know but youve a top brain in that skull especially in the ways of business finance and the like you can serve us in other ways there are people like us all over the world with aspirations in their own country i want you to go into partnership with hamid malik hes got a genuine business and one that makes money but with something else underneath as you know youre too valuable to be a foot soldier and what will malik think about the idea i think youll find hell discover it impossible to resist they walked out on deck liam carrying the bag and found one trawler sailing away the other still alongside someone shouted are you coming or not liam were loaded were on our way liam crossed to the other deck and daniel glanced at omar standing at the bridge rail look for me in algiers you bastard and behave yourself as liam had said hamid malik agreed to the idea at once and daniel proved his worth very quickly reorganizing the administrative side of the shipping business introducing modern methods technology and computers it meant a growth in the companys legitimate side that malik had never anticipated there were plenty of oldfashioned freighters availablerust buckets perhaps but improved at small costand they were perfect for the trade that daniel expanded working every port in the mediterranean underneath with much assistance from libyan sources they supplied more arms to the pira to eta in spain and on one memorable occasion dealt with a contract brokered by liam for a weapons expert to go to south america on behalf of the colombian terrorist organization farc daniel had gone himself invoking liams wrath he had ended up on the run in deep jungle engaged in one firefight after another with pursuing colombian special forces and finally managed to escape across the peruvian border back in algiers it was business as usual the rise of islam inexorable pushed by their contacts in libya the firm had to concentrate on supplying the demands of people like the plo and fatah and ireland was less and less important besides the sas special forces of the british army had affected the pira so much that seventy to eighty percent of the latters planned operations had to be aborted the first gulf war came and went in and in february of that year an attempt to fire rockets on downing street from a parked van narrowly failed daniel read about it then phoned liam on the same old number it was an hour before he called back daniel said the downing street business is it one of yours it looks like a typical pira hit over the years their calls had been sparing absolutely not weve no bloody idea whose it is howre things at your end how do you think the death business has been booming in the middle east havent you noticed ive been thinking we might have to consider taking the fight to the british mainland again the sas are bleeding us dry we may have to try something else such as hitting at the british economy ive got sleepers in london daniel people who have ordinary jobs ordinary lives who just wait for what to be needed over the years many of them have attained a reasonable level of expertise in weaponry and the handling of explosives by spending what we call a holiday at one of our training camps in the remote part of the west of ireland and you have lists i have indeed the thing is if there was ever a special job when we needed to call some of them to action would you be interested in being their controller daniel answered without hesitation of course when would it be perhaps never i just wanted to know what you thought have they got those newfangled mobile phones in algiers yet not that ive seen well weve got them here and theyll change your life stay well ill be in touch but it was november when he heard from liam again a long time since you called daniel told him ive been banged up in maze prison for four years missed out on the city of london bombing but they gave me a compassionate early release lung cancer dammit liam you should have told me what are you up to the usual thing organizing trouble for the enemy were going ahead with the idea we talked about before a campaign in london next year that will shock the world theres a courier package on its way to you it was just delivered i havent had a chance to open it years ago i organized my sleepers in cells of seven theres one in particular a woman and six men i last activated them four years ago twelve small explosions rocked the west end of london for a twoweek period they got away with it and i closed them down the effect was incredible people were walking on tiptoe for months they all live in the kilburn area of london the package gives you their names and lastknown addresses i want you to go to london speak to the woman in charge and activate the cell at this stage i cant give them details of what they are required to do just hold themselves ready thats right the whole purpose of the cell system is to maintain absolute security i share no information about my sleepers with anyone on the army council even the chief of staff how do i persuade this woman i am from the right people she knows my name what you say is liam coogan sends you his blessing and says hold yourself ready and thats all tell her that when the time comes to strike the word will be the day of reckoning is here ill call you and you will pass it on he had a fit of coughing jesus i should give up the smoking do this for me son of course i will liam take care daniel thought about it for a while then phoned the airport and booked a flight trying to open the package with one hand as he did so it was saturday and caitlin daly was in the kitchen at the presbytery enjoying a cup of tea with her mother when the phone rang she answered and the voice with the slightest touch of a yorkshire accent said caitlin daly yes who am i speaking to liam coogan sends you his blessing and says hold yourself ready the shock was immense and she put a hand on the table to steady herself who are you just call me daniel im liams cousin you dont sound irish my mother was from crossmaglen im sitting in a rear pew in the church of the holy name its very peaceful and not a soul here can i see you my time is limited i have a plane to catch to algiers five minutes she put down the phone and her mother said who was that dear business caitlin told her ive just got to go round to the hospital she reached for her coat and put it on i shant be long reading the notes on caitlin daly her tragic experience as a child in derry her life till now in her midthirties daniel had expected to find her interesting but he hadnt been prepared for her beauty it left him momentarily speechless but not daly whats going on she demanded recovering his wits he said im only here as a mouthpiece for liam im to tell you that you must consider your cell activated there will be a campaign in london next year that will shock the world though at this stage he cant give you details of what you are required to do and how will we know when the time comes to strike the word will be the day of reckoning is here he will tell me and i will pass on the order to you those are his instructions so we wait thats what he told me and this list for you the members of your cell do the names of these six men still make sense oh yes they are all members of the hope of mary circle at the refuge here at the hospice some sort of a club much more than that the sound basis for all our lives i will call them together tonight and inform them of the situation he stood up youre a remarkable young woman caitlin and you are a remarkable young man daniel he left her then and went out the door banging and she stood there leaning on the back of the pew shaking with emotion the vestry door opened and monsignor murphy came out oh its you caitlin i thought i heard voices who was it a stranger from a faroff land monsignor who wandered in by chance hes gone now i sent him on his way she took his arm lets go to the presbytery and join mother for a cup of tea that evening having called the other members of the cell in turn she met them in the chapel at hope of mary barry flynn pool costello cochran and murray joined her and filled with excitement and awe they recited their own special prayer together at roughly the same time that daniel holley arrived in algiers although it would be many years before he discovered that meeting had taken place two months later liam coogan died of a sudden heart attack daniel was in hazar at the time brokering an arms deal for the bedu army in that region malik reached him on his mobile but protocol was a delicate matter with arab rulers and it was a week before daniel could get down to the port by land rover and find a plane to fly out there was no possible way he could have got to crossmaglen to attend the funeral and there would have been great danger for him anyway the funerals of provo leaders like liam were always very public affairs and attracted a great deal of media attention the real shock hit him when he went in the office and malik said a terrible tragedy liam going like that but maybe it was a blessing with a prolonged death from cancer to look forward to at least hell have a smile on his face wherever he is now whats that supposed to mean daniel asked the provisional ira bombed the canary wharf business district in london two weeks ago daniel was stunned i cant believe it is my mail here on your desk there was no message of any kind from liam but on the other hand if hed wanted to speak to daniel he could have made contact by mobile even in such a remote country as hazar the truth was that if liam had been responsible in any way for the london bombing he would have contacted daniel and told him to activate the cell he hadnt because somebody else had been responsible the chief of staff knew liam was a dying man and had probably taken appropriate steps so thered been no message to daniel to pass on to caitlin daly her cell would doubtless have taken pleasure in the news from london but been disappointed in their failure to be a part of it should he phone her he toyed with the idea and dismissed it the bombing had had nothing to do with liam that was the truth of it he was a sick man a dying man and others had taken care of it so he put his sorrow behind him and got down to work busy with deals to pakistan and then in june the provos struck again the center of manchester devastated but in the end enough was enough and the ceasefire of became peace the following year how had caitlin daly felt he used to wonder waiting for the call that never came the call that was obviously so important to her but it was over now and done with until the next time he smiled wryly admitting to himself that nothing had changed not really there might be peace but the pira still ran the largest crime syndicate in europe so to hell with it wars and rumors of wars world terrorism islam on the march chechnya bosnia there was no end to it business was business as far as malik was concerned and daniel went with the flow operating on the theory that a good product and a pistol in the pocket was all you needed to get by the life he had led had made him a total cynic and that was all he believed in anymore his luck ran out in always take care in the balkans malik used to say they kill each other at the drop of a hat that was certainly true enough for kosovo its muslim citizens hated serbs beyond anything else in the world and wanted independence daniel had brokered three previous deals in kosovo for the muslims had plenty of money to spend on arms supplied by sympathizers in the oilrich gulf states a bulgarian agent named kovac made the arrangements and they were simple enough all daniel needed in the wild backcountry was a smuggler who knew the forest area and a suitable old land rover the drivers name was mahmud and he didnt speak instead concentrating on his driving on the narrow mud tracks of the forest a rifle at his feet he was about fifty unshaven and with a walleye daniel had met him on one previous occasion and remembered that hed been surprised at how good his english was and mahmud had explained that at nineteen he had gone to england to manchester where his uncle lived how far to this lamu place not long now mahmud said i saw you a year ago how are things now do the serbs still raid the villages sure they do they rape our women kill the children burn the mosques all those things and sometimes the russians come daniel frowned i hadnt heard that the russians arent supposed to be here the united nations wouldnt sanction it mahmud shrugged they stay round here in the border country special soldiers they call spetsnaz daniel sat there thinking about it and wondering what the russian game was that they were strong supporters of the serbs was a given so their presence in this muslim part of kosovo gave him pause for thought lamu now just up ahead mahmud pointed to a crossing of tracks where the trees thinned out and there was a sudden engine roar as a large armored vehicle plowed through small trees from the right and braked to a halt it was a russian storm cruiser daniel recognized it at once weve got trouble he said as two armed men in uniform leapt out mahmud picked up his rifle and scrambled out firing a wild shot then turning to run and was immediately shot down the soldiers walked forward slowly weapons ready beyond them several more had emerged from the storm cruiser and stood watching daniel opened the door and got out hed picked up enough russian over the years to understand it when one of the soldiers said who are you so he responded as a reflex pulling the browning from his pocket and shooting both of them in the heart doubletapping first one and then the other as he turned to run into the forest there were cries of dismay from the other soldiers and a fusillade of shots as they ran forward he was hit in the right thigh he was aware of that and then the left shoulder he went down and they were on him in seconds boots swinging and then somebody shouteda voice of real authority he knew thatand then there was only the blackness he came to on a bed in a room with a beaded ceiling feeling no pain only a general numbness he was heavily bandaged and a man was sitting at his bedside in a highback chair smoking a cigarette he wore combat fatigues with the tabs of a full colonel and when he spoke his english was excellent so you return from the dead i think mr holley he smiled and held up daniels passport what an interesting man you are but then ive heard of you before in fact many times over the years who are you spetsnaz daniel croaked the unit im with is but im colonel josef lermov of the gru both of the men you shot have died they usually do my men wanted to kill you but we cant have that im sure you have a fascinating story to tell the unit paramedic has patched you up and well be returning to our base in bulgaria where you can have proper treatment people like kovac are seldom trustworthy i find my own fault daniel said ive taken the pitcher to the well too often what happens now a short trial in moscow oh we dont do that these days very counterproductive moscow certainly but i fear it likely to be the lubyanka not the death sentence it is unfortunate that you killed those two men but your death would be such a waste im sure you tell a good story and i look forward to hearing it sleep now he went out clicking off the light daniel lay there trying to make sense of it all but his brain was befuddled by morphine it was over that was all he could think of after all these years it was over and he closed his eyes and drifted into sleep moscow a hell of a story ivanov said when lermov was finished hes been in the lubyanka five years now i did his first interrogation when we got back from the kosovo mission which was a highly illegal affair anyway so he couldnt be put on trial in any public sense which explains him serving life imprisonment at the lubyanka ivanov said exactly for the good of the state rubberstamped in some office so he just sits there in his cell going slowly mad lermov shook his head ive kept watch over him when we first got down to business i pointed out that the usual prospect for a man like him would be a transfer to station gorky where all he could expect was treatment of a kind that would shorten his life considerably on the other hand if he cooperated with me he could enjoy privilegedprisoner status at the lubyanka his own cell and a job in the library and he proved sensible ivanov said but then who wouldnt no it was more complicated than that you could say he was just being sensible a pragmatist but i soon discovered it was subtler i never had the slightest difficulty in getting answers to my questions from him thats extraordinary ivanov said but why ill tell you later i have to speak with the governor of the lubyanka im going to get him transferred here to my authority and what do you want me to do ivanov asked make sure max chekhov gets here soon in london max chekhov was in his apartment in park lane standing in front of a mirror in his dressing room and adjusting his bow tie when his mobile sounded who is it he asked in english the answer came in russian and used his old army rank major chekhov yes captain peter ivanov calling from gru headquarters in moscow on behalf of colonel josef lermov chekhov was immediately wary for as an old military hand with connections at the highest level of government he knew the name lermov was one to take seriously what is this about he demanded im due at the royal opera house in a couple of hours to see carmen well im afraid shell have to wait ivanov told him your presence is requested in moscow by the prime minister no less chekhov was shocked and also immediately worried why whats this about youll find out soon enough theres a plane waiting for you at berkley down i suggest you dont keep the prime minister waiting he clicked off and chekhov called major ivan chelek at the embassy and when he answered told him what had happened have you any idea whats going on ivan i cant say max i do know that putins appointed josef lermov as head of station here hes also given him the task of solving the kurbsky riddle ive been helping the investigation at this end as much as i could and what have you found thats not for me to say max if i were you i wouldnt linger he switched off and chekhov unfastened his bow tie and started to unbutton his dress shirt angry but frightened as well what the hell did putin want him for the reason for his unease was a dark secret sometime before charles ferguson had ordered his kidnapping by the salters and chekhov had ended up at the holland park safe house chekhov was not a brave man and he had spilled the beans about various matters to earn his release if it ever got out at the kremlin he was not only finished he was a dead man on the other hand ferguson had never approached him again maybe nobody knew with a sinking sense of dread chekhov began to dress appropriately for winter in moscow ivanov found lermov in the bar vodkas waiting in a bucket of crushed ice the colonel toasted him how did it go with chekhov ivanov took his vodka down in a single gulp and told him i got the impression the summons worried him he said the mention of putins name worries a lot of people lermov swallowed another vodka what about you daniel holley you mean i spoke to the governor at the lubyanka and faxed him a copy of the putin letter holley is on his way here you were going to tell me more about his interrogation yes i was when i told you that i had no difficulty getting answers to my questions you sounded a little disappointed it was as if you expected more from him you could be right i suppose ivanov admitted it took me a long time and many interviews to really get to the truth about him he told me his secrets but it wasnt because he was afraid of the threat of station gorky what is he afraid of then ivanov asked nothing lermov shrugged he is a nihilist and what would that be a common philosophy in tsarist times a nihilist is someone who believes that nothing has any valuein his case that nothing has any value anymore im not sure i follow ivanov said the rape and murder of rosaleen coogan and his execution of the four men responsiblei think it completely changed him i dont think hes been able to take anything seriously since then to him its all a violent game in a way and you think thats the way he sees it yes i do lermov took off his glasses and pinched his nose and if he doesnt care about anything that includes himself come in dr freud lermovs mobile sounded and he answered it listened and nodded well see you in two minutes he gave ivanov a brief smile holley is at the main entrance ill leave you to do the honors just bring him up to the office and we wont need a guard as ivanov approached he saw a man in a black tracksuit standing between two prison guards and chatting with them to ivanovs surprise he didnt have the shaved head of a prisoner which was privilege indeed his dark brown hair was reasonably long with no sign of gray in spite of his age he looked fit and well in the tracksuit his good strong face wore a slight smile the smile of a man who couldnt take anything too seriously mr holley im peter ivanov the two guards put their heels together and ivanov signed for him god bless lads holley told them in very acceptable russian dont do anything i would they went away smiling and he turned to ivanov what happens now i take you to colonel lermov ive been working with him on this case by order of the prime minister i am impressed ivanov led the way and holley said youll know all about me then you could say that so youll know what dear old josef wants with me of course i do but i think hell prefer to tell you himself this way he gestured up the stairs to the walkway and followed holley up lermov was standing beside the old tea lady and she was filling a glass for him just in time josef holley said ill join you another for my friend babushka lermov told her you look good daniel theyve been treating you well i think six months since you last saw me holley said ive been promoted looking after the accounts in the general supply office a corrupt lot the staff in there thieves and chancers most of them merited a cell themselves yes the governor told me how pleased he was didnt want to part with you holley sipped the tea the old lady had given him and is he going to part with me how can he who says so lermov took the letter from his pocket and unfolded it captain ivanov and i have several copies between us its proved to be an open sesame everywhere weve shown it holley held it in one hand and studied it still sipping his tea well it would wouldnt it vladimir bloody putin himself he handed the letter back your chum here dismissed the guards what was that all about we dont need them ivanov told him what are you going to do daniel suddenly make a run for it where would you go daniel now is it holley said we are getting friendly he switched to english and the yorkshire accent was obvious ill say it again josef what goes on lermov answered him in english its a miracle youre here at all daniel five years ago when you killed two of my men in kosovo the rest wanted to execute you i kept you alive with two bullets in you for moral reasons then discovered wed captured someone very special indeed someone worth saving holley said absolutelyan open window on terrorism and the death business over twenty years of hard experience you were beyond price and the knowledge ive gained from our many talks has been i nvaluable happy to have been of service but i didnt have much of a choice about that did i station gorky lermov shook his head at least be honest with yourself you had a choice of a better option and took it whatever else you are youre no martyr daniel and shall i tell you why you have to believe to be a martyr you my friend dont believe in anything daniel holley changed something dark passing on his face like a shadow over the sun an elemental force there that had ivanov reaching for the flap of his holstered pistol and then holley actually laughed you want to know something josef i think you might well be right what happens now lermov nodded to ivanov who said to holley in english you and i will go into the office opposite where ill show you a dvd and offer you certain files on the computer some of which is information gained from you from our conversations over the years lermov cut in then well have a look at a situation that is giving us trouble and well see what suggestions you might make to rectify the matter ivanov finished thats what you were always good at daniel isnt that so analyzing the situation assessing the risk youre a master at that sort of thing lermov said if thats supposed to make me feel good youre wasting your time what is the point of this exercise josef your sentence daniel youve done five years so far youre fortynine and look forty on a bad day but as the years roll on that wont last maybe we can do something about that your logic is irrefutable holley turned to ivanov so lets go into the damn office and see what youve got ill leave you to it lermov told him and went along to the walkway to where the old tea lady had pushed her trolley when holleys mood turned black tea colonel no babushka i need vodka a lot of vodka the one with the accent hes a little mad i think arent we all babushka lermov told her and went down the stairs but instead of the bar he went to his room sat at a desk by the window got out the manuscript of the book he was working on and read through the current chapter which had been cut off in midsentence by a tap on the shoulder by ivanov in the university library it was good stuff but it was unfinished there was no ending but then there seldom was in his business the life hed chosen instead of a calm and scholarly career in the academic world it suddenly struck him that hed never really had a choice he glanced at the final page of the chapter then closed the manuscript with a kind of finality and put it in his briefcase so what next he asked himself softly and the knock on the door answered him holley wore a cord around his neck a redandgold security tag dangling from it of the kind worn only by senior staff members lermov pointed to it whats this he asked ivanov i thought people might wonder who he was when hes walking round you know like going to the lavatory or down to the bar josef holley told him he pulled a chair forward sat opposite lermov and ivanov leaned against the door lermov said so youve gone through everything daniel absolutely you dont seem to have missed much you and the boy wonder here so what do you think about the fact that the boss man wants charles ferguson and his people eliminated and doesnt care how you do it yes lermov replied calmly well i like his advice about that moscow mafia hit man its almost flattering ive been called many things but mafia has never been one of them get on with it all right if we take fergusons immediate clan that means roper dillon miller and his sister the two salters and blake johnson eight in all holley said dont forget kurbsky and bounine ivanov put in silly me holley said i was forgetting the greatest novelist russias produced in modern times a possible nobel prize winner so ten in all so it would appear peter joked that all we needed was a dinner party and a bomb under the table holley glanced at ivanov its the real world were talking about here he turned back to lermov so the man in the kremlin wants no hint of any russian influence in this whole affair if possible so if there was a hint of pira about what takes place that would be just the thing daniel asked exactly lermov leaned forward i was thinking of caitlin daly holley allowed his anger to show damn you josef i should never have told you about her you told me many things daniel it was part of our agreement this is ridiculous i visited her only once lermov in november thats fourteen years ago she could be dead for all i know she is alive and well living and working exactly where she was then lermov smiled i had major ivan chelek at the london embassy make inquiries holley said he went to the church i suppose something like that he said she was a very attractive lady she would be about fifty now holley said chelek said you could take ten years off that holley suddenly got up i dont know about you two but i need a drink i cant get my head round this he turned to the door ivanov barred his way for a moment but lermov nodded so holley pulled it open and went out ivanov said he doesnt seem keen hell come round weve talked so many times over the years i feel i know him he shrugged at least as much as one can ever hope to understand another human being forgive me colonel but im a cynic ivanov told him i often experience considerable difficulty in knowing myself i admire your honesty tell me something how often have you killed i was too young for afghanistan and the first chechen war but i was bloodied in the second i was twenty when i went to that field intelligence not infantry but it was a desperate bloody business the chechens were barbarians of the first order imported muslims from all over the place to serve with them you couldnt drive anywhere without being ambushed yes i saw some of that myself lermov said and know exactly what you mean daniel holleys experience has been different his killing has been close and personal back in kosovo when my spetsnaz boys got him he doubletapped the two men he killed on the instant no hesitation i wonder how many times he did that on his travels ivanov said it stands to reason that as an arms salesman he kept rough company exactly lermov stood up lets see how hes getting on they found holley sitting in the bar a glass of beer in front of him and a large whiskey lermov said i thought you had no money i told the barman i was waiting for you have a seat lermov waved to the barman and sat down holley raised the beer and drank not stopping until the glass was empty he finished with a sigh and said in english as theyd say in leeds that were grand he reached for the glass of whiskey and tossed it down and that were even better would you like another one lermov asked not really itd be nice to have a rugby match to go with it but this is moscow not leeds and russia not yorkshire so lets get down to brass tacks and what would that be why do you think a woman i spoke to fourteen years ago will still be waiting and still interested in a cause long gone but thats what sleepers do daniel theyre always the chosen ones the believers and they wait no matter how long it takes even if theyre never needed at all a gloomy prospect holley said and let me remind you what caitlin daly did back in the bombs she and her cell set off in london the general panic confusion and fear she caused lasted for months a considerable victory holley said i know all that anyway theres not just her to consider what about the men in her cell alive or dead who knows i cant even remember their names i can help you there i have a fax all the way from your old partner in algiers hamid malik i got in touch with him when you fell into my hands five years ago hes proved a valuable asset to us lermov told him you clever sod holley said he waved to the barman yes i am arent i anyway he had the original correspondence from your cousin liam and i have all the names it means nothing even if these men are still round theres no way of knowing if they feel the same way about dear old ireland true but ive given the list to chelek and hell trace them you said you didnt want any obvious russian involvement in this business absolutely right but itll save you time and once you get there itll all be in your hands itll also be of assistance to caitlin daly if she has lost touch but you wont know that until youve seen her dont you mean if i see her holley asked and drank his new beer down no i mean when you see her so make your decision now to arrange the deaths of ten people one of them a woman isnt what i planned to do when i got up this morning you mean when you got up in your cell at the lubyanka where captain ivanov will certainly return you if i order him to and then ill give him another order to do what to get your head shaved your belongings packed and ready for the earlymorning flight to station gorky there was a pregnant moment and ivanov looked wary holley said so in the end josef youre just as bad a bastard as the rest of us ive no intention of having my head served up on a plate at the kremlin i can see that youre not the john the baptist type so you want me to play public executioner again i suppose i do and can the hawk fly away to freedom afterwards i should imagine that is exactly what he would do if this matter was resolved to our mutual satisfaction excellent holley tossed his whiskey down if youd said yes i wouldnt have believed you anyway he got up right i dont know what you are doing about my accommodation but i presume i can use the office so im going to go up now and knock out some sort of plan of action a room will be arranged for you lermov told him but the office is yours you may use my authority to extract any information you like from the gru computers and this max chekhov whos on his way from london i know were supposed to keep the russian influence out of things but hes floating along on a sea of money booze and women i bet he could be useful he went out and lermov said so peter are you disappointed again no ivanov said i think hes a thoroughly dangerous man i know and he looks so agreeable lets have another vodka on it there was snow mixed with sleet in the evening darkness as the falcon carrying max chekhov landed at the belov international privateaircraft facility close to the main moscow airport when the plane pulled in to the entrance of the terminal building and chekhov came down the steps lermov was waiting for him in full uniform fur hat and fur collar he saluted giving chekhov his title one soldier to another major chekhov josef lermov kind of you to meet me colonel a pleasure but also a duty the prime minister is waiting for you now for a moment chekhov was terrified again and fought to control his shaking he stumbled slightly mounting the icy steps leading into the terminal his walking stick sliding lermov caught him and laughed take care i wouldnt want you to fall and break a leg the prime minister doesnt permit excuses that is my experience of him too they reached the limousine a porter following with chekhovs bags and found ivanov waiting lermov made the introductions then he and chekhov sat in the rear and ivanov got behind the wheel and drove away the snow was falling lightly now and it was really rather peaceful chekhov said its a great pleasure to meet you you name is certainly familiar to me could i ask what this all is about general charles ferguson chekhovs sudden anger blotted out any fears he was going through at that moment that bastard im half crippled as you may have noticed and its all his fault a shotgun blast in one kneecap delivered by gangsters in his employ yes id heard something of the sort well the prime ministers had enough hes entrusted me with the task of doing something about it he wants them finished off with his rather unique experience of the ways of general charles ferguson and company chekhov had reservations about lermovs prospects but felt it politic to offer only enthusiasm and he was relieved to hear that they didnt seem to know anything about his other past history with them this could work out nicely i will tell you colonel and with all my heart i would like nothing better than to see those swine wiped off the face of the earth then we must do our best to oblige you twenty minutes later they were sitting in the same office where lermov had met putin before the one that belonged to general volkov once head of the gru as they waited chekhov said a great man volkov did you know him not intimately disappeared off the face of the earth i wonder what became of him oh i think it highly likely that he and his men were murdered by this man dillon on fergusons orders lermov told him good god chekhov crossed himself yes they fully deserve killing and the prime minister has told me i may rely on you for any help i need before chekhov could reply the wall panel opened and putin appeared in a tracksuit there you are chekhov good flight is your leg improved excellent prime minister really excellent chekhov gabbled has colonel lermov explained the task i have given him yes sir he has chekhov managed to say i completely agree with everything you have ordered he may rely on me totally in london good putin turned to lermov hows it going very well prime minister i was inspired by your advice to think moscow mafia and how they would handle it and youve come up with an answer a man prime minister and just the one for the job dont tell me putin said just get on with it and let the result speak for itself good luck he moved the door opened in the paneling and he was gone chekhov heaved a sigh of relief thank god lets get out of here where do we go now the astoria the staff hotel for gru headquarters its not exactly the dorchester but youll be amongst friends chekhov accepted the astoria with good grace for an old soldier amongst soldiers again usually fits in ivanov helped him settle in and suggested meeting downstairs in half an hour for a meal chekhov said look captain i was wounded in afghanistan so im not just a rich fool like some of my fellow oligarchs your colonel has told me about your plan and the prime ministers just confirmed it to me do you have a problem with it of course not those bastards crippled me but just sit down for ten minutes and tell me exactly whats happening would that be asking too much not at all ivanov said and told him everything afterwards he left chekhov to unpack and went in search of holley whom he found in the office working away on the computer papers spread around sometimes making notes by hand he sat down for a while watching him i see you still like doing things the oldfashioned way it may seem strange holley said but i find that no matter how much information i accumulate electronically i can extract the essence of things with a few brief notes by hand and what are you searching for they turned and found lermov standing in the doorway chekhov peering over his shoulder max chekhov daniel holley holley nodded and said anything and everything about all the individuals involved in this affair their comings and goings their timetables take lady monica starling for instance ive now got her family home in essex her brothers house in dover street her rooms in cambridge ive got a full schedule of her lectures and seminars online and ive got pretty much the same for most of the people on our list as much as is possible so when do you think youll be ready lermov asked to give daly a call and tell her the day of reckoning is here oh very soon i should think first i need something from you encrypted mobiles one for each of us and a spare for caitlin daly lermov said see to that peter anything else youll have my passport on file somewhere id only just renewed it in ninetyfour when you grabbed me in kosovo you want to have it back lermov asked it would be nice and dont forget i was always a highly successful businessman in the worlds eyes although a trifle disreputable because of the arms dealing the darker side of my record has never been in the public domain i even have a bank deposit in london if you can find the passport your people could put a stamp or two in it to fill in the fiveyear gap holley nodded looking thoughtful and while youre at it prepare another british passport to go with it daniel grimshaw a good yorkshire name i can thicken my accent to go with that is that all lermov said if it is i suggest we go down for dinner holley shook his head ill join you a bit later i still need to check a few things about the opposition i need to know exactly what their schedules are he smiled you said that if you want to assassinate ten people invite them round to dinner and explode a bomb under the table obviously we cant do that but assassination victim by victim has its problems also its like a warning light to anyone else connected i can see that but whats the answer to hit everybody at once no matter where they are that would take some planning ivanov told him you could say that so leave me to it and id appreciate the encrypted mobiles at your soonest they left and holley cut to the news on television they were talking politics as usual and there was some fuss about europes cry that the russian federation was depriving them of gas and oil turning off the pipelines they cut to putin vigorously defending himself blaming america for interfering in european affairs castigating britain for supporting them it seems there was some meeting of the un in just a week and putin was going there to defend his point of view holley switched off smiling slightly clever bastard he said softly daring the president and the prime minister to show up and face him which of course they wont and then a switch clicked in his head what was it he had seen he quickly paged through his notes andyes there it was harry millers parliamentary diary th february visit to the united nations new york on behalf of the prime minister it was the date of putins intended appearance he pushed a bit further and found a booking for miller at the plaza hotel in new york a place he knew well looking across central park and there was something else hed noticed before what was it what was it and then he had it his fingers danced over the computer keys again accessing the white house administrative logs yes blake johnson would be spending a threeday weekend on long island and in new york city on presidential business at the united nations and the first day of blakes holiday was february th a friday miller amp johnson holley smiled after a while ivanov entered the office a bag in one hand he opened it and produced two mobile phones with their chargers holley examined one it looks good small light its called a codex produced by british intelligence to be honest weve simply stolen it and manufactured it for ourselves its totally encrypted the number for each one is on the sticker on the back you just peel it off excellent and ive gone round to records and found your passport im having the forgery section bring the passport uptodate with a few entry stamps as you wanted and theyre creating a new one for daniel grimshaw he held up a small camera so dont smile please just look solemn he took what he wanted and lermov came along the walkway and opened the door whats all this forgery need a passport photo ivanov told him i see chekhovs gone to bed i think we all should one more thing holley said i need some clothes i suppose we could find something suitable enough for flying in the falcon ivanov began and holley cut him off dont be stupid i am not flying in the falcon british intelligence monitors your planes in and out of the country i cant afford to be seen anywhere near you and to be frank about it neither can chekhov he shouldnt be observed getting off a russian flight in the company of important gru people its too political a statement lermov nodded youre right of course i see you have the mobiles you wanted we have them now too so we can keep in touch at all times ivanov will take you shopping for clothes tomorrow but what guarantee do we have that once out of our sight he wont do a runner colonel ivanov demanded dont be silly where would he go ivanov went out and lermov turned and smiled so its coming together for you you think i think so i know how the game should proceed the moves the players would be required to make but until i have spoken to caitlin daly and checked whether her cell has survived i can give you no assurance of anything i understand when do you want to leave the sooner the better the day after tomorrow if possible certainly no longer than the day after that ill leave you now to make your call he opened the door and paused as holley said and which call would that be daniel as the americans say you cant kid a kidder you havent asked for mad money to survive on for accommodation while youre in london or most important of all for weaponry this can only mean you have a source in mind someone with an encrypted mobile like you have now amazing things mobiles within two minutes you can be talking to someone anywhere in the world algiers for instance you wily old fox holley told him its been said before ill leave you to it in the old moorish house on the hill overlooking the harbor of algiers hamid malik lay on the bed in his bedroom the windows open to the night air the light wind stirring the fragrance from the garden below he was reading a dayold copy of the financial times and wondering what the world was coming to and then his mobile sounded who is this he asked in arabic holley replied in english thickening his yorkshire accent its me you daft bastard i cant remember the exact words but somewhere in the bible it says for this my son was dead and is alive again malik bursting with emotion replied in arabic praise be to allah i have always known what happened to you in kosovo long ago a man named lermov got in touch with me so i understand he tells me youve been a valuable asset purely business arms for somalia or wherever the russians are stirring up trouble so the death business is booming as always partner so when can i see you back in algiers im not sure theres a rather unusual mess in london that the russians want me to clear up blood in the streets you mean malik groaned daniel you are closer than a brother to me when does it end as allah wills old friend holley said theres a debt to pay here if im to be set free i see malik thought about it for a moment what if you went ahead with this venture got to london and simply disappeared this would be easy for me to arrange you know i have blood relatives living in england connections of every kind in the islamic world russia is one of the most powerful nations on earth with round sixty thousand gru members worldwide one way or the other id be hounded down if i did a runner i must go with the tide on this one and hope for the best so how can i help you ill need a banker and weaponry your cousin with the antique shop in london in shepherds market is he still alive selim malik very much so that would be fine the albany regency is just round the corner tell him to book me a studio suite there from the day after tomorrow nothing too ostentatious ive always found that staying in a reasonably expensive class of hotel is the best cover of all ill take your word for it anything else theyve recovered my old passport for me but theyre putting together another one daniel grimshaw born in leeds daniel said i must admit that sounds yorkshire enough you are presumably using an encrypted phone a british codex give me your number holley did now we are truly linked like brothers just as in the old days malik laughed stay well my friend and stay close the following day ivanov took holley to gum a store which seemed to be able to supply every human need and as the clothes had to support holleys role as a prosperous businessman he went for top of the range in everything somewhat to ivanovs alarm the prices here are shocking youve got the card lermov gave you so whos counting he got an excellent suitcase a black singlebreasted suit a navy blue blazer and gray flannel slacks four shirts two pairs of black shoes underwear a collegiatelooking striped tie and a black raincoat that ivanov said was outrageously expensive but had a reinforced inside pocket lined with soft leather in which to carry a concealed pistol youre sure thats it ivanov asked as he produced the card and paid why didnt you get something for yourself while were here holley asked that would be dishonorable ivanov said as they walked out and then he smiled besides better to wait the pound was down again in the paper this morning much cheaper to shop in london a sensible point of view they were walking towards the limousine obviously i havent fired any kind of weapon recently is there a firing range at headquarters holley asked in the cellars ill arrange it but i shouldnt imagine youll have a problem youre right of course but it would be sensible to test myself holley said as they drove away the firing range was the same as such places the world over the sergeant in charge was named lisin a hard old soldier favoring cropped hair and a gru tracksuit there was a bad scar on his left cheek that could only have been caused by a narrow missthe kiss of a bullet as the oldtimers put it it was a gloomy sort of place the cellar the bare lights at the far end picking the target figures out of the darkness six of them sidebyside here you are again then captain ivanov still wanting to try your luck thats it sergeant ivanov told him cheerfully what have you got for us today its good for you to handle the enemys preferred choices theres a glock here if anybody fancies it a beretta much used by the american army in vietnam and this browning hi power thats been round in the british army for years still the weapon of choice with many members of the sas ivanov hesitated a door creaked open behind and holley glanced over his shoulder and saw lermov and chekhov come in he turned back to ivanov of course the glock takes some beating but the other two have certainly proved themselves over the years he turned smiled easily at lisin who frowned suddenly wary lermov said show us how its done sergeant a pleasure sir lisin picked up the glock assessed the position and fired from left to right deliberately shooting the first three targets in the heart he put the safety on and turned to ivanov three totally dead men and thats the point sir isnt it he held the glock out would you like to have a go theres still plenty of rounds in it ivanov took the glock holding it twohanded turned and fired quickly at the other three targets he caught the edge of the heart in the fourth target the fifth under the ribs and the sixth in the top edge of the heart not doing too well today are we sir lisin said a slight smile on his face and ivanov was shamed lermov said we all have our off days peter lisin took the glock and fired at the three targets again in the same deliberate way shooting each one in the center of the heart he emptied the weapon and turned to holley would you like to have a go sir if so ill put up fresh targets no need holley told him ive never been in love with a glock and the beretta is a fine weapon but the browning has a history to it he turned holding the weapon against his right thigh then his hand swung up firing singlehanded in an oddly oldfashioned way starting with one and ending with six shooting each target between the eyes he ejected the magazine and pulled off his sound mufflers and placed the browning on the table lisin was dumbfounded ivanov stared at holley in awe ive never seen anything like that because its a gift lermov patted holley on the shoulder from god like all gifts from the devil is more likely holley said im going up to the office now he walked to the back of the cellar where chekhov was standing amazed if you can spare the time max i need to talk to you when chekhov joined him in the study he found him sitting at the computer come and look at this holley said chekhov pulled a chair forward bolt hole was on screen hey i recognize that its a magazine interview i did i didnt realize it was online theres more several magazine and newspaper stories ill show you they sat watching for five or ten minutes chekhov said laughing why are people so interested im not a film star youre an oligarch a billionaire youre a curiosity to the english how did you buy it it was advertised for sale in country life magazine i had my driver run me down to west sussex and fell in love with it i nstantly and bought it just like that its what we oligarchs do daniel we have so much money it has no meaning anymore do you often stay there whenever i can if theyd allowed me the helicopter pad i would probably have visited more because of the convenience but they didnt if i go down for a while i take staff from the town house that belov owns in mayfair so who looks after the place i own a cottage a mile and a half down the road on a creek running through the marsh its called patch end and a local lady a widow named lily white keeps an eye on bolt hole and acts as housekeeper her son jacob a local fisherman looks after my boat the mermaid and whats that like holley asked a bit like a sport fisherman but about twice the size i like to go for a sail when im there if the weathers right oh i dont know it can be fun or used to be ive been limited these last couple of years with my leg do you go anyplace else i go to the states every couple of months belov has a building in new york and i visit on business holley nodded okay thats all good to know now when you return to london make sure its by yourself you shouldnt be seen with anyone like lermov or ivanov ill do the same ill fly business class under an assumed name on a british airways flight to heathrow the only way i will communicate with you is by encrypted mobile the same rule applies to my dealings with lermov and ivanov id advise you to do the same for a moment the memory of his brief kidnapping and interrogation at the hands of charles ferguson and his people returned to haunt chekhov and he had an insane desire to tell holley all about it but that would never do he was after all still in russia he would just have to travel hopefully everything you say makes sense what happens when we get there and you speak to this caitlin daly woman i havent the slightest idea she might say youre out of your head get away from me or ill call a policeman which means the whole things off bizarre isnt it it certainly is max chekhov said ill see you later soon after the door clicked and ivanov entered with a large envelope which he emptied on the desk there was holleys original passport in very good condition along with another in the name of daniel grimshaw plus a drivers license i must say the forgeries are excellent holley told him you dont have a credit card ill take care of that myself and youre not going to tell me how of course not nor where youre going to stay thats correct now go tell your boss that im ready to go he went out holley found some plastic envelopes tidied the desk turned off the computer and left the office in his bedroom he took the purchases he had made at gum laid them on the bed neatly then put his holley passport in one of the plastic envelopes zipped it up and put it in the inside left pocket of the jacket of the black suit the grimshaw passport he put in the right inside pocket he laid out a white shirt and underwear socks a pair of shoes then packed everything else into the suitcase careful and meticulous as always but he liked things to be right and it meant that he was ready to go and everything else was in his head he went downstairs and found lermov in the bar with chekhov as usual they were drinking vodka everything in order lermov inquired i think you could say that holly waved to the barman a large scotch over here ivanov came in with an envelope in his hand as you ordered colonel the barman brought the scotch lermov opened the envelope and took out an airline ticket he examined it then pushed it over ten oclock in the morning daniel business class british airways to london just as you wanted holley examined it excellent the only thing missing is a few euros for expenses and a taxi from heathrow to downtown at the other end a thousand should do it i would have thought five hundred would be ample he smiled at holley after all as i understand it you have your own banking arrangements in place meantime the prime minister has asked me to join his party in new yorkhes giving a speech to the un on friday ill fly to london after that captain ivanov will leave in the embassy mail plane tomorrow and assist major chelek his slight weary smile was for all of them i think we know where we are with this business gentlemen chekhov tried to look eager the games afoot isnt that what the english say that writer conan doyle shakespeare actually daniel told him but well only have a game at all if caitlin daly decides to join us well lets travel hopefully lermov said and got up i need you in my office peter we have much to do before you go lets get one thing straight holley said as they say in the theater its my gig over there and what i say goes max takes his orders from me ivanov was going to say something but lermov shut him up of course daniel they went out daniel knocked back his scotch and chekhov said let me get you another why not but just the one chekhov called to the barman and daniel said your staff at belov international in new york are they mostly russian no the new york branch was an american firm when belov took it over years ago but we do have many russians there and as you must know the moscow mafia extends not only to london but also new york and you employ such people on the security side of things they can be very useful our head of security at the belov building is one such man mikhail potanin who is i suppose capable of most things lets say hes very reliable one has to be practical sometimes in business people must be persuaded to see reason that must be very reassuring for poor putupon businessmen like yourself holley got up to go chekhov said so it will be just the voice on the phone over there you will keep me informed wont you as much as i feel necessary youve got to trust me max after all ive got to trust you lermov will want to know everything i say to you so try juggling with that but remember what we agreed im in charge over there you take your orders from me of course im better for you in every way max better than lermov believe me so be sensible why wouldnt i max managed to sound indignant because you couldnt have become a millionaire without being a devious bastard play straight with me holly smiled or ill kill you in his bedroom he called malik in algiers everything set yes selim remembers you well from the old days and looks forward to meeting you the albany regency is one he uses regularly himself for overseas agents visiting him and hes booked you a suite its all on the firm and he uses an encrypted mobile himself ill give you the number he did and holley wrote it down i wont call him now but you could confirm my arrival tell him i dont want to be picked up ill get a taxi at heathrow ill let him know stay in touch and may allah protect you my brother i could be spending the rest of my life in the lubyanka or even station gorky now ive been offered a chance to earn my way out of it id say the hand of god has got something to do with that take care malik he lay back on the bed pillowed his head and stared up at the ceiling taking a very deep breath his stomach churning now it begins he said softly now it begins london it was just after twothirty the following afternoon when holleys taxi drew up outside the albany regency just off curzon street stormy weather had caused the flight from moscow to take longer than usual but he was here in mayfair and london in the rain he had changed the euros ivanov had given him for sterling paid the cabdriver generously and went up the steps to the entrance where a doorman in a top hat and green frock coat greeted him and a young uniformed porter relieved him of his suitcase he found the hotel pretty much as he had remembered it slightly oldfashioned which was its charm but maintained well and expensive enough to ensure that the clientele was respectable his reservation was waiting and all holley had to do was sign the reservation form and produce his passport for identification purposes the russians had used the same date and place of birth as on his real passport but hadnt put his mother and her address in leeds on the nextofkin page there would have been no point during one of his sessions with lermov during his second year of confinement the colonel had told him his mother had died it was a bad memory and one he preferred to forget the young porter accompanied him to the fifth floor and showed him to the suite which was pleasant and functional with a sliding window to a small balcony with a good view of curzon street and shepherds market holley tipped the boy unpacked quickly and put his things away he noticed himself in the fulllength mirror when he opened the wardrobe the black suit the striped tie and white shirt made him look exactly right banker or lawyer businessman or accountant eminently respectable there was a small refrigerator next to the television he opened it and selected a doublevodka miniature poured it into a plastic cup added a little tonic water and toasted himself in the mirror here we go off to bloody war again old lad he drank it down and went out shepherds market had always been one of his favorite places in london the narrow streets the pubs the restaurants and the shops selling everything from paintings and prints to antiques selim malik was painted in gold above the door of one such shop a narrow window on each side one offering a triangle of truly remarkable buddhas and the other an exquisite bokhara silk rug the door was shut but there was an intercom beside it and holley pressed a button confident he was on camera which proved true because before he could open his mouth a voice said in arabic praise be to allah a moment later the door opened and he was pulled inside to a tight embrace daniel it is you six years since ive seen you and you look good older selim older but you never change selim was small perhaps fivefive with long curling hair that had once been black but was now silvery gray and swept behind the ears no mustache but a fringe of beard and a dark olive face he had goodhumored eyes that lit up his personality when he was happy as he was now he wore a velvet jacket from another age a ruffled shirt and baggy velvet trousers everything is change daniel i was sixtyfive this year imagine that come into my study and have a glass of champagne with me to celebrate so youre still that kind of arab allah is merciful youve booked in at the hotel everything is taken care of i have a running account there theyre very good the study was partly rococo and partly victorian with overstuffed chairs and two enormous sofas and an axminster carpet that must have cost a fortune a large round table in beaten brass was almost at floor level and a bottle of cristal champagne in an ice bucket sat upon it with seventeenthcentury venetian goblets to drink it with sit down he urged and you do the honors ill be back he went out and daniel thumbed off the cork and poured selim returned with a black bag and a laptop which he put on the table a present for you but lets have a drink first he drank it straight down and poured another allah be praised to see you out of that terrible prison you must feel like edmond dantes escaping from the chateau dif i think he did sixteen years but i may be wrong daniel said you havent seen hamid he chuckled forgive me to you he was always malik an old habit no i havent seen him but weve spoken i can buy my freedom the russians want me to do them a big favor right here in london if i can bring it off im rid of them for good you think you can trust them not really but i must go with the flow and hope you know best dont tell me anythingi would rather not know what it is please open the bag and see if its what you wanted holley did and pulled out an ankle holster and a colt with a couple of boxes of ammunition hollowpoint selim said next was a cardboard box containing a walther ppk with a carswell silencer the new short version last of all came a nylonandtitanium bulletproof vest this is wonderful holley told him there should be a knife in there as well holley groped around and found it slim dark and deadly with a razorsharp blade leaping to attention when a button was pressed excellent thats taken care of me perfectly not quite selim leaned over and opened a zip to a side pocket of the bag he took out an envelope expense money ten fiftypound notes and another five hundred pounds in twenties there is more where that came from so ask when you need it heres a company credit card ive taped the pin number on the back learn it and destroy theres always the chance that youre going to need a credit card these days what can i say not much have you eaten no well let me buy you a late lunch round the corner at the lebanese great great cooking unless you have other plans no not for a while yet id love to have a meal with you he stowed the items back into the bag ill leave these here for the moment and get them when i come back thats fine as they went through the shop selim said whats the plan to get started at once or take your time actually im probably going to mass daniel holley said but dont ask me to explain he left the hotel in the earlyevening rain borrowing an umbrella walked to the end of curzon street hailed a black cab and told the driver to take him to kilburn darkness was falling and the traffic busy but they were there quite quickly and he asked to be dropped at kilburn high road he walked the rest of the way unfortunately according to the times inscribed on the board at the gate he was already too late for that evenings services he hesitated but a hint of light at the church windows encouraged him to go forward walking through the victoriangothic cemetery with angels and effigies of one kind or another looming out of the darkness he realized that he couldnt remember much from his first visit but then it had been so brief he turned the ring on the door and went in it was incredibly peaceful the lights very low and the church smelt of incense and candles the mary chapel to one side money had been spent here mostly during the high tide of victorian prosperity that had coincided with the churchbuilding period when the anticatholic laws changed the stainedglass windows were lovely the pews beautifully carved and the altar and choir stalls ornate flowers were stacked all around the altar steps in polished brass vases music was playing very softly and almost beyond hearing but suddenly it stopped a door creaked open and closed the noise echoing there was the sound of footfalls on tiles and caitlin daly walked in from the righthand side carrying a watering can and he recognized her instantly holley stayed back in the shadows and watched the photo hed seen of her on the internet was perfectly recognizable but didnt do her full justice the woman in the green smock and gray skirt rearranging flowers at the altar and watering them had been beautiful when he had last seen her in her midthirties at fifty she was still attractive her face enhanced by the coppercolored hair that had been cropped in a style holley remembered from an old ingrid bergman movie she finished bowed to the altar crossed herself picked up the watering can turned and detected movement in the shadows is someone there she called and her voice echoed in the empty church he hesitated then stepped forward can i help you she asked im not sure i last saw you in when i gave you the message liam coogan sends you his blessing and says hold yourself ready she stared at him for a moment obviously shocked oh dear god who are you you asked me that last time and i said just call me daniel im liams cousin you said i didnt sound irish you dont you have a tinge of yorkshire in your voice thats not surprising since i was born in leeds she shook her head i still cant believe it i phoned you at the presbytery and said i was sitting in a rear pew in the church and asked to see you i said my time was limited as i had to catch a plane to algiers she nodded yes i remember so well and the thrill of it and the disappointment oh yes but we cant talk here monsignor murphy is at a dinner tonight well use the sacristy it was warm and enclosed in there a desk and a couple of chairs a laptop religious vestments hanging from the rails registers of all kindsmarriages deathsand a church smell to everything that would never go away she leaned against the wall by the window arms folded and he sat opposite tell me about yourself she said im using an alias at the moment daniel grimshaw a sound yorkshire name that suits your voice my mother was a coogan from crossmaglen and i was a volunteer with the pira so was i and proud of it i know liam told me about your sleeper cell and how he activated you in twelve explosions that resonated in the west end of london for months her face was glowing great days they were then you went back to waiting did that bother you its what sleepers do daniel wait to strike again and hopefully for the big one back then liam asked me that if he activated you again would i be your controller and i said yes liam died of course from a heart attack but im here now she nodded gravely god rest liams soul he was a good man were your cell members disappointed not to have a role in the bombings yes but at least we had the satisfaction of seeing the british suffer such a great defeat its strange but seeing you like this brings your last visit vividly back to me we always met weekly in the chapel at hope of mary the day you gave me liams message i called a special meeting and gave them the good news and how did they take it excitement awe we knelt and recited our own special prayer together holy mary mother of god pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death we who are ourselves alone daniel said she was amazed but how do you know that i just do as i know the names of those menbarry flynn pool costello who changed to docherty cochran and murray a hell of a long time ago i wouldnt imagine theyre still round until two years ago they all attended our weekly meeting but unfortunately barry and flynn had a severe brush with the law they were both too handy with a gun finally an armed robbery they took part in went sour they would have probably gotten seven years if caught but i used a certain influence i have obtained false american passports for them and other necessary documentation and packed them off to the states and you stay in touch on a regular basis we have a hope of mary hospice and refuge in new york too they are both security men there and the remaining four we meet as weve always done united by prayer and a common commitment to the pira i was recruited at london university the others in various ways liam coogan used to arrange trips to training camps in the west of ireland the ira version of a holiday he used to say we did that many times over the years bonded you might say but really only got to do your work with that twelvebomb jolly in mayfair in was it enough it always is if your resolve is strong and you are committed but you need more than that i think some deepseated reason perhaps some great wrong that urges you on thats true take henry pool hes a selfemployed privatehire driver like you he had an english father and irish mother but her father was murdered by english black and tans in when she was only six months old and her mother fled here to kilburn it was a strong motive for him to not exactly care for the english i shouldnt imagine his mother would ever let him forget it is there something wrong with that she asked not at all for a tenyearold child to see her father gunned down by masked intruders in front of her and her mother would i imagine be a memory that would last forever her face was surprisingly calm so you know about that exactly who are you daniel this half irishman who claims to have been a member of the provisional ira you not only sound yorkshire you look like some prosperous businessman what on earth would ever have made you join so he told her all about rosaleen coogan afterwards she sat down on the other side of the desk from him her face like stone her eyes burning and it was obvious that she accepted the truth of what he had told her those foul creatures gods curse on them for what they did to that poor girl some kind of curse on me ever since daniel told her ive killed a number of times for the provos and other times for myself he stood up put his foot on the chair and hitched his trousers up revealing the ankle holster the way of the gun has become rather permanent in my life but you dont regret what you did you cant she banged on the desk with her clenched fist damn all of them and now she was really upset and daniel said take it easy its not always good for us to let the past intrude you dont understand its brought it all back to me the night the men with guns smashed their way in and murdered my father they forced themselves on my mother two of them it was only my age saved me holley aghast at the horror of it could only say im so sorry girl she took a deep shuddering breath what i need is a drink and i dont think it a sin in the circumstances to raid monsignor murphys cupboard in search of communion wine she found a bottle and two coffee cups and poured a generous measure into each she handed one to him and drank deeply herself now tell me everything properly who you are really and what youre doing here theres a man named general charles ferguson who runs a special security outfit for the prime minister his righthand man is sean dillon once a top enforcer for the pira and a good one in he was in a serb prison when ferguson turned up and made him an offer he couldnt refuse to join him or face a firing squad so dillon chose the traitors path you could put it that way she poured more wine for both of them theres no other way of putting it tell me moreeverything youre quite a man daniel she said an hour later when he was finished probably the most remarkable one ive met in my entire life so what do you think about the russians a means to an end ive nothing against them in the early years of the troubles they provided arms for the pira on more than one occasion i know that for a fact and charles ferguson and company to hell with him over the years as you tell it hes been responsible for the death of many of our comrades one way or the other major giles roper may look like a tragic and romantic hero in his wheelchair but his exploits in bomb disposal did us great harm by god but youre a hard woman caitlin as for dillon a damn traitor and ive no time for him the fact that his own father was killed by british soldiers should have been bad enough for him he did great work for the cause for years until ferguson appeared on the scene hes the worst kind of turncoat i cant see it any other way and these gangster friends of his the salters theyve done us great harm also and then we have harry miller the prince of darkness himself he appears to have made a hobby out of murdering members of the pira for years his luck is obviously good his wifes wasnt but thats the price you pay what do you think of his sister holley asked her from what you tell me she killed a provo the kind of upperclass english woman who thinks everythings a jolly jape she deserves to meet the same end as everyone else and you really mean that it was as direct a challenge as he could make she said im very oldfashioned daniel i still believe in a united ireland and the peace process hasnt given us that so to hell with it you and your problem if i can put it that way mean theres a chance to go active once more and dispose of some very bad people whove done my side nothing but harm so youre with me on this you can depend on it she said firmly and what about the others can you talk them round i dont think ill have much trouble pool has lived on his own since his mother died docherty is on his own he served time as costello so i obtained an irish passport for him as docherty hes a drunkard every so often so no woman will put up with him matthew cochran lives in one lodging home after another since his wife died of breast cancer and patrick murray is a longdistance truck driver hes never married just has one girl after the other barry and flynn ive already told you about but as theyre in new york whatever youre planning wont concern them an assorted bunch but committed daniel committed the oath our special prayer the comradeshipall these things make us what we areand going active again would only affirm it daniel said ill take your word on that he stood and took a codex and its charger out of his raincoat pocket this is an encrypted mobile ive stuck a tab on it with your number and mine memorize them and destroy call me anytime and ill be in touch with you very soon when will you speak to your people ill start phoning round tonight daniel its been marvelous to see you again she meant it her eyes shining and actually shook hands outside it was pouring so he raised his umbrella and walked down the path through the gravestones and effigies of the cemetery pausing for a moment in the roofed gateway to the street dear god he said softly am i out of my bloody mind or is she but there was no answer to that and he walked down to the main road and hailed a cab it was nine oclock and a thought struck him the salters and their pub the dark man on cable wharf this could be a good time to check it over itd be reasonably busy so he would be able to blend in with the crowd his knowledge of london learned on many visits in the old days stood him in good stead now he told the driver to drop him off in wapping high street found a lane with a sign that read cable wharf and went down there was a new development of flats on one side decaying warehouses on the other eager for the builders much of the area begging to be developed he moved out of the darkness onto cable wharf and it was interesting and attractive the other side of the thames was a panorama of streetlights the dark man to his right the sound of music drifting up beyond there was what looked like a multistory luxury apartment development the jetty of the old wharf running out into the river several boats moored there things were busy at the dark man if the car park was anything to go by and he ventured into the bar it was very crowded a pretty mixed slice of humanity all ages men and women the roar of voices coupled with taped music it was like a victorianthemed pubmirrors mahogany and porcelain beer pumps harry salter and his nephew billy were familiar to him from pictures and he saw them sitting in a corner booth seemingly oblivious to the noise holley stayed down at the end of the bar squeezed against it by those standing around and indifferent to him a handsome blond arrived on the other side of the bar and he ordered a beer and a whiskey chaser she prompted back that will put hairs on your chest he handed across a tenpound note and she tried to give him some change which he waved away the noise almost drowned her thanks and somebody called hey ruby down here there must be a better way she smiled roll on eleven oclock you could go on way after that couldnt you he said into the early hours if we want but not in this pub love when i call time out they go i need to get a life even if they dont she turned away holley drank his beer tossed down his whiskey and left he walked along the wharf and saw a shed with an old ford van outside the door on the drivers side wasnt locked so he opened it it smelt like a garage inside and there was a key in the ignition probably used as a runabout on the riverside he got out walked to the end of the wharf and stood looking at the lights for a while he turned to the pub again thinking how vulnerable it was then he went back up through the darkness and hailed a cab in the high street in his suite at the albany regency he checked the room safe in the wardrobe in which he had left the walther and silencer and all his ammunition everything was in order and he took off his jacket and tie opened his laptop and tapped in to some of his files brainstorming in a way miller and blake johnson were in new york for the putin appearance at the un that was a fact that frank barry and jack flynn were in new york too seemed fortuitous to be candid it was as if it was ordained highly trained in weaponry over the years too handy with a gun caitlin had said fleeing to america to avoid the prospect of seven years in jail for armed robbery a lot could be done with that he considered it then thought of his conversation with max chekhov about the belov operation in new york especially his head of security mikhail potanin from the sound of him hed been moscow mafia in his time which meant he was capable of most things before any final planning was possible it was necessary for caitlin daly to sound out the cell and see what they thought but the presence of barry and flynn together in new york titillated him if they took care of blake johnson and harry miller on friday he clicked on charles ferguson and saw that he was at a dinner at the garrick club that evening then he checked on monica starling and saw that she had a faculty dinner with professor george dunkley of corpus christi college that night at a country hotel called raintree house he looked it up and discovered it was six miles out of cambridge the audacity of what he was thinking appealed to him he thought some more about it then sat by the window looking out at the night and the rooftops of shepherds market and called caitlin daly on his codex she was deeply cautious waiting for something to be said its daniel caitlin she laughed relief in her voice forgive me ill need to get used to this phone you got back okay obviously you didnt tell me where youre staying a nice quiet respectable hotel near shepherds market ah mayfair i like it there ill get right to the point two of the people on our list harry miller and blake johnson will be in new york on friday and i was thinking of your people barry and flynn who you helped to get out of london when prison was in view too handy with a gun you said how do you think theyd react if you suggested they do the job on miller and johnson they could be up for it she said theyve always been hard men lucky to stay out of prison years ago the head of security at our place in new york has told me hes sure that on the side theyre hoodlums for hire and how do you feel about that i speak to them most weeks their membership in the cell still means a great deal to them id be willing to put it to them i know its too late for you to speak to the other four tonight but its only six in the evening in new york im not trying to put any pressure on you but time is of the essence could you speak to them tonight no point in me calling im nothing to them i was always the leader daniel guiding them as i saw fit as far as im concerned though the show of hands has to be one hundred percent and nothing less i have only four to stand in front of now and if we are to agree to your plan of campaign against ferguson and his people it is logical that i should speak to barry and flynn but i must make one thing clear if we agree and they dont all bets are off yes i can see that i can also see that im in your hands on this by the way i havent asked about your weapons status we were well supplied with small arms explosives bombmaking parts it was a while ago of course but it should all still be under lock and key in a large cupboard in the presbytery wine cellar im going to go now daniel think out my approach and speak to barry and flynn if im lucky i might even find them together you must be tired you were after all in moscow this morning ill speak to you tomorrow and she was right suddenly he felt bushed he poured a whiskey for a nightcap drank it while peering out of the window so far so good but tomorrow was another day and he went to bed the following day chekhov phoned him just after breakfast daniel my friend how goes it it goes very well where are you in my apartment infinitely preferable to moscow ill tell you to look out of my window at hyde park warms my heart i love this city did lermov say goodbye nicely frankly i think hes more interested in his trip to new york than in your enterprise at the moment i believe he takes it as a sign of great favor from the prime minister you surprise me i would have imagined him above that sort of thing im a true cynic in such matters people like lermov men of huge brain and much learning often express contempt for the graceandfavor aspect of success until its offered to them i suppose he would love to be a general if you see my point of course what would really seal it for him would be your success with the business at hand can you tell me whats happening holley had no reason not to i went to church in a manner of speaking and saw the lady in question she embraces the idea of activating her cell listened to what i told her of ferguson and company and damned them all she cant stop hating the british max her father was killed in front of her when she was ten her mother raped it sounds like something out of a bosnian nightmare chekhov said what do the members of the cell say im waiting to hear the only problem is that two of them had to clear off to new york with the law breathing down their necks so what are you going to do well everything obviously depends upon what her people decide but if its favorable i think im going to need your help in what way chekhov asked holley explained about barry and flynn and when he was finished chekhov said where would i come in the way i see it one of them will hit blake johnson in quogue and the other take miller in new york this guy you employ at belov potanin i think his name was mikhail potanin what about him the impression you gave me was that he was capable of anything id like him to monitor barry and flynn dont even try to say no max i know the way you oligarchs rose to power and it was on the backs of a lot of men like potanin so whos arguing lets see first if barry and flynn agree and if so ill put it in potanins lap ill be in touch the moment i hear is ivanov in making himself at home hell have all week to make his move until lermov gets in at the weekend hes too eager that boy half an hour later caitlin called how are you she asked did you have a good night more to the point did you daniel they went for it hook line and sinker flynn lives in greenwich village but barry has a staff flat at the refuge i called him first and flynn was with him barry put the telephone on speaker and i was able to discuss it with both of them they admitted to having done contract work in the past theres an old yorkshire saying i dont mind a thief as long as hes an honest thief from the sound of them theyll do for me the refuge where barry has staff quarters i take it they have computer facilities of course look up harry miller online and youll find a photo of him walking along a london street send barry a copy while i have you you can give me their addresses and mobile numbers is that necessary i cant do everything through you caitlin itll just be too cumbersome and ineffective besides ive just arranged for someone to monitor them and see to their general welfare hell make sure theyre all right she did as he asked and he wrote the information down when is your meeting six tonight do you want me there not really daniel ive been their leader for so long and the cell is a tight unit psychologically i think it would be better if you told me what you wanted them to do and ill pass it on fine ill allocate the tasks and get a taxi up to the church later this afternoon to give them to you that means if they do say yes you can tell them whats expected of them if they say no then simply put the stuff in your office shredder ill phone you when im on the way daniel are you sure time is going to be very tight friday will be a big day and night both here and in new york if youre going to get anywhere with them remind them of their years of serving the cause appeal to their patriotism ferguson and his people are the enemy youve got to sell it i will daniel as he sat going over a mental progress report he realized the one issue he hadnt done anything about was the kurbsky mystery he looked at his watch he had time for just a quick look he left the hotel quickly hailed the first cab he saw and told the driver to take him to belsize park he soon found chamber court the residence of kurbskys aunt svetlana it was a substantial detached property early victorian from the look of it there was a front gate and a side gate each with an intercom but you couldnt see through the gates and the walls were high and it looked like an electronic security system ran along the top he kept on walking at a steady pace aware that he was very probably on camera and then a strange thing happened the side gate opened and a man in overalls emerged he was completely bald his cheeks hollow the eyes sunken and staring obviously someone on chemotherapy it seemed cruel to think it but he looked like a walking ghoul the poor sod holley thought as alexander kurbsky ignored him and went into the corner shop on the other side of the road holley kept going and found abbey road increasing his pace and turning up his collar as it started to rain lightly according to the files kurbskys aunt lived in the house with her companion katya zorin british born but of russian extraction when the original plan had been put in place kurbsky had told luzhkov that his aunt was to be left alone that he would not visit her because he didnt want her in any way to be involved with the plot that had brought her nephew to london in all the material holley had studied there had been no indication that anyone connected with the gru had made any attempt to check the situation could chamber court have been housing kurbsky all along perhaps under fergusons protection it was an intriguing thought just as intriguing as the poor wretch he had just seen possibly an oddjob man of some sort he continued along abbey road caught a cab at swiss cottage and told the driver to take him to the albany regency there was work to be done he sat drawing up the specific plans of action for caitlin daly the number one target was ferguson he had that dinner at the garrick club and henry pool was the obvious choice there pool had been in the privatehire business for several years and his luxury amara limousine was already preapproved by the ministry it was up to him to discover a way of being fergusons driver on friday night one of the small explosive devices caitlin had hidden in the wine cellar would suffice to do the job aided by an electronic remote control or possibly a pencil timer miller and johnson in new york were down to barry and flynn the saltershe was helped there by the fact that unusually for such a successful pub it closed at eleven oclock and its comparative isolation would mean it would take time for emergency services to get there an arson attack after midnight he wrote down the name john docherty and suggested he proceed on foot so that the noise of a vehicle at that time in the early hours would not be noticed in the pub he mentioned that an old ford van parked outside the shed had a key in the ignition monica starling she would leave corpus christi college at seven oclock and drive six miles to the raintree house a photo from holleys laptop was printed and he assigned the task to patrick murray the longdistance truck driver it shouldnt be hard to run monica starlings vehicle off a country road finally alexander kurbsky something was not right about chamber court he felt it instinctively and the strange inhuman being hed seen coming out of the side gate didnt seem right either so that task he suggested for matthew cochran cochran would have to get over that wall to discover if it was tenanted only by the two women or not he produced each task on a separate sheet and put them together in an envelope with no address on it as a precaution and his mobile sounded he answered its me ivanov im calling from the embassy whats happening ive been busy thats whats happening i really havent got time to talk now dont give me that im in charge of you until colonel lermov gets here on saturday ive spoken to chekhov he tells me youve contacted the daly woman and shes interested but whats all this about new york holley was angry and bitterly regretted having been so open with chekhov none of your business sunshine dont interfere if you screw things up ill kill you i swear it you wouldnt dare try me now be a good boy you know the rules we never meet im in charge and i keep you informed on the telephone fuck you you bastard why peter i didnt know you cared holley switched off he might have known that was the trouble with the military always wanting to show what big stuff they were always stealing the good work some junior officer had produced and passing it off as their own he pulled on his raincoat stuffed the large envelope in a plastic bag and went out in search of a cab it was late afternoon now shadows drawing in and close to five he was just in time it would give her a chance to look at his plans he called her from the high street in kilburn im here you dont need to spend time with me ill just pass you the envelope wait for me in the church ill walk from the presbytery and come in through the back door he did as he was told pushed the great front entrance open and ventured in there were five or six people over on the right waiting by the confessional boxes he stood at the back and she appeared outside the sacristy and waved and he went to join her she pulled him in took the envelope and opened it ill give it a quick read she finished the sheets in five minutes and put them back in the envelope it all seems to make sense im sure pool can sort something out with the car he once told me hes very well in with the ministry its a starting point anyway good what about roper and dillon i dont see them here we havent got enough manpower at the moment but we can take them soon for roper i thought wed blow up the holland park safe house the man in the wheelchair never seems to leave it these days and dillon ill shoot him hes a loner which simplifies things someone alone in the street on a rainy night someone behind he smiled and she took a step back someone walked over my grave when you said that not you caitlin not for years call me when youre ready he went out and straight up the aisle opened the door wide and started down the path peter ivanov dressed in a trench coat and trilby stepped out of a monumental archway and faced him holley stood there looking at him so you knew about the church and where it was even when we were in moscow youre not supposed to interfere ivanov youll ruin everything come with me ivanov told him were going to have a little discussion i wouldnt argue with sergeant kerimov here he doesnt like it and hes bigger than you holley walked towards the car where kerimov large and lumpen stood on the other side waiting to get behind the wheel he looked formidable come on get in ivanov opened the front passenger door ill sit behind you kerimov was smiling when he eased behind the wheel holley leaned down as if to sit on the passenger seat pulled the colt from his ankle holster and shot kerimov through the back of the left hand he cried out tried reaching for his gun with his right hand and holley rapped him across the head kerimov slumped across the wheel oh dear youll have to get him in the backseat and drive him somewhere better not make it an emergency room they call the police to a gunshot wound of course theres always the medical facility at the embassy holley said god damn you ivanov told him next time ill kill you remember that especially if i find youve come back here and interfered with caitlin daly he walked briskly away and left them to it on the way back he reviewed the situation he wasnt bothered in the slightest by what he had just done ivanov could hardly call in the law all he could do was haul the wretched kerimov back to the embassys sick bay lermov would have to hear about what had happened of course but it was obvious that ivanov had broken the rules theyd all agreed on what would lermov make of that not very much holley concluded hed probably tell ivanov to stop being an ass holley had made his point drawn a line in the sand and that was that he got out at the hotel but didnt go in there wasnt much he could do right now waiting on news of the meeting and which way things would swing he also needed to give chekhov the addresses and phone numbers of barry and flynn so chekhov could speak to potanin and get things up and running but there was the same problem there frustrated he went along to shepherds market to visit selim sitting in the study darkness falling outside a gas fire burning in the victorian fireplace holley fidgeted while waiting for the call selim had once again provided champagne but holleys was untouched you really should drink up daniel said selim itll help you relax whats wrong can you tell me not in any detail said holley its just im on the verge of satisfactory resolution to my job here but but someone is interfering how do you know holley asked because you always do things on your own you hate any interference and i can just bet that whoever youre doing this job for doesnt see it the same way we agreed that we should never meet that we should only make contact by encrypted mobile and just now i had some eager young bastard together with a sergeant the size of a brick wall try to put me in a car in kilburn ah a sergeant the militarys involved then men in uniform they need to take charge give orders well not to me holley took the glass and drank it down in one gulp so what did you do holley reached to the ankle holster and took out the colt and laid it on the brass table shot the sergeant in the back of the hand as he gripped the wheel and left his captain to struggle back to the embassy with him wonderful selim smiled thats the best thing ive heard in years youre a lone wolf daniel the most dangerous beast in the forest holleys mobile sounded it was caitlin can we talk holley glanced at selim who pointed to the kitchen picked up the bottle of champagne and went out im with a friend but you can speak now how did it go they went for it completely and listen to this weve already had a stroke of luck it seems that fergusons usual car was damaged in a minor accident last week so its away for repair henry pool said its common knowledge amongst the other drivers because ferguson was very angry so he thinks he can be the replacement car absolutely certain pool says if he asks for it hell get it the dispatcher is an old pal of his hes not concerned about the hazard he said its common to leave passengers in the limousine to run errands for them get a newspaper or cigarettes or sometimes a bottle hell nip out set off the bomb and no one will be the wiser and the others are just as enthusiastic yes docherty is quite happy about handling the dark man situation he lived in wapping years ago and knows his way round down there and murray no problem hes going to put a suit and tie on drive up to cambridge in the morning with the photo find where monica starling lives and put a face to the name and cochran he said that he seemed to have less to do than anyone if i cant find a way to break into a house inhabited by two spinster ladies he said i should be ashamed of myself excellent call barry and flynn too tell them the good news and give them the following name mikhail potanin have you got that ive written it down he is a very experienced guy in this kind of business and hell be in touch with them they have nothing to fear hell help in any way he can this friday in new york is definitely on yes ive got all that get on to them right now and thanks caitlin he called chekhov next it sounded like there was a party going on in the park lane apartment music female laughter its me holley told him whats going on over there daniel old son just a few friends are you drunk never that daniel you insult me as a russian we need to talk and we shall ill go into my study close the door and silence the chattering of fools there was a movement a certain banging and the noise died how can i help everythings dropped into place caitlin and her cell will swing into action here on friday as we speak shes confirming with barry and flynn that its on for friday ill give you their phone numbers chekhov said if i press a button im recording this so just tell me holley did im dropping this in potanins lap to watch over them make sure theyre up to itand if necessary clean up any messes dont worry daniel hes done this kind of thing many times before chekhov said i gathered that but make sure he realizes its serious business i hear you had ivanov on your case he gave me a call i asked him if hed spoken to you and he said not yet i get the impression he doesnt exactly trust you and i dont trust him he called me demanding that i fill him in on everything i gave him short shrift i had a package to deliver to caitlin daly and dont tell me he followed you he didnt need to he just popped up but he wasnt supposed to approach her or me in any waythat was the plan he turned up in the graveyard at the church with some thug called kerimov in tow tried to force me into his car oh dear tell me what happened i shot him in the hand not ivanov the large peasant i left them there to sort it out went along to the main road and hailed a cab if you were here i would embrace you my friend max told him thats the most entertaining thing ive heard in years glad to oblige call potanin now and tell him to get things moving in new york im relying on you the instant we hang up what about kurbsky ive got one of caitlin dalys people investigating the house in belsize ive been to have a look theres something strange there but im not sure what holley told him surely kurbsky couldnt have been hanging out there its too obvious i saw a weird guy coming out a ghoul god help him obviously on chemotherapy that couldnt be kurbsky he certainly doesnt have cancer im not saying it was him i just have a hunch about the place that somethings not quite kosher anyway lets get moving let me know how things go but chekhov did not immediately call potanin he stood there thinking about it then he sighed deeply murmured i suppose id better and called his contact number for lermov in moscow the colonel answered at once i wondered when i might hear from you hows holley getting on quite brilliantly chekhov told him ive got to say josef hes a remarkable man heres the state of play at the moment he quickly went through everything holley had told him and when he was finished lermov said he certainly works fast so i should go through with it call potanin in new york and tell him to give barry and flynn any help they need of course you should go through with it this could be an extraordinary coup let me know everythingeverythingas it happens even when im with putin i will of course chekhov told him what do you think of this unfortunate business with ivanov i dont know what you mean chekhov told him delighting in it because he resented ivanovs assumption of command and had come to realize that he didnt like him anyway lermov said stupid boy i had high hopes of him but there you are ill make my displeasure clear when he tells me if he tells you chekhov said oh hell tell me all right max ill see to it at shepherds market the awnings out against light rain daniel and selim enjoyed a late supper at a restaurant called al bustan it was crowded a constant buzz of conversation washing over them but they had a certain privacy in the corner booth where they were sitting food is poetry to the people who run this restaurant selim told him and sipped his wine you are calmer now i think because things are coming together daniel said but youre right about the food though anything would taste good after five years of the cooking in the lubyanka its nice here he looked around the restaurant it reminds me of algiers and that made him think of shabwa and the desert training camp and all that came since and his mood darkened what is it my friend holley told him nothing was ever the same when theyd finished with me algiers and malik and the business became all i had and now you think you have nothing in a way ive been more disappointed than id hoped we are all in the hands of allah he is responsible for all things then he willed me to exact a terrible vengeance on those four men who murdered that young woman that deed changed me entirely a different man took my place and still does this is too sad daniel we must think of something better have you some time to spare tomorrow or are you trapped by your affairs i have a small car in a garage i rent not far from here a mini cooper we could go out for a drive have lunch holley thought about it it wasnt a good idea but really everything was in motion new york was in play the others had their orders any remaining communication would be by phone anyway all right lets do it daniel said and im remembering something about chekhov he has a country place called bolt hole located in an interesting part of west sussex salt marshes lots of sea a causeway reaching out to a low island with an ancient house ive seen it on television it sounds fun does he go there a lot i dont think so he told me he was refused permission for a helicopter pad so he has to drive so what we could get to west sussex in two hours i have friends nearby selim shook his head these oligarchs they are worse than suleiman the magnificent shall we take that as definite absolutely holley told him well leave at ten then i suggest an early night selim raised his hand and called to the waiter for the bill holley undressed and put on a robe and caitlin came on the codex ive heard from barry and hes heard from potanin he said hes going to meet them tomorrow with a friend of his named bulganin he suggested barry take miller and flynn do blake johnson fine quogue should be pretty straightforward but miller is more difficult holley said barry shouldnt underestimate him millers a killer god willing he prevails she said or allah he told her same difference he poured a nightcap and went and stood at the window watching the latenight traffic pass max chekhov hadnt got back to him but hed clearly kept his promise and passed the details to potanin chekhov probably had a woman or two keeping him busy not that it mattered hed done his job he wondered how ivanov was managing to explain his sergeants unfortunate accident hed bet anything ivanov found a way to absolve himself of any blame he looked at his watch he probably should call lermov himself but it was too late now three in the morning in moscow it could wait and he went to bed for many years holley had had a recurring dream about rosaleen coogan and the events of that night it lasted for a period of three or four weeks usually during times of great stress and activity it had not been much of a problem during his years of imprisonment but now and for the first time in a while it surfaced it was always the same a strange blackandwhite landscape remarkably similar to film noir buildings rising into the night streets and she was there at his side the only other person in a dark world and she said she was going and would be back but never did never came back again and the streets were like a maze in the darkness as he ran from one place to another and never could find her the strangest thing of all was trying to wake from that dream it took an incredible physical struggle and he would lie there in bed soaked in sweat and trembling and feeling a heartbreaking sense of loss for rosaleen and the fact that she was gone never to be found this time lying on the bed of his suite in the albany regency hotel it was different somehow lady monica starling had become part of that dream she was there with rosaleen and it was them both that daniel was running around seeking and he suddenly knew beyond any shadow of a doubt that no matter what anyone said or wished or argued that shed killed a provo herself there was no way he could be a party to killing her and rosaleen would have agreed with him it somehow gave him a lightness of being a calm happiness call it what you like but it was there for a moment clear and profound as if he had been touched by something he felt a strange sense of peace a kind of release as he went to turn on the shower he could take the men but not monica and caitlin and all the rest of them would have to accept that he started to get dressed but then stopped and decided it was better to be dressed for action you never knew what might come up he put on the nylonandtitanium bulletproof vest first which was capable of stopping a round at pointblank range a white shirt and formal tie covered it and once hed pulled on his trousers he fastened the holster to his right ankle when he left the hotel borrowing one of its umbrellas in his black suit and black raincoat he looked like a thoroughly respectable city professional man it had rained during the night but stopped by the time holley went around to selims where he found a simple breakfast of croissants coffee and ripe bananas waiting selim wore a french beret and a black duster coat as they made their way through several backstreets and came to a mews named friars yard he produced a key and opened the end garage revealing a black mini cooper a factory limited edition small but deadly i indulged myself it will do in excess of a hundred and twentyfive miles an hour and have you that daniel is my dark secret would you care to drive its been rather a long time since i did but daniel grimshaw does have a perfectly valid forged license then put your umbrella in the back with the other one already in there you think it will rain again absolutely this is england daniel off we go and if you decide to have a crash do it with style with the driving it was as if hed never been away for the mini cooper handled superbly and they had a good fast run from london to guildford and all the way to chichester where they had a pit stop at the ship hotel and more coffee after that they followed the minis sat nav through a maze of country roads and came to patch end and holley pulled up at the side of the road there was a salt marsh an inlet with four houses three oldfashioned fishing boats beached on the shingle and a small motorboat selim opened the glove compartment and took out a pair of zeiss binoculars he peered down theres a woman in the garden of the end house hanging out laundry do you want to take a look holley did and nodded i know chekhov owns a house down there and i bet thats a lady named lily white her son jacob keeps an eye on things for chekhov while hes away it wouldnt have much traffic down there well go and see what bolt hole has to offer a mile farther on they discovered a pub set back from the road with a sizable garden the main part of it was undeniably old but there was a modern extension that suggested a motel it looked anything but prosperous and it was just at that moment that the weather broke again rather sad when you think of it selim said imagine staying at that place in the rain well chekhov fell in love with bolt hole told me so himself holley said so lets go and see why there were no cliffs but a headland of sorts with a fringe of trees on top a small car park behind and the marsh below with the causeway running out to the island it was beautiful beyond doubt the old house the sea and every so often a strange geyser of foam erupting so thats where the name bolt hole comes from holley said raising the binoculars spectacular very impressive selim said and so is the motor yacht at the jetty on the seaside its called the mermaid holley focused the binoculars in time to see a thickset roughlooking man wearing a battered naval cap and an old reefer coat emerge from the wheelhouse jacob white in the flesh holley said talking to someone on his mobile theres a mercedes coming in from the left down there holley swung around to observe and received a shock for the mercedes turned along the causeway pulled in on the jetty beside the mermaid and stopped at the gangway where jacob white stood waiting ivanov got out from behind the wheel and chekhov emerged from the passenger side id like to say i cant believe it holley said but i do let me fill you in on these two he explained and selim said well you could say the plot thickens but lets move we may be noticed they werent supposed to go even near each other the only communication was supposed to be by codex so what are they up to ivanovs your biggest problem the young military action dog who wants to be in charge and chekhov my dear daniel you took me into your confidence last night you gave me no specifics but forgive a man used to subterfuge when he guesses that this all has to do with the russians and by the russians i assume it leads to putin the man himself max chekhov is an oligarch and theyve fallen increasingly on hard times in the financial mess of the world of today and they need to look to the kremlin for support chekhov has more to contend with than most since he was chosen to head belov international when the state took it over again in other words hes a putin man holley nodded lermov told me that putin told him chekhov was the only oligarch he had any time for and that was only because he had him in his pocket so what would you like to do now selim asked but didnt get an answer a harsh voice called hold on you two what are you doing sniffing round here i saw you looking down at the boat and you had binoculars i think youre mistaken holley called and hissed at selim keep going lets get out of here behind him jacob white increased his pace reached out grabbed holley and swung him around selim also turned and saw chekhov and ivanov toiling up the path behind my god its you ivanov called hold him jacob holley on the half turn as jacob swung him around delivered a reverse elbow stroke into the mouth and as jacob doubled over raised a knee in his face that lifted him backwards the result was quite devastating chekhov and ivanov paused chekhov looking shocked daniel he said whats going on i might ask you the same thing holley answered and ivanov pulled a makarov out of his trench coat pocket my turn you bastard he said and shot him it was like a tremendous punch in the chest delivered by a sixteenstone heavyweight fighter and holley staggered lost his balance and fell on his back from the first impact he had taken one deep breath after another for sometimes the force of a blow into body armor could induce unconsciousness all those years ago in the camp hed been trained to handle such a situation he closed his eyes heard chekhov say youve killed him you fool youve ruined everything the bastard deserved killing ivanov dropped to one knee i think ill give him one in the forehead just to make sure holley drew out the colt opened his eyes reached up and shot off half of ivanovs left ear ivanov screamed dropped the makarov and got to his feet clutching the wound blood streaming through his fingers holley got up aware of the pain in his chest and still breathing deeply i dont know whats been going on max between you and the boy wonder here it wasnt supposed to be like this ive organized everything for friday completed my side of the bargain but what have you and this piece of dung been up to thats the question i dont think lermov will be pleased and god help you with putin if he found that everything had been turned into a cockup because you and ivanov had a different agenda chekhov was horrified i didnt intend anything like this daniel believe me what am i going to do there must be a firstaid kit on the mermaid strap him up put him in the backseat and get back to the embassy in london next time i really will kill him he nodded at jacob white who had managed to get to his feet maybe the last of the apemen can give you a helping hand i dont think he can even help himself chekhov said and walked a few yards after them as they went to where the mini cooper was parked he took out his diary and its pencil selim saw what he was doing ah you are noting the number hoping to trace me it is algerian my friend quite untraceable holley turned grow up max or do you want a bullet yourself just piss off and tell anyone who needs to know that everything is organized or as i suspect caitlin daly would say on friday well astonish the world selim got behind the wheel get in and ill show you what a great driver i am what would you like to do holley unbuttoned his shirt found the makarov round sticking in his bulletproof vest and pulled it out a welldressed man shouldnt be without one as to what id like to do that place the ship hotel in chichester where we stopped for coffee had a decentlooking restaurant id say we could get there in half an hour sorry you wont be able to join me in the bottle of champagne im going to order then youll have to drink it all yourself dear boy selim malik told him and they drove away the lunch was all that could be expected and holley drank far too much champagne as he admitted but the real discovery was selims driving skill he was firstrate on the way back to london holley half asleep in his seat said ive got to give it to you selim you handle this thing like a racing driver always my dream selim told him many years ago when i was at oxford university a policeman who pulled me up for speeding said who do you think you are stirling moss and you were flattered who wouldnt be britains alltime favorite star of the racetrack and a true gentleman now of course i am getting too old holley was aware of nothing more after that because he fell asleep he woke with a start to selims touch on his shoulder they were outside the hotel here we are what now have a shower sort myself out check the bruising holley managed a laugh so you have nothing particularly important to do everythings sorted selim as i told chekhov its all in order friday everything comes together and we solve the problem for mister big at the kremlin ive one call to make on my codex and then im going to turn it off so nobody can get me for the rest of the night i have a suggestion the curzon cinema in shepherds market shows many interesting films tonight they show a french film directed by jeanpierre melville in bob le flambeur its a wonderful heist moviean aging gangster is tempted back into one last fatal throw of the dice that sounds like just my kind of movie holley said i cant wait well have dinner afterwards ill see you in an hour when he called caitlin daly he got an instant response where are you he asked at my office paperwork for the charity and ive got a forum to attend with monsignor murphy dont you find it difficult to fit everything in of course but its important the work we do and hes used to leaning on me in many ways hes an important figure in the catholic church in london even the rich respond to him and their money is important to us when i read all the files on your people it fascinated me that the whole hope of mary thing came out of murphy doing a visit to derry for a few months during the worst of the troubles and being impressed by the work the little sisters of pity were doing i never got any idea he was in favor of a violent solution to the troubles he isnt to believe in sinn fein and a united ireland was always as natural as breathing for him and im not saying he wouldnt confess an ira man when the church said he shouldntbut not an ounce more than that hes a great and good man and a bit of a holy fool i wonder what hed say about your involvement in the glorious cause youre sure he hasnt got an inkling absolutely not hed be horrified stop this daniel i dont want to hear any more on the subject have you had any final news from barry and flynn not yet but its only noon over there flynn and bulganin were supposed to go down to this quogue place youre right tomorrow will be soon enough youll be having a meeting in the chapel at the refuge i suppose youre not going to suggest joining us theres no need everythings worked out youve done very well im going out to a show so ill turn off my mobile ill talk to you tomorrow he got dressed thinking about it she obviously wanted to be in charge a psychological hangup that because of being leader of the cell for so many years and that was fine though he didnt know how shed react to his insistence that monica starling be taken out of the equation he realized that itd be better if he told her about it facetoface but he would leave that until tomorrow night his phone sounded just before he was leaving it was chekhov daniel youve got to understand the pressures im under ivanov is a madman i knew he was too good to be true the first time i met him how is the bastard never mind that he shot you in the chest how did you survive that i was wearing a bulletproof vest under my shirt you really should consider it for yourself max my god im going to get one straightaway but about ivanov i patched him up on the boat and drove him back to the embassy as you suggested they had some top surgeon in to stitch him up but hes going to look very strange what were you doing there in the first place he was very insistent that i should take him down there and show it to him he said that perhaps it could be useful sometime in what way he didnt say i thought he might want it for weekends you know boyfriends and so on i didnt realize his inclinations ran that way mind you thats his business to each his own im going out so you neednt try again if you want to cover your back phone lermov and tell him what happened actually i already have youre a laugh a minute max holley switched off and left bob le flambeur was sensationally good and lifted his spirits in spite of the downbeat ending marvelous he told selim as they sat in the booth at al busten they dont make them like that anymore i didnt get a chance to tell you by the way chekhov called me what happened holley told him a pity the sod didnt die in the back of the mercedes you have a point with such a man one wonders what he could try next your big day whatever it is is friday i presume that after that your problems will be over it would be a clean break lets put it that way so what of tomorrow i havent the slightest idea i have one important phone call to make in the morning the rest is just time filling then may i suggest an excellent way to spend the whole day twenty miles out of town is a spa and country club of which i happen to be a member an excellent gymnasium two swimming pools more health treatments than you would know what to do with there is even a golf course i dont play golf you can drive round in a cart with some clubs and try you know something youre absolutely right holley told him and emptied the champagne bottle into their glasses and toasted him and if its anything like its been itll be a nice day out in the rain which it certainly was but the day was saved by selim planning ahead and speaking in the intimate way one would to an old friend to someone called martha who was it seemed director of activities the result was that when they arrived at tenthirty and ran from the mini cooper through pouring rain to the front entrance they were met by an attractive fortyish blonde in white slacks and a blue blazer who had a full program organized for them club tracksuits were supplied selim went off for a massage holley elected to try the gym where a muscular young man named harry put him through a series of weighttraining classes and noting his age from the form hed filled in observed that he was in remarkable condition and obviously worked out holley didnt tell him he had until recently been a regular user of the gym facility at the lubyanka prison in any case when he stripped off his vest revealing the terrible bruise ivanovs bullet had made his explanationthat hed slipped against the end of a steel bar at a london gymwas received with horror at the lack of professionalism that had allowed such a thing to happen he worked his way through a series of weightlifting exercises and cycles and finally ended up in a sauna for half an hour then another half hour swimming and decided hed had enough he asked for a fresh tracksuit went to the lounge bar ordered a large scotch and went and lay on a recliner from which he could look out at the golf course stretching away into an infinity of rain and mist he had his codex in a pocket of the tracksuit and when it sounded he got it out quickly it was caitlin daly where are you somewhere in kent what have you got for me the word from barry is excellent he tells me that potanin and the other man bulganin are firstrate bulganin and flynn went to quogue and sniffed round there arent too many people there this time of year and with the weather and they located the boat and the miller hit barry said potanins provided him with a silenced pistol with hollowpoint cartridges he said potanin instructed him to wait identify his target then shoot him up close preferably in a crowd situation and just keep on walking nobody sees a thing wasnt that the way mick collins and his boys operated in dublin in the old days for the first time it occurred to holley that she might be a raving lunatic well i suppose there is a certain truth to that but lets hope for barrys sake something else turns up youre seeing the cell again tonight yes everyones ready for action its all systems go theres just one change holley said and when selim appeared in a robe a towel around his neck he put a finger to his lips and motioned him to sit what would that be the woman monica starling ive decided against it you can tell murray his target is aborted her response was immediate you cant do that it was agreed ive changed my mind im not going to be responsible for the killing of a woman and if youve a brain in you at all youll know why thats an end of it my decision you cant do that im cell leader and im the commander of the whole bloody plot holley told her without me and the russians you wouldnt have an operation now youve still got one but without the killing of the woman her reluctance was plain in her voice if thats the way it has to be dont mess with me on this girl his voice was hard i hold the cards here i can have word sent to potanin that its all off even order him to dispose of barry and flynn she was obviously shaken no dont do that ill call round tonight after your six oclock meeting and confirm this with you facetoface ill be waiting in the back pew all right i understand he switched off his codex and turned to selim who was looking grave not good i fear whatever it is who is this woman have i met her no and you wouldnt want to a deeply disturbed individual but arent we all now how about some lunch after all my exertions im absolutely starving after lunch selim disappeared to indulge in a final massage of some description and an appointment in the hairdressing salon holley felt that enough was enough although there was no doubt that he felt a lot better than when hed arrived he was sitting in the lounge bar thinking about what had happened with caitlin daly when martha appeared to inform him that the clothes hed been wearing when hed arrived had all been valeted and were waiting for him in the allotted cubicle he found perfection even his tie had been pressed the shoes shined he returned to the bar lounge to find selim still in a robe but with his hair trimmed and looking suspiciously black youve had a dye job holley said and you my friend look like a whiskey advert for a man of fortynine you look remarkably fit daniel its not fair not much in life is holley told him lets have a coffee then you go and change and i suggest we make tracks selim waved to the barman as holleys codex sounded lermov said there you are daniel time we talked i think where are you moscow but soon to leave for the prime ministers plane well thats nice for you so close to the seat of power but remember icarus his wings melted and fell off when he flew too close to the sun ah you obviously enjoyed the benefits of a classical education of a grammar school education josef in my case the leeds variety what do you want daniel you mustnt go round shooting people it wont do so you heard about that from your pet poodle chekhov i suppose yes and i know about the incident when ivanov turned up at the church and tried to force you into the car he was wrong glad you agree but about yesterdays incident i would point out he shot me first im only speaking to you now thanks to the genius of the wilkinson sword company which made my bulletproof vest i accept all that but youve certainly had your revenge half an ear gone well lets say hes made his mark in the world i should imagine hell look satisfactorily grotesque youre a hard man daniel even harder than id imagined what you see is not what you get with me josef you should have realized that just as you should have realized what peter ivanov is really like under that pretty uniform hes broken your specific orders in this matter we were to be voices on the codex thats all he violated that by showing up at the church and yet again by making chekhov take him to bolt hole what was that all about i could ask the same of you who was your mysterious companion of the arabic persuasion you knew id need the services of a banker and weapons supplier and that was he i was interested after my discussions with chekhov about bolt hole it occurred to me that it might offer some sort of temporary sanctuary he keeps a substantial motor yacht there in such a vessel france would be only a short run across the english channel in time of need if you follow me after all who knows how this thing will end i see your point so you and your friend were simply assessing the situation and completely astonished when chekhov and ivanov appeared the rest as they say in a mystery novel you know so to come to whats important everything is set for tomorrow absolutely you can tell the prime minister if you like i dont think so im a cautious man i like to be sure id rather wait until its actually happened and then surprise him of course josef but do tell ivanov to do as hes told i already have i dont suppose theres anything else you need not that i can think of safe flight enjoy new york i trust it will be a memorable visit for you in more ways than one lermov told him selim had waved the waiter away and sat there throughout the entire conversation now he beckoned the barman back and repeated the order did you get all that holley asked a trifle onesided but what you were saying was interesting i presume that the person you were talking to is ivanovs superior very much and just appointed head of station for the gru in london colonel josef lermov to be precise they lost his predecessor in the thames lermov pulled me out of the lubyanka to try and find a solution to the problem putin had dropped into his lap youll be thrilled to know hes about to leave moscow as part of putins entourage flying with the great man to new york where he will speak at the united nations tomorrow night daniel i have got beyond being astounded at anything in this business selim waved the barman away after he placed the tray on the table i suggest we have our coffee and then go back to london where i presume the final episode will take place not long now i suppose thats one good thing the suspense is killing me what next im expected in kilburn at round seven oclock by the lady i was talking to before this is important very much so and also unpleasant but it has to be done you know the time i have spent with you has been like a movie selim said your story all the things happening to you i see only through your eyes and what you choose to tell me but its always only part of the story i dont see what the others in your life do except in that singular episode involving chekhov and ivanov its as if you were living life in a film noir seen only from your point of view inhabited by cinema ghosts and you are one of them the entire story told in one hour and forty minutes holley said just like bob le flambeur and look what happened to him selim replied and he got up and went off to get dressed selim dropped holley off at the hotel youre sure you dont want to borrow the car no ill be fine with a cab as usual i dont know what it is you have to do but i trust it will go well if youre free later come and see me the big day tomorrow may make you restless tonight i know holley grinned the suspense is killing me now selim drove away and holley discovering it was only fourthirty borrowed an umbrella from the doorman and went around mayfair for forty minutes rainwalking in a private and enclosed world under the umbrella but all he was doing was putting off the bad moment he knew that and he returned to the hotel and went up to his suite he half undressed taking off his shirt so that he could put on his bulletproof vest again he strapped on the ankle holster decided against the walther ppk for now but slipped the flickknife into his left trouser pocket so he was prepared for it had to be done though he was not looking forward to it he told the cabdriver to drop him at kilburn high road and walked through to the park passing hope of mary hospice and refuge at half past six he stood there umbrella raised against the interminable rain then walked back to the church through the darkness left his umbrella in a corner of the porch and went in he stood in the gloom at first by the door where religious pamphlets of one kind or another were displayed there was a selection of prayer cards of various kinds all at a price to help church funding and there it was that special we who are ourselves alone card he helped himself meticulously dropping a couple of pound coins into the box provided he went and sat on the end of the rear pew and waited it was very quiet the church smell the guttering candles but there was no one by the confessional boxes and the lights had been turned off probably to save on the electricity bill there was a gloomy medieval atmosphere about the place that some might have found menacing and in the darkness things creaked a door banged from the direction of the sacristy and she appeared by the altar and walked towards him an old khaki trench coat over her shoulders her steps echoed hollowly he stood to greet her so there you are caitlin youve done what i asked she stared at him proud and bitter if its what you want then let it be so ill not pretend to like it that she shot dead one of our own while working with ferguson is a known fact and i think its illogical to treat her differently because shes a woman its what i need caitlin its as simple as that so you give me your word that murray has your orders to abort she crossed herself i swear it on my soul and ill swear it on anything else you wishthe bible if you like ill be content if you swear it on your own symbol of the prayer most precious in your life above all things he held up the card swear it on this i swear before god and with all my heart that i have spoken to patrick murray in front of his comrades who can confirm that his mission concerning monica starling is aborted she held out the card to him and he said no id prefer you to keep it then if you dont mind ill take my leave of you caitlin daly said a great day tomorrow god willing will we see you in the evening i think not holley said ill leave it to you and the cell saturday will be the day to see whats been achieved as he turned to go she caught his arm you still dont truly believe in all this do you his laugh was harsh and genuine a bit late in the day to ask me that sort of question i stopped believing in myself years ago once youve made a discovery like that its difficult to believe in anything else but its your day if its anybodys ill leave it to you and contact you on saturday morning he went out and she said to herself i thought so there was a slight creak as one of the doors opened in a confessional box and a man came forward holding a pistol in his right hand you heard all that patrick i could have shot him easy dont be stupid what would we have done with the body it would have ruined everything so what happens now does what you told me in front of the others still hold of course not go back to the original instructions and kill the bitch now go on get out and keep this to yourself he withdrew the door banged and it was so quiet only the virgin mary floating in a sea of candlelight watching her she looked down at the prayer card she tore it into little pieces her face quite calm then walked back to the sacristy although not of the faith himself daniel holley had seen enough of how important roman catholicism was to irish women to believe that the oath she had given him sworn on the virgin herself would be binding the memory of his years with his beloved mother was enough to convince him in the cab during the return journey he felt considerable relief he called ahead and told selim he was on his way a certain burden had been lifted and it showed when he got to the shop and rang for entrance selim bustled out wearing his black duster coat i could tell by your voice that you are a different man am i correct yes i have to admit im much relieved excellent five minutes to go for the eight oclock show at the curzon theyre showing alain delon and belmondo in borsalino gangsters again holley said of course and why not hurry my boy well just make it the film was as stunning as it had been the first time holley had seen it decades ago later at al bustan they discussed it more than any other filmmakers the french have portrayed the romance of the gangster have been able to make him a genuine antihero and there is a certain nobility to such characters selim said holley shook his head youve been reading too many film magazines selim the one thing that all such films have in common is the ending your antihero usually on his back in some street a gun in his hand in the act of dying if not already dead wheres the nobility in that but this is not always so daniel you my boy are still here despite all the odds the samurai for real but consider the price selim has it been worth it i think not he got up and reached for his coat ill see you in the morning he went out into the narrow street turning up his collar against the rain lighter now but still there he felt a strange content probably because of the way the problem with caitlin daly had resolved itself and was reasonably satisfied with the way things were going he assumed that harry miller had already departed for new york what he didnt know was that the gulfstream carried an additional passenger one sean dillon who had persuaded ferguson at the last minute that he should go for the moment all holley wanted was sleep for tomorrow would be one of the most important days in his life and arriving back at the hotel he went straight up to his room and turned in he had the dream again if anything more intense than ever rosaleen with him an even shorter time leaving him quite quickly assuring him that she would return but never doing so there was the same sense of panic as he ran through those narrow streets and towering buildings in the blackandwhite world this time it wasnt just the feeling of loss where she was concerned it was experiencing the sensation that he was the only person in that dark world and for the first time he struggled and came awake he lay there staring at the ceiling aware that he was totally alone and always would be that was his eternal truth and something hed better face so he got up showered and shaved put on his ankle holster just in case and went across to shepherds market selim insisted on making scrambled eggs and toast for them and holley sat there in the kitchen watching him cooking it was absolutely delicious and he said so and selim beamed happily if i learned one great thing from the english when i was at oxford it was the art of making perfect scrambled eggs on toast for it is a great art did you know that ian fleming is said to have virtually lived on scrambled eggs he once said in an interview that he could eat them at any time day or night selim youre a good friend and i know what youre doing youre trying to take my mind off things and yes i need that if things go right theyll start happening in the late afternoon new york time the other things will happen here late tonight i am on standby if you like its other people who will actually go to war the woman that was proving difficult she is actually in charge of whats happening i planned things its as simple as that while others go into action i have to stand back and wait for the result and if it does not produce the expected success one supposes mister big at the kremlin gets to blame you so what do i do the day stretches ahead care to return to my favorite spa i could phone martha and book us in overnight holley was going to say no and then thought oh why not he could get the verdict there as well as anyplace else and should the news turn out to be badwell he was really going to need that massage at the club things were very much as they had been before even the weather was the same latewinter cold and miserable rain sitting in the lounge bar at four oclock in the afternoon on his own after a strenuous round in the gym holley received his first voice from the outside world a call from chekhov where are you he demanded none of your business holley told him im staying out of the way thats all you need to know everything is in place so ive stepped back leaving caitlin daly to strut her stuff as cell leader do you think thats wise shes earned her spurs max everyone knows what theyve got to do ferguson the salters kurbsky new yorkits all out of my hands now you seem to have skipped monica starling chekhov said because ive taken her off the agenda a sudden attack of conscience i have no difficulty killing on behalf of a woman as you well know but ive never actually killed one and i dont intend to start now and caitlin daly must have hated that how did you know think red brigade or go back further to the french revolution shed have helped female aristocrats up the steps to the guillotine with a smile on her face i think youre being a little hard there max whats the boy wonder up to theyve sewn up his ear its covered by a substantial dressing and surgical tape so you cant see how much damage has been done but it must be considerable i meant it to be im surprised he isnt still in his bed in the sick bay but hes up and round and glaring at everyone like the devil himself i saw him in the canteen with kerimov who has dressing taped across his left hand and wears a black sling its the only time ive visited the embassy in the past few days not that youd tell me but has he said anything about me daniel asked as i said i stick to the plan and stay away from the embassy as much as possible which was the order he hasnt phoned me since the confrontation but daniel this is why i phoned youi wanted to let you know that lermovs been in touch when was this an hour or so ago hes arrived in new york he asked after ivanov and suggested i should call you concerned about my welfare no doubt holley laughed keeping tabs on me more like he spoke to me yesterday just before they left moscow asked me to stop shooting people and inquired about how things were going but i assume he would know anyway because ive kept you informed it did occur to me that you might have passed it along to him but my dear daniel what is one to do thats for you to decide survivals the name of the game where youre concerned i can see that and i dont hold it against you you cant harm me because i dont trust you for a minute max not even for a little bit now thats hard daniel chekhov told him yes isnt it daniel cut him off and selim appeared in a robe just checking are you all right im fine get back to work holley told him youve got to think of those pounds he waited for the next call but it was an hour before it came lermov said i wont ask you where you are a man of secrets i think is everything still in place absolutely im standing back while caitlin daly savors her hour of glory no problems then one change of plan i decided to abort the attack on monica starling yes i heard about that did it cause any problem it wasnt well received but its my decision very noble of you so now we wait i wish you luck daniel if you can bring this off it will be the coup of a lifetime holley sat there thinking about it so chekhov must have been in touch with lermov the minute hed put the phone down which explained lermov knowing about the monica starling business well that was all right he was reminded of the old mafia saying keep your friends close but your enemies closer he closed his eyes dozing and after a while there was a tap on his shoulder and he opened his eyes and found harry standing there in his white uniform were ready for you in the pool now mr grimshaw all those special exercises lots to do holley got up and followed meekly for it was filling the time admirably until the final act of the drama and so time wore on and the evening came and then it was time for bed he slept lightly too much on his mind braced for the calls until finally he was fetched awake by his codex he glanced at the bedside clock and saw it was two in the morning daniel chekhov said ive had a call from potanin in new york its not good tell me the business at quogue ivan bulganin was observing from a clump of trees he saw flynn shoot johnson as the boat came in but johnson managed to shoot him in return flynn went into the water bulganin couldnt do anything about it except get the hell out of there and as he left he heard the sound of emergency vehicles arriving and frank barry miller left the plaza to go for a walk in central park barry followed him and potanin stalked them barry tried to jump miller and miller had what looked like an ankle holster he shot barry in the knee and walked away potanin couldnt risk any involvement and cleared off christ what a bloody cockup i havent finished barry called in on his mobile from mercy hospital he told potanin hed better get him out or else and what did potanin do sent bulganin round dressed as a doctor and stuck a hypo in him some nurse arrived he punched her and got clean away a total disaster holley said it could have been worse barrys dead and bulganin made sure to pocket his mobile theres no connection to belov or to us well thats something i suppose have you informed lermov not yet but i obviously must hes at a late dinner at the un hardly a good time i understand hes coming back to london tonight yes he wont want to confront putin with this kind of news but you should tell him if only to cover yourself holley said and ivanov hell find out anyway what about the woman has she called do you know how things are going here i told her id contact her in the morning but i meant a more civilized hour than this well i think you should tell her about new york as soon as possible youre right i suppose ill call you back in the old days they sometimes killed messengers who delivered bad news holleys laugh had a certain grimness to it not nice daniel not nice at all youll put me off my breakfast holley got out of bed put on a robe then went and sat in an easy chair beside a window that overlooked the terrace and called her she answered almost instantly is it you daniel yes caitlin she seemed to hesitate then carried on is there news from new york yet where are you i came over from the presbytery theres no one round in the church at this time of the morning ive locked myself in the sacristy sitting down i hope because ive had my friend chekhov on with news from his security people in new york and bad news it is go on she said in a strangely calm voice so he told her when he was finished she said wearily well god wasnt on our side thats for sure what happened in london holley said tell me the worst ferguson and pool and the limousine a premature explosion before they got in pool had a remote control so he must have mishandled it and he was closer to the amara so he was killed and ferguson was simply blown over hardly singed let alone killed and the salters i drove docherty down there myself and hung round to see how he got on he seemed to get in the pub all right but after a while there was a disturbance and he came running out with somebody after him he got in that old van you mentioned started up and drove straight along the jetty into the thames i dont know what went wrong he must have panicked i got out of there fast and came back here a total failure barry and flynn dead in new york pool dead docherty very probably what happened to cochran holley asked i think we may have struck gold there he got in the garden and was disturbed by a man who beat him up pretty thoroughly he said he looked like some ghoul in a horror movie the chemotherapy man holley told her i walked past the house yesterday to check it out from the outside and saw him emerge from a side entrance another man cochran said came out of the house on the terrace and called are you all right alex alexander kurbsky it has to be and the other guy would be yuri bounine what happened this alex relieved cochran of his wallet he was distracted by the arrival of his friend so cochran managed to run for it scrambled over the wall and got away he also heard womens voices and one did call out alexander are you well thats it holley said not quite daniel she was silent for a moment we even lost when i lied to you in a way he knew what was coming and said spit it out monica starling she took a deep breath and told him so there you are and gods curse on me for what i did shes all right though and how in the hell would you know murray dumped the truck into a tree farther along and went back through the wood along the side of the road he watched police and ambulance at the scene there was an old boy with her whod been bandaged up but she seemed fine no thanks to you holley told her so what happens now she asked wearily i suppose the russians will be interested to know that kurbsky is alive and kicking if that weirdlooking man really is him id stake my life on it i think this strange appearance is just a very clever disguise if you look at photos of alexander kurbsky hes a longhaired bearded cavalier of a man a swagger to him it was an absolutely brilliant idea on the part of whoever thought it up to disguise him as the exact opposite so youll pass the information on to the russians what would they do kidnap him i suppose to do that theyd have to lay hands on him and i very much doubt thats going to happen charles ferguson and his friends have just experienced a personal and very organized series of attacks theyre not going to take any chances holley shook his head ferguson is going to fear the worst when kurbsky reports in hell make arrangements to get him and the women out of there and pack them off to somewhere safe and secure perhaps out of the country where do you think oh who the hell knows theyre very close with the americans theyll probably help one thing you can be certain about it will happen today and very quickly so what now ill not run out on you im glad to hear it just before everything hotted up last night i had a strange call from a man who asked me if i knew where you were he said he was a captain ivanov what did you do i was up to my eyes with everything i said i didnt know what he was talking about and he laughed in a very nasty way and said maybe he should come and see me i closed down on him who is he i told you i had the russians behind me in this and asked if it bothered you you said it didnt and that they were a means to an end peter ivanov is a gru captain hes turned out to be a truly bad man he doesnt like me and thinks he should be the one running things not that theres much left to run ill deal with him where are you in the country ill be back in town soon look for me girl keep the faith he sat there thinking about it a bloody mess it had turned out to be and still only three oclock in the morning well no point going back to bed now he called selim who answered groggily whoever this is go away its me selim stop fooling round we need to talk meet me downstairs in five minutes he had actually been sitting in the lounge for fifteen minutes when selim emerged looking rumpled so tell me whats so important holley did from the beginning to the shambles it had now become selim listened with a kind of awe my dear boy can this be so its better than the midnight movie what happens now charles ferguson will move quickly to get kurbsky and those with him to somewhere safeand thats the end of it the big boss in the kremlin will be disappointed and i have a feeling lermov will feel youve let him down well thats too bad and if he thinks ill go back to the lubyanka he can think again fighting talk thats what i like to hear lets see if theres anyone round to give us breakfast daniel and then well get back to town and see whats happening end game back in london at his hotel holley phoned ivanov in the afternoon i presume youve heard the bad news chekhov told me as soon as he knew not so clever now holley are we youve failed i suppose you could put it that way holley told him has lermov called of course he has and he isnt pleased id say its back to the lubyanka for you its a thought i suppose when does he get in round midnight and hes told me to keep a close eye on you no use in trying to do a runner he was thoroughly worked up his voice full of venom dont be stupid holley told him how can you keep a close eye on me when you dont even know where i am i know where the daly woman is though thats true but i warned you about approaching her and i meant what i said shes had enough on her plate yes more bloody failure as i understand it major chelek has heard what happened to charles ferguson last night absolutely bloody nothing a dead chauffeur wasnt the point i understand the salters pub the dark man is still standing in spite of a suspected arson attack true holley said and lady monica starling survived the crash with the truck driver who tried to knock her off the road a complete failure thats the truth of it ivanov said and what about kurbsky chekhov told me that you had arranged for one of the cell members to break into kurbskys aunts house to find out if hes been hiding there what happened about that suddenly in a moment of revelation daniel holley knew that hed had enough and that he didnt really care anymore about putin being disappointed and josef lermovs career prospects facing severe damage when it came right down to it even the threat of a return to the lubyanka didnt worry him because he was going to run and keep on running and they could all go to hell what he wasnt going to do was tell ivanov that alexander kurbsky and yuri bounine were hiding in his aunts house almost certainly awaiting a pickup for pastures new arranged by charles ferguson according to cochran the house was empty everyone gone thats all i can say then where are they i havent the slightest idea maybe ferguson would know you could ask him or that starling bitch ivanov said she was more involved with kurbsky than anyone i dont think youd get very far asking her and as shes harry millers sister and sean dillons lover i wouldnt advise you to try anyway im telling you again stay away from caitlin daly go to hell ivanov told him and clicked off holley didnt have to prepare for the possibility of a bad scenario he knew it was coming he stripped to the waist and pulled on his bulletproof vest then dressed again this time he backed up the ankle holster and the knife in his left sock with the silenced walther in the special lefthand breast pocket of his raincoat at the shop selim let him in and said i see you have your suitcase with you at this stage in the game a fast exit might be in order im returning your laptop bring me uptodate selim said holley filled him in so there you are a disaster all round the call from ivanov doesnt sound good do you think hell go after daly im sure of it which is why im going there now lermovs not due until midnight can i borrow the mini cooper of course you can ill get the keys selim went out for a moment then returned and handed them to holley if you have to park it somewhere leave the keys inside and lock the door i have spares if it needs to be picked up what have you planned i havent the slightest idea im at the stage where im not playing the game the games playing me a most interesting position to be in i await the outcome with bated breath then ill be on my way obviously ill be in touch please do dear friend selim embraced him and lightly kissed his cheeks allah protect you holley went out into shepherds market the door closed behind him he was alone again hed just started to drive when his codex sounded and he pulled over to the side of the road it was chekhov and his first words were as usual where are you on the road what do you want you spoke to ivanov didnt you yes you told him that cochran found the place empty you were very lucky what do you mean i mean that ivanov has some special new electronic gadget from major chelek that knocks out security systems he and kerimov got inside chamber court a short time ago and found it deserted not a soul there holley felt immediately cheered ferguson certainly moves fast so where do you think they are probably america ferguson is owed a lot of favors there but wherever it is it will be very very safe ivanov must be going out of his head at that thought what about caitlin daly chekhov asked she must be devastated at the way things have worked out thats one way of describing it and lermov gets in at midnight i hear chekhov said and wont be pleased you can say that again holley told him what are you going to do get the hell out of there id like to but theres the woman to consider chekhov laughed incredulously dont be ridiculous you dont owe her anything come off it max there she was living on past glory and her own impossible dream and shed still be doing that if i hadnt turned up and made the dream real again hardly your fault that was lermov and putin at the kremlin you didnt have a choice maybe not but i cant just run out on her now ive got to go ill speak to you later he started to drive but had to pull over to the side as his codex alerted him again it was caitlin daly in a panic sean dillon had turned up at the church with billy salter dillon had gone into the confessional box with monsignor murphy it was all there and dillon knew everything and four dead men alreadyhenry pool john docherty frank barry and jack flynnall with the card in their wallets ferguson and his people were on to them holley agreed with her at this stage for dillon to be so close was incredible the prayer cards hadnt helped out of the six male cell members five had carried the card he certainly hadnt known about that and he wondered if caitlin did theres no proof nothing concrete he tried to reassure her where are you at the church monsignor murphys in his study in the presbytery im in the sacristy its the only place where i can be truly alone and lock the door im scared daniel frightened that ivanov will make an appearance i dread that he could be here already are you armed yes i carry a belgian leon in my bag thats good and you know how to use it ill see you quite soon ive got a car twenty minutes with any luck he did not see what happened that was the terrible thing he drove to kilburn parked the mini cooper some distance from the church and could see a small crowd of people standing there in the dusk of early evening an ambulance and two police cars policemen taking statements monsignor james murphy was in a dark cloak talking to one officer and from the look of him greatly distressed there was a mediumsized truck with one front wheel over a curb a shakenlooking man in a leather jacket leaning against it obviously the driver holley stood at the back and said softly to an old man in a cloth cap standing next to him what happened a terrible business monsignor murphys housekeeper came running down the path and straight out into the road i saw the whole thing quite a few people did the driver never stood a chance i dont know what possessed her an older woman in front looked back over her shoulder i heard her shouting at somebody she was saying get away from me and where is she holley asked the man in the ambulance but shes dead like i said the police are taking a lot of statements its a terrible thing but that poor sod was in no way to blame he nodded towards the driver holley backed slowly away as more people appeared drawn to the crowd by the drama of it he turned and walked back to the mini cooper and sat behind the wheel for a while she had been running from peter ivanov that had to be the explanation his anger was very real because he was to blame he sat there breathing deeply and gripping the wheel hard then he called chekhov there was no background music no impression that others were there its daniel he said where are you at the apartment do you know what ivanovs up to chekhov was obviously reluctant to talk he was here a while ago after hed discovered that there was no one at belsize park he turned up in a cab and he had kerimov with him the apeman was wearing big gloves because of his bad hand so he could drive ivanov had been drinking what did he want he said they needed to know where alexander kurbsky was and the obvious person to ask was monica starling because shed been involved with him from the beginning and that was it no he told me he wanted me to lend him one of my mercedes limousines i keep three in the underground parking downstairs he said he didnt want to use an embassy car to do what holley demanded he was just talking nonsense he said if he could get his hands on monica starling and take her for a ride in the country he could soon get the truth about kurbsky out of her chekhov laughed uneasily just crazy stuff daniel max he made threats against caitlin daly bad enough to frighten her to death ive been up to kilburn and she was already in a body bag in the ambulance cops all over the place the old priest murphy in tears jesus holley i dont know anything about that i swear it okay then what do you know what did he say about where he would go that was drunken nonsense he was rambling on about bolt hole and he said there was a full moon tonight and it would be perfect to go for a sail which is exactly what the drunken fool intends now this is what youre going to do and if you let me down ill kill you anything daniel ill do anything im going to ring off you will call him assess the situation and call me now get on with it chekhov was back within five minutes hes really tanked up i asked where he was headed and he said he already told me then he said he had to go now because he had precious cargo in the trunk the stupid bastard hes actually gone and lifted her holley said what are you going to do chekhov asked give ferguson a call miller and dillon will go crazy when they find out about this no ive got to think of me here as well as her i can only bring them into it by delivering myself into their hands and im damned if ill do that ive had enough of prison bars to last a lifetime ill just have to handle it alone youre crazy it isnt your business oh yes it is max i told you before its a woman thing with me ill go now ill have to hurry but they tell me a mini cooper is built for speed so well see at least he knew the way thanks to the day out with selim and there was the sat nav to follow he drove fast but stayed alert the last thing he needed was a police car to stop him for speeding he had a good fast run to guildford and all the way to chichester had just passed through when his codex sounded he pulled in at a convenient layby turned off his engine and answered daniel lermov here holley checked his watch and found it was almost tenthirty where are you i understood you were getting in at midnight i am lermov replied im calling you from the falcon i know everything including the death of caitlin daly youre well informed chekhovs been on the phone to you he knows who his real friends are and not you youre a loose cannon i should have realized that the only loose cannon in this whole matter has been your boy wonder peter ivanov hes responsible for the death of caitlin daly because he didnt follow your orders and hell have to answer for that so what happens to monica starling obviously chekhov must have told you whats going on ive just spoken to ivanov it seems theyve almost reached their destination ive ordered him to release her and you think that drunken pig will hes got to dispose of her because if she goes free hell have charles ferguson miller and dillon thirsting for his blood because of what happened to her and i think youll find theyre not particularly well disposed towards you id be very careful where youre taking this daniel lermov said ah station gorky awaits does it youll have to catch me first and im still going to bolt hole peter ivanovs a dead man dont be stupid he knows youre on your way hell be expecting you you told him chekhov already had i might have known youre finished josef unless ivanov puts a bullet in that womans head and dumps her over the rail of chekhovs yacht with a few pounds of chains round her ankles i believe thats what youve told him to do i of course intend to see that he doesnt lermov shouted dont be a fool he knows youre coming but holley cut him off he switched off the engine at the narrow approach road leading to the small headland and advanced on foot keeping to the fringe of trees taking selims zeiss binoculars with him there was a single light at the end of the jetty and there was the mercedes the canvas stern cover was in place on the yacht and monica starling sat on a folding beach stool her hands bound behind her she wore a sweater and slacks obviously the clothes shed been wearing when kidnapped and was facing him so that he could see that her mouth was taped he was standing by a small bench seat there was a footfall behind him and something nudged him in the back kerimov said in russian weve been waiting me and my friend the makarov it seemed obvious youd start off here to see what was going on so i thought id greet you get your hands behind your neck or ill blow your spine away his roaming left hand found the walther which he slipped in his pocket now the ankle holster put your foot on the bench holley did exactly as he was told and kerimov found the colt and put that in his pocket also satisfied holley asked still with his right foot on the bench i will be when youre dead kerimov said and he pushed holley hard so that he fell over kerimov kicked him in the side on your feet you piece of shit the boss wants a word before i kill you holley found the flickknife in his left sock pulled it out as he got up turned to face kerimov pressing the button and the razorsharp blade sheared up under the chin into the brain kerimov went down hard and kicked for a while and then was still holley recovered his weapons wiped the knife and put the colt back in the ankle holster he searched kerimov briefly and found car keys which he assumed were for the mercedes he started down the walther in his left hand there was no sign of ivanov there was a light in the wheelhouse but it seemed empty there was soft music playing a light at the portholes perhaps ivanov was below monica saw him coming and shook her head vigorously which didnt help at all he started towards her a finger to his lips then took his knife from his right pocket there was a maniacal laugh behind him and a bullet caught him squarely in the back and he half turned and peter ivanov was standing up in the wheelhouse fooled you you bastard holley dropped the walther and ivanov shot him in the chest sending him back over the rail into the water he went down surfaced and kicked out into the darkness while ivanov was still negotiating the companionway to the deck holley pulled his way around to the prow and at that point there were a few stone steps up to the jetty he freed himself from his raincoat and knelt on the bottom step listening ive killed the bastard did you see that ivanov was obviously addressing monica but then he raised his voice and shouted kerimov where are you holley pulled the colt from the ankle holster was up the steps in a moment monica saw him first and couldnt help reacting ivanov swung around in alarm and holley said this is for caitlin daly he shot ivanov between the eyes the hollowpoint cartridge imploding in the brain instant death as he went back over the rail holley picked his knife up from the deck and cut monicas bonds she tore the tape away and gagged god that hurt i dont know who the hell you are but i should warn you theres another one not anymore he jumped me up there in the trees ive taken care of him permanently id no choice never mind that what id really like is an explanation earlier this evening i went out to visit a local corner shop in mayfair when this mercedes drew up beside me before i knew what was happening they had a bag over my head and forced me into the trunk of the car i should imagine two hours of that must have been hell but who are they where am i and who are you though thank god for you your brother is major harry miller the man in your life is sean dillon tell them caitlin daly is dead and the man ive just killed was responsible a gru captain named peter ivanov who worked for colonel josef lermov theyll know what its all about believe me and you just call me daniel he went to the steps recovered his raincoat and found the car keys hed taken from kerimov i think youll find these are for the mercedes if youre up to it id drive it back to london if i were you but where am i in west sussex a place called bolt hole owned by an oligarch named max chekhov the cars his too i think youll find hes not unknown to your people he took out his codex a good job these things are water resistant i think youd better give them a call theyll be worried im going to get my car she was still on the phone when he got back he took his suitcase with him went below dumped his wet clothes and changed both his passports had survived the soaking thanks to their plastic covers so that was all right there was a wardrobe with a wide range of clothes he helped himself to a fawn trench coat and went back on deck she was still on the codex paused and said hes here a moment passed and she held it out to him its sean dillon holley took it from her and said shell be fine dillon said who the hell are you there are days when im not too sure myself a cinema ghost a friend calls me though you wont know what that means i dont know where kurbsky is but give him my respects ivanov and his sergeant actually gained entrance to chamber court earlier and found it empty theres how close it came so theres nothing more i can say or do dillon asked yes there is actually alexander kurbskys situation is a big problem that would seem beyond solving i think ive got a solution and id like you to pass it on to blake johnson and what would it be the telling only took a couple of minutes and when he was finished dillon laughed do you know something i think that could very well be an answer ill pass it on holley turned off his codex ill get moving and so should you he passed monica a plastic bag hed found in the bedroom below one walther a colt and a flickknife id never get through customs with that lot give them to dillon hell know what to do with them she accepted the bag and held out her hand what can i say goodbye would seem to be appropriate he smiled youre one tough lady monica starling he got in the mini cooper and drove away she stood there listening as the noise dwindled strange the sense of loss she felt and she turned went to the mercedes and drove away herself holley left the mini cooper in the longstay car park at southampton airport booked in a hotel overnight and flew out on an early flight to paris unable to sleep very well hed phoned selim and told him what had happened a terrible business selim said what do you think ferguson will do hes always had a very efficient disposal system rather like undertakers the people he employs pick up the bodies left over from unfortunate incidents such as this ivanov and kerimov will be reduced to a few pounds of gray ash quicker than you can i magine and caitlin daly her death means it makes it very easy to treat the whole affair as if it never happened blake johnson of course had a bullet in him but hes on the mend and josef lermov perhaps its his turn to do a stint with the gru at station gorky like greta the only certain thing is that mister big at the kremlin is going to feel very let down holley said especially at the continuing lack of information regarding kurbsky i would also point out that details about what happened at bolt hole will certainly reach the kremlin and will certainly do your reputation little good there but in my opinion what you did for lady monica starling was magnificent and im sure her friends will share that view yes but unfortunately they are all on the wrong side and dont try to make me out to be some kind of a good guy not at this stage selim i found out who i truly was all those years ago when i shot dead those four men whod murdered rosaleen coogan what i am is what i am it cant be changed now so what next selim said algiers i think ill see you soon algiers it was three days later sitting on the terrace of the old moorish villa on the hill overlooking the harbor drinking icecold lager so what now malik asked back to business the death business god help us but theres got to be something better anyway the russians can be very unforgiving it might be a good idea to vanish into the desert again for a while i dont think you need to worry about any idea of vengeance anymore there was an interesting story on cnn on the television this morning i saw it just before you arrived what was it id really prefer you to see for yourself well go in the study they repeat these things on the hour so they sat together and waited and there it was an announcement from the white house the great russian novelist alexander kurbsky suffering from leukemia had quietly arrived in florida to seek the finest help available the president himself welcomed the chance for the united states to offer the very latest in treatment for this truly great man he was delighted to know how much the government of the russian federation had given their support to the move in the care of his aunt svetlana and friends mr kurbsky was recuperating under medical supervision on heron island it had been suggested that he could be a nobel prize winner next year and prime minister vladimir putin applauded the idea wholeheartedly malik switched off how clever it takes care of so many things including you ill go and open the champagne your troubles are over if you believe that youll believe anything daniel said he went out and walked to the balustrade of the terrace overlooking the harbor and his codex sounded he hesitated for it could be anyonelermov chekhov even putin himselfbut there was no point trying to hide is that you mr holley this is charles ferguson ah charles ferguson daniel took a deep breath how did you get my number max chekhov i had my people lift him once monica starling filled us in on bolt hole he told us all about you the russians wont like that then max will have to keep his door locked ferguson said so what do you want with me now that you know who i am daniel asked i just wanted to thank you for saving monicas life from that raving lunatic and his sergeant very civil of you any news on colonel lermov back in moscow and if hes half the man i think he is hell have already managed to shift the blame onto the shoulders of the late unlamented ivanov ferguson paused your plan of attack daniel was really very good even putin will have to admit that hell try to pull you back in you know he can try all he wants im done with him and you think you can survive his displeasure on your own without friends friends like you general daniels laugh was short and cold you and the russiansyoure two sides of the same coin theres nothing to choose between you im sorry you feel that way but you know daniel situations have a way of changing you have my number now you know where to reach me watch your back danieland again many thanks for what you did for monica the line went dead daniel checked and yes there was fergusons number stored in his phone just a click away he knew there would come a time when he would have to use it and he knew he would regret it he put the phone down on a small table lay on the cane recliner looked up at the sun and closed his eyes his troubles had just begun and there was much to prepare for
