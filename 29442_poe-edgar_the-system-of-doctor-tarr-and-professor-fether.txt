the system of doctor tarr and professor fether by edgar allan poe during the autumn of while on a tour through the extreme southern provinces of france my route led me within a few miles of a certain maison de sante or private madhouse about which i had heard much in paris from my medical friends as i had never visited a place of the kind i thought the opportunity too good to be lost and so proposed to my travelling companion a gentleman with whom i had made casual acquaintance a few days before that we should turn aside for an hour or so and look through the establishment to this he objected pleading haste in the first place and in the second a very usual horror at the sight of a lunatic he begged me however not to let any mere courtesy towards himself interfere with the gratification of my curiosity and said that he would ride on leisurely so that i might overtake him during the day or at all events during the next as he bade me goodbye i bethought me that there might be some difficulty in obtaining access to the premises and mentioned my fears on this point he replied that in fact unless i had personal knowledge of the superintendent monsieur maillard or some credential in the way of a letter a difficulty might be found to exist as the regulations of these private madhouses were more rigid than the public hospital laws for himself he added he had some years since made the acquaintance of maillard and would so far assist me as to ride up to the door and introduce me although his feelings on the subject of lunacy would not permit of his entering the house i thanked him and turning from the main road we entered a grassgrown bypath which in half an hour nearly lost itself in a dense forest clothing the base of a mountain through this dank and gloomy wood we rode some two miles when the maison de sante came in view it was a fantastic chateau much dilapidated and indeed scarcely tenantable through age and neglect its aspect inspired me with absolute dread and checking my horse i half resolved to turn back i soon however grew ashamed of my weakness and proceeded as we rode up to the gateway i perceived it slightly open and the visage of a man peering through in an instant afterward this man came forth accosted my companion by name shook him cordially by the hand and begged him to alight it was monsieur maillard himself he was a portly finelooking gentleman of the old school with a polished manner and a certain air of gravity dignity and authority which was very impressive my friend having presented me mentioned my desire to inspect the establishment and received monsieur maillards assurance that he would show me all attention now took leave and i saw him no more when he had gone the superintendent ushered me into a small and exceedingly neat parlor containing among other indications of refined taste many books drawings pots of flowers and musical instruments a cheerful fire blazed upon the hearth at a piano singing an aria from bellini sat a young and very beautiful woman who at my entrance paused in her song and received me with graceful courtesy her voice was low and her whole manner subdued i thought too that i perceived the traces of sorrow in her countenance which was excessively although to my taste not unpleasingly pale she was attired in deep mourning and excited in my bosom a feeling of mingled respect interest and admiration i had heard at paris that the institution of monsieur maillard was managed upon what is vulgarly termed the system of soothing that all punishments were avoided that even confinement was seldom resorted to that the patients while secretly watched were left much apparent liberty and that most of them were permitted to roam about the house and grounds in the ordinary apparel of persons in right mind keeping these impressions in view i was cautious in what i said before the young lady for i could not be sure that she was sane and in fact there was a certain restless brilliancy about her eyes which half led me to imagine she was not i confined my remarks therefore to general topics and to such as i thought would not be displeasing or exciting even to a lunatic she replied in a perfectly rational manner to all that i said and even her original observations were marked with the soundest good sense but a long acquaintance with the metaphysics of mania had taught me to put no faith in such evidence of sanity and i continued to practise throughout the interview the caution with which i commenced it presently a smart footman in livery brought in a tray with fruit wine and other refreshments of which i partook the lady soon afterward leaving the room as she departed i turned my eyes in an inquiring manner toward my host no he said oh no a member of my family my niece and a most accomplished woman i beg a thousand pardons for the suspicion i replied but of course you will know how to excuse me the excellent administration of your affairs here is well understood in paris and i thought it just possible you know yes yes say no more or rather it is myself who should thank you for the commendable prudence you have displayed we seldom find so much of forethought in young men and more than once some unhappy contretemps has occurred in consequence of thoughtlessness on the part of our visitors while my former system was in operation and my patients were permitted the privilege of roaming to and fro at will they were often aroused to a dangerous frenzy by injudicious persons who called to inspect the house hence i was obliged to enforce a rigid system of exclusion and none obtained access to the premises upon whose discretion i could not rely while your former system was in operation i said repeating his words do i understand you then to say that the soothing system of which i have heard so much is no longer in force it is now he replied several weeks since we have concluded to renounce it forever indeed you astonish me we found it sir he said with a sigh absolutely necessary to return to the old usages the danger of the soothing system was at all times appalling and its advantages have been much overrated i believe sir that in this house it has been given a fair trial if ever in any we did every thing that rational humanity could suggest i am sorry that you could not have paid us a visit at an earlier period that you might have judged for yourself but i presume you are conversant with the soothing practice with its details not altogether what i have heard has been at third or fourth hand i may state the system then in general terms as one in which the patients were menageshumored we contradicted no fancies which entered the brains of the mad on the contrary we not only indulged but encouraged them and many of our most permanent cures have been thus effected there is no argument which so touches the feeble reason of the madman as the argumentum ad absurdum we have had men for example who fancied themselves chickens the cure was to insist upon the thing as a fact to accuse the patient of stupidity in not sufficiently perceiving it to be a fact and thus to refuse him any other diet for a week than that which properly appertains to a chicken in this manner a little corn and gravel were made to perform wonders but was this species of acquiescence all by no means we put much faith in amusements of a simple kind such as music dancing gymnastic exercises generally cards certain classes of books and so forth we affected to treat each individual as if for some ordinary physical disorder and the word lunacy was never employed a great point was to set each lunatic to guard the actions of all the others to repose confidence in the understanding or discretion of a madman is to gain him body and soul in this way we were enabled to dispense with an expensive body of keepers and you had no punishments of any kind none and you never confined your patients very rarely now and then the malady of some individual growing to a crisis or taking a sudden turn of fury we conveyed him to a secret cell lest his disorder should infect the rest and there kept him until we could dismiss him to his friends for with the raging maniac we have nothing to do he is usually removed to the public hospitals and you have now changed all this and you think for the better decidedly the system had its disadvantages and even its dangers it is now happily exploded throughout all the maisons de sante of france i am very much surprised i said at what you tell me for i made sure that at this moment no other method of treatment for mania existed in any portion of the country you are young yet my friend replied my host but the time will arrive when you will learn to judge for yourself of what is going on in the world without trusting to the gossip of others believe nothing you hear and only onehalf that you see now about our maisons de sante it is clear that some ignoramus has misled you after dinner however when you have sufficiently recovered from the fatigue of your ride i will be happy to take you over the house and introduce to you a system which in my opinion and in that of every one who has witnessed its operation is incomparably the most effectual as yet devised your own i inquired one of your own invention i am proud he replied to acknowledge that it is at least in some measure in this manner i conversed with monsieur maillard for an hour or two during which he showed me the gardens and conservatories of the place i cannot let you see my patients he said just at present to a sensitive mind there is always more or less of the shocking in such exhibitions and i do not wish to spoil your appetite for dinner we will dine i can give you some veal a la menehoult with cauliflowers in veloute sauce after that a glass of clos de vougeot then your nerves will be sufficiently steadied at six dinner was announced and my host conducted me into a large salle a manger where a very numerous company were assembled twentyfive or thirty in all they were apparently people of rankcertainly of high breeding although their habiliments i thought were extravagantly rich partaking somewhat too much of the ostentatious finery of the vielle cour i noticed that at least twothirds of these guests were ladies and some of the latter were by no means accoutred in what a parisian would consider good taste at the present day many females for example whose age could not have been less than seventy were bedecked with a profusion of jewelry such as rings bracelets and earrings and wore their bosoms and arms shamefully bare i observed too that very few of the dresses were well made or at least that very few of them fitted the wearers in looking about i discovered the interesting girl to whom monsieur maillard had presented me in the little parlor but my surprise was great to see her wearing a hoop and farthingale with highheeled shoes and a dirty cap of brussels lace so much too large for her that it gave her face a ridiculously diminutive expression when i had first seen her she was attired most becomingly in deep mourning there was an air of oddity in short about the dress of the whole party which at first caused me to recur to my original idea of the soothing system and to fancy that monsieur maillard had been willing to deceive me until after dinner that i might experience no uncomfortable feelings during the repast at finding myself dining with lunatics but i remembered having been informed in paris that the southern provincialists were a peculiarly eccentric people with a vast number of antiquated notions and then too upon conversing with several members of the company my apprehensions were immediately and fully dispelled the diningroom itself although perhaps sufficiently comfortable and of good dimensions had nothing too much of elegance about it for example the floor was uncarpeted in france however a carpet is frequently dispensed with the windows too were without curtains the shutters being shut were securely fastened with iron bars applied diagonally after the fashion of our ordinary shopshutters the apartment i observed formed in itself a wing of the chateau and thus the windows were on three sides of the parallelogram the door being at the other there were no less than ten windows in all the table was superbly set out it was loaded with plate and more than loaded with delicacies the profusion was absolutely barbaric there were meats enough to have feasted the anakim never in all my life had i witnessed so lavish so wasteful an expenditure of the good things of life there seemed very little taste however in the arrangements and my eyes accustomed to quiet lights were sadly offended by the prodigious glare of a multitude of wax candles which in silver candelabra were deposited upon the table and all about the room wherever it was possible to find a place there were several active servants in attendance and upon a large table at the farther end of the apartment were seated seven or eight people with fiddles fifes trombones and a drum these fellows annoyed me very much at intervals during the repast by an infinite variety of noises which were intended for music and which appeared to afford much entertainment to all present with the exception of myself upon the whole i could not help thinking that there was much of the bizarre about every thing i saw but then the world is made up of all kinds of persons with all modes of thought and all sorts of conventional customs i had travelled too so much as to be quite an adept at the nil admirari so i took my seat very coolly at the right hand of my host and having an excellent appetite did justice to the good cheer set before me the conversation in the meantime was spirited and general the ladies as usual talked a great deal i soon found that nearly all the company were well educated and my host was a world of goodhumored anecdote in himself he seemed quite willing to speak of his position as superintendent of a maison de sante and indeed the topic of lunacy was much to my surprise a favorite one with all present a great many amusing stories were told having reference to the whims of the patients we had a fellow here once said a fat little gentleman who sat at my right a fellow that fancied himself a teapot and by the way is it not especially singular how often this particular crotchet has entered the brain of the lunatic there is scarcely an insane asylum in france which cannot supply a human teapot our gentleman was a britannia ware teapot and was careful to polish himself every morning with buckskin and whiting and then said a tall man just opposite we had here not long ago a person who had taken it into his head that he was a donkey which allegorically speaking you will say was quite true he was a troublesome patient and we had much ado to keep him within bounds for a long time he would eat nothing but thistles but of this idea we soon cured him by insisting upon his eating nothing else then he was perpetually kicking out his heelssoso mr de kock i will thank you to behave yourself here interrupted an old lady who sat next to the speaker please keep your feet to yourself you have spoiled my brocade is it necessary pray to illustrate a remark in so practical a style our friend here can surely comprehend you without all this upon my word you are nearly as great a donkey as the poor unfortunate imagined himself your acting is very natural as i live mille pardons mamselle replied monsieur de kock thus addressed a thousand pardons i had no intention of offending mamselle laplace monsieur de kock will do himself the honor of taking wine with you here monsieur de kock bowed low kissed his hand with much ceremony and took wine with mamselle laplace allow me mon ami now said monsieur maillard addressing myself allow me to send you a morsel of this veal a la st menhoult you will find it particularly fine at this instant three sturdy waiters had just succeeded in depositing safely upon the table an enormous dish or trencher containing what i supposed to be the monstrum horrendum informe ingens cui lumen ademptum a closer scrutiny assured me however that it was only a small calf roasted whole and set upon its knees with an apple in its mouth as is the english fashion of dressing a hare thank you no i replied to say the truth i am not particularly partial to veal a la st what is it for i do not find that it altogether agrees with me i will change my plate however and try some of the rabbit there were several sidedishes on the table containing what appeared to be the ordinary french rabbit a very delicious morceau which i can recommend pierre cried the host change this gentlemans plate and give him a sidepiece of this rabbit auchat this what said i this rabbit auchat why thank you upon second thoughts no i will just help myself to some of the ham there is no knowing what one eats thought i to myself at the tables of these people of the province i will have none of their rabbit auchat and for the matter of that none of their cataurabbit either and then said a cadaverous looking personage near the foot of the table taking up the thread of the conversation where it had been broken off and then among other oddities we had a patient once upon a time who very pertinaciously maintained himself to be a cordova cheese and went about with a knife in his hand soliciting his friends to try a small slice from the middle of his leg he was a great fool beyond doubt interposed some one but not to be compared with a certain individual whom we all know with the exception of this strange gentleman i mean the man who took himself for a bottle of champagne and always went off with a pop and a fizz in this fashion here the speaker very rudely as i thought put his right thumb in his left cheek withdrew it with a sound resembling the popping of a cork and then by a dexterous movement of the tongue upon the teeth created a sharp hissing and fizzing which lasted for several minutes in imitation of the frothing of champagne this behavior i saw plainly was not very pleasing to monsieur maillard but that gentleman said nothing and the conversation was resumed by a very lean little man in a big wig and then there was an ignoramus said he who mistook himself for a frog which by the way he resembled in no little degree i wish you could have seen him sir here the speaker addressed myself it would have done your heart good to see the natural airs that he put on sir if that man was not a frog i can only observe that it is a pity he was not his croak thus oooogh oooogh was the finest note in the world b flat and when he put his elbows upon the table thus after taking a glass or two of wine and distended his mouth thus and rolled up his eyes thus and winked them with excessive rapidity thus why then sir i take it upon myself to say positively that you would have been lost in admiration of the genius of the man i have no doubt of it i said and then said somebody else then there was petit gaillard who thought himself a pinch of snuff and was truly distressed because he could not take himself between his own finger and thumb and then there was jules desoulieres who was a very singular genius indeed and went mad with the idea that he was a pumpkin he persecuted the cook to make him up into pies a thing which the cook indignantly refused to do for my part i am by no means sure that a pumpkin pie a la desoulieres would not have been very capital eating indeed you astonish me said i and i looked inquisitively at monsieur maillard ha ha ha said that gentleman he he he hi hi hi ho ho ho hu hu hu hu very good indeed you must not be astonished mon ami our friend here is a wit a drole you must not understand him to the letter and then said some other one of the party then there was bouffon le grand another extraordinary personage in his way he grew deranged through love and fancied himself possessed of two heads one of these he maintained to be the head of cicero the other he imagined a composite one being demosthenes from the top of the forehead to the mouth and lord broughams from the mouth to the chin it is not impossible that he was wrong but he would have convinced you of his being in the right for he was a man of great eloquence he had an absolute passion for oratory and could not refrain from display for example he used to leap upon the dinnertable thus and and here a friend at the side of the speaker put a hand upon his shoulder and whispered a few words in his ear upon which he ceased talking with great suddenness and sank back within his chair and then said the friend who had whispered there was boullard the teetotum i call him the teetotum because in fact he was seized with the droll but not altogether irrational crotchet that he had been converted into a teetotum you would have roared with laughter to see him spin he would turn round upon one heel by the hour in this manner so here the friend whom he had just interrupted by a whisper performed an exactly similar office for himself but then cried the old lady at the top of her voice your monsieur boullard was a madman and a very silly madman at best for who allow me to ask you ever heard of a human teetotum the thing is absurd madame joyeuse was a more sensible person as you know she had a crotchet but it was instinct with common sense and gave pleasure to all who had the honor of her acquaintance she found upon mature deliberation that by some accident she had been turned into a chickencock but as such she behaved with propriety she flapped her wings with prodigious effect so so and as for her crow it was delicious cockadoodledoo cockadoodledoo cockadoodlededoodooodooooooo madame joyeuse i will thank you to behave yourself here interrupted our host very angrily you can either conduct yourself as a lady should do or you can quit the table forthwithtake your choice the lady whom i was much astonished to hear addressed as madame joyeuse after the description of madame joyeuse she had just given blushed up to the eyebrows and seemed exceedingly abashed at the reproof she hung down her head and said not a syllable in reply but another and younger lady resumed the theme it was my beautiful girl of the little parlor oh madame joyeuse was a fool she exclaimed but there was really much sound sense after all in the opinion of eugenie salsafette she was a very beautiful and painfully modest young lady who thought the ordinary mode of habiliment indecent and wished to dress herself always by getting outside instead of inside of her clothes it is a thing very easily done after all you have only to do so and then so so so and then so so so and then so so and then mon dieu mamselle salsafette here cried a dozen voices at once what are you about forbear that is sufficient we see very plainly how it is done hold hold and several persons were already leaping from their seats to withhold mamselle salsafette from putting herself upon a par with the medicean venus when the point was very effectually and suddenly accomplished by a series of loud screams or yells from some portion of the main body of the chateau my nerves were very much affected indeed by these yells but the rest of the company i really pitied i never saw any set of reasonable people so thoroughly frightened in my life they all grew as pale as so many corpses and shrinking within their seats sat quivering and gibbering with terror and listening for a repetition of the sound it came again louder and seemingly nearer and then a third time very loud and then a fourth time with a vigor evidently diminished at this apparent dying away of the noise the spirits of the company were immediately regained and all was life and anecdote as before i now ventured to inquire the cause of the disturbance a mere bagtelle said monsieur maillard we are used to these things and care really very little about them the lunatics every now and then get up a howl in concert one starting another as is sometimes the case with a bevy of dogs at night it occasionally happens however that the concerto yells are succeeded by a simultaneous effort at breaking loose when of course some little danger is to be apprehended and how many have you in charge at present we have not more than ten altogether principally females i presume oh no every one of them men and stout fellows too i can tell you indeed i have always understood that the majority of lunatics were of the gentler sex it is generally so but not always some time ago there were about twentyseven patients here and of that number no less than eighteen were women but lately matters have changed very much as you see yes have changed very much as you see here interrupted the gentleman who had broken the shins of mamselle laplace yes have changed very much as you see chimed in the whole company at once hold your tongues every one of you said my host in a great rage whereupon the whole company maintained a dead silence for nearly a minute as for one lady she obeyed monsieur maillard to the letter and thrusting out her tongue which was an excessively long one held it very resignedly with both hands until the end of the entertainment and this gentlewoman said i to monsieur maillard bending over and addressing him in a whisper this good lady who has just spoken and who gives us the cockadoodlededoo she i presume is harmless quite harmless eh harmless ejaculated he in unfeigned surprise why why what can you mean only slightly touched said i touching my head i take it for granted that she is not particularly not dangerously affected eh mon dieu what is it you imagine this lady my particular old friend madame joyeuse is as absolutely sane as myself she has her little eccentricities to be sure but then you know all old women all very old women are more or less eccentric to be sure said i to be sure and then the rest of these ladies and gentlemen are my friends and keepers interupted monsieur maillard drawing himself up with hauteur my very good friends and assistants what all of them i asked the women and all assuredly he said we could not do at all without the women they are the best lunatic nurses in the world they have a way of their own you know their bright eyes have a marvellous effect something like the fascination of the snake you know to be sure said i to be sure they behave a little odd eh they are a little queer eh dont you think so odd queer why do you really think so we are not very prudish to be sure here in the south do pretty much as we please enjoy life and all that sort of thing you know to be sure said i to be sure and then perhaps this clos de vougeot is a little heady you know a little strong you understand eh to be sure said i to be sure by the bye monsieur did i understand you to say that the system you have adopted in place of the celebrated soothing system was one of very rigorous severity by no means our confinement is necessarily close but the treatment the medical treatment i mean is rather agreeable to the patients than otherwise and the new system is one of your own invention not altogether some portions of it are referable to professor tarr of whom you have necessarily heard and again there are modifications in my plan which i am happy to acknowledge as belonging of right to the celebrated fether with whom if i mistake not you have the honor of an intimate acquaintance i am quite ashamed to confess i replied that i have never even heard the names of either gentleman before good heavens ejaculated my host drawing back his chair abruptly and uplifting his hands i surely do not hear you aright you did not intend to say eh that you had never heard either of the learned doctor tarr or of the celebrated professor fether i am forced to acknowledge my ignorance i replied but the truth should be held inviolate above all things nevertheless i feel humbled to the dust not to be acquainted with the works of these no doubt extraordinary men i will seek out their writings forthwith and peruse them with deliberate care monsieur maillard you have really i must confess it you have really made me ashamed of myself and this was the fact say no more my good young friend he said kindly pressing my hand join me now in a glass of sauterne we drank the company followed our example without stint they chatted they jested they laughed they perpetrated a thousand absurdities the fiddles shrieked the drum rowdedowed the trombones bellowed like so many brazen bulls of phalaris and the whole scene growing gradually worse and worse as the wines gained the ascendancy became at length a sort of pandemonium in petto in the meantime monsieur maillard and myself with some bottles of sauterne and vougeot between us continued our conversation at the top of the voice a word spoken in an ordinary key stood no more chance of being heard than the voice of a fish from the bottom of niagra falls and sir said i screaming in his ear you mentioned something before dinner about the danger incurred in the old system of soothing how is that yes he replied there was occasionally very great danger indeed there is no accounting for the caprices of madmen and in my opinion as well as in that of dr tarr and professor fether it is never safe to permit them to run at large unattended a lunatic may be soothed as it is called for a time but in the end he is very apt to become obstreperous his cunning too is proverbial and great if he has a project in view he conceals his design with a marvellous wisdom and the dexterity with which he counterfeits sanity presents to the metaphysician one of the most singular problems in the study of mind when a madman appears thoroughly sane indeed it is high time to put him in a straitjacket but the danger my dear sir of which you were speaking in your own experience during your control of this house have you had practical reason to think liberty hazardous in the case of a lunatic here in my own experience why i may say yes for example no very long while ago a singular circumstance occurred in this very house the soothing system you know was then in operation and the patients were at large they behaved remarkably well especially so any one of sense might have known that some devilish scheme was brewing from that particular fact that the fellows behaved so remarkably well and sure enough one fine morning the keepers found themselves pinioned hand and foot and thrown into the cells where they were attended as if they were the lunatics by the lunatics themselves who had usurped the offices of the keepers you dont tell me so i never heard of any thing so absurd in my life fact it all came to pass by means of a stupid fellow a lunatic who by some means had taken it into his head that he had invented a better system of government than any ever heard of before of lunatic government i mean he wished to give his invention a trial i suppose and so he persuaded the rest of the patients to join him in a conspiracy for the overthrow of the reigning powers and he really succeeded no doubt of it the keepers and kept were soon made to exchange places not that exactly either for the madmen had been free but the keepers were shut up in cells forthwith and treated i am sorry to say in a very cavalier manner but i presume a counterrevolution was soon effected this condition of things could not have long existed the country people in the neighborhoodvisitors coming to see the establishment would have given the alarm there you are out the head rebel was too cunning for that he admitted no visitors at all with the exception one day of a very stupidlooking young gentleman of whom he had no reason to be afraid he let him in to see the place just by way of variety to have a little fun with him as soon as he had gammoned him sufficiently he let him out and sent him about his business and how long then did the madmen reign oh a very long time indeed a month certainly how much longer i cant precisely say in the meantime the lunatics had a jolly season of it that you may swear they doffed their own shabby clothes and made free with the family wardrobe and jewels the cellars of the chateau were well stocked with wine and these madmen are just the devils that know how to drink it they lived well i can tell you and the treatment what was the particular species of treatment which the leader of the rebels put into operation why as for that a madman is not necessarily a fool as i have already observed and it is my honest opinion that his treatment was a much better treatment than that which it superseded it was a very capital system indeed simple neat no trouble at all in fact it was delicious it was here my hosts observations were cut short by another series of yells of the same character as those which had previously disconcerted us this time however they seemed to proceed from persons rapidly approaching gracious heavens i ejaculated the lunatics have most undoubtedly broken loose i very much fear it is so replied monsieur maillard now becoming excessively pale he had scarcely finished the sentence before loud shouts and imprecations were heard beneath the windows and immediately afterward it became evident that some persons outside were endeavoring to gain entrance into the room the door was beaten with what appeared to be a sledgehammer and the shutters were wrenched and shaken with prodigious violence a scene of the most terrible confusion ensued monsieur maillard to my excessive astonishment threw himself under the sideboard i had expected more resolution at his hands the members of the orchestra who for the last fifteen minutes had been seemingly too much intoxicated to do duty now sprang all at once to their feet and to their instruments and scrambling upon their table broke out with one accord into yankee doodle which they performed if not exactly in tune at least with an energy superhuman during the whole of the uproar meantime upon the main diningtable among the bottles and glasses leaped the gentleman who with such difficulty had been restrained from leaping there before as soon as he fairly settled himself he commenced an oration which no doubt was a very capital one if it could only have been heard at the same moment the man with the teetotum predilection set himself to spinning around the apartment with immense energy and with arms outstretched at right angles with his body so that he had all the air of a teetotum in fact and knocked everybody down that happened to get in his way and now too hearing an incredible popping and fizzing of champagne i discovered at length that it proceeded from the person who performed the bottle of that delicate drink during dinner and then again the frogman croaked away as if the salvation of his soul depended upon every note that he uttered and in the midst of all this the continuous braying of a donkey arose over all as for my old friend madame joyeuse i really could have wept for the poor lady she appeared so terribly perplexed all she did however was to stand up in a corner by the fireplace and sing out incessantly at the top of her voice cockadoodlededooooooh and now came the climax the catastrophe of the drama as no resistance beyond whooping and yelling and cockadoodling was offered to the encroachments of the party without the ten windows were very speedily and almost simultaneously broken in but i shall never forget the emotions of wonder and horror with which i gazed when leaping through these windows and down among us pelemele fighting stamping scratching and howling there rushed a perfect army of what i took to be chimpanzees ourangoutangs or big black baboons of the cape of good hope i received a terrible beating after which i rolled under a sofa and lay still after lying there some fifteen minutes during which time i listened with all my ears to what was going on in the room i came to same satisfactory denouement of this tragedy monsieur maillard it appeared in giving me the account of the lunatic who had excited his fellows to rebellion had been merely relating his own exploits this gentleman had indeed some two or three years before been the superintendent of the establishment but grew crazy himself and so became a patient this fact was unknown to the travelling companion who introduced me the keepers ten in number having been suddenly overpowered were first well tarred then carefully feathered and then shut up in underground cells they had been so imprisoned for more than a month during which period monsieur maillard had generously allowed them not only the tar and feathers which constituted his system but some bread and abundance of water the latter was pumped on them daily at length one escaping through a sewer gave freedom to all the rest the soothing system with important modifications has been resumed at the chateau yet i cannot help agreeing with monsieur maillard that his own treatment was a very capital one of its kind as he justly observed it was simple neat and gave no trouble at all not the least i have only to add that although i have searched every library in europe for the works of doctor tarr and professor fether i have up to the present day utterly failed in my endeavors at procuring an edition
