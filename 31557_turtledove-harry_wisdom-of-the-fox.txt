a gnawed bone to his trencher duin the bold slammed his tankard down on the long table ale slopped over the rim fool is it he shouted his fair face reddening youre the fool you thickskulled muckbrain drago stormed up with an oath murder in his eyes his thick arms groped toward duin the slimmer man skipped back his hand flashed to his swordhilt cries of anger and alarm rang through castle foxs great hall gerin the fox baron of fox keep sprang to his feet stop it he shouted the shout froze both angry men for a moment giving their benchmates a chance to crowd between them drago sent one man flying with a shrug of his massive shoulders but was brought up short by a grip not even his massive thews could break van of the strong arm grinned down at him almost a foot taller than the squat bear the outlander was every bit as powerfully made gerin glowered at his fractious vassals disgust plain in every line of his lean body the men grew shamefaced under his glare nothing would have pleased him more than breaking both their stupid heads he lashed them with his voice instead snapping i called you here to fight the trokmoi not each other the woodsrunners will be a tough enough nut to crack without us squabbling among ourselves then let us fight them duin said but his blade was back in its scabbard this dyausdamned rain has cooped us up here for ten days now no wonder were quarreling like so many snapping turtles in a pot turn us loose lord gerin to that even drago rumbled agreement he was not alone the fox shook his head if we try to cross the river niffet in this weather either current or storm will surely swamp us when the sky clears we move not before privately gerin was more worried than his liegemen but he did not want them to see that since spring hed been sure the northern barbarians were planning to swarm south over the niffet and ravage his holding hed decided to strike first but this downpourworse than any he could remember in all his thirty years on the northern marches of the empire of elabonbalked his plans for ten days hed had no glimpse of sun moons or stars even the niffet a scant half mile away was hard to spy rumor also said the trokmoi had a new wizard of great power more than once the baron had seen fell lights dancing deep within the northern forests his eversuspicious mind found it all too easy to blame the trokme mage for the rude weather duin started to protest further then he saw the scar over gerins right eye go pale a sure danger signal the words stayed bottled in his throat he made sheepish apologies to drago who frowned but under gerins implacable gaze nodded and clasped his hand as calm descended the baron took a long pull at his own ale it was late he was tired but he was not eager for bed his chamber was on the second floor and the roof leaked siglorel shelofas son when sober the best elabonian wizard north of the high kirs had set a fiveyear calking spell on it only the summer before but the old sot must have had a bad day water trickled through the roofing and collected in cold puddles on the upper storys floor spread rushes did little to soak it up gerin plucked at his neat black beard he wished for carpets like those he had known in his younger days south of the mountains study was all hed lived for then and the barony the furthest thing from his mind he remembered the fiasco that had resulted when exasperation drove him to try the book of spells hed brought north from the capital history and natural lore had always interested him more than magecraft his studies at the sorcerers collegium began late and worse were cut short after fewer than a hundred days a trokme ambush took both his father and elder brother leaving him the unexpected master of fox keep in the eight years since hed had little cause to try wizardry his skill was not large nor did age improve it his incantation raised nothing but a cloud of stinking black smoke and his vassals hackles on the whole he counted himself lucky amateur wizards who played with forces stronger than they could control often met unpleasant ends a snatch of drunken song made him look up duin and drago sat with their arms round each others shoulders boasting of the havoc they would wreak among the trokmoi when the cursed weather finally cleared the baron was relieved they were two of his stoutest fighting men he drained his mug and rose to receive the salutes of his vassals head buzzing slightly he climbed the sootgrimed oak stairway to his bedchamber his last waking thought was a prayer to dyaus for fair weather so he could add another chapter to the vengeance he was taking on the barbarians a horn cried danger from the watchtower tumbling him from his bed with the least ceremony imaginable he cursed the bronzen clangor as he stumbled to a window if that overeager lackwit up there is tootling for his amusement ill have his ears he muttered to himself but the scar over his eyes throbbed and his fingers were nervous in his beard if the trokmoi had found a way to cross the niffet in the rain no telling how much damage they might do the window was only a northfacing slit intended more for shooting arrows than sight the little gerin saw was enough jabbing forks of lightning revealed hand after hand of trokmoi all searching for something to carry off or failing that to burn the wind blew snatches of their lilting speech to his ears may the gods fry you aingus you tricky bastard and your pet wizard too gerin growled he wondered how the trokme chieftain had got so many men across the river so fast then he raised his eyes further and saw the bridge bulking impossibly huge over the niffet it had to be sorcerous a silvery band of light leading from the northern woods into gerins holding it had not been there when the baron went to his rest as he watched trokme nobles poured over it in their chariots retainers loping beside them once long ago gerin thought he had read something of such spans he could not recall where or when but the halfmemory sent a pang of fear icing up his spine no time for such worries now he hurled himself into trousers and hobnailed sandals buckled on his sword and rushed down dimlit passageway and creaking stair to the great hall where his vassals had hung their corselets when they arrived that hall was a swearing jumble of men donning bronzefaced leather cuirasses and kilts strapping on greaves jamming potshaped helms onto their heads and fouling each other as they waved spears in the air like gerin most had skin that took the sun well and dark hair and eyes but a few freckled faces and light beards told of northern bloodduin for one was fair as any trokme ho captain van of the strong arm boomed thought youd never get here even in the rowdy crew gerin led van stood out taller than the foxs six feet by as many inches he was broad enough not to look his height a swordcut creased his nose and disappeared into the suncolored mat of beard covering most of his face little hellish lights flickered in his blue eyes his gear was as remarkable as his person for his backandbreast was cast of two solid pieces of bronze not even the emperor had a finer one unlike the businesslike helms his comrades wore vans was a fantastic affair with a scarlet horsehair plume nodding above his head and leather cheekpieces to protect his face looking more wargod than man he shook a spear like a young tree if his tale was true hed been trying to cross the trokme forests from north to south and had all but done it till he fell foul of aingus clan but hed escaped them too and had enough left in his giant frame to swim the niffet towing his precious armor behind him on a makeshift raft his strength bluff good humor and wideranging stories told in the forest tongue until he learned elabonian had won him a home at fox keep for as long as he wanted to stay but when gerin asked him his homeland he politely declined to answer the fox did not ask twice if van did not want to talk it was his affair that had been only two years ago gerin thought with a twinge of surprise he had trouble remembering what life had been like without his burly friend at his side the foxs own armor was of the plainest leather much patched plates battered and nicked the leather was firm and supple though and every plate sound to gerins way of thinking the figure he cut was less important than staying alive himself and putting a quick end to his foes the warriors wallowed through thick mud to the stables it squelched underfoot trying to suck their sandals and boots into its cold slimy mouth the chaos was worse inside the stables as boys tried to hitch unwilling horses to their masters chariots gerin strung his bow and stowed in on the right side of his car next to his quiver on the left went an axe like many of the foxs vassals van affected to despise the bow as an unmanly weapon he bore sword dagger and a wickedly spiked mace on his belt his shield and the foxs yardwide discs of bronzefaced wood and leather topped the cars low sidewalls when put in their brackets gerins was deliberately dull vans burnished bright despite their contrasting styles the two formed one of the most feared teams on the border gerins driver a gangling youth named raffo leaped into the chariot a sixfoot shield of heavy leather was slung on a baldric over his left shoulder it gave gerin cover from which to shoot taking up the reins raffo skillfully picked his way through the confusion after what seemed far too much time to the fox his men gathered in loose formation just behind the gatehouse shrieks from beyond the keep told plain as need be that the trokmoi were plundering his serfs archers on the palisade kept up a sputtering duel with the barbarians targets limited to those the lightning showed at gerins shouted command the gatehouse crew flung wide the stronghinged gates and let the drawbridge thump down the chariots lumbered into action trailing mucky wakes vans bellowed oaths cut off in midword when he saw the bridge by my beard he grunted where did it come from magicked up without a doubt gerin wished he were as calm as he sounded no trokme hedgewizard could have called that spell into beingnor could the elegant and talented mages of the sorcerers guild down in the capital an arrow whizzing past his ear shattered his brief reverie trokmoi swarmed out of the peasant village to meet his men they had no mind to let their looting be stopped aingus they shouted and balamunga name the fox did not know the elabonians roared back gerin the fox the two bands met in bloody collision a northerner appeared at the left side of the foxs chariot sword in hand the rain plastered his long red hair and flowing mustaches against his head he wore no helm the reek of ale was thick about him reading his mind was easy van would have to twist his body to use his spear raffo had his hands full and gerin who had just shot could never get off another arrow before the trokmes blade pierced him feeling like a gambler playing with loaded dice the fox snatched up his axe with his left hand he drove it into the barbarians skull the trokme toppled a look of outraged surprise still on his face van exploded into laughter what a rare sneaky thing it must be to be lefthanded he said more barbarians were hustling stolen cattle pigs sheep and serfs across the gleaming bridge to their homeland the villeins had no chance against the northern wolves huddled in their huts against the storm and the wandering ghosts of the night they were easy meat a few had tried to fight their crumpled bodies lay beside their homes sickle flail and scythe were no match for the sword spear bow and armor of the trokme nobles though their retainers were often little better armed than the peasants gerin almost felt pity as he drove an arrow into one of those retainers and watched him thrash his life away he knew the northerner would have had no second thoughts about gutting him a few trokmoi had managed to light torches despite the downpour they smoked and sputtered in the woodsrunners hands the rain though made the thatched roofs and wattle walls of the cottages all but impossible to light with a wave and a shout gerin sent half his chariots after the pillagers his own car was in the middle of the village when he shouted pull up raffo obediently slowed gerin slung his quiver over his shoulder he and van slid their shields onto their arms and leaped into the mire raffo wheeled the horses and made for the safety of fox keeps walls the chariotriders not chasing looters followed the fox to the ground panting footsoldiers rushed up to stiffen their line a trokme sprang on the barons back before he could find his footing in the mud his bow flew from his hand the two struggling men fell together the barbarians dagger sought gerins heart but was foiled by his cuirass he jabbed an elbow into the trokmes unarmored middle the fellow grunted and loosened his grasp both men scrambled to their feet gerin was quicker his foot lashed out in a roundhouse kick the spiked sole of his sandal ripped away half the trokmes face with a dreadful wail the marauder sprawled in the ooze his features a gory mask duin the bold thundered by on a horse though his legs were clenched round its barrel he still wobbled on the beasts bare back since a rider did not have both hands free to use a bow and could not deliver any sort of spearthrust without going over his horses tail gerin thought fighting from horseback a foolish notion but his fierce little vassal clung to the idea with the tenacity of a bearbaiting dog duin cut down one startled trokme with his sword when he slashed at another the northerner ducked under his stroke and gave him a hefty push he fell in the mud with a splash the horse fled the trokme was bending over his prostrate victim when an elabonian with a mace stove in his skull from behind van was in his element never happier than when on the field he howled a battle song in a language gerin did not know his spear drank the blood of one mustachioed barbarian pantherquick he brought its bronzeshod butt back to smash the teeth of another raider who thought to take him from behind a third trokme rushed at him with an axe the barbarians wild swipe went wide as did vans answering thrust the impulse of the blows left them breast to breast van dropped his spear and seized the barbarians neck with his huge fist he shook him once as a dog does a rat bones snapped the trokme went limp van flung him aside gerin did not share his comrades red joy in slaughter the main satisfaction he took from killing was the knowledge that the shuddering corpse at his feet was one enemy who would never trouble him again as far as he could he stood aloof from his fellow barons internecine quarrels he fought only when provoked and was fell enough to be provoked but seldom toward the trokmoi though he bore a cold bitter hatred at first it had been fueled by the slaying of his father and brother but now revenge was only a small part of it the woodsrunners lived only to destroy all too often his border holding tasted of that destruction as it shielded the softer more civilized southlands from the sudden bite of arrows and the baying of barbarians in the night almost without thinking he ducked under a flung stone another glanced from his helmet and filled his head with a brief shower of stars a spear grazed his thigh an arrow pierced his shield but was turned by his corselet his archers shot back filling the air with death spouting bodies disappeared in the mud to be trampled by friend and foe alike the trokmoi swarmed round gerins armored troopers like snarling wolves round bears but little by little they were driven back from the village toward their bridge their chieftains fought back making fierce charges across the foxs fertile wheatfields crushing his men beneath the flailing hooves of their woods ponies sending yardlong arrows through cuirasses into soft flesh and lopping off arms and heads with their great slashing swords at their fore was aingus he had led his clan for nearly as long as gerin had been alive but his splendid red mustachioes were unfrosted almost as tall as van if less wide through the shoulders he was proud in gilded armor and wheelcrested bronze helm golden fylfots and the ears of men he had slain adorned his chariot his right hand held a dripping sword his left the head of an elabonian who had tried to stand against him his long knobbycheekboned face split in a grin when he spied gerin its himself himself he roared come to be corbies meat like his father thinking to be a man before your ape of a friend are you laddie his elabonian was fluent enough though flavored by his own tongue van shouted back at him gerin silent set himself for the charge aingus swung up his sword his driver a gaunt blackrobed man the fox did not know whipped his beasts forward on came the chariot its horses hooves pounding like doom gerin was lifting his shield to beat back aingus first mighty stroke when vans spear flashed over his shoulder and took one of the onrushing ponies full in the chest with the awful scream only wounded horses make the shaggy pony reared and then fell it dragged its harnessmate down with it the chariot overturned and shattered sending one wheel flying and spilling both riders into the muck gerin ran forward to finish aingus the trokme lit rolling and rushed to meet him a fine thing will your skull be over my gate he shouted then their blades joined with a clash of sparks and there was no more time for words slashing and chopping aingus surged forward trying to overwhelm his smaller foe at the first onset gerin parried desperately had any of the trokmes cuts landed he would have been cut in two when aingus blade bit so deep into the edge of his shield that it stuck for a moment the fox seized the chance for a thrust of his own aingus knocked the questing point aside with a dagger in his left hand he had lost his bloody trophy when the chariot foundered the barbarian would not tire gerins sword was heavy in his hands his battered shield a lump of lead on his arm but aingus only grew stronger he was bleeding from a cut under his chin and another on his arm but his attack never slowed crash crash an overhand blow smashed the foxs shield to kindling the next ripped through his armor and drew a track of fire down his ribs he groaned and sank to one knee thinking him finished the trokme loomed over him eager to take his head but gerin was not yet done his sword shot up and out with all the force of his body behind it the point tore out aingus throat dark in the gloom his lifeblood fountained forth as he fell both hands clutching futilely at his neck the baron dragged himself to his feet van came up beside him there was a fresh cut on his forearm but his mace dripped blood and brains and his face was wreathed in smiles he brandished the gory weapon and shouted come on captain weve broken them is it to go through me youre thinking gerins head jerked up the trokme voice seemed to have come from beside him but the only northerner within fifty yards was aingus scrawny driver he wore no armor under his sodden robes and carried no weapon but he strode forward with the confidence of a demigod stand aside fool gerin said i have no stomach for killing an unarmed man then have not a care in the world southron darling for ill be the death of you and not the other way round at all lightning cracked giving gerin a glimpse of the northerners pale skin stretched drumhead tight over skull and jaw like a cats the fellow s eyes gave back the light in a green flash he raised his arms and began to chant an invocation poured forth sonorous and guttural gerins blood froze in his veins as he recognized the magicsteeped speech of the dreaming river valleys of ancient kizzuwatna he knew that tongue and knew it did not belong in the mouth of a swaggering woodsrunner the trokme dropped his hands screaming ethrog o luhuzantiyas a horror from the hells of the haunted east appeared before him its legs torso and head were human the face even grimly handsome swarthy hooknosed and proud beard falling in curling ringlets over broad chest but its arms were the snapping chelae of a monster scorpion a scorpions jointed tail grew from the base of its spine sting gleaming at the tip with a bellow that should have come from the throat of a bull the demon luhuzantiyas sprang at gerin and van it was a nightmare fight quicker on its feet than any human the demon used its tail like a living spear the sting flashed past gerin s face so close that he caught the acrid reek of its poison it scored a glittering line across vans corselet those terrible claws chewed the outlanders shield to bits only a backward leap saved his arm he and gerin landed blow after blow but the demon would not go down though dark ichor pumped from a score of wounds and one claw was sheared away not until van with a strength born of loathing smashed its skull and face to bloody pulp with frenzied strokes of his mace did it fall even then it writhed and thrashed in the mire still seeking its foes gerin drew in a long shuddering breath now wizard he grated join your devil in the fiery pit that spawned it the trokme had put twenty or so paces between himself and the fox his laughan unclean chuckle that scraped across gerins nervesmade plain his lack of fear its a strong man you are lord gerin the foxthe contempt he packed into that stungand this day is yours but well meet again aye indeed we will my name lord gerin is balamung mark it well for youve heard it twice the now and hear it again you will twice gerin only whispered it but balamung heard not even remembering are you well twas three years gone by i came south having it in mind to take up sorcery you made me sleep in the stables with the reeking horses and all for some fatgut from the south and his party of pimps filled the keep all to bursting you said when the next time comes for me to sleep at fox keepand twill be sooni shant bed in the stables so south i fared stinking of horsedung and in elabon the town only their hinder parts did the sorcerers collegium show me they called me savage and that to my face mind after you its them to pay their price for you see quit i didna i wandered through desert and mountain and learned from warlocks and grizzled hermits and squinting scribes who cared nought about a rentices accent so long as he did their bidding and in a cave lost in the snows of the high kirs far above one of the passes the empire blocked i found what i had learned to seek the book of shabethshiri the sorcererking of kizzuwatna long ago himself had died there when i took the book from his dead fingers he turned to a puff of smoke and blew away and today the book is mine and tomorrow the northlandsand after that the world is none too big you lie gerin said all you will own is a nameless grave with no one to comfort your shade balamung laughed again now his eyes flamed red with a fire of their own wrong you are for the stars tell me no grave will ever hold me they tell me more too for they show me the gates of your precious keep all beat to flinders and that inside two turns of the bloody second moon you lie gerin growled again he ran forward ignoring the pain that lanced up from his wound balamung stood watching him hands on hips the fox lifted his blade balamung was unmoving even when it came hissing down to cleave him from crown to breastbone the stroke met empty airlike the light of a candle suddenly snuffed the wizard was gone gerin staggered and almost fell balamungs derisive laugh rang in his ears for a long moment then it too faded father dyaus above the shaken fox said again van muttered an oath in an unknown tongue well captain he said theres your warlock gerin did not argue the trokmoi seemed to lose their nerve when the sorcerer disappeared faster and faster they streamed over balamungs bridge their feet silent on its misty surface only a snarling rearguard held gerins men at bay those warriors slipped away to safety one by one with deepthroated roars of triumph the elabonians swarmed after them like a phantasm compounded of coils of smoke the bridge vanished soldiers screamed as they plunged into the foaming niffet the bronze they wore for safety dragging them to a watery doom on the shore men doffed armor with frantic haste and splashed into the water to save their comrades jeering trokmoi on the northern bank shot at victims and rescuers alike it took two men to save duin impetuous as always he had been farthest along the bridge when it evaporated and he could not swim somehow he managed to stay afloat until the first rescuer reached him but his grip was so desperate that he and his wouldbe savior both would have drowned had another swimmer not been nearby a few others were also hauled out but balamungs trap took more than a dozen a plashing downstream made gerin whirl matteroffact as a river godlet drago the bear came out of the water wringing his long beard like a peasant wench with her mans breeches incredibly armor still gleamed on his breast if anyone could survive such a dip thought gerin it would be drago he was strong as an ox and lacked the imagination to let anything frighten him nasty he rumbled in a voice like falling trees he might have been talking about the weather aye an abstracted gerin muttered at the instant the bridge had melted away the rain stopped pale dim nothos nearing full gleamed in a suddenly starflecked sky while ruddy elleb now waning toward third quarter was just beginning to wester the other two moons golden math and quickmoving tiwaz were both near new and hence invisible hustling along a doubled handful of disheveled prisoners most of them wounded the weary army trudged back to the keep gerins serfs met them at the village they shouted thanks for having their crops or most of them saved their dialect was so rustic that even gerin who had heard it since birth found it hard to follow gerin ordered ten oxen slaughtered laying the fatwrapped thighbones on the altars of dyaus and the wargod deinos which stood in his great hall the rest of the meat vanished into his men to wash it down barrel after barrel of smooth foaming ale and sweet mead was broached and emptied men who found combat raising a different urge pursued peasant wenches and servant wenches many of whom preferred being chased to chaste at first the baron did not join the merrymaking he applied an ointment of honey lard and astringent herbs to his wound luckily not deep and winced at its bite then he had the brightestlooking captive a tall mournful blond barbarian who kept his left hand clutched to a torn right shoulder bandaged and brought into a storeroom while two troopers stood by with drawn swords gerin cleaned his nails with a dagger from his belt he said nothing the silence bothered the trokme who fidgeted what is it you want of me he burst out at last its cliath son of ailech i am of a house noble for more generations than i have toes and fingers and no right at all do you have to treat me like some low footpad what right have you gerin asked mildly to rob and burn my land and kill my men i could flay the hide off your carcass in inchwide strips and give it to my dogs to eat while what was left of you watched and no one could say i did not have the right thank your gods wolfar did not catch you he would do it but tell me what i need to know and i will set you free otherwisehis eyes flicked to the two hard men by himill walk out this door and ask no questions after one of cliaths eyes was swollen shut the other peered at the fox what would keep you from doing that anyway once ive talked gerin shrugged ive held this keep almost eight years men on both side of the niffet know what my word is worth and on this you have that word youll get no second chance cliath studied him the trokme made as if to rub his chin but grimaced in pain and stopped he sighed what would you know of me then tell me this what do you know of the blackrobed warlock who calls himself balamung och that kern till this raid its little ive had to do with him and wanted less its bad cess for any man to have truck with a wizard say i for all he brings loot no glory in beating ensorceled foes is there no more than in cutting the throat of a pig and it tied too but those who go with balamung grow fat and the few as stand against him die and in ways less pretty than having the skins of them flayed off i mind me of one fellowpuir wightwho no slower than a sneeze was naught but a pile of twisty slimy wormsand the stench of him nigh on a year and a half it is since the wizard omadhaun came to us and for all were friends now with bricrius clan and thieving meriaseks still i long for the days when a man could take a head without asking the leave of a driedup little turd like balamung him and his dogfuttering talisman the trokme spat on the hardpacked dirt floor talisman gerin prompted aye with my own eyes ive seen it tis squarish perhaps as long as my forearm and as wide but not near so thick you understand and opening out to double that and when hed fain bewitch someone or magic up something why the talisman lights up almost like a torch with my own eyes ive seen it cliath repeated can you read the baron asked no nor write no more than i can fly why in the name of the gods would you care to know that never mind gerin said i know enough now more than i want he added to himself bricrius clan and meriaseks had been at feud since the days of their grandfathers the fox tossed his little knife to the barbarian who tucked it into the top of one of his high rawhide boots gerin led him through the main hall ignoring his vassals stares he told his startled gatekeepers to let cliath out and said to him how you cross the river is your affair but with that blade perhaps you wont be waylaid by my serfs good eye shining cliath held out his left hand a puir clasp but im proud to make it och what a clansmate youd have been gerin took the offered hand but shook his head no id sooner live on my own land than take away my neighbors now go before i think about the trouble im giving myself by turning you loose as the northerner trotted down the low hill gerin was already on his way back to the rollicking great hall a frown on his face truly deinos was coursing his terrible warhounds through the northern forests and the baron was the game they sought after he had downed five or six tankards though things looked rosier he staggered up the stairs to his room arm round the waist of one of his serving wenches but even as he cupped her soft breasts later part of his mind saw castle fox a smoking ruin and fire and death all along the border ii he woke some time past noon by the racket coming from below the roistering had never ceased probably no one was on the walls either he thought disgustedly could balamung have roused his men to a second attack he would have had fox keep in the palm of his hand the girl was already gone gerin dressed and went down to the great hall looking for half a dozen of his leading liegemen he found van and rollan the boarslayer still rehashing the battle drawing lines on the table in sticky mead fandor the fat had a beaker of mead too but he was drinking from it that was his usual sport his red nose and awesome capacity testified to it drago was asleep on the floor his body swathed in furs beside him snored simrin widins son duin was nowhere to be found the fox woke simrin and drago and bullied his lieutenants up the stairs to the library grumbling they found seats round the central table they stared suspiciously at the shelves full of neatly pigeonholed scrolls and codices bound in leather and gold leaf most of them were as illiterate as cliath and held reading an affectation but gerin was a good enough man of his hands to let them overlook his eccentricity still the books and the quiet overawed them a bit the baron would need that today he scratched his bearded chin and remembered how horrified everyone had been when after his father was killed hed come back from the southlands cleanshaven duins father dour old borbeto the grim had managed the barony till his return when he saw gerin hed roared is durens son a fancyboy gerin had only grinned and answered ask your daughter shouts of laughter won his vassals to him duin wandered in still fumbling at his breeches bawdy chuckles greeted him fandor called easier to stay on a lass than a horse is it it is and more fun besides duin grinned plainly none the worse for his dunking he turned to gerin sketched a salute whats on your mind lord among other things gerin said drily the bridge that was almost your end downright uncanny i call it rollan murmured he spoke thickly for his slashed lip had three stitches holding it shut tall solid and dark he ran his fief with some skill fought bravely and never let a new thought trouble his mind me i have no truck with wizards drago said righteously he sneezed damn ive taken cold he went on theres no way to trust a body like that noses always in a scroll think theyre better than simple folk remember where you are fool simrin widins son hissed no offense meant of course lord drago said hastily of course gerin sighed now let me tell you what i learned last night the faces of his men grew grave as the tale unfolded and there was a silence when he was through duin broke it along with his auburn hair his fiery temper told of trokme blood now he thumped a fist down on the table and shouted a pox on wizardry theres but one thing to do about it we have to hit the whoreson before he can hit us again this time with all the northmen not just aingus clan a mutter of agreement ran down the table gerin shook his head this was what he had to head off at all costs theres nothing id like better he lied but it wont do on his home ground their mage would squash us like so many bugs but from what the braggart said we have some time what id fain do is go south to the capital and hire a warlock from the sorcerers collegium there so we can fight magic with magic i dont relish leaving fox keep under the axe but the task is mine for i still have connections in the southlands we can settle balamung properly once im back it strikes me as a fools errand lord duin said plainspoken as always what we need is a good hard stroke now duin if you want to beard that wizard without one at your back then youre the fool if you had to take a keep with a stonethrower over its gate youd find a stonethrower of your own wouldnt you i suppose so duin said his tone was surly but there were nods round the table gerin was relieved he was coming to the tricky part with a little luck he could slip it by them before they noticed stout fellow he said and went on easily van will need your help here while im gone with him in charge nothing can go too badly wrong it didnt work even fandor and simrin both of whom had kept those noses buried in their drinking jacks till now jerked up their heads diffidently rollan began begging your pardon my lord and gerin braced for insubordination it came fast enough the gods know van of the strong arm has proven himself a man time and again and a loyal and true vassal as well but for all that he is an outlander and owns no land hereabouts guesting with you as he does itd be downright unseemly for us whose families have held our fiefs for generations to take orders from him gerin gathered himself for an explosion before he loosed it he saw all the barons nodding their agreement he caught vans eyes the outlander shrugged tasting gall the fox yielded with as much grace as he could if thats how you would have it so be it van would it please you to ride with me then it would that captain van said coming as close as he ever did to gerins proper feudal title ive never been south of the kirs and ive heard enough about elabons capital to make me want to see it fine gerin said duin you have the highest standing of any here do you think you can keep things afloat while im away aye or die trying gerin feared the latter but merely said good and whispered a prayer under his breath duin was more than doughty enough and not stupid but he lacked common sense drago and rollan decided to stay at fox keep themselves and leave the defense of their own castles to the vassal contingents they would send home gerin dared hope they might restrain duin after his other liegemen had gone he spent a couple of hours giving duin instructions on matters probable matters possible and as many matters impossible as his fertile mind could envision he finished for dyaus sake send word along the west march road and the emperors highway the border barons must know of this so they can ready themselves for the storm even wolfar as his holding borders mine news has to go through him anyway but the slug happens to be out acourting and his man schild though he has no love for me wont kill a messenger for the sport of it also you could do worse than to get siglorel here he has the most power of any elabonian wizard north of the kirs even if he is overfond of ale last i heard he was in the keep of hovan son of hagop east of here trying to cure hovans piles duin nodded hopefully in wisdom he surprised gerin by offering a suggestion of his own if youre bound to go through with this wizard scheme lord why not go to ikos and ask the sibyl for her advice you know thats not a bad thought gerin mused ive been that way once before and it will only cost me an extra day or so next day he decidednot for the first timethat mixing ale and mead was a poor idea the cool crisp early morning air settled in his lungs like sludge his side was stiff and sore his head ached the creaks and groans of the light wagon and steady pound of hooves on stone roadbed sounds he usually failed to notice rang loud in his ears the sun seemed to have singled him out for all its rays worst of all van was awake and in full song holding his throbbing head gerin asked dont you know any quiet tunes aye several of em van answered and returned to his interrupted ditty gerin contemplated death and other delights at last the song came to an end i thank you he said nothing at all captain van frowned then went on i think yesterday i was too hellishly worn out to pay as much attention to what you were saying as i should why is it such a fell thing for balamung to have got his claws on shabethshiris book the fox was glad to talk if only to dull the edge of his own worry shabethshiri was the greatest sorcerer of kizzuwatna long ago the land where all wizardry began and where it flourishes to this day they say he was the first to uncover the laws behind their magic and set them down in writing to teach his pupils now that cant be the book balamung was boasting of can it no i have a copy of that one myself as a matter of fact so does everyone whos ever dabbled in magic its not a book of spells but of the principles by which theyre cast but using those principles shabethshiri worked more powerful warlockery than any this poor shuddering world has seen since he made himself king as well as mage and he fought so many wars he ran short of men or so the story goes so he kept his rule alive by raising demons to fight for him and by many other such cantrips think how embarrassed an army that thought itself safe behind a stream would be to have it flood and drown their camp or turn to bloodor to see shabethshiris men charging over a bridge like the one balamung used against us embarrassed is scarcely the word captain i suppose not shabethshiri wrote down all his most frightful spells too but in a book he showed to no one he meant it for his son they say but for all his wizardry he was beaten at last all the other mages and marshals of kizzuwatna combined against him lest he rule the whole world his son was killed in the sack of his last citadel shaushka shaushka the damned that was his ive seen it with my own eyes it lies in the far north of kizzuwatna at the edge of the plains of shanda and the plainsmen showed it to me from far away stark dark and dead nothing grows there to this day even afterhow many years gerin shuddered two thousand if a day but the winners never found shabethshiris body or his book either and sorcerers have searched for it from that day to this the legends say some of its pages are of human skin it glows with a light of its own when its master uses it the baron shook his head cliath saw it sure as sure a nice fellow this shabethshiri and i think hed be proud of the one who has his book now it seems all kizzuwatnans have a taste for blood though van said once when i was traveling with the nomads gerin never found out about the kizzuwatnan van had fallen foul of for at that moment two hurtling bodies burst from the oaks that grew almost to within bowshot of the road one was a stag proud head now low as it fled but it had not taken more than three bounds when a tawny avalanche struck it from behind and smashed it to the grass great stabbing fangs tore into its throat once twice blood spurted and slowed the stags hooves drummed and were still crouched over its kill the longtooth snarled a warning at the travelers it settled its short hind legs under its belly and began to feed its stumpy tail quivered in absurd delight as it tore hunks of flesh from the stags carcass when the men stopped to watch it growled deep in its throat and dragged its prey into the cover of the woods van was all for flushing it out again but gerin demurred like rogue aurochs longtooths were best hunted by parties larger than two rather grumpily van put away his spear sometimes gerin he said you take all the fun out of life the fox did not answer his gloomy mood slowly cleared as the sun rose higher in the sky he looked about with more than a little pride for the lands he ruled were rich ones and he thought the wealth they made stayed on them the lands between the kirs and the niffet had drawn the empire of elabon for their copper and tin and as a buffer between its heartland and the northern savages once seized though they were left largely to their own devices not a measure of grain nor a pound of tin did elabon take from gerins land or from any other borderer lords the marchwarden of the north carus beos son kept his toy garrison in cassat under the shadow of the kirs so long as the borderers held the trokmoi at bay the empire let them have their freedom traffic on the great road was light so near the niffet the only traveler gerin and van met the first day was a wandering merchant a thin doleful man he nodded gravely as he headed north a calico cat with mismatched eyes and only one ear sat on his shoulder it glared at gerin as they passed when night began to near the baron brought a brace of fowls from a farmer who dwelt by the road van shook his head as he watched his friend haggle with the peasant why not just take what you need like any lord he asked the kern is your subject after all true but hes not my slave a baron who treats his serfs like beasts of burden will see his castle come down round his ears the first time his crops fail serve him right too the fool after they stopped for the evening gerin wrung a hens neck and drained its blood into a trough he dug in the rich black soil that should satisfy any roving spirits he said plucking and gutting the bird and skewering it to roast over the campfire any that wouldnt sooner drink our blood instead van said captain out on the plains of shanda the ghosts have real fangs and they arent shy of watchfires only the charms the nomads shamans magic up can keep them at bayand sometimes not those either if most of the moons are dark a bad place gerin believed him any land that made his hardbitten comrade leery sounded like a good place to avoid they drew straws for the first watch within seconds van was curled in his bedroll and snoring like a thunderstorm gerin watched tiwaz and math both thin crescents almost lost in the skirts of twilight follow the sun down to the horizon as they sank full nothos rose under his weak grayish light field and forest alike were halfseen mysteries small nightcreatures chirped and hummed gerin let the fire die into embers and the ghosts came as always the eye refused to grasp their shapes sliding away before they could be recognized they swarmed round the pool of blood like great carrion flies their buzzing filled gerins mind some shouted in tongues so ancient their very names were lost others he almost understood but no true words could be heard only clamor and loss and wailing the fox knew that if he tried to grasp one of the flittering shapes it would slip through his fingers like so much mist for the dead kept but a pallid semblance of life grateful for the boon of blood they tried to give him such redes as they thought good but only a noise like the rushing wind filled his head had he not granted them that gift or had the fire not been there they likely would have driven him mad he kept watch until midnight staring at stars and full nothos and the halfseen shapes of spirits until elleb a copper disc almost half chewed away was well clear of the dark woods on the horizon no man disturbed him few travelers were so bold as to risk moving in the dark of the sun when gerin roused van he woke with the instant awareness of a seasoned warrior the ghosts are bad tonight the baron mumbled and then he was asleep van announced the dawn with a whoop that jerked the fox awake trying to pry his eyes open he said i feel as if my head were filled with sand early in the morning says the same thing twice an hour this side of midday is counted as morning is it not aye it is and too bloody early in the bargain oh for the days when i was in the capital and not one of the wise men i listened to thought of opening his mouth before noon gerin gnawed leathery journeybread dried fruit and smoked sausage washing them down with bitter beer he had to choke the bread down the stuff had the virtue of keeping nearly forever and he understood why the bugs liked it no better than he he sighed stretched and climbed into his armor wincing as his helm slipped down over one ear bent permanently outward by a northerners club in a longago skirmish the birds are shining the sun is chirping and who am i to complain he said van gave him a curious glance you feeling all right captain he asked a note of real concern in his voice yes and no gerin said thoughtfully but for the first time since i came back from the southlands it doesnt matter at all things are out of my hands and they will be for a while now if someone pisses in the souppot why duin will just have to try and take care of it without me its a funny feeling you know im half glad to be free and half afraid things will fall apart without me it s like running a long way and then stopping short ive got used to the strain and feel wrong without it they moved south steadily but not in silence van extracted a clay flute from his kit and made the morning hideous with it gerin politely asked if hed been taking music lessons from the ghosts but he shrugged a massive shrug and kept on tweedling a pair of guardhouses flanked the road where it crossed from gerins lands to those of palin the eagle two sets of troopers sprawled in the roadway dicing the day away at the creak of the wagon they abandoned the game and reached for their weapons gerin looked down his long nose at the wary archers hail he said would that youd been so watchful last summer when you let wacho and his brigands sneak south without so much as a challenge the guard captain shuffled his feet lord how was i to know hed forged his safeconduct by the hand of it and the spelling the lout could barely write too late now but if it happens again youll find a new lord probably in the underworld do we pass your inspection you do that lord the guard waved the wagon on gerin drew sword as he passed the ancient boundary stone separating his holding from palins palins guardsmen returned his salute for long generations the two houses had been at peace the stone its timeworn runes covered by graygreen moss had sunk almost half its height into the soft earth once past the guards van turned and said to gerin you know fox when i first came to your land i thought palin the eagle had to be some fine warrior to judge by what his folk called him how was i to know they were talking of his nose hes no carlun come again i will say gerin chuckled but he and his vassals keep order well enough that i dont fear a night or so in the open in his lands or perhaps with one of his lordlets you dont want himself to guest you no indeed he has an unmarried sister who must be rising forty by now and desperate poor lass worse she cooks for him too and badly the last time i ate with palin i thought the bellysickness had me not just a sour stomach when the travelers did stop for the night it was at the ramshackle keep of one of palins vassals raff the ready a blocky boulder of a man he was very much of the old school wearing a forked beard that almost reached his waist his unflappable solidity reminded the fox of drago so less hearteningly did his disdain for cleanliness withal he set a good table he had killed a cow that day and along with the beef there was a stew of frogs and mussels from a nearby pond freshbaked bread blueberries and blueberry tarts and a fine nutlike ale with which to wash them down gerin sighed in contentment loosened his belt belched and then reluctantly gave raff his news his host looked uneasy he promised to spread the word you think your men wont be able to hold them at the niffet then he asked im very much afraid they wont well ill tell my neighbors not that itll do much good all of us are looking south not north waiting for the trouble in bevons barony to spill over into ours theres fighting there van asked hopefully aye there is that all four of bevons sons are brawling over the succession and him not even dead yet one of them ran twenty sheep off palins land too the son of a whore with that warning they left early almost before dawn they carried a torch to keep the ghosts at bay even so gerins skin crawled with dread until the spirits fled the rays of the sun he spent a nervous morning hurrying south through bevons strifetorn barony every one of bevons vassals kept his castle shut tight the men on the walls gave gerin and van hard stares but no one tried to stop them around noon they heard fighting down an approaching side road van looked interested but gerin cared far more about reaching the capital than getting drawn into an imbroglio not his own the choice did not stay in his hands two spearmen and an archer plainly fleeing burst onto the highway the archer took one quick glance at gerin and van shouted more traitors and let fly his shaft sailed between them perhaps because he could not pick either one as target he got no second shot gerin had been sitting with bow ready to hand and no confusion spoiled his aim but even as the archer fell his comrades charged the wagon gerin and van sprang down to meet them the fight was short but savage the footsoldiers seemed to have already despaired of their lives and thought only of killing before they fell cool as usual in a fight the fox ducked under his foes guard and slid the point of his blade between the luckless fellows ribs the man coughed blood and died the baron wheeled to help van but his friend needed no aid a stroke of his axe had shattered his mans spearshaft another clove through helm and skull alike only a tiny cut above his knee showed he had fought at all he rubbed at it grumbling bastard pinked me i must be getting old the triumph left the taste of ashes in gerins mouth what fools the men of elabon were to be fighting among themselves while a storm to sweep them all away was rising in the northern forests and now he was as guilty as any warriors who might have been bold against the trokmoi were stiffening corpses in the roadwaybecause of him where youre going makes you more important than them van said when he voiced that worry aloud i hope so but in his heart gerin wondered if the southern wizards could withstand balamung and the book of shabethshiri he sighed with relief when at last he spied the guardhouse of bevons southern neighbor ricolf the red he was not surprised to see it had a double complement of men the baron returned the greetings ricolfs guardsmen gave him he knew a few of them for he had spent several pleasant weeks at ricolf s keep on his last journey to the southlands its been too long lord gerin one of the guards said ricolf will be glad to see you and i him he was like a second father to me peace be with you wayfarers ricolfs man called as they drove past and to you also peace van made the proper response for he held the reins he had been quick to pick up the customs of gerins land the sun was dying in the west and gerin felt the first low keenings of longdead wraiths when ricolfs castle came into view crowned by a scarlet banner somewhere high overhead an eagle screamed vans sharp eyes searched the sky till he found the moving speck on our right he said theres a good omen if you care for one i mislike taking omens from birds gerin said theyre too public whos to say a foretelling is meant for him and not some lout in the next holding who has to squint to see it a boys clear voice floated from ricolfs watchtower who comes to the holding of ricolf the red i am gerin called the fox guestfriend to your master ricolf and with me is my friend and companion van of the strong arm by dyaus and rilyn god of friendship we claim shelter for the night bide a moment after a pause gerin heard ricolfs deep voice exclaim what let them in fool let them in the drawbridge swung down the lad cried in the names of dyaus and rilyn welcome guestfriend gerin be you welcome also van of the strong arm ricolfs keep more sophisticated than gerins frontier fortress had stone outwalls instead of a log palisade its moat was broad and deep limplooking plants splashed the slick surface of the water a vile stench rose from the moat sinuous ripples made gerin suspect water plants were not the only things to call it home ricolf greeted his guests at the gatehouse he was stout perhaps fifty with a square ruddy face and blue eyes his tunic and trousers were brightly checked and modish in cut but the sword swinging at his belt was a plain wellbattered weapon that had seen much use he had more gray in his red hair and beard than gerin remembered and lines of worry the fox had not seen before bracketed his eyes and mouth when gerin scrambled down from the wagon ricolf enfolded him in a bearhug pumping his hand and thumping his back great dyaus above lad is it ten years theyve made a man of you ten years indeed and us not living five days ride from each other this must never happen again untangling himself gerin said true enough but i doubt if either one of us had a fiveday stretch free and clear in all those years he explained why he was traveling south ricolf nodded in grim comprehension gerin went on if what traders say is true youve had your own troubles i did until i sent my unloving cousin sarus to the afterworld this past winter ricolf agreed he focused on van is this your new lieutenant i thought what news i heard of him so much nonsense but i see it was just the truth my comrade rather gerin said and made the introduction van acknowledged it with grave respect his broad hand back thickthatched with golden hair swallowed ricolfs in its clasp i greet you as well van of the strong arm use my home as you own for as long as you would speaking of whichricolf turned back to gerinwould you like to scrub off the dust of the road in my bathhouse before we eat you have the time i think bathhouse geirn stared i thought id have to shiver in the streams or reek like a dungheap till i got south of the mountains ricolf looked pleased so far as i know i have the first up here i had it put in last summer when i sent messages to the unmarried barons of the northcountryand to some south of the kirs toothat any who thought himself worthy of my daughter elises hand should come here to let me decide which man i thought most suited to her my wife yrse gave me no sons who lived you know nor have i hopes for any legitimate ones now as ive no real intention of marrying again i had three bastard boys and one a lad of promise too but the chestfever carried them off two winters back poor lads so when i die the holding passes to elise and whomever she weds gerin you must have got my invitation to join us i know youre still wifeless yes i did but i had an arrow through my shoulder it was a nasty one and i was afraid the wound would rot if i traveled too soon i sent my regrets thats right so you did i remember now i was truly sorry you ve done yourself a fine job since duren and dagref er died it wasnt the trade i was trained for gerin shrugged my father always counted on dagref besides being older than me he was a fighter born who would have thought the trokmoi could get them both at once i know my father never did as for me im still alive so i suppose i havent disgraced myself he changed the subject remembering his father still hurt now youd better show me where that bathhouse of yours is before your dogs decide im part of the midden he scratched the ears of a shaggy reddish hound sniffing his ankles its tail switched back and forth as it grinned up at him tongue lolling out a halfmemory flickered but he could not make it light go away ruffian ricolf snapped the dog ignored him beast thinks the place belongs to him ricolf grumbled he took gerins arm and pointed right over there and ill see to it your horses are tended ricolfs tubs were carved limestone the delicate frieze of river godlets and nymphs carved round them told gerin theyd been hauled up from the south for local gravers were less skilled soaking in steaming water the fox said ricolf gives the suitors nothing but the finest i never thought id feel clean again vans bulk almost oozed out of the tub but he grunted contented agreement he asked what is this daughter of ricolfs like gerin paused to rinse suds from his beard your guess is as good as mine ten years back she was small and skinny and rather wished she were a boy they dried off van spent a few minutes polishing imaginary dull places on his cuirass and combing the scarlet crest of his helm gerin did not redon his own armor choosing instead a skyblue tunic and black breeches with your gear you could go anywhere he said but id look a mere private soldier in mine even this is none too good the southerners will doubtless have their hair all curled and oiled and wear those toga things they affect he waved a limpwristed hand and they talk so pretty too dont have much use for them eh captain gerin smiled wryly thats the funniest part of it i spent the happiest part of my life south of the kirs im a southerner at heart some ways i suppose but i cant let it show at fox keep ricolf led them into his long hall at the west end a great pile of fatwrapped bones smoked before dyaus altar you feed the god well gerin said he has earned it ricolf turned to the men already at the tables let me present the baron gerin called the fox and his companion van of the strong arm gentlemen we have here rihwin the fox gerin stared at the man who shared his sobriquet rihwin stared back his cleanshaven face a mask his smooth cheeks alone would have said he was from the south but he also wore a flowing green toga and a golden hoop in his left ear gerin liked most southern ways but he had always thought earrings excessive ricolf was still talking also rumold of the long bow laidrad the besieger wolfar of the axe gerin muttered a polite unpleasantry wolfar a darkskinned lump of a man with bushy eyebrows coarse black hair and an unkempt thicket of beard that almost reached his swordbelt was the foxs western neighbor theyd fought a bloody skirmish over nothing in particular two winters ago before wolfar went to seek ricolfs daughter while ricolf droned on introducing more suitors and men of his household gerin got hungrier and hungrier finally ricolf said and last but surely not least my daughter elise the baron was dimly aware of vans sweeping off his helmet and somehow bowing from the waist in full armor what elises long golden gown contained reminded him acutely of how much little girls could grow in ten years he vaguely regretted she did not follow the barebodiced southern style but the gown showed plenty as it was long brown hair flowed over her creamy shoulders her laughing green eyes held him i remember you well lord gerin she said when last you were here you bounced me on your knee times change though so they do my lady he agreed mournfully he took a seat without much attention to his benchmates and found himself between rihwin and wolfar bounced her on your knee forsooth rihwin said soft voice turning words in elaborate southern patterns i should be less than a truthteller were i to say some such idea had not crossed my mind at one time or another and i daresay the minds of others here as well and now we meet a man who has accomplished the fondest dreams of a double hand of nobles and more in good truth a fellow manifestly to be watched with the greatest of care he raised a mug in mocking salute but gerin thought the smile on his handsome face real the baron drained his own tankard in return rihwin seemed to wince as he downed his ale no doubt he preferred wine most southerners did but grapes grew poorly north of the kirs an elbow nudged gerins ribs wolfar grinned at him displaying snaggled teeth gerin suspected he had wereblood in him his hairiness varied marvelously as the moons whirled through the sky three years before when nothos and math were full at the same time a tale went round that hed gone all alone into the forests of the trokmoi and slain men with his teeth at the moment he seemed civiland civilizedenough how fare you fox he asked well enough until now gerin answered smoothly from the corner of his eye he saw rihwin cock an eyebrow in an expression he was more used to feeling on his own face than seeing on another he felt he had passed an obscure test his belly was growling when the repast appeared ricolfs cooks did not have the spices and condiments the fox had known south of the mountains but the food was good and they did no violence to it there was beef both roasted and boiled fowls fried crisp and brown mutton ribs of pork cooked in a tangy sauce creamy cheese with a firm tasty skin thick soup from the stockpot and mountains of freshbaked bread ricolfs good beer was an added delight serving wenches ran here and there foodladen bronze platters in their hands trying to keep ahead of the gobbling suitors rihwin and one or two others discreetly patted the girls as they went by gerin understood their caution it would not have done for a noble intent on marrying ricolfs daughter to get one of his wenches with child van had no such worries when a wellmade lass came by he kissed her and gave her a squeeze she squealed and almost dropped her tray her face was red as she pulled away but she smiled back at him the feasters tossed gnawed bones onto the halls dirt floor where ricolfs dogs snarled and fought over them whenever the battles grew too noisy a couple of cleanedup serfs in stout boots toed the hounds apart even so the din was overpowering so were the smells the odors of dog and man vied with the smell of cooking meat smoke from the torches and the great hearth next to dyaus altar hung in a choking cloud gerin ate until he could barely move then settled back replete and happy everyone rose as elise made her exit flanked by two maids when she was gone the serious drinking and gambling began wolfar gerin knew was a fanatic for dicing but tonight for some reason he declined to enter the game i never bet in my life he declared loftily pretending not to hear the foxs snort i wish i could say that a loser mourned as his bet was scooped up why cant you wolfar just did rihwin said gerin grinned at him with genuine liking in the southlands the smooth insult was a fine art one the baron had enjoyed but one too subtle for castle fox rihwin nodded back maybe he had aimed the remark for gerins ears it always warmed the fox when a southerner born and bred took him for an equal they were a snobbish lot on the other side of the kirs that rihwins target was wolfar only made things more delightful rihwin had a capacity for ale that belied his soft looks gerin valiantly tried to keep up empyting his mug again and again until the room spun as he rose his last clear memory was of van howling out a nomad battlesong and accompanying himself with the flat of his blade on the tabletop to his surprise the baron woke up the next morning in a bed he had scant notion of how or when hed reached it little wails of delight and vans hoarse chuckle from the next room told him the outlander had not wasted his night sleeping the fox found a bucket of cold water outside his door he poured half of it over his head spluttering he walked down the passageway and into the yard he found ricolf there halfheartedly practicing with the bow though the older man had not tried to pace his guests he looked wan does this sort of thing happen every night gerin asked the gods forbid were it so id have been long dead no i plan to announce my choice tonight and it would be less than natural if tension didnt build for near a year ive seen these menall but sigiber the south poor wight who got a spear through his middlein battle heard them talk watched them aye my minds made up at last who can you keep it quiet no thats a foolish question you could before pup though you were and its not the sort of thing to change in a man for all his affected waysi know some call him fop and not foxrihwin is easily the best of them after him perhaps would be wolfar but a long way back wolfar gerin was amazed you cant mean it aye i do i know of your trouble with him but you cant deny hes a doughty warrior hes not as slow of wit as his looks would make you think either hes a mean one though once in handtohand he almost bit my ear off something else occurred to the fox what of your daughter if the choice were hers whom would she pick it was ricolfs turn for surprise what does that matter shell do as i bid her he turned back to his archery gerin was tempted to leave but knew his old friend would think him rude to vanish on the eve of the betrothal he spent the day relaxing glancing at the couple of books ricolf owned and making light talk with some of the suitors van emerged in the early afternoon a smile on his face the outlander was rubbing a callus on his right forefinger when he found gerin the baron remembered the heavy silver ring hed worn there van explained its only right to give the lassie something to remember me by you i dont think shes likely to forget i suppose not van said happily a bit before sunset a wandering minstrel appeared outside ricolf s gate and prayed shelter for the night the baron granted it on condition that he sing after elises betrothal was announced the minstrel whose name was tassilo agreed at once how not he said after all tis the purpose of a singer to sing the evening meal was like the one the night before tonight though ricolf opened jugs of wine brought up from the south along with griffinheaded ivory rhytons and eared cups of finest sithonian warebeautiful scenes of hunting drinking and the deeds of the gods were painted under their glaze gerins thrifty soul quailed when he thought of what ricolf must have spent rihwin who seemed to expect his coming triumph and hadnt tasted the wine he loved in a year began pouring it down almost faster than he could be served he held it well at first regaling his comrades with bits of gossip from the emperors court though this was a year old most of it was new to gerin the feasters finished an expectant hush fell on the hall just as ricolf began to rise rihwin suddenly clambered onto the table the boards creaked voice wineblurred rihwin called out ha bard play me a tune and make it a lively one tassilo who had looked at the bottom of his cup more than once himself struck fiery music from his mandolin rihwin went into a northern dance gerin stared at him he was sure ricolf would not like this but rihwin found the jig too sedate he shifted in midstep to a wild stamping nomad dance ricolf watching the unmanly performance looked like a man bathing in hellfire he had all but beggared himself to provide the best for these men and make his holding as much like the elegant southland as he could was this his reward then with a howl rihwin stood on his hands and kicked his legs in the air in time to the music his toga fell limply around his ears he wore nothing under it at that spectacle the maids hustled elise from the hall gerin did not quite catch her expression but thought amusement a large part of it in agony ricolf cried rihwin you have danced your wife away i could hardly care less rihwin said cheerfully play on minstrel iii after that there was little ricolf could do he tried to make the best of the fiasco by proclaiming to everyone that wolfar of the axe was his true choice as elises groom wolfar acknowledged his honor with a gracious grunt which only disconcerted ricolf more there were scattered cheers including a sardonic one from rihwin gerin muttered insincere congratulations to wolfar then he left the feast claiming he wanted to make an early start in the morning that held just enough truth to make mannerly his escape from his enemys triumph van had already disappeared with another wench and a jug of wine ignoring the raucous celebration in the great hall gerin blew out the little flame flickering from the middle fingertip of the handshaped clay lamp by his bed and fell asleep he woke to the sound of someone fumbling at the barred door ellebs crescent just now topping the walls of ricolfs keep peeped through the eastfacing slit window and sent a pale pink stripe of light across the bed to the door sunrise was still two or three hours away head aching gerin groped for his clothes he slid into trousers but wrapped his tunic round his right arm for a shield the fumbling went on knife in hand he padded to the door and flung it open whatever outcry he had intended clogged in his throat great dyaus elise what are you doing here he gurgled he almost had not known her no longer was she gowned and bedecked she wore stout boots breeches and a sheepskin jacket so baggy it all but hid her curves a knife swung at her belt her long hair was tucked up under a shapeless leather travelers hat for a long moment she stared at the blade in his left hand its nicked edge glittered in the fading light of the hallway torches then she brushed past the stunned fox and shut the door behind them voice low and fast she said i need help lord gerin and of all the men here i think i can only ask it of you i was willing to try my fathers idiot scheme as long as i thought i had some chance of getting a husband i could endure but wolfar of the axe gerin wished he had not drunk so much his head still buzzed and his wits were slow all the northland knows i have no love for wolfar but what do you want of me he asked already afraid he knew the answer she looked up at him eyes enormous in the gloom i know you are going to the capitaltake me with you my mother was of a southern house and i have kin there id be no burden to you ive been daughter and son both to my father and i can live from the land like any warrior dont you see i cant gerin broke in its impossible what would my life be worth if someone were to find you here even now alarmed at that he added by the gods where are your maids as soon as i knew my father had chosen wolfar i put a sleeping powder in their cups the ninnies were still clucking over poor besotted rihwin he wasnt a bad fellow for all his silly ways the baron felt a twinge of annoyance at her mentioning the drunken fool with kindness but stifled it he said thats one for you then but why wont ricolf think i ran off with you against your will nothing simpler i let a note in my room saying just what i was doing and why there are things in it only he and i know hed not think it forced from me gerin stared women who read and wrote were not of the ordinary sort well he thought ive already found that out but he shook his head saying you have all the answers it seems but answer me this would you have me break the sacred oath of guestfriendship i hold with your father no luck comes to the oathbreaker gods and men alike turn from him she inspected him her eyes filled with tears he felt himself flinch under her gaze youve forgotten the oath you gave me all those years ago then she asked bitterly how old was i eight ten i dont know but ive remembered from then till now that you treated me like a real person not just a brat underfoot you swore if ever i needed you there you would be is an oath less an oath because given to a child am i less a person because i have no beard you called on dyaus by dyaus lord gerin could you see yourself wed to wolfar were you a woman the tears slid down her cheeks no he sighed understanding what the truth meant but unable to lie to her no more could i i would sooner die theres no need of that he said awkwardly patting her shoulder he shrugged on the rolledup tunic and climbed into his cuirass what sort of gear do you have no need to worry about that ive already stowed it in your wagon he threw his hands in the air i might have known you know van will call me nine different kinds of fool and every one of them true but youll be useful to have around you could talk a longtooth into eating parsnips wait here he added and stepped into the hall he tried vans door it was barred he swore under his breath he was about to tap when the door flew open van loomed over him naked as the day he was born his mace checked its downward arc inches from the foxs head captain what in the five hells are you up to he hissed behind him a woman made drowsy complaint in the halflight the curve of her hip and thigh made an inviting shadow on the bed its all right love the outlander reassured her she sighed and went back to sleep van turned to gerin dont come scratching round my door it isnt healthy so i see now will you put that fornicating thing down and listen to me when the baron finished there was nothing but astonishment on vans face he whistled softly i will be damned spend two years thinking a man stodgy and then he does this to you his shoulders shook with suppressed mirth what are you standing here gawking for go on get the horses hitched up ill be with you in a few minutes softly but firmly he shut the door in gerins face blinking the baron retrieved elise and hurried down the hallway the only sounds were faint cracklings from the guttering torches and snoring from behind almost every door gerin thanked the gods for the flooring of rammed earth on planking the nails in his sandals would have clicked like the wooden snappers some sithonian dancers wore on their fingers how can i thank you elise whispered i gerin clamped a hand over her mouth someone else was in the hall wolfar stumbling to his bed had rarely felt better in his life he had spent most of the night thinking of gerin chopped into dogmeat after he took over ricolfs lands as well as his own elise was a tasty baggage too every other feaster had long since either lurched off to bed or slid under the table but wolfar buoyed by visions of glory and mayhem was still mostly himself after drinking them all down he gaped when gerin appeared before him ah the fox he said jovially i was just thinking of you his piggy eyes went wide when he saw the barons companion gerin saw wolfar fill his lungs to shout he snatched a dead torch from its dragonheaded bronze sconce and broke it over his rivals bald spot wolfar sank without a sound mouth still open gerin and elise darted for the stables not knowing how long he would stay stunned they slowed once they got outside the castle attracting the gate crews attention was the last thing they wanted the horses looked resentful as gerin harnessed them his fingers leaped over the leather straps each had to go in its proper place lest the whole harness come apart he expected an alarm at any moment but the horses were hitched and elise hidden under blankets in the back of the wagon and all stayed quiet van however did not come gerin waited and worried a footfall in the doorway made him whirl his hand leaped for his swordhilt but that gigantic silhouette could only belong to one man what kept you the baron barked some things a gentleman never hurries van said with dignity you laid wolfar out cold as a cod hell have himself a tenday headache now lets be off shall we ah youve already got a torch lit good here start another the light may keep the worst of the ghosts away or of course it may not i know few men whove gone nightfaring and fewer still who came back again but now its a needful thing i think he climbed aboard took the reins and set the horses moving harness jingling they rode up to the gate a couple of ricolfs hounds sniffed about the wagons wheels van flicked them away with his whip the gate guards made no move to let down the drawbridge they looked curiously at van and gerin one asked lords why are you on your way so early van stopped breathing it was a question for which he had no good answer but gerin only grinned a lopsided grin he laughed at the guards and said im running away with ricolfs daughter shes much too good for anyone here the soldier shook his head ask a question like that and you deserve whatever answer you get i suppose come on vukov he said to the other watchman let down the bridge if they want to take their chances with the ghosts its their affair and none of mine smothering a yawn vukov helped his comrade with the winch the bridge slowly lowered then dropped the last few feet with a thump to gerin the clop of the horses hooves on it seemed the loudest thing in the world trying not to bellow laughter van wheezed and choked between splutters he said captain that was the most outrageous thing ive ever seen youve got to promise me youll never ever let me gamble with you i have better things to do than throwing my money away its illdone to lie in the house of a guestfriend if his men choose not to believe why thats their affair and none of mine gerin shrugged mimicking the guardsman as soon as they left the shelter of ricolfs keep the ghosts were on them keening loss and shrieking resentment of any who still kept warm blood in their veins without the boon of blood to placate them they sent an icy blast of terror down on the travelers the horses rolled their eyes shying at things only they saw gerin stopped his ears with his fingers in a vain effort to shut out the ghosts wails he saw van work his massive jaw but no word of complaint passed the outlanders lips elise shivering came up to sit with them under the scant protection the torches gave ricolfs lands shot by in a gray blur as if van thought to outrun the ghosts by fleeing south the horses did not falter rather they seemed glad to run false dawn was touching the east with yellow light when the wagon sped past the little guardpost ricolf kept on his southern border gerin was not much surprised to see the guards curled up asleep inside fire and blood warded them from the night spirits they did not stir as the wagon clattered past the fox had been looking back over his shoulder as long as he was in ricolfs lands when he saw how van slowed their pace once past the border he knew he had not been the only one to worry he cocked an eyebrow at his friend for all his willingness to help carry off the lady he said to no one in particular i seem to notice a certain burly accomplice of mine lacking a perfect faith in the power of her notes to soothe ruffled tempers if all that noise means me van rumbled then youve hit in the center of the target it would have been downright awkward to have to explain to a horde of warriors just what i was doing with their lords daughter elise made a face at him she at least seemed confident there would be no followers gerin wondered what it took to put trust in someone unknown for a double handful of years his mind stalked round the idea like a cat with ruffled fur he was still astonished any pleading of hers could have convinced him to bring her along at last the sun touched the eastern horizon spilling out ruddy light like a huge hand pouring wine from a jug the ghosts gave a last frightened moan and returned to whatever gloomy haunts they inhabited during the day the morning wore on with no sign of anyone on gerins trail but he still felt uneasy for no reason he could name it could not have been the land save for the high kirs now a deep blue shadow on the southern skyline nothing was much different from what he knew in his own barony meadow and forest alternated and if there were a few more elms and oaks and a few less pines and maples that mattered little the woods did grow closer to the road than the fox would have liked south of ricolfs holding the highway marked the boundaries of two barons said to be rivals and to gerins way of thinking they should have kept the undergrowth well trimmed so no one could use it for cover once a little stream wound close by the roadway when van pulled off to water the horses and let them rest for a few minutes frogs and turtles leaped from mossy rocks and churned away in senseless terror just as they would have near fox keep no the fox thought as he stared back at a suspicious turtle the land was not what troubled him the peasants seemed much the same too they lived in little villages of wattle and daub the community oxen housed about as well as the people scrawny chickens picked around cottages and squawked warnings at dogs who snarled back little naked herdboys guided flocks of sheep and cattle with sticks helped by the shortlegged brown and white dogs native to the north country men and women in colorless homespun worked in the fields as hard as the draft animals laboring with them not until gerin lifted his eyes to the keeps could he finger what troubled him castles crowned many hills but here and there the banks of their moats were beginning to crumble into the water some lesser barons let stands of trees big enough to shelter scores of warriors grow almost within bowshot of their walls gerin had no desire to claim shelter from any of these nobles the few he saw on the road distressed him their chariots were decorated with inlays of gold and bright stones but plainly had never seen combat more than one man wore cloth instead of mail what cuirasses were to be seen were covered with studs and curlicues of bronze beautiful to look at but sure to catch and hold a spearpoint the footsoldiers were not much better they were well armed but soft jaws and thick middles said they were unblooded troops behind the shield of the border where the trokmoi were always ready to pounce on the weak elabons northern province was starting to rot van saw it too this land is ripe for the taking he said gerin could only nod the sun rose high and hot gerin felt the sweat trickle down his back and chest he wished he could scratch through his armor with fairer skin van suffered more tanned though he was he finally took off his proud helm and carefully stowed it in the back of the wagon then poured over his head a bucket of cool water from the brook where they had stopped he puffed and snorted as the water poured down his face and dripped through his beard ahhh he said thats better even if i do sound like a whale coming up for air a whale elise said she had shed her jacket in tunic and trousers she was more comfortable than either of the men her hat she kept on for her fairness was not like that of van who grew golden under the sun she would burn and freckle and peel and never really tan at all she went on ive heard the word some kind of fish is it not ive never seen one nor i gerin said the farthest ive traveled is to the capital and there are no whales in the inner seas well captain ill tell youand you my ladyive seen whales right enough and closer than i wanted too do you know the land called mabalal elise shook her head gerin said ive heard the name its far to the south and east i think thats the one captain and sultrywhy this is nothing beside what its like there i thought id melt like a lump of wax in a fire the people are little and dark and they seem to like it well enough for all their swarthy hides the women are not uncomely and what they do van abruptly broke off gerin was amused to see his huge friend could blush but i was talking about whales van went on they come in all sizes and the sailors like the little ones and wouldnt think of harming them but the big ones hate men and sink whatever boats they can now one of them had lived outside the harbor at jalorthats the capital thereaboutsfor years and hed sunk maybe twenty ships he had a reddish skin they knew him by and they called him old crimson since crimson is the color their kings wear five times theyd tried to kill him and neither of the two harpooners who lived was whole it got so bad the captains wouldnt ship out of jalor and if they did they couldnt find a soul to man the oars didnt that put a pretty squeeze on the merchants so they decided to have another go at him and when one of their big traders a fellow named kariri saw me in some dive he thought i would make a good oarsman having more in the way of muscle than his countrymen i was game things had been dull since id had to leave shanda and the price he promised was good it had to be to get rowers for that boat most of us were foreigners of one kind or another the folk of jalor knew better so off we sailed the only ship in the water though the docks and beach were black with people watching now in those part the way they lure whales is this they catch a lot of fat tunny and pickle them with salt in big jars and when theyre nice and ripe they soak rags in the fishgrease and dump em in the water where they think the whales are the first thing any of us knew of old crimson being round was a sort of a loud hiss and a cloud of evilsmelling steam whales arent like other fish they have to come to the surface every so often to get a breath of air and blow out the old thats what hed done not fifty yards to starboard i tell you i missed a stroke and i wasnt the only one then he came all the way out of the water and i never want to see such a sight again that ruddy hide of his was all scarred and torn from the ships hed sunk and i saw three spearpoints stuck in just back of his head but not deep enough to do more than drive him mad with pain over the years i dont lie when i say idve sooner been elsewhere right then he was bigger than our boat and not by a little either but the harpooning crew knew what to do if theyand wewere going to come home alive they tossed ten or twelve pounds of that pickled tunny toward the monster and he snapped it up its a funny thing but the stuff makes whales drunk and old crimson lay still in the water if he were a kitten he would have purred once that happened the harpooners slipped out of their clothes not that they wore much just rags round their middles and swam over to him quiet as they could one trailed his barbed harpoon the second a little stand for it and the third who had more brawn than most men of mabalal took a big mallet with him they climbed up on old crimsons head and he never stirred we lay dead quiet in the water for fear of rousing him they set up the harpoon just aft of his head right behind the others that hadnt gone deep enough to kill then the fellow with the mallet swung it up over his head and hit the butt end of the harpoon with everything he had i swear by all the gods there are that the whale leaped clean out of the water with the harpooners still clinging to him they might have screamed but we never would have heard them we were backing water for all we were worth but still i saw that great tail like a fist over the bow when it came down the ship just went all to splinters im hazy about what happened next because something hit me right between the eyes i must have grabbed an oar the next thing i remember is being fished out of the water by one of the little boats that came out as soon as the people on shore saw old crimson was really dead thirtyfour people were on our boat when we set out and six of us lived only one of the harpooners the fellow with the little stand anyway the fishermen who rescued me took me to shore and the jalorians took the whales carcass ashore too for they valued the meat and oil of it the head of the merchants guild kissed all of us who had lived and gave each of us a tooth worried out of the whales head i dont lie when i say it was more than half a foot long but do you know what i didnt make a copper more from it for that fat merchant sitting on his arse on the shore just called me a filthy foreigner and wouldnt pay for all that though i drank my way through the grogshops for ten days straight without touching a coin of my own and to this day no one in jalor knows how old kariris warehouses burned down you know gerin said thoughtfully if they were to put a line on the end of their harpoons with floatssealed empty casks maybeevery hundred paces or so they could spear their whales without having to climb onto them and if the wound didnt kill on the spot the whales couldnt escape by diving either van stared at him i do believe itd work he said at last why werent you there then to think of it the gods know i never would have he looked to elise gerin i do believe our guest thinks my yarn would be good for making flowers grow but not much else though since shes kind as she is fair shes too polite to say so hold the reins a bit for me will you elise started to protest but van was not listening to her he stepped into the back of the wagon gerin heard him rummaging in the battered leather sack where he kept his treasures after a minute or two he grunted in satisfaction and emerged handing elise what he held gerin craned his neck to look too it was an ivory tusk unlike any he had ever seen though no longer than the fang of the longtooth he knew this was twice as thick and pure white not yellowish someone had carved a whale and the prow of an unfamiliar ship on the tooth the whale was tinted a delicate pink seeing the barons admiration van said a friend of mine made it while i was out roistering youll notice it isnt done but i got out of jalor in a hurry and he didnt have time to finish elise was silent gerin kept the reins van had been yawning all morning and now he tried to snatch some sleep in the cramped rear of the wagon the fox was looking for one particular dirt track of the many joining the elabon way each path had a stone post set beside it carved with the marks of the petty barons to whose keeps the roadlets ran it was past noon before gerin saw the winged eye he sought he almost passed it by for the carving was so ancient that parts of it had weathered away startling red lichens covered much of what remained where are we going elise asked when he turned down the track she coughed as the horses kicked up dust i thought you knew all my plans gerin said id like to hear what the sibyl at ikos tells me i stopped there once before when i went south for the first time and she warned me id never be a scholar i laughed at her but two years later the trokmoi killed my father and my brother and i had to quit the southlands that i had heard elise said softly im sorry gerin could feel the truth in her words he was touched and at the same time annoyed with himself for letting her sympathy reach him he felt relieved when she returned to her original thought where we go matters little to me i simply didnt know any place away from wolfar is good enough though ive heard evil things of the country round ikos ive heard them too he admitted but ive never seen much to make me think them true this road goes over the hills and through some of the deepest forest this side of the niffet before it reaches the sibyls shrine its said strange beasts dwell in the forest i never saw any though i did see tracks on the roadway that belong to no animals the outer world knows the more prosperous petty barons and their lands clung leechlike to the elabon way a few hours travel from it things were poorer freeholders held their own plots men not under the dominion of any local lordling they were of an ancient race the folk who had been on the land between the niffet and the high kirs even before the coming of the trokmoi whom the empire had expelled slim and dark they spoke the tongue of elabon fluently enough but among themselves used their own soft sibilant language the road narrowed becoming little more than a winding rutted lane under frowning trees the sinking suns light could barely reach through the green arcade overhead gerin jumped when a scarlet finch shot across the roadway taken aback by the flash of color in the gloom as the sun set he pulled off the road and behind a thick clump of trees he routed van from his jouncing bed together they unharnessed the horses and let them crop what little grass grew in the shade of the tall beeches they had but a scanty offering for the ghosts dried beef mixed with water it was not really enough but gerin hoped it would serve elise wanted to take one watch the fox and van said no in the same breath please yourselves she shrugged but i could do it well enough a knife appeared in her hand and then almost before the eye could see it was quivering in a treetrunk twenty feet away gerin was thoughtful as he plucked the dagger free but still refused elise looked to van he shook his head and laughed my lady i havent been guarded by women since i was old enough to keep my mother from learning what i was up to i dont plan to start over now she looked hurt but said only very well then guard me well this night heroes he halfsketched a salute as she slipped into her bedroll van who was rested offered to take the first watch gerin got under a blanket twisted until he found a position where the fewest pebbles dug into him and knew no more until van prodded him awake math is down andwhat do you call the fast moon ive forgotten tiwaz thats it as well as i can see through the trees itll set in an hour or so that makes it midnight and time for me to sleep van was under his own blanketthe goldandblack striped hide of some great hunting beastand asleep with the speed of the experienced wanderer gerin stretched yawned and heard the ghosts buzz in his mind like gnats in the dim red light of the embers the wagon was a lump on the edge of visibility the horses a pair of dark shadows gerin listened to their unhurried breathing and the chirp and rustle of tiny crawling things an owl overhead loosed its hollow eerie call somewhere not far away a small stream chuckled to itself a longtooth roared in the distance and for a moment everything else was quiet the baron turned at a sound close by he saw elise halfsitting watching him her expression was unreadable regrets he asked voice the barest thread of sound her answer was softer still of course to leave all ive ever known its no easy road but one i have to travel you could still go back with wolfars arms waiting theres no returning she started to say more stopped began again do you know why i came with you you helped me once long ago her eyes were looking into the past not at gerin the first time i saw you was the most woeful day of my life i had a dog id raised from a pup he had a floppy ear and one of his eyes was half blue and because of his red fur i called him elleb he used to like to go out and hunt rabbits and when he caught one hed bring it home to me one day he went out as he always did but he didnt come back i was frantic i looked for two days before i could find him and when i did i wished i hadnt hed run down a little gully and caught his hind leg in a trap i remember gerin said realizing why the dog ruffian had seemed familiar i heard you crying and went to see what the trouble was i was heading south to study was i crying i suppose i was i dont remember all i could think of was poor ellebs leg shredded in the jaw of the trap and blood dried black and the flies the trap was chained to a stake and i couldnt pry it loose from him hurt as he was i remember him growling when you came up still trying to keep me safe you knelt down beside me and patted him and poured some water from your canteen on the ground for him to drink and then you took out your knife and did what needed to be done not many would tried to make friends with him first and not many would have sat with me afterwards and made me understand why an end to his pain was the last gift he could get from someone who loved him by the time you took me home i really did understand it you were kind to me and ive never forgotten and because of so small a thing you put your trust in me i did and i have no regrets her last words were sleepsoftened gerin watched nothos and the stars peep through holes in the leafy canopy and thought about the obligations with which he had saddled himself after a while he decided he too had no regets he fed bits of wood to the tiny fire slapped at the buzzing biters lured by its light and waited for the sun to put the ghosts to rout at dawn he woke van his comrade knuckled his eyes and spoke mostly in sleepy grunts as they harnessed the horses elise doused and covered the fire before gerin could tend to it they breakfasted on hard bread and smoked meat to his disgust gerin missed a shot at a fat grouse foolish enough to roost on a branch not a hundred feet away it flapped off wings whirring the track wound through the forest trailing shoots and damp hanging mosses hung from branches overhead eager to snatch at anything daring to brave the woods cool dim calm the horses were balky more than once van had to touch them with the whip before they would go on few birds trilled to ease the quiet almost the only sounds were the creaking of branches and the rustling of leaves in a breeze too soft to reach down to the road once a sound almost softer than silence paced the wagon for a time it might have been the pad of great supple feet or perhaps nothing at all gerin sawor thought he sawa pair of eyes greener than the leaves measuring him he blinked or they blinked and when he looked again they were gone the rattle of the wagons wheels was swallowed as if it had never been place gives me the bloody shivers van said to gerin his friends voice sounded louder than needful the baron thought the day passing faster than it was so thick was the gloom he bit back an exclamation of surprise when they burst from shadow into the brightness of the late afternoon sun he had not realized how much the thought of camping again in the forest chilled him until he saw he would not have to the hills cupped the valley in which ikos lay travelers could look down on their goal before they reached it the main road came from the southwest gerin could see little dots of moving men carriages and wagons all come to consult the sibyl his own road was less used the border lords usually put more faith in edged bronze than prophecy a tiny grove surrounded the temple probably in days long past the forest had lapped down from the hilltops into the valley but the sacred grove was all that was left of it there the shrines glistening marble roof stood out vividly against the green of the trees around the temple proper were the houses of the priests the attendants and the little people who while not really connected with the sibyl made their livings from those who came to see her sellers of images and sacrificial animals freelance soothsayers and oracleinterpreters innkeepers and whores and the motley crew who sold amulets charmsand doubtless curses too around the townlet were cleared fields each small plot owned by a freeholder gerin knew the temple clung to the old ways he did not grudge it its customs but still thought freeholding subversive a peasant could not produce enough wealth to equip himself with all the gear a proper warrior needed without the nobles the border and all the land behind would have been a red tangle of warfare with the barbarians howling down to loot and burn and kill should we go down before the light fails van asked gerin thought of ikos dingy hostels he shook his head wed get nothing done at this hour from what i recall of the inns well find fewer bugs here the evening meal was spare taken from the same rations as breakfast gerin knew those had been packed with the idea of feeding two people not three he reminded himself to lay in more pretty sorry scholar you are he jeered at himselfworrying over smoked sausages and journeybread he must have said that aloud for van laughed and said well someone has to after all the baron took the first watch in ikos below the lights faded until all was dark save for a central watchfire the hills to the southwest were dotted with tiny sparks of light gerin knew to be camps like his own in its grove the temple was strange for the light streaming out from it glowed blue instead of the comfortable redgold of honest flame magic gerin decided sleepily or else the god walking about inside when maths golden halfcircle set he roused van then dove headfirst into sleep he woke to the scent of cooking luckier than he had been the morning before van had bagged a squirrel and two rabbits and was stewing them elise contributed mushrooms and a handful of herbs feeling better about the world with his belly full gerin hitched up the horses the wagon rolled down the path toward the sibyl iv gerin soon discovered his memory had buried a lot about ikos first of all the place stank it lay under a cloud of incense so cloying that he wished he could stow his nose in the wagon mixed with the sweet reek were the scents of charring fat from the sacrifices and the usual town odors of stale cookery garbage ordure and longunwashed animals and humanity the noise was as bad gerins ears had not faced such an assault since he returned to the north country it seemed as if every peddler in ikos rolled down on the wagon each crying his wares at the top of his lungs swordblades rare and potent drugs sanctified water oats pretty boys savory cooked geese collected books of prophetic verse and countless other things a fat bald man in greasy tunic and shiny leather apron an innkeeper from the look of him pushed his way through and bowed low before the bemused fox who had never seen him before count stoffer i believe he said back still bent patience exhausted gerin snapped well if you believe that youll believe anything wont you and left the poor fellow to the jeers of his fellow townsmen is this what the capital is like elise asked faintly it is gerin said but only if you will allow that a map is like the country it pictures she used a word he had not suspected she knew van chuckled and said its the same problem both places i think too many people all pushed together captain youre the only one of us with pockets have a care they arent slit gerin thumped himself to make sure he was still secure if any of these fine bucks tries it hell be slit himself and not in the pocket he suddenly grinned or else not depending on how lucky i am they pushed their slow way through ikos and into the clearing round the sacred grove the sun was already high when they reached it they bought cheese and little bowls of barley porridge from the legion of vendors men from every nation gerin knew cursed and jostled one another each trying to be the first to the gods voice on earth one lightly built chariot held two nomads from the eastern plains they were little and lithe flat of face and dark of skin with scraggly caricatures of beards dangling from their chins they dressed in wolfskin jackets and leather trousers and bore doublecurved bows reinforced with sinew they carried small leather shields on their left arms one was bossed with a golden panther the other with a leaping stag when van noticed them he shouted something in a language that sounded like hissing snakes their slanted eyes lit as they gave eager answer there were kizzuwatnans in heavy carts hauled by straining donkeys squat heavyboned men with swarthy skins broad hooknosed faces and liquid mournful eyes their hair and beards curled in ringlets they wore long linen tunics that reached to their knees there were a few sithonians though most of them preferred the oracle at pronni in their own country slimmer and fairer than the kizzuwatnans they wore woolen mantles with brightly dyed edgings they scornfully peered about from under broadbrimmed straw hats though they had been subjects of the empire for five centuries they still saw themselves as something of an elite and looked down on their elabonian overlords as muscular dullards even an urfa from the deserts of the far south had come to ikos he must have ridden all the way around elabons greater inner sea for he was still perched atop his camel gerin looked at its reins and saddle with interest thinking how fascinated duin would have been the desertdweller peered down at the wains and chariots around him he growled guttural warning when they came too close that was seldom horses shied from his evillooking mount the urfa was wrapped in a robe of grimy wool eyes and teeth flashed in a face darkened by dirt and long years of sun save for a nose even larger than the kizzuwatnans his features were delicate almost feminine he wore a thin fringe of beard and for all his filth seemed to think himself the lord of creation gerin had a hard time naming some of the other outlanders van claimed one blackhaired fairskinned giant belonged to the gradi who lived north of the trokmoi the man was afoot and sweating in his furs he carried a stout mace and a shorthandled throwing axe gerin knew almost nothing of the gradi but van spoke of them with casual familiarity do you know their tongue elise asked aye a bit van said just how many languages do you know gerin asked well if you mean to say hello in and maybe swear a bit gods ive lost track long since tongues i know fairly well though perhaps ten or a dozen something like that which is your own elise asked my lady van said with something as close to embarrassment as his deep voice could produce ive been on the road a lot of years now after so long where i started matters little gerin grinned wryly hed got much the same answer when he asked that question elise looked to want to pursue it further but held her tongue one group of foreigners the fox knew only too well the trokmoi three chieftains had come to consult the sibyl their chariots stayed together in the disorder they were from deep in the northern woods gerin who knew the clans on the far side of the border as well as he knew the barons warding it recognized none of them nor were the clan patterns of bright checks on their drivers tunics familiar to him chiefs and drivers alike were tall thin men four had red hair and two were blond all wore their hair long and had huge drooping mustachioes though they shaved their cheeks and chins two clutched jugs of ale to themselves another wore a necklace of human ears priests circulated through the crowd gerin looked with scant liking at the one approaching the wagon a robe of gold brocade was stretched across his overample belly and his beardless cheeks shone pink everything about him was round and soft from his limpid blue eyes to the toes peeking sausagelike from his sandals he was a eunuch for the god accepted no whole man as his servitor the tip of his tongue played redly across his lips as he asked what would your business be gentles with the sibyl of my lord biton his voice was soft and sticky like the caress of a hand dripping with honey id sooner not speak of it in public gerin said quite quite your servant falfarun most definitely agrees you have though a suitably appropriate offering for the god i hope i think so gerin swung a purse into falfaruns pudgy fist the priests face was blank doubtless all will be well when your question is heard i do hope my dear falfarun it will be heard soon gerin said in his suavest voice he handed the priest another larger purse which vanished into a fold of falfaruns robe indeed yes indeed come this way if you please falfarun neared briskness as he elbowed aside less forethoughtful seekers of divine wisdom clucking to the horses van steered after him falfarun led the wagon into the sacred grove around the temple precinct seeing the foxs success the trokmoi pulled off rings armlets and a heavy golden pectoral and waved them in the face of another plump priest you gauged the size of your second sack about right van whispered praise dyaus for that the last time i was here i spent three days cooling my heels before i got to go before the sibyl i was still too young to know the world runs on gold was the wench worth looking at once you finally saw her scarcely she was a wrinkled old crone i wonder if she still lives why have hags to give prophesies it seems to me theyd hardly be fitting mates for whatever god runs the shrine here give me a young juicy lass every time van said drawing a sniff from elise biton has spoken through her since she was chosen for him when she was still a child gerin explained whenever a sibyl dies the priests search among families of the old race this valley has always been their stronghold when they find a girlchild with a certain markwhat it is they keep secret but its been bitons sign for agesshe becomes the new sibyl for as long as she remains a maiden and her chastity is guarded i assure you the tumult behind them faded under the trees images of allseeing biton were everywhere in the grove half of them turned to show the two eyes in the back of his head another priest led the trokmoi along a different path far from being struck by the holiness of the wood they argued loudly in their own language high walls of gleaming white marble warded the outer courtyard of bitons temple the gates were flung wide but spearcarrying temple guards stood ready to slam them shut should trouble threaten here and there the shining stone was chipped and discolored a mute reminder of the great invasion of the trokmoi two hundred sixty years before when biton himself the priests maintained made an appearance to drive the barbarians from his shrine before they could go in falfarun summoned a greenrobed underpriest the fat priest said it is not permitted to enter the courtyard save on foot arcarola here will take your wagon to its proper place fear not for there is no theft on the grounds of the temple a loathsome plague unfailingly smites any miscreant daring to attempt such rapine how many are thus stricken gerin asked skeptically the body of the latest is one of the curiosities within the outer walls poor wretch may he edify others sobered gerin descended from the wagon followed by elise and van when arcarola climbed up the horses rolled their eyes and tried to rear feeling the unfamiliar touch at the reins van put a heavy hand on each ones muzzle and growled dont you be stupid now following that with an oath in the harsh tongue gerin guessed was his own the beasts subsided and let themselves be led away the trokmoi came up about then more greenrobes took their chariots the priest who was leading them drew falfarun aside and spoke softly with him the trokmoi were talking too and not softly the argument theyd begun under the trees of the sacred grove was still in full swing gerin was about to greet them in their own tongue until he heard what they were quarreling about one of the northerners looked suspiciously at the fox and his comrades not so loud should you make it catuvolcus he said he sounded worried and his scarred hands made hushing motions catuvolcus was not going to be hushed gerin guessed he was a bit drunk his eyes were shot with red his speech slurred he toyed with his gruesome necklace divico he said you can take a flying futter at fast fomor he used the northern name for the quickest moon whats the chance we would find someone this far south who speaks the real language theres no need to take a chance for no purpose but im saying its no chance at all and if you will remember now twas your scheme to come here and what was the why of it just to have the privacy we could scarce be getting from our own oracles a proper notion it was too id liefer not have that balamung omadhaun know its less than full faith i have in him who is the spalpeen anyhow and why should we fight for him if i go hunting with a bear why i want to be sure hell not save me for the main course listening as hard as he could without seeming to gerin barely noticed falfarun return he was trailed by the other priest who was even fatter than he falfarun coughed and said good sir my colleague saspirhe indicated his companion whose smooth eunuchs face belied the years shown by his graying hair and sagging jowlsand i have decided that these northern gentlemen should precede you to the sibyl as their journey has been longer than yours and they have urgent business in their own land which requires them to make haste you are trying to tell me they paid you more gerin said without much rancor falfaruns chins quivered his voice was hurt as he answered i would not put it so crassly but its still true gerin finished for him be it so then if we can follow them directly but of course falfarun said relieved to find him so agreeable saspir gave the trokmoi the good news and took them into the temple courtyard falfarun followed his reedy voice loud in the ears of gerin who would much rather have listened to the barbarians another goldenrobed hierarch conducted a togaclad noble out from the holy precinct the mans thin pale face bore a troubled expression the nomads from the plains of shanda came up just as gerin entered the courtyard he heard a priest override their loud objections to being separated from their chariot even the trokmoi had fallen silent in the temple forecourt they were gawking necks craning every which way trying to see everything at once gerin thought they looked like so many hungry hounds licking their chops in front of a butchers shop he did not much blame them for the sight of so much treasure affected him the same way the wouldbe thiefs corpse covered with hideous rawedged lesions and bloated and stinking after some days in the open did little to dampen his enthusiasm beside him van whistled soft and low only the choicest gauds were on display most of the riches biton s shrine had accumulated over the centuries were stored away in strongwalled vaults behind the temple or in caves below it what was visible was plenty to rouse a plunderers lusts chief among the marvels were twin tenfoot statues of gold and ivory one of the emperor oren ii who had built the temple in the ancient grove the other of his father ros the fierce who drove the trokmoi north of the river niffet and won the land between the kirs and the niffet for elabon oren wore the toga and held in his upraised right hand the orb of empire ros mailed had a javelin ready to cast and leaned upon a narrowwaisted shield of antique design ros stern craggy face with its thrusting nose and lines carved deep on weathered cheeks still brought awe after four hundred years gerin shivered when he looked up into those cold eyes of jet a huge golden mixing bowl celebrated bitons triumph over the trokmoi wider even than vans outstretched arms it was set upon a clawfooted tripod of bronze and held the images of barbarians fleeing the gods just wrathand the prostrate bodies of those his arrows had struck down on a pedestal of purple marble next to it was a splendid statue of a dying trokme the naked warrior was on his right side propping himself up with his right arm that hand still clung to swordhilt the other clutched a gaping gash in his right side the redpainted blood streamed down his flank to form a puddle at his hip his face was turned up to stare at his unportrayed conqueror its grimace showed agony and defiance but not a hint of fear the statues features were blunter than those usual among the longfaced thinnosed trokmoi probably the sculptor himself a sithonian had used a countryman as model adding only long hair and mustaches to make clear the statues race there was much else to see the silverandgold longtooth its leap onto an aurochs frozen by a master artisan of long ago the chalices and urns of precious metals alabaster cinnabar and multicolored jades the stacks of ingots and bars of gold and silver each with a plaque telling which accurate prophesy it commemorated but falfarun was leading gerin up to the steps of the temple and that was a sight in itself orens architect had tried to harmonize the sparely elegant columned shrines the sithonians loved with the native brickwork fanes of elabon and his effort was a noble one the sides of bitons shrine were marble blocks spacious glazed windows helped illuminate the interior the front wall was pure sithonian with its triangular entablature supported by delicately fluted columns of whitest stone between architrave and overhanging eaves the frieze carved by a team of workmen from drawing by the creator of the dying trokme showed biton hand outstretched guiding an imperial column against a horde of trokmoi ros his harsh features easy to recognize stood in the lead chariot his men had a tough uniformity in striking contrast to the disorderly foe they battledand to the barons who had come after them up the seven marble steps they went falfarun chattering all the while when elise heard statue and frieze sprang from the same mans mind she asked his name falfarun looked shocked and shook his head i have no idea he said the work is far too holy to be polluted by such mundanities gerins eyes needed a moment to adjust to the inside of bitons shrine accustomed as they were to bright sunshine they went wide as he saw the splendor within for it had faded in his memory limiting himself to simple white stone for the outside of the building its designer had let color run riot within twin rows of crimson granite columns polished mirrorbright led the eye to the altar that was of sandalwood overlain with gold and encrusted with all kinds of precious stone it threw back in coruscating sheets the light cast on it by dozens of fat candles in three arabesqued chandeliers overhead the temples inner walls were faced with rare green marbled shot with gold that stone came from only one quarry near siphnos in sithonia the fox could but marvel at the sweat and gold needed to haul it here a journey of several hundred miles over the greater inner sea and the royal roads of elabon like the columns it was buffed till it gleamed it tinged nicheset gold and silver statues with its own color chanting acolytes paced here and there intent on bitons rituals their slippers swished over the floor mosaics their swinging censers filled the air with the fragrances of aloes myrrh and other costly incenses folk who wanted bitons aid but needed no sight of the future knelt and prayed in pews flanking the granite columns some kept their heads lowered others raised them to the ceiling frescoes as if seeking inspiration from the scenes of the gods begetting by dyaus on a princess and of his subsequent adventures most of them caused by the jealousy of the heavenly queen darza only in two respects was bitons shrine unlike many even more superb temples in the lands south of the mountains one was the image of the god behind the altar here he was no graceful youth a square column of rough black stone stood there drinking in the light and giving back none immeasurably old it could have been a natural pillar save for the faint images of eyes round its top and a jutting phallus stabbing forward from its middle bitons priests had only smiled when oren proclaimed their deity a son of dyaus in their hearts they knew whose god was the elder seeing that image gerin was not inclined to doubt them bitons power was rooted in the earth and in the square of bare earth to the left of the altar was a rift leading down below the roots of the sacred grove to the sibyls cave a rift whose like was unknown in the tamer south the trokmoi made obeisance before bitons altar the three chieftains on their knees and the drivers flat on their bellies they rose dusted themselves off and followed their guide into the yawning mouth of the cave one driver a freckled youth with face tightset against fear flexed the fingers of one hand in a sign to avert evil the other was tight on the hilt of his blade falfarun brought up his charges to take the barbarians place all bent the knee before biton falfarun panting as he eased his bulk to the floor gerin looked up at the ancient idol for an instant he thought he saw eyes brown as his own looking back at him but when he looked again they were only scratches on stone rising falfarun asked would it please you to take more comfortable seats while waiting to meet the sibyl gerin sat in the foremost pew he ignored the puffing falfarun who dabbed at his forehead with a square of blue silk his thoughts were on the trokmoi if these barbarians men from so deep in the forests he knew nothing of them had allied their clans with balamung how many more had done the same fox keep it seemed was in the way of an onsalught more terrible than the attack whose scars still showed on the temple forecourts walls he grew more and more jittery until the trokmoi emerged from the cavemouth all were grimfaced they had no liking for what theyd heard the young driver who had made the wardsign was white as an exterior column the freckles on his nose and cheeks standing out like spatters of dried blood the two chiefs who had been quarreling outside the temple forecourt were still at it divico even more worried than before waved a hand in front of catuvolcus face are you not glad now we came he said plain as day the witchwoman told us thered be naught but a fox gnawing our middles if we joined balamung plain as day ox ordure catuvolcus said the old gammer has no more wits than teeth the count of which is none on all the border theres but one southron called the fox and were you not listening when himself told us the kernd be ravens meat in no more than days it must be done by now so wheres your worry gerin stood and gave the trokmoi his politest bow begging your pardon he said using their tongue with a borderers ease but a wizards word a coin id bite or ever i pocketed it but if youre after the fox i am he and i tell you this the raven wholl pick my bones is not yet hatched no nor his grandsire either he had hoped his sudden appearance would show the barbarians the folly of their way instead he saw the rashness of his for catuvolcus bellowed an oath grasped sword from scabbard and rushed his five comrades followed leaping to his feet van lifted falfarun over his head as easily as if the fat eunuch had been stuffed with down he pitched him into the trokmoi bowling over two of them and giving himself and gerin time to free their blades at the same instant elise hurled a dagger then skipped back to safety the freckled driver fell throat pumping a torrent of blood round the hilt suddenly flowering there and sword slipping from nerveless fingers catuvolcus ducked under the hurtling priest he swung up his sword twohanded brought it down in a cut to cleave gerin from crown to chin sparks flew as the fox blocked the stroke his arms felt numb to the elbow he ducked under another wild slash edged bronze whizzing bare inches above his head his own sword bit into the trokmes belly he ripped it free to parry the lunge of one of the drivers the northerner seemed confused at facing a lefthanded swordsman gerin beat down another tentative thrust feinted at his enemys throat and guided his sword into the barbarians heart more surprise than pain on his face the trokme swayed and fell he gasped for air he could not breathe tried to speak only blood gushed from between his lips the fox looked round for more fight but there was none van leaned on his blade and puffed he watched the shrilling scrambling eunuchs with distaste half the proud crest of his helm was sheared away his armor was drenched with gore but none was his red hair matted by redder blood the head of one barbarian stared glassily at its body the ghastly corpse lay across another whose entrails and pouring blood befouled the gentle meadow of the mosaic floor horror on her face elise came up to survey the carnage with a flourish van plucked her dagger from its victims throat and handed her the dripping weapon as fine a throw as ive ever seen and as timely too he said she held it a moment then threw it to the floor as hard as she could and gagged reeling back against the pews gerin put a hand on her shoulder to comfort her she clung to him and sobbed he murmured wordless reassurance he was nearly as much an accidental warrior as was she and recalled only too well puking up his guts in a clump of bushes after his first kill now he was just glad he was still among the living and tried not to think of the ruined humanity at his feet he offered his canteen to elise so she could rinse her mouth she took it with a muffled word of thanks a squad of temple guardsmen rushed down the main aisle brushing aside the plainsmen who had watched the fight with interest and their guide the guard captain his corselet gilded to show his rank shook his head when he heard gerins story though saspir confirmed it tugging his beard the officer whose name was etchebar said to slay a priest of the god even to save your own lives is foully done surprised am i biton did not smite you dead slay van shouted who in the five hells said anything about slaying a priest you jouncebrained lump of dung etchebars spearmen bristled at that but restrained themselves at his gesture the great tun is no more slain than you as youd find out if you flipped water in his fat face and if wed waited for your aid itd be the trokmoi you were jabbering with here he spat into the pool of red look as smoothly as before he lifted falfarun the priest had still been on top of the inert divico van set him on his feet as blood dribbled from the hem of his robe the outlander slapped him gently once or twice he groaned and clutched his head he did not seem much hurt however shaken he was gerin turned all his powers of persuasion on the guard captain and the priest one of whose eyes was already beginning to blacken he broke off in midsentence when he saw van stooping over divico plainly intending to finish off the unconscious man the baron made a quick grab for his friends arm captain are you daft van said i hope not gerin took vans place over the fallen trokme and shook him divico came to himself with a thunderstorm in his head he moaned and opened his eyes that accursed fox was bending over him the scar above his eye white against his tan his square face hard the trokme gathered himself for a spring until he felt the cold kiss of a blade at his throat he rolled his eyes down until he saw its upper edge still smeared with blood impotent rage flashed across his face i willna beg for my life if its that youre after he said slit my weasand and have done a warriors answer gerin nodded still speaking the forest tongue with a fluency divico found damnable can it be youre wise as well he sheathed his sword and helped the bewildered trokme sit the chieftain hissed when he saw his slaughtered comrades gerin waved at them and went on you and your friends heard the sibyls words but did they heed them not a bit and see whats become of them now sure as sure the samell befall you and your clansmen if you go following balamungs wartrumpets if i give you your life would you go and tell them that aye and others you meet on the way divicos red brows came together as he thought at last he said i would that for catuvolcus and arviragus i cared not a fart poor togail is another matter though black shame twill be to me to tell my brother kell his son had his lovely throat torn out while i return revengeless still i will do it to keep the same from befalling all my kin fox i like you not but i will by taranis teutates and esus i swear it that was the strongest oath the trokmoi knew gerin thought if it would not bind divico to his word nothing would good man he said clasping his hand and helping him to his feet he almost told the trokme he thought like an elabonian but judged the proud chieftain would think it an insult a moment etchebar said drily you have not the only claim on this man because of him blood was shed in the holy precinct which is abhorrent to our lord biton he touched his eyes and the back of his head in reverence falfarun nodded vigorous agreement the guardsmen leveled their spears at divico who shrugged and relaxed but kept his hand near his sword i am sure we can come to an understanding gerin said propelling guard captain and priest into a quiet corner there they argued for some minutes the fox reminded them that divico had opposed catuvolcus who started the unholy combat furthermore he pointed out biton was able to deal with those who offended him as he had proved on the body of the luckless thief who was displayed in the forecourt etchebar growled a curt order and divico was set free the trokme bowed to gerin and left one hand still clutched to his aching skull another discreet offering of gold for the temple salved falfaruns bruises etchebar was a harder case for vans chaffing had wounded his pride he wanted satisfaction not gold making sure the outlander was not in earshot gerin apologized profusely blackrobed temple servitors dragged away the dead trokmoi and began to mop up their spilled gore which had already attracted a few flies eyes still unhappy under bushy eyebrows etchebar gathered up his men and led them back to the forecourt and now gentles to the sibyl at last falfarun said with quite as much solemn aplomb as he had had before he was tossed about and his gleaming robe befouled the mouth to the sibyls cave was a black grinning slit elise still wan took gerins hand looking down into the inky unknown he was glad of the touch van fumed blasphemously as he tried to scrub sticky drying blood from his cuirass falfarun vanished down the cavemouth you need have no fear for your footing he called since the unhappy day a century ago when the cousin of the emperor forenz the second of that name i believe tumbled and broke an ankle it was thought wise to construct regular steps and flooring to replace rocks and dirt such is life he sighed a bit unhappy at tradition flouted the subterranean corridor to the sibyls cave went down and down twisting until gerin lost all idea of which way he was going a few dim candles set in brackets of immemorial antiquity gave pale and fitful light making the flapping shadow of falfaruns robe a monstrous thing crossbranches of the caverns were holes of deeper blackness in the gloom elises grip on gerins hand tightened most of the cave wall was left in its natural state now and again a bit of rock crystal would gleam for a moment in the candlelight and then fade a few stretches were walled off by brickwork of a most antique mode which had its origins in the timeworn river land of kizzuwatna where men first lived in cities not truly square like most bricks these had convex tops and looked like buns of baked earth when gerin asked the reason for the brickwork falfarun answered with a shiver behind the bricks are charms of great fellness for not all branches of these caves are safe for men as you have seen some we use for armories others to store grain or treasure but in some branches dread things dwell and men who tried to explore them never returned those ways were stopped as you see to prevent such tragedies more than that i cannot tell you for it was done ages ago imagining the pallid monsters that could inhabit such dismal gloom gerin shivered himself he tried not to think of the tons of rock and earth over his head van muttered something that might have been prayer or curse and hitched the swordbelt higher on his hip an ancient statue of biton smiled its secret smile at them as they neared the sibyl the candles gave way to brighter torches the corridor widened to form a small chamber a gust of cool damp wind blew past gerins face he heard the deep mutter of a great subterranean river far below when falfarun touched his elbow he started your gifts entitle you to privacy with the sibyl if such is your desire the priest said gerin thought then nodded surprisingly falfaruns bruised face crinkled into a halfsmile good he said did the answer you received please you not belike your brawny friend would undertake to pitch me through a wall van sputtered in embarrassment falfarun went on good fortune attend you gentles and i leave you with the sibyl he waved at the throne set against the rear wall of the chamber and was gone by my sword van said softly if i didnt know better id say it was carved from one black pearl taller than a man the high seat glimmered nacreously in the torchlight crowns of silver shone on its two back posts the thrones splendor made the bundle of rags sitting on it altogether incongruous though the trokmoi had called the sibyl a crone gerin hadnt been able to believe the withered body through which the god had spoken ten years before still held life but it was she one eye dim the other whitened by cataract her face was a badlands of wrinkles her scalp shone through thinning strands of yellowish hair the mind behind that ruined countenance was still sharp though she raised one withered claw in a gesture of command step forward lass lads she said voice a dry rustle gerin knew she would have called his father lad had he been before her and she would have been as right what would you know of my master biton she asked for some days gerin had mulled the question he would put still in that place his tongue stumbled as he asked how best may i save myself and my lands and destroy the wizard who threatens them she did not reply at once thinking she had not heard the baron opened his mouth to ask the question again but with no warning her eyes rolled back showing only veintracked whites her scrawny fists clenched her body shook and trembled throwing her robe off one dry shoulder to reveal an empty dug her face twisted when she spoke it was not in her own voice but that of a powerful man in the first flush of strength hearing the god gerin and his companions went to their knees as his words washed over them buildings fall in flame and fire against you even gods conspire bow before the mage of the north when all his power is put forth to crush you down to lay you low for his grave no man will know the gods voice and power gone the sibyl slumped forward in a faint v evening came gray clouds scudded across the sky the wetdust smell of rain was in the air grim and silent gerin began to help van make camp elise worry in her voice and on her face said not three words have you spoken since we left the temple all the rage and helplessness the baron had contained since he stalked frozenfaced past falfarun to reclaim the wagon came out in a torrent of bile he slammed his helmet to the ground it spun into the undergrowth what difference does it make he said bitterly i might as well cut my own throat and save that perambulating corpse the work the sibyl told me the same thing he did only from him i hadnt believed it i was a fool to go to her i wanted advice not a death sentence a plague take all oracles at that van looked up while gerin stormed he had quietly gone on setting up camp hed started a fire and drained the blood of a purchased fowl into a trench to propitiate the ghosts i knew a man who said something like that once captain he said is there a story to go with the knowing elise asked seemingly searching for any way to draw gerin out of his inner darkness aye that there is van agreed he understood well enough what she was after and pitched his words to the fox elise settled herself by the fire to listen captain you knowor youve heard me saythe world is round no matter what any priest may blabber i know i should ive been round it maybe ten years ago when i was at the far eastern edge of this continent i hired on as a manatarms under a merchant named zairin he was moving a shipment of jade silk and spices from a place called ban yarang to selat a couple of hundred miles southeastward the folk are funny round those parts little yellowskins with slanting eyes like the shanda nomads it looks better on the women i must say still thats no part of the yarn zairin was one of those people who have no truck with the gods now in those parts its customary to check the omens by watching the way the sacred peacocks peck at grain if they eat well the journey will be a good one if not its thought wiser to try again some other time there we were all ready to set out and zairins righthand mana fat little fellow named tzembrought us a bird from the shrine he poured out the grain but the peacock who probably hadnt much liked traveling slung under his arm for more than a mile just looked at it he wouldnt touch it for anything not that bird zairin sat watching this getting madder and madder finally the old bandit had himself a gutful he got up on his feet and roared out if he wont eat let him drink may my beard fall out if i lie he picked up that peacock chucked it into the kemlong river which runs through ban yarang and started off regardless gerin was caught up in spite of himself dyaus its not a chance id like to take he said and you the fellow who curses oracles you can imagine what we were thinking most of the way though things went well enough the road was only a little track through the thickest jungle ive ever seen so we lost a couple of porters to venomous snakes the poor barefoot fools stepped on and one more to a bloodsucking demon that left him no more than a withered husk when we found him the next morning but on a trip like that you learn to expect such things zairin was mightily pleased with himself he kept laughing and telling anyone whod listen what a lot of twaddle it was to pay any attention to a fool bird well a day and a half before we would have made selat and proved the old croaker right everything came unraveled at once a dam broke upstream from where we were fording five men and half our donkeys drowned the customs man zairin knew at the border had been transferred and i shudder to think of the silver his replacement gouged out of us half the men got a bloody flux it bothered me for two years and just to top everything off old zairin came down with the crabs from then on captain he was a believer i can tell you go howl gerin said i was hoping youd cheer me with a yarn where a prophesy turned out wrong i know enough of the other sort myself for that you can stand first watch can i now well you can the outlander scorched gerin in more tongues than the fox knew finally he said captain fair is fair i ll wrestle you for it arent you the bloodthirsty one i thought youd had enough fighting for one day gerin got up and pulled off his tunic he helped van undo the leather laces of his backandbreast his friend sighed as the weight came off in kilt and sandals van seemed more a wargod than ever his muscles rippled as he stretched the forest of golden hair on his chest and belly flashed in the firelight only his scars told of his humanityand his turbulent past one terrible gash ran from right armpit to navel every time gerin saw it he wondered how the outlander had lived not that he was unmarked himself sword spear knife and arrow had left their signatures on his skin and the cut aingus had given him was only half healed seeing elises eyes travel from vans enormous frame to him he knew he seemed a stripling beside his companion though he was a wellmade man of good size but he had a name as a wrestler on both sides of the niffet he had learned more tricks from masters south of the kirs than his neighbors ever imagined and threw men much bigger than himself for all that though vans raw strength was enough to flatten him as often as he could finesse his way to victory when word went out that they would tussle even trokmoi came to watch and bet embarrassed that her look had been seen and understood elise dropped her eyes gerin grinned at her he wont chuck me through a tree girl who says i wont van bellowed he charged like an avalanche gerin sprang to meet him ducking under the thick arms that would quickly have squeezed breath from him he hooked his own left arm behind vans right knee and rammed a shoulder into his friends hardmuscled middle van grunted and went down but a meaty paw dragged gerin after him they rolled thrashed and grappled in the dirt gerin ended up riding his friends broad back his hands had slid under the outlanders shoulders his hands were clasped behind vans neck van slapped the ground gerin let him up he shook his head and rubbed his eye to rout out some dust youll have to show me that one again gerin he said another fall the baron shrugged all right but the last one was for the watch van nodded in midnod he leaped gerin had no chance to use any of his feints or traps he was seized lifted and slammed to earth with ribjarring force van sprang on him like a starving lion onto a fat sheep thoroughly pinned gerin grumbled get off me you pile of suet van snorted and pulled him to his feet they both swore as they swabbed each others scratches with beersoaked rags the stuff stung foully after supper gerin began to regret not having the first watch he was sure he was too full of troubles to sleep despite the days exertions he tossed wriggled until a small stone no longed gouged his back wished the crickets were not so loud van watched his friends face relax as slumber overtook him he was not too worried about the barons dejection he had seen him downhearted before and knew he recovered quickly but the fox deeply felt his responsibilities if anything a menace to his lands hit him harder than a threat against himself more and more clouds blew in from the west pale against the dark blue dome of the sky math a day past first quarter and mottled tiwaz now nearly full jumped in and out of sight a couple of hours before midnight dim nothos waning gibbous disk joined them the wind carried a faint salt tang from the orynian ocean far away van scrubbed dried blood from his armor and helm waiting till it was time to wake gerin rain threatened all through the foxs watch it was still dark when the first spatters came elise jerked as a drop splashed her cheek she woke up all at once like a soldier smiling at gerin she said the gods in the heaven send drippingtressed rain to nourish sweet hope in a desert of painor so the poet says anyway he stared at her the passage of a night had eased much of his gloom now surprise banished the rest where did you learn to quote lekapenos and whose rendering was that whoever did it knows his sithonian well as for the rendering she shrugged its mine that passage always appealed to me and where else would i learn my letters than from the epics that held much truth the baron still recalled the godlike feeling hed had when the curious marks on parchment began to correspond with the verses hed learned by ear thoughtfully he started getting ready to travel again gerin was glad to exchange the dirt road that led to ikos for the main southbound highway before the former became a bottomless river of mud moments later he was wondering at the wisdom of his choice from behind him came a drumming of hooves the deadly clangor of bronze on bronze and wheels rumbling on a stone roadbeda squadron of chariotry moving fast van unshipped his spear and gerin began to string his bow then a deep voice sounded above the rising clatter way way for the men of aragis the archer the baron pulled off the road with almost unseemly haste ignoring the rain aragis troopers pounded past brave in surcoats of scarlet and silver a handful of draggled bandits were their reluctant companions proud hawk face never smiling aragis captainor maybe it was aragis himselfraised one arm in salute as his men thundered by some of them had leers for elise stares for vans fine cuirass the bandits looked stolidly ahead gerin guessed they could already see the headsmans axe looming large across their futures and precious little else whew van said as the chariots disappeared into the rain ahead this trip will make a fine yarn but its not something id like to do more than once which is true of most things that make good stories gerin said van laughed and nodded from ikos to cassat was a journey of two days to the baron they were a time of revelation for years his mind had not reached further than the harvest the balance of a blade or the best place to set an ambush but elise had read many of the works that were his own favorites and better yet thought on what she read they passed hour after hour quoting passages they liked and arguing meanings gerin had almost forgotten talk like this existed over the years all without his knowing it his mind had grown stuffy and stale now he relished the fresh new breeze playing through it van chimed in too from time to time he lacked the background gerin and elise shared but he had seen more of the varied ways of man than either and his wit was keen the purple bulk of the high kirs a great rampart looming tall on the southern horizon came to dominate the landscape eternal snow clung to many peaks scoffing at high summer below eight passes traversed the mountains seven the empire had painstakingly blocked over the years to keep out the northern barbarians in the foothills before the eighth squatted the town of cassat a monument to what might have been oren ii had planned it as a splendid capital for the new province his father had won its great central square was filled with temples triumphal arches law courts and a theater but fate had not been kind birds nested under the eaves of the noble buildings grass pushed up between marble pavingblocks the only reality to cassat was its barracks squat unlovely structures of wood and grimy plaster where a few hundred imperial soldiers pretended to rule the northlands a few streets of horsetraders swordsmiths joyhouses and taverns met their needs the dusty wind blew mournful through the rest of the town the empires dragon flag black on gold flew only over the barracks there did carus beos son the marchwarden of the north perform his office mice alone disputed in the courthouse oren had built once carus had been a favorite at court he had earned his present post some years back when the urfa massacred a column he led because of what he saw as exile to the cheerless north he despised and resented the border barons gerin called on him nonetheless few as they were carus men would help hold the border against the trokmoi could he be persuaded to send them north elise accompanied the baron van took the wagon to a leading trader of horseflesh seeking fresh animals to replace gerins weary beasts the marchwarden of the north sat at a wellscuffed desk piled high with parchments of all sizes he was sixty or a bit over his yellowishwhite hair had retreated to a ruff round his ears and the back of his neck leaving his pink scalp bare but for a meager forelock his eyes had dark pockets under them his jowls quivered when he lifted his head from whatever bureaucratic inconsequentiality gerins arrival had interrupted my man tells me you seek the assistance of the empire against the trokmoi surely the boldness of the brave holders of elabons frontier cannot have declined to such an abysmal level he said looking at gerin with no liking at all then his narrow eyes swiveled to elise and a murky gleam lit them the fox saw a liking there sure enough but only of the sort that made him want to kick carus stained teeth down his throat elise studied a point on the wall directly behind the marchwardens forehead surely not gerin said ignoring the fact that he had not been offered a seat he handed elise into a chair and took another for himself carus sallow cheeks reddened as if nothing had happened the fox resumed at the present time however circumstances are of unusual difficulty he told the marchwarden of balamung and his threatened invasion carus was drumming his nails on top of his desk by the time the fox finished let me see if i understand you correctly he said you expect the troops of the empire to get you out of trouble with this wizard into which you have gotten yourself now to justify this request for service you may point towhat among other things that we border barons have kept the trokmoi out of the empire for two hundred years and more a trivium carus waved his hand in a languid southern gesture which might have seemed courtly from rihwin but was only grotesque in a man of the marchwardens years and girth if i had my way we would merely send a few thousand tons of stone down behind the great gate that would quite nicely seal off the barbarians for all time horseballs gerin muttered elise heard him and grinned carus heard him too the baron had not intended that horseballs carus mouth moved in what might have been a smile but his eyes stayed cold ah the vivid turn of phrase of the frontier but do let me return to what i was saying indeed i think the empire would be as well off without you what do we gain from you after all no metals no grainonly trouble half the rebels of the past two hundred years have had northern ties you corrupt the calm orderly way of life we crave no my good lord gerin if the barbarians can eat you up they are welcome to you the fox had not really expected help from the marchwarden but he had not expected outright hatred either he drew in a long angry breath elise pressed his hand in warning but he was too furious to pay heed he spoke in the same polished phrases carus had used and the same venom rode them you complain the empire receives nothing from us up on the border we wonder what we get from you where are the men and chariots of the empire to help us drive away the northern raiders where are they when we fight among ourselves do you care not a bit for if we are kept distracted we cannot think of rebellion you judge and rightly our flesh and blood a better shield than any you might make of stone or wood and so we die for nothing bowing to carus gerin stood to go and you my fine marchwarden you have gained most of all from our thankless toil while we sweat and bleed to keep the border safe here you have stayed for the past twentyfive years shuffling parchments from one pile to the next and sitting on your fat fornicating fundament the last was a roar of surprising volume carus leaped to his feet fumbling for his sword but finding only an empty scabbard gerin laughed mockingly guards the marchwarden bleated when the men appeared he gabbled clap this insolent lout in chains and cast him in the dungeon until he learns politeness his eyes lingered on elise he reached out a flabby hand to take her arm i will undertake to instruct the wench personally the befuddlement on the guards faces was ludicrous they had not seen their master so active in years gerin made no move for his own blade he said mildly do you know what will happen if you seize us as soon as the barons learn of it they will come down in a body and leave your precious barracks so much kindling not long after that the trokmoi will be here to light it im almost sorry you wont live to watch what what nonsense are you spewing now illgark carus voice abruptly disappeared elise was tickling the soft skin under his chin with the tip of her dagger she smiled sweetly at him the blood drained from his face leaving it the color of the parchment on his desk moving very carefully he let go of her arm go he said in ragged parody of the tone he had used a moment before get out guards take them away to the dungeons sir asked one scorn in his voice no no just go carus sank back into his chair hands shaking and sweat gleaming on his bald head with as much ceremony as if it were a daily occurrence his men conducted gerin and elise from the marchwardens presence the sun was still high in the southwest the audience had made up in heat what it lacked in length gerin turned to elise and said i knew having you along would be a nuisance once he caught a glimpse of you the old lecher couldnt find a way to get me out of there fast enough dont be ridiculous im a mess of itself her hand moved to brush at her hair the baron surveyed her there was dust in her hair and a smudge of grime on her forehead but her green eyes sparkled the mild doses of sun she allowed herself had brought out a spray of freckles on her nose and cheeks her lips were soft and red and even in tunic and trousers she was plainly no boy easy there gerin told himself do you want to make ricolf your irreconcilable enemy too along with the trokmoi and wolfar he gave his beard a judicious tug youll do he said youll definitely do she snorted and poked him in the ribs he yelped and mimed a grab at her she made as if to stab him they were still smiling half an hour later when van pulled up in the wagon he smelled of horses and beer and had two new beasts in the traces a grin split his face when he saw how happy gerin looked himself gave you the men did he what oh no im afraid not the fox explained the fiasco van laughed loud and long gerin went on i expected nothing much and got just that you seem to have been busy thoughwhat sort of horse do you have there anyway he jerked a thumb at one of vans newly acquired animals unlike its companion a handsome gray gelding this roughcoated little beast was even less sightly than the shaggy woodsponies of the trokmoi but van looked scandalized he leaped down and rubbed the horses muzzle a quick snap made him jerk his hand away even so he said captain dont tell me you dont know a shanda horse when you see one the fool trader who had him didnt he thought he was putting one over on me well let him laugh a shanda horse will go all day and all night you cant wear one down if you try i like the bargain and you will too all right show me gerin helped elise up then climbed on himself van followed the wagon clattered out of cassat toward the great gate the sole remaining link the empire allowed itself with its northern provinces it was a long pull through the gate toward the end the gray horse was lathered and blowing but the pony from the plains showed no more sign of strain than if it had spent the day grazing gerin was impressed though elabon had not blocked this last way through the kirs her marshals had done their best to make sure no enemy could use it fortresses of brick and stone flanked the roadway watchmen tramped smartly along their battlements alert against any mischance the towers bronzesheathed wooden gates were closed now but could open to vomit forth chariots and footsoldiers against any invader wizards too aided in defending the empire they had their own dwellings twin needlelike spires of what seemed to be multicolored glass off which the late afternoon sun shimmered and sparkled should the fortresses armed might fail to blunt an attack the warlocks would set in motion the thousands of boulders heaped on either side of the pass and thus block it forever the arrangement left gerin uneasy what wizardry had made it could unmake he cheered slightly when he discovered the warriors in the fastnesses could also start the avalanche by purely natural means paths led up to the tops of the piles of scree and triggering rocks there had levers under them the fox did not envy the men who would work those levers the succession of powerful strongholds awed even van folk who huddle behind forts are dead inside he said but with forts like these it will be a while yet before anyone notices the reek of the corpse a brown and buff lizard chased a grasshopper into the road it danced madly under hooves and wagon wheels then vanished into a crevice in the rocks on the far side gerin never knew whether it had caught its bug traffic through the great gates was heavy traders headed north their donkeys brayed loud disgust at the weight of the packs they bore traders came south their donkeys brayed loud disgust over nothing at all mercenaries wandering wise men wizards and a good many travelers who fell into no neat schemeall used the imperial highway nearly two hours went by before the wagon reached the end of the pass golden under the light of the setting sun the southern land spread out ahead like a picture from a landscape masters brush field and forest town and orchard all were plain to see with brooks and rivers like lines of molten copper its a rare pretty country van said what are the people like people gerin shrugged id best keep an eye on my wallet then go howl youd bite a coin freegiven likely i would if i planned to spend it scoffer just then a warm dry breeze wafted up from the south it was sweet and spicy with the faintest tang of salt from the distant inner sea and carried scents the baron had forgotten like a swift stream breaching the dam that restrained it longburied memories flooded up in gerin he thought of the two years free from care he had spent in the capital then of the sterile worryfilled time sinceand was appalled why did i ever leave you he cried to the waiting land ahead father dyaus you know i would sooner have been a starving schoolmaster in the capital than king of all the northlands if thats how you feel why not stay in the south elise asked her voice was gentle for the fair land ahead had enchanted her as much as the fox why not indeed gerin said surpised he realized the notion had never crossed his mind and wondered why at last he sighed and shook his head were the danger behind me less great id leap at the chance like a starving longtooth but for better or worse my life is on the cooler side of the mountains much depends on me there if i stay i betray more than my own men i think the land will fall to balamung and i doubt it will slake his evil thirst that may happen yet the gods have given the northland little enough hope its partly my fault balamung is what he is if i can make amends i will i think you will do well elise said slowly often it seems the most glory is won by those who seek it least glory if i can stay alive and free without it i dont give a moldy loaf of journeybread for glory i leave all that to van ha van said do you want to know the real reason hes bound to go back my lady tell me gerin said curious to see what slander his friend would come up with captain youd need more than a wizard to drive you away from your books and you know it as well as i do there was enough truth in that to make gerin throw a lazy punch at van who ducked a good part of the baronys silver flowed south to the copyists and bookdealers in elabons capital they wound their way down from the pass hoping to reach a town before the sun disappeared gerin was less worried about the ghosts than he would have been on the other side of the mountains peace had reigned here for many years and the spirits were relatively mild for his part van grew eloquent about the advantages of fresh food a mug of ale or even wine a comfortable bed and perhaps though he did not say so a wench to warm it the road was flanked by a grove of fruit trees of a kind unknown north of the kirs not very tall they had graybrown bark shiny lightgreen leaves and eggshaped yellow fruit both leaves and fruit were fragrant but gerin remembered how astonishingly sour the fruit was to the tongue it was called he snapped his fingers in annoyance he had forgotten the very name as the trees began to thin another smell made its presence known through their perfume a faint carrion reek the barons lips drew back in a mirthless grimace i think weve found our town he said the road turned the screen of trees disappeared and sure enough the town was there it was not big enough to have a wall the fox was sure folk living ten miles from it had never heard its name nonetheless it aspired to cityhood in a way open to the meanest of hamlets by the road stood a row of crucifixes each with its slowrotting burden under them children played now and then shying a stone upward dogs slunk there too dogs with poor masters or none waiting for easy meals some of the spiked and roped criminals were not yet dead through sunbaked and blistered lips they begged for water or death each according to the strength left in him one newly elevated or unnaturally strong still howled defiance at gods and men his roars annoyed the carrion birds nearby strong black bills filled with noisome food they flapped lazily into the sky staring down with fine impartiality on town travelers and field they knew all would come to them in good time vans face might have been carved from stone as he surveyed the wretches elise was pale her eyes went wide with horror her lips shaped the word why but no sound emerged gerin tried not to remember his own thoughts when hed first encountered the malignant notions of justice the southerners had borrowed from sithonia maybe he said grimly i had my reasons for going home after all vi the town gerin learned its name was fibis did little to restore the luster of the southlands in the barons eyes the houses lining the northsouth road were little finer than the huts of his peasants only muddy alleys ankledeep in slops led away from that road the sole hostel fibis boasted was of a piece with the rest it was lowroofed dingy and small the sign outside had faded past legibility within the smell of old grease fought with but could not overcome the odor of stale urine from the dyeworks next door and the neverabsent stench of the crosses and the townsfolk city ways that had been sophisticated to the youth who traveled this road ten years before now seemed either foppish or surly gerin tried to strike up a conversation with the innkeeper a dour weathered old codger named grizzard but got only grunts in return he gave up and went back to the rickety table where his friends awaited supper if i didnt know better he said id take oath the fellow was afraid of me then he thinks youve already tasted his wine said van who was on his third mug what swill he swigged pursed his lips to spit but swallowed instead the rest of the meal was not much better than the wine plainly lack of competition was all that kept grizzard in business disgusted with the long fruitless day he had put in gerin was about to head for bed when a cheery voice said hello youre new here whats old grizzard given you to drink without so much as a byyourleave the fellow pulled up a chair and joined them he sniffed the wine grimaced and flipped a spinning silver disk to the innkeeper who made it disappear you can do better than this you thief he said to the foxs surprise grizzard could the baron studied his new acquaintance curiously for the man seemed made of pieces which did not belong together despite his heartiness his voice soon dropped so low grizzard could not hear what he said while his mouth was full of slang from the capital his homespun tunic and trousers were both rustic yet his chin sported a gray imperial and his shoes turned up at the toes both sithonian styles the name he gavejust tevis without patronymic or sobriquetwas one of the three or four commonest south of the mountains whoever he was he had a rare skill with words softly easily he enticed from gerin usually as closemouthed as any man alive the story of his travels and all without revealing a bit of his own purpose it was almost as if he cast a spell he paused a while in silent consideration his clear dark eyes studying the fox you have not been wellused by the empire he said at last gerin only shrugged his caution had returned he was wary of this smoothtalking man of mystery tevis nodded as if he had expected nothing more tell me he said do you know of moribar the magnificent his imperial majestys governor at kortys van who had drunk deep stared at tevis in owlish incomprehension elise was nearly asleep her head warm on gerins shoulder her hair tickled his cheek the scent of it filled his nose but in his mind the stench of the rood was stronger still here was the very thing carus beos son had feared most a potential rebel in the capital of sithonia seeking northern help at any other time the baron would have shed no tears to see the empire go up in civil war but now he needed whatever strength he could find at his back he chose his words with care tevis i dont know you and i didnt ask to know you if you say one word more to me you will have spoken treason and i will not hear it true ive had my quarrels with some of his majestys servants but if he does not plot against me in my land i have no right to plot against him in his i would not have drunk with you had i known what was in your mind here take this and go he set a coin on the table to pay for the jug of wine tevis smiled faintly keep it he said and this as well he took something from the pouch on his belt tossed it next to the coin and was gone into the night while gerin still gaped at what he had thrown a tiny bronze hand fingers beginning to curl into a fist oh great dyaus above he said an imperial hand he propped his chin on his palm and stared at the little token before him he could have been no more startled had it sprung up and slapped him in the face bristles rasped under vans fingers as he scratched his jaw and what in the five hells is that he asked with ponderous patience a secret agent spy informer call him what you will that doesnt matter but if id shown any interest in setting moribar on the throne by this time tomorrow wed be on crosses side by side waiting for the vultures to pick out our eyes ha id bite off their heads van seemed more concerned with the vultures than the crucifixion that would invite them thats one way of dealing with them i suppose gerin agreed mildly he woke elise she yawned and walked sleepily to the one room grizzard grudged female travelers van and gerin headed for their own pallets hoping they would not be bugridden almost as an afterthought the fox scooped up the diminutive but deadly emblem tevis had left behind though weary he slept poorly the quarrel with carus his jarring reintroduction to the dark side of the southlands and above all the brush with doom in the form of tevis kept him tossing all night the bed was hard and lumpy too when he awoke half a dozen red itchy spots on his arms and chest proved he had not slept alone van was unusually quiet at breakfast head hurt gerin asked as they walked to the stables what oh no its not that captain van hesitated finally he said ill tell you right out gerin last night i almost decided to buy myself a gig and get the blazes out of this crazy country gerin had imagined disaster piled on disaster but never in his worst nightmares had he imagined his friend leaving ever since van came to fox keep the two of them had been inseparable fighting back to back and then carousing and yarning far into the night each owed the other his life several times with a shock the baron realized van was a larger gustier version of his dead brother dagref losing him would be more than parting with a comrade part of the barons soul would go with him before he could put what he felt into words elise spoke first why would you want to leave now are you afraid the danger is in the north not here she seemed unwilling to believe her ears at any other time the outlanders wrath would have kindled if his courage was questioned now he only sighed and kicked at a pebble genuine distress was in his voice as he answered my lady look about you his wave encompassed not just the grubby little hamlet of fibis and the crosses outside it but all the land where the writ of the empire was law youve seen enough of me to know what i am and what my pleasures are fighting talking drinking aye and wenching too ill not deny but here what good am i if i break wind in the backhouse i have to look over my shoulder lest some listening spy call it treason its not the kind of life i care to lead worrying before i move not daring even to think gerin understood that well enough for much the same sense of oppression weighed on him but van was still talking i was all set to take my leave of you this morninghead north again i suppose but then i got to thinkinghe suddenly grinnedand i decided that if any boyloving imperial hand doesnt like the way i speak why ill carve the son of a pimp into steaks and leave him by the side of the road to warn his scurvy cousins elise laughed in delight and kissed him on the cheek i think you planned this whole thing just to get that kiss gerin said come on you hulk quit holding up the works bastard still grinning van pitched his gear into the wagon the morning was still young when they splashed through the chilly langros river though not as great as the niffet or the mighty carastos which watered much of the plain of elabon its cold current ran swift as it leaped down from the kirs toward the greater inner sea the water at the ford swirled icily around gerins toes and welled up between the wagons floorboards most of the travelers belongings were safe in oiled leather sacks but half the journeybread turned to slimy brown paste gerin swore in disgust van said cheer up captain the stuff wasnt worth eating anyhow when they stopped to rest and eat van turned to gerin and said quietly thanks for not pushing me this morning you might have made it hard for me to stay i know gerin said neither of them mentioned the matter again they made good progress that day passing small farms in the foothills and then as the land began to level out going by great estates with splendid manorhouses set well back from the road when shadows lengthened and cool evening breezes began to blow they camped by the roadside instead of seeking an inn gerin fed and watered the horses as the sun set in the growing darkness the ghosts appeared but their wails were somehow muted their cries almost croons ellebs thin crescent soon followed the sun like a small boy staying close to his father that left the sky to the stars and math whose gibbous disk bathed the land beyond reach of the campfire in pale golden light as the night went on she was joined by tiwaz whose speedy flight through the heavens had taken him well past full and when gerins watch was nearly done nothos poked his slowmoving head over the horizon the baron watched him climb for most of an hour then gave the night to van the next day gave every promise of rolling along as smoothly as had its predecessor the promise was abruptly broken a bit before noon a manorholder had decided to send his geese to market the road was jammed by an endless array of tall white birds herded along by a dozen or so men with sticks the geese honked cackled squabbled and tried to sneak off the road for a mouthful of grain they did everything in fact but hurry when gerin asked their warders to clear a way so he could pass they refused if these blame birds get into the fields one said well be three days getting them all out again and our lordll have our heads lets charge right through van suggested cant you see the feathers fly the thought of a goose stampede brought a smile to gerins lips but he said no these poor fellows have their job to do too i suppose and so they fretted and fumed while the birds dawdled along in front of them more traffic piled up behind as time dragged on vans direct approach looked better and better the whip twitched in gerins hand but before he used it he noticed the road was coming to a fork the geese streamed down the eastern path can we use the western branch to get to the capital he called you can that one of the flocktenders answered so the fox swung the wagon down the new way new hardly gerin noticed that none of the others stalled behind the geese used the clear road soon enough he found out why the eastern branch of the highway was far newer after it was complete evidently nobody had bothered with the other one again the wagon jounced and rattled as it banged over gaping holes in the roadbed on one stretch the paved surface vanished altogether there the blocks had been set not in concrete but in molten lead locals had carried away blocks and valuable mortar alike as soon as imperial inspectors no longer bothered to protect them the baron cursed the lout who had sent him down this road he hoped he could make it without breaking a wheel the district had perhaps once been prosperous but had decayed when its road was superseded the farther they went the thicker the forest grew until at last its arms clasped above the roadway and squirrels flirted their bushy gray tails directly overhead soon the very memory of the road would be gone finding a village in the midst of such decline seemed divine intervention the villagers fell on gerin and his friends like longlost relatives plying them with food and a rough heady country wine and listening eagerly to every word they brought of the world outside not a copper would they take in payment the baron blessed such kindly folk and blessed them doubly when they confirmed that the road did in fact eventually lead to the capital instead of sinking into a bog you see captain you worry too much van said everything will work out all right gerin did not answer he could not let things work out all right he had to make them do so backtracking would have cost him a day he could not afford to spend the villagers insisted on putting up their guests for the night gerins host was a lean farmer named badoc son of tevis the baron hid a shiver other villagers just as anxious for news claimed elise and van the benches round badocs table were filled to overflowing by the farmer his plump friendly wife leunadra the fox and a swarm of children these ranged in age from a boy barely able to toddle to badocs twin daughters callis and elminda who were about seventeen gerin eyed the striking girls appreciatively they had curly hair sparkling brown eyes and cheeks rosy under sunbestowed bronze their thin linen tunics clung to young breasts as subtly as he could the baron turned the conversation in their direction they hung on his every word so long as he was talking about van to his own charms they remained sublimely indifferent i wish your friend could stay here one of the twins mourned gerin had forgotten which was which they both babbled on about vans thews his armor his rugged features his smile and on and on until gerin began to hate the sound of his comrades name badocs craggy face almost smiled as he watched his guests discomfiture at last the ordeal was over the baron quite alone and by then glad of it went to his bed his feet hung over the end for badoc had ousted one of his younger sons to accommodate the fox gerin was tired enough that it fazed him not a bit a womans cry woke him around midnight another followed then another long and drawn out evoi evoiii the baron relaxed it was only the followers of mavrix the sithonian god of wine out on one of their moonlight revels gerin was a bit surprised mavrixs cult had spread to this outoftheway place but what of it he went back to sleep the next morning he discovered the considerate villagers had not only curried his horses till their coats gleamed but also left gifts of fresh bread wine cheese onions and bars of dried fruit and meat in the back of the wagon a troop of small boys followed him south until their parents finally called them home i almost hate to leave van said gerin studied him was he still wearing the traces of a satisfied grin what if he is witling the baron asked himself do you begrudge him his good fortune well yes a little his inner voice answered the road was a bit better south of the village at least it never disappeared under the trees the air was cool and moist the sunlight subdued gerin felt more at home than he had since leaving ricolfs keep he was not alone he heard elise softly humming a song of the north country she smiled when she saw him watching her they came to a clearing almost wide enough to be called a meadow hidden away deep in the forest the fox squinted at the sudden brightness a doe which had been nibbling at the soft grass by the forests edge lifted its head at the wagons noisy arrival and sprang into the woods pull over will you van said the outlander reached for gerins bow and quiver though he disdained archery in battle he loved to hunt and was a fine shot he trotted across the clearing and vanished among the trees with grace and silence a hunting cat might have envied sighing gerin threw down the reins and stretched out fulllength on the sweetsmelling grass sore muscles began to unkink elise stepped down and joined him the horses were as glad at the break as the people they cropped the grass with as much alacrity as the deer had shown minute followed minute but van gave no sign of returning hes probably forgotten which end of the arrow goes first gerin said he rose went to the wagon and emerged with vans spear carrying this i shouldnt wonder every time he touched it he marveled at his friends skill with such a heavy weapon he practiced slow thrusts and parries to while away the time more than a little conscious of elises eyes on him showing off in front of a pretty girl was a pleasure he did not get often enough more and more he resented the wound that had kept him from courting this particular pretty girl it was not that he lacked for women if nothing else a barons prerogatives were enough to prevent that though he was moderate in his enjoyment of them and never bedded a wench unwilling but none of his partners had roused more than his lusts and he quickly tired of each new liaison in elise he was beginning to suspect something he had thought rare to the point of nonexistence a kindred soul he had just dispatched another imaginary foe when a crackle in the bushes on the far side of the clearing made him raise his head van back at last he thought he filled his lungs to shout a greeting it died unuttered only a thin whisper emerged and that directed at elise do just what i tell you walk very slowly to the far side of the wagon then run for the woods move he snapped when she hesitated he made sure she was on her way before loping into the middle of the clearing to confront the aurochs it was a bull a great roan shaggy shoulders higher than a tall mans head scars old and new crisscrossed its hide its right horn was a shattered ruin broken in some combat or accident long ago the other curved out and forward a glittering spear of death the aurochs ears twitched as it stared at the puny man who dared challenge it the certainty of a charge lay like a lump of ice in gerins belly any aurochs would attack man or beast but a lone bull was doubly terrible dragos grandfather had died under the horns and stamping hooves of just such a foe quicker even than the fox expected the charge came the beasts hooves sent chunks of sod flying skyward there was no time to throw vans spear gerin could only hurl himself to his left diving to the turf he had a glimpse of a green eye filled with insane hatred then the aurochs was past the jagged stump of its horn passing just over him the rank smell of its skin fought the clean odors of grass and dirt gerin was on his feet in an instant but the aurochs was already wheeling for another charge faster than any fourfooted beast had any right to be the fox hurled his spear but the cast was hurried and high it flew over the aurochs shoulder only a desperate leap saved gerin had the bull had two horns he would surely have been spitted as it was he knew he could not elude it much longer in the open he sprang up and sprinted for the forest snatching the spear as he ran behind him came the drumroll of the aurochs hooves the small of his back tingled anticipating the horn then breath sobbing in his throat he was among the trees timber cracked as the aurochs smashed through brush and saplings still it had to slow as it followed his dodges from tree to tree he hoped to lose it in the wood but it pursued him with a deadly patience he had never known an aurochs to show its bellows and snorts of rage rang loud in his ears deeper and deeper into the forest he ran following a vague game trail that came to an abrupt end some time not long before a forest giant had toppled falling directly across the path its collapse brought down other trees and walled off the trail as thoroughly as any work of mans might have done gerin clambered over the dead timer the aurochs was not far behind the foxs wits had been frozen in dismay from the moment the aurochs appeared in the clearing they began to work again as he leaped down from the deadfall panting i cant run any farther anyway he jabbed the bronzeclad butt of vans spear deep into the soft earth then blundered away into the forest having thrown his dice for the last time ever louder came the thunder of the aurochs hooves till the fox could feel the ground shake for a terrible moment he thought it would try to batter through the dead trees but it must have known that was beyond its power it hurled its bulk into the air easily clearing the manhigh barrierand spitted itself on the upthrust spear the tough wood of the spearshaft shivered into a thousand splinters but the leafshaped bronze point was driven deep into the aurochs vitals it staggered a couple of steps on wobbling legs blood spurting from its belly then a great gout poured from its mouth and nose it shuddered and fell its sides heaved a last time then were still it gave the fox a reproachful brown bovine stare and died gerin rubbed his eyes in his dance with death out on the meadow he had been sure the beasts eyes were green his own hand came away bloody he must have been swiped by a branch while dashing through the forest but he had no memory of it shows how much i know he thought he wearily climbed back over the deadfall he had not gone far when van came crashing down the game trail drawn bow in his hands elise was right behind him the outlander skidded to a stop his jaw dropping how are you captain he asked foolishly alive much to my surprise butthe aurochs elise said van stopped the picture of confusion gerin was just glad elise had had the sense to go after his friend instead of showing herself to the aurochs and probably getting herself killed im afraid ill have to buy you a new spear when we get to the capital he said van hauled himself over the barrier he came back carrying the spearpoint bronze was too valuable to leave what in the name of the trident of shamadraka did you do he asked the baron wondered where shamadrakas worshipers lived he had never heard of the god climbing those trunks took everything i had left he said the beast was hunting me like a houndive never known anything like it he would have had me in a few minutes but by some miracle i remembered a fable i read a long time ago about a slave who was too lazy to hunt hed block a trail set a javelin behind his barrier and wait for the deer to skewer themselves for him elise said i know the fable you mean the tale of the deer and mahee in the end hes killed by his own spear and a good thing too he was a cruel wicked man you got the idea for killing the brute out of a book van shook his head out of a book captain i swear ill never sneer at reading again if it can show you something thatll save your neck the real pity of it is youll never have a chance to brag about this and why not gerin had been looking forward to doing just that slaying a bull aurochs singlehanded with a spear dont be a fool gerin who would believe you van had killed his doe while the baron battled the aurochs he dumped the bled and gutted carcass into the wagon and urged the horses southward none of the travelers wanted to spend the night near the body of the slain aurochs not only would it draw unwelcome scavengers but the spilled blood was sure to lure hungry lonely ghosts from far and wide all eager to share the unexpected bounty of the kill when the failing light told them it was time to camp the deer proved toothsome indeed van carved steaks from its flanks they roasted the meat over a fire but despite a full belly the outlander was unhappy he grumbled i feel naked without my spear what will i do without it in a fight gerin was less than sympathetic seeing that youve brought a mace an axe three knives only two the third is just for eating my apologies two knives then and a sword so heavy i can hardly lift it let alone swing it so i think youll find some way to make a nuisance of yourself a nuisance van was he plucked a long straw from elises hand leaving the short oneand the first watchfor gerin the fox tried not to hear his friends comfortfilled snores his sense of the basic injustice of the universe was only slightly salved when elise decided not to fall asleep at once gerin was glad of her company without it he probably would have dozed for the night was almost silent the sad murmurs of the ghosts heard with the minds ear rather than the bodys were also faint the lure of the dead aurochs reached for miles leaving the surrounding countryside all but bare of spirits for some reason the fox could not fathom elise thought he was a hero for slaying the aurochs he felt more lucky than heroic there was precious little glory involved in running like a rabbit which was most of what hed done had he not plucked what he needed from his rubbishheap of a memory the beast would have killed him fool luck he concluded nonsense elise said dont make yourself less than you are in the heat of the fight you were able to remember what you had to know and more to do something with it you need more than muscle to make a hero not convinced gerin shrugged and changed the subject asking elise what she knew of her kin in the capital her closest relative there it transpired was her mothers brother valdabrun the stout who held some position or other at the emperors court though he did not say gerin found that a dubious recommendation his imperial majesty hildor iii was an indolent dandy and the baron saw little reason to expect his courtiers to be different to hide his worry he talked of the capital and his own two years there elise was a good audience as city life of any sort was new to her he told a couple of his better stories her laugh warmed the cool evening she moved closer to him eager to hear more he leaned over and kissed her it seemed the most natural thing in the world to do for a moment her lips were startled and still under his then she returned the kiss at first hesitantly then with a warmth to match his own you do have a gift for complicating your life he told himself as she snuggled her head into his shoulder if things go on the way they ve started not only will wolfar want to cut out your heart and eat it a project hes been nursing quite a while anyhow but your old friend ricolf will be convincednote or no noteyou ran off with his daughter for reasons having very little to do with taking her to her uncle and what is she thinking shes no peasant wench to be honored by a tumble and then forgotten and further a plague on it all he thought he kissed her again but when his lips touched her soft white throat and his hands moved to slide inside her tunic she asked him softly was it for this then you decided to bring me south have i traded one wolfar for another she tried to keep her tone light but hurt and disappointment were in her voice they stopped him effectively as a dagger drawn perhaps more so she slipped free of his encircling arm breath whistled through his nostrils as he brought his body back under minds rein i would never have you think that he said nor do i in truth she replied but the hurt was still there the time to remember he was man and she maid might come later he thought it was not here yet despite the cool quiet of the night and the moonlight filtering through the trees she was silent so long he thought her still upset but when he framed further apologies she waved them away they talked of inconsequential things for a little while then she rose and walked to the wagon for her bedroll as she passed him she stooped her lips brushed his cheek his mind was still thoughtfilled long after she had fallen asleep ellebs thick waxing crescent was well set and the nearly full math bright as a golden coin beginning to wester when he woke van and sank into exhausted slumber his dreams at first were murky filled now with the aurochs now with elise he remembered little of them he rarely did and thought strange those who could recall their dreams and cast omens from them but then it was as if a gale arose within his sleeping mind and blew away the mists separating him from the country of dreams clear as if he had been standing on the spot he saw the great watchfires flame heard wild music of pipe horn and harp skirl up to the sky saw tall northern warriors gathered by the fires some with spears others with drinkinghorns in their hands this is no common dream he thought and felt fear but he could not leave it not even when black wings drowned his sight in darkness those proved to be the edges of the wizards cloak balamung wore the sorcerer stepped back a pace to be silhouetted against the firelight like a bird of prey only his eyes were live things embers of scarlet and amber set in his gaunt face the barbarian mage was only too aware of the fox he turned a trifle and bowed a hatefilled bow as if the baron had been there in the flesh the light played redly off his hollow cheeks he said lord gerin the fox its no less than a nuisance you are to me no less so i pray youll forgive my costing you a dollop of sleep to show you whats waiting in the northlands whilst you scuttle about the filthy south would i could be drawing the blackhearted soul of you from your carcass but theres no spell i ken to do it what with you so far away no spell gerin knew could have reached across the miles at all he was nothing not even a wraith just eyes and ears bound to see and hear only what balamung chose to reveal the trokmoi danced round the fires tossing swords spears aye and drinkinghorns too into the air the barons disembodied spirit was less terrified than it might have been the dance was one of those rihwin had performed atop ricolfs table it seemed an age ago but balamung surely knew the baron expected him to arm for war what else had he been summoned to see balamung called down curses on the foxs head he hoped they would not bite deep on and on the wizard ranted until he paused to draw breath then he went on more calmly saying not least do i mislike you for costing me the soul of a fine fighting man this day like a wee bird i sent it flitting out to light in the body of the great aurochs sure as sure i was hed stomp you to flinders and leave you dead by the side of the road curse your tricky soul how did you escape him his spirit died trapped in the beast for i could not draw it free in time and when it flickered away his body was forfeit too poor wight no wonder the bull had trailed him with such grim intensity maybe hed been right when he thought its eyes were green there in the meadow that might have been some byproduct of balamungs magic he had been lucky indeed but sure and ill have my revenge balamung screamed behind him the music had fallen silent the dancers stood motionless and expectant the spell the mage used must have been readied beforehand for when he cried out in the harsh kizzuwatnan tongue a stout wicker cage rose from the ground and drifted slowly toward the fire gerins spirit quailed when he saw it he knew the trokmoi burned their criminals alive and in this cage too a man struggled vainly to free himself die traitor die balamung shouted all the gathered warriors took up the cry horror rose in gerin who suddenly recognized the condemned prisoner it was divico the trokme chieftain whose life he had spared at ikos he wished sickly that he had let van give the northerner a clean death have a look at what befalls them who fight me balamung whispered for your turn is next his voice was cold as ice harsh as stone and while he spoke the cage entered the blaze some minor magic had proofed the wicker against flame no fire would hold on it but wherever a tongue licked divico it clung flaring as brightly as if his body were a pitchsoaked torch held there by balamungs wizardry gerin watched in dread as the flames boiled divicos eyeballs in his head melted his ears into shapeless lumps of meat that sagged and ran against his cheeks then charred the flesh from those cheeks to leave white bone staring through fire cavorted over the trokmes body but balamungs evil magic would not let him die he fought against the unyielding door until his very tendons burned away his shrieks had stopped long before when flames swallowed his larynx he was a job i had to rush balamung said when its you now fox falling into my hand ill take the time to think up something truly worthy of you oh indeed and i will he made a gesture of dismissal gerin found himself staring up from his bedroll body wet with cold sweat bad dream captain van asked gerins only answer was a grunt he was too shaken for coherent speech divicos face eaten by flames still stood before his eyes more vivid than the dimly lit campsite he really saw he thought he would never want to sleep again but his weary body needed rest more than his mind feared it the sounds of a scuffle woke him before he could do more than open his eyes strong hands pinned him to the ground it was still far from sunrise did bandits in the southland dare the darkness or was this some new assault of balamungs he twisted trying to lever himself up on an elbow and see who or what had overcome him be still or ill rend thee where thou liest the voice was soft tender female and altogether mad more hands all full of casual deranged strength pressed down his legs they tugged warningly he felt his joints creak all hope left him after he had escaped balamungs forays it seemed unfair for him to die under the tearing hands of the votaries of mavrix why had the winegods orgiastic frenzied cult ever spread outside his native sithonia moving very slowly the baron turned his head trying to see the extent of the disaster perhaps one of his comrades had managed to get away but no in the moonlight he saw van his vast muscles twisting and knotting to no avail pinned by more of the madwomen still more had fastened themselves to elise the maenads eyes reflected the firelight like those of so many wolves that was the only light in them they held no human intelligence or mercy for they were filled by the madness of the god the finery in which they had begun their trek through the woods was ripped and tattered and splashed with mud and grime their hair awry and full of twigs one woman plainly a lady of high station from the remnants of fine linen draped about her body clutched the mangled corpse of some small animal to her bosom crooning over and over my baby my baby a blue light drifted out of the forest a shining nimbus round a figure godlike was the only word for it gerin thought what have we here the figure asked voice deep and sweet like the drink the desert nomads brewed to keep off sleep mavrix the women breathed their faces slack with ecstasy gerin felt their hands quiver and slip he braced himself for a surge but even as he tensed the god waved and the grip on him tightened again what have we here mavrix repeated van gave a grunt of surprise how is it you speak my language to the fox it had been elabonian he didnt the protest died halfspoken as his captors snarled the god made an airy effeminate gesture we have our ways he said and suddenly there were two of him standing side by side theyhegestured again and there was only one as well as he could gerin studied mavrix the god wore fawnskin soft and supple with a wreath of grape leaves round his brow in his left hand he bore an ivytipped wand at need gerin knew it was a weapon more deadly than any mortals spear mavrixs blond curls reached his shoulder his cheeks and chin were shaven that softfeatured smiling face was a pederasts dream but for the eyes two black pits reflecting nothing giving back only the night a faint odor of fermenting grapes and something else a rank something gerin could not name clung to him that must be a useful art the baron spoke in halting sithonian trying to pique the gods interest and buy at least a few extra minutes of life mavrix turned those fathomless eyes on the fox but his face was still a smiling mask he answered in the same tongue how pleasant to hear the true speech once more albeit in the mouth of a victim and gerin knew his doom are you in league with balamung then he growled knowing nothing he said now could hurt him further i friend to some fribbling barbarian charlatan what care i for such things but surely friend mortal you see this is your fate the madness of the mavriad cannot must not be thwarted were it so the festival would have no meaning for what is it but the ultimate negation of all the petty nonfulfillments of humdrum everyday life its not right elise burst out dying i can understand everyone dies soon or late but after the baron gerinthe fox thought it a poor time to rhyme but kept quietsinglehanded slew the aurochs to die at the hands of lunatics goddriven or no mavrix broke in deep voice cracking gerin slew a great wild ox the gods smile gave way to an expression of purest horror the oxgoad come again he screamed but now in the shape of a man metokhites i thought you slain with a final despairing shriek the god vanished into the depths of the woods his followers fled after afflicted by his terrorall but the lady of rank who still sat contentedly rocking her gruesome baby still amazed at being alive gerin slowly sat up so did elise and van both wearing bewildered expressions what did i say elise asked gerin thumped his forehead trying to jar loose a memory he had paid scant attention to mavrix in the past as the gods principal manifestations wine and the grape were rare north of the kirs i have it he said at last snapping his fingers this metokhites was a sithonian prince long ago once he chased the god into the lesser inner sea beating him about the head with a metaltipped oxgoad mavrix always was a coward i suppose he thought i was a newwhat would the word beincarnation of his tormentor what happened to this metokhites fellow van asked its not the smartest thing tangling with gods as i remember he chopped his son into bloody bits being under the impression the lad was a grapevine a grapevine you say well captain if i ever seem to you to go all green and leafylike be so good as to warn me before you try to trim me at that the last of the maenads lifted her eyes from the ruined little body she dandled there was a beginning of knowledge in her face though she was not yet fully aware of herself or her surroundings her voice had some of the authority of the sibyl at ikos when she spoke mock not mavrix lord of the sweet grape rest assured you are not forgotten gathering her rags about her she swept imperiously into the woods silence fell on the camp vii taking advantage of the quiet of the ghosts gerin decided to leave at once though he knew mere distance was even less guarantee of safety from mavrix than from balamung no thunderbolt smote him before too much time had passed the rising sun turned tiwaz and math to a pair of pale gleams hanging close together in the southern sky so full of events had the previous day been that the fox took till midafternoon to remember his dream if such it was by that time they were on the main road again three more corpuscles among the thousands flowing toward the empires heart so thats why you woke with such a thrash van said then the full import of the barons words sank in youre saying the scrawny son of nobody knows where we are and what were up to gerin rubbed his chin where we are anyway im not sure i like that i know damned well i dont but what can i do about it the fox spent a gloomy watchful night fearing a return visit from mavrix the oracular tones of the gods halfcrazed worshiper had left him jittery the watch was lonely too van fell asleep at once and elise quickly followed him that day on the road she had hardly spoken to the baron she spent most of her time listening to vans yarns he would cheerfully spin them for hours on end she gave gerin nothing more than cool courtesy when he tried to join the conversation at length he subsided feeling isolated and vaguely betrayed the left side of his mouth quirked up in a sour smile he knew only too well that his illtimed ardor was what made her wary the new morning began much as the day before had ended gerin and elise cautious and elaborately polite while van who seemed oblivious to the tension around him bawled out a bawdy tune he had learned from the trokmoi so it went till they reached the pranther river another of the streams that rose in the foothills of the kirs and ended by swelling the waters of the greater inner sea the road did not falter at the pranther but sprang over it on a bridge supported by eight pillars of stone the span itself was of stout timbers which could be removed at need to slow invaders this bridge was no flimsy magicians trickit looked ready to stand for a thousand years van gazed at it with admiration what a fine thing it beats getting your backside wet any day its probably the most famous bridge in the empire gerin told him grinning the bridge over the pranther was one of his favorite places in the south its called dalassenos revenge whys that captain dalassenos was oren the builders chief architect he was the fellow who designed this bridge but oren wanted only his own name on it being a sithonian dalassenos didnt have much use for the emperor in the first place and that was too much to bear so he carved his own message into the rock then put a coat of plaster over it and chiseled orens name in that after a few years the plaster peeled away andwell see for yourself he jerked a thumb at the pylon its only so many scratches to me i dont read sithonian or much else for that matter gerin thought for a moment as near as i can put it into elabonian it says the plaster above twas nought but a farce and as for king oren he can kiss my arse van bellowed laughter ho ho that calls for a snort a blind reach into the back of the wagon brought him his quarrya wineskin he swigged noisily dalassenos flip insolence also earned the fox a smile from elise her appreciation was worth more to him than vans chuckles what happened to dalassenos when the plaster wore off she asked the friendly interest in her voice told gerin he had been forgiven not a thing he answered it lasted through orens life and he died childless he liked boys his successor hated him for almost bankrupting the empire with all his building and likely laughed his head off when he learned what dalassenos had done i know he sent dalassenos a pound of gold tight though he was as they passed over the bridge gerin looked down into the pranthers clear water a green manlike shape caught his eye it was so close to the surface that he could easily see the four scarlet gillslits on either side of its neck the pranther held the only colony of rivermen west of the greater inner sea dalassenos had brought the reptiles here from their native sithonian streams the canny artificer knew stones and sand propelled by the pranthers current would eventually scour away the riverbottom from under his bridges pilings and bring it tumbling down hence the rivermen they repaired such damage as fast as it occurred in exchange the empire banned humans from fishing in the pranther and gave the rivermen leave to enforce the prohibition with their poisoned darts it was also said that dalassenos had hired a wizard to put a spell of permanent plenty on the fish the baron did not know about that but the rivermen had flourished in the pranther for more than three hundred years gerin heard the screech of an eagle overhead shielding his eyes from the sun he looked up into morning haze until he found it it wheeled in the sky sun striking sparks from its ruddy plumage its feathers he mused were red as a trokmes mustache sudden suspicion flared in him as he realized what hed thought van do you think you can bring me down that overgrown pigeon he asked knowing his friends mighty arms could propel a shaft farther than most men dreamed possible the outlander squinted upward shook his head no more than i could flap my arms and fly to fomor fomor is it tiwaz i mean whatever fool name you give the quick moon two years with me and you still talk like a trokme gerin sadly shook his head go howl captain whats in your mind the fox did not answer he pulled the wagon off the road the eagle gave no sign of flying away nor had he expected any he had never seen a red eagle and was convinced it was some creature of balamungs a flying spy he climbed down from the wagon and began to root among the bushes by the roadside what are you looking for gerin elise asked sneezeweed he answered not finding any he muttered a curse the plant was a rank pest near fox keep it grew everywhere in the northlands even invading wheatfields when it flowered those sensitive to its pollen went into a seasonlong agony of wheezing sneezing runny eyes and puffy faces the dried pollen was also a firstrate itching powder as small boys soon learned the fox remembered a thrashing his brother dagref had given him over a pair of sneezeweedimpregnated breeches at last he found a ragged sneezeweed plant huddling under two bigger bushes its shiny dark green leaves sadly bugeaten he murmured a prayer of thanks to dyaus when he saw a spike of pink flowers still clinging to it it would serve for the small magic he had in mind he ran the spell over and over in his head hoping he still had it memorized it was simple enough and one all prentices learneda fine joke on the unwary at the sorcerers collegium one quickly learned not to be unwary he held the spray of sneezeweed flowers in his left hand and began to chant his right hand moved through the few simple passes the spell required it took less than a minute when it was done he looked up and awaited developments for a moment nothing happened he wondered if he had botched the incantation or if it simply was not strong enough to reach the highflying eagle then the bird seemed to stagger in midflight its head darted under its wing to peck furiously no longer could it maintain its effortless rhythm through the air but fought without success to maintain altitude it descended in an ungainly spiral screaming its rage all the while and flopped into the bushes about twenty paces from the wagon van put an arrow through it it died still snapping at the shaft much pleased with himself the fox trotted over to collect the carcass he had just brought it to the wagon when elise cried out in warning two more red eagles were diving out of the morning sky stooping like falcons van had time for one hasty shot he missed cursing foully he snatched up the whip and swung it in a terrible arc it smashed into one bird with a sound like a thunderclap feathers flew in a metallic cloud the eagle gave a despairing screech and tumbled to the roadway the other one flew into gerins surprised arms it fastened its claw on the leather sleeve of his corselet seeming to think the garment part of its owner the fox plunged his free hand at its shining breast trying to keep its bill from his eyes it screamed and bucked buffeting him with vilesmelling wings there was a crunch van drove the butt end of the whip into the eagles head again and again the mad gleam in its golden eyes faded gerin slowly realized he was holding a dead weight blood trickled down his arm that leather sleeve had not altogether protected him a gleam of silver caught his eye the bird wore a tiny button at its throat held on by a fine chain the button bore only one mark a fylfot balamung sure enough gerin muttered van peered at it over his shoulder let me have a closer look at that will you he said gerin slipped the chain from the dead eagle s neck and passed it to him he hefted it thoughtfully lighter than it should be he squeezed it between thumb and finger grunting at the effort gives a little but not enough he brought down a booted foot clubfashion there was a thin hissing wail gerin gagged he thought of latrines of newdug graves fresh uncovered of scummed moats of long slow evils fermenting deep in the bowels of swamps and oozing upwards to burst as slimy bubbles the body in his arms writhed though he knew it was knew it had to be dead he looked down and dropped his burden with an exclamation of horror no longer was the corpse that of an eagle but of a trokme his head battered to a pulp fiery locks soaked in blood but the broken body was no bigger than the bird had been grimfaced he and van repeated the grisly experiment twice more each time with the same result as he buried the three tiny bodies in a common grave the pride he had felt in his sorcerous talent drained away like wine from a broken cup what good were his little skills against such power as balamung possessed power that could rob men of their very shapes and send them winging over hundreds of miles to slay at his bidding elise said it will take a mighty southern mage indeed to overcome such strength her voice was somber but somehow her words instead of depressing the baron lifted his spirits they reminded him he would not after all have to face balamung alone more and more their conflict was assuming in his mind the nature of a duel between himself and the northern wizard a duel in which the trokme owned most of the weapons but why was he here in the southlands if not for allies you have a gift for saying the right thing he told her gratefully she shook her head in pretty confusion he did not explain as the day wore on he felt better and better true balamung had tried to slay him from afar but twice now his efforts had come to nothing and every hour put more miles between him and his quarry late in the afternoon van pointed to a handsized roadside shrub not much different from its neighbors and said you know some plantlore gerintheres another useful plant for you that the fox said it looks like any other weed to me then you elabonians dont know what to do with it it grows out on the plains of shanda too the shamans there call it aoratos which means it lets you see a bit of the unseen when you chew the leaves not only that they help keep you awake on watch like i said a useful plant what do you mean it lets you see a bit of the unseen thats the only way i can explain it captain hold up a moment and ill let you see for yourself van uprooted the little bush and returned to the wagon gerin studied the plant curiously but it was so nondescript he could not say whether he had seen its like before he got to test its properties soon enough for he drew first watch that night the leaves were gritty and bitter their juice burned as he swallowed little by little he felt his tiredness slip away as he sat sentinel the night came alive around him the sky seemed to darken elleb just past first quarter shone with spectral clarity so when she rose did math a day past full the stars also seemed very bright and clear but that was the least effect of the aoratos plant the fox found he could tell with certainty where every live thing lurked within a hundred yards of the fire no matter how well concealed it was its life force impinged on him like a spot of light seen in the back of his mind he understood why van had had trouble talking about the experienceit seemed to use a sense his body did not normally employ he was even able to detect strange patterns of radiance within the ghosts though their flickering shapes remained indistinct as ever the extra perception gradually faded and was gone well before midnight on the whole he decided he approved of the aoratos plant if nothing else it made ambushes nearly impossible aye it does that van nodded when gerin told him of his feelings but you have to use near half the plant at every dose the gods know when well see another here i never did find one in the northlands you know nor did they find another aoratos bush the following day or the next or the next the last of its leaves stripped the little plant was tossed away and all but forgotten as the road swung east down into the great plain whose heart was elabons capital gerin found he had more important things to think about the dry warmth of the south the quality of the sunlight pouring down from the sky and the bustling people of the ever more numerous towns were calling forth a side of his nature he had had to hide on the frontier a gentler side his vassals would only have construed as weakness drago or rollan could never have understood his open admiration of a sunset his search for verses from lekapenos appropriate to its beauty his easy friendly dealing with merchants and innkeepers men at whom they would simply have barked orders he felt like a flower half of whose petals were seeing the sun for the first time in years the presence of elise beside him was a pleasant pain she unsettled him more than he was willing to admit even to himself he was too conscious of her as a woman to bring back all the ease of talk they had once enjoyed she stayed warm and friendly but deftly avoided anything truly personal seeming content with the inconclusive status quo her warmth extended farther than the fox too her laughing responses to vans outrageous flirtation grated on gerins nerves two days out from the capital the travelers found lodging at a tavern in a little town called cormilia the lass who served them there was short dark and though a bit plump quite pretty a tiny mole on her right cheek made her round face piquant something about her struck the foxs fancy when he raised an eyebrow at her she winked back saucily he was not surprised when she tapped at his door later that night while her thighs clasped him she seemed hotblooded enough for any mans taste but her ministrations immensely pleasant in the moment somehow left him less than satisfied after she slipped away he knew he had pleased her her adoring manner the next morning spoke of how much but the coupling only showed him the emptiness within himself he was preoccupied and curt and breakfasted without much noticing what he ate when he and van went out to the stable to hitch up the horses he blurted you know when dyaus created women he must have been in a fey mood you cant live with them and sure as sure cant live without them though surmise gleamed in vans eye he said nothing to that he knew gerin was a man who had to work things through in his own mind and often thought advice interference a briny breeze from the greater inner sea blew all day they might have made the capital by evening but gerin did not relish trying in the dark to find his old friend turgis inn the great citys maze of streets was bad enough by day the coming parting with elise also wrenched him more each mile he traveled he was far from eager to speed it unduly he decided to camp just in front of the last low ridge shielding the capital from sight as darkness fell the citys lights put a glow on the eastern horizon and bleached fainter stars from the sky in an area so densely peopled night travel was no longer unthinkable a brightly lit convoy of wagons and chariots rumbled past the campsite every few minutes often with a mumbling priest to help ward off the spirits of this van heard nothing for he fell asleep almost instantly but gerin did not pass his watch in lonely contemplation for the first time since the night mavrix appeared elise decided to stay up a while and talk the reason soon became clear she was bubbling over with excitement and curiosity about the capital and the family in it she had never seen she gushed on for a time then stopped embarrassed but this is terrible what a loon i am here i play the magpie over all ill see and do in the city and not a word of thanks to you who brought me here safe through so many troubles what must you think of me the answer to that had been slowly forming in the barons mind ever since he helped her slip from ricolfs keep her rhetorical question but served to bring it into sharper focus he replied hesitantly though for fear of her thinking he was abusing the privilege their companionship had given him its simple enough he said at last taking the plungethe thought of losing her forever filled him with more dread than any trokme horde after balamung and his woodsrunners are driven back to the forests where they belong nothing would make me happier than coming south again so i can court you properly he did not know what reaction he had expected from hercertainly not the glad acceptance she showed as things are now i cannot say as much as i would like she said but nothing would please me more her lips met his in a gentle kiss that gave him more contentment than all his sweaty exertions the night before in cormilia she went on foolish man did you not know i cried last year when i learned your wound would keep you from coming to my fathers holding he held her close his mind filling with a hundred a thousand foolish plans for the future the rest of the watch flew by like a dream as it would have for any lover who suddenly found his love returned if balamungs gaunt figure stood like a jagged reef between him and his dreams on this night he would pretend he did not see it elise fought sleep until math rose to add her light to that of elleb whose nearly full disc rode high in the south the baron watched her face relax into slumber murmured sleep warm and kissed her forehead she smiled and stirred but did not wake when gerin told van what he had done the outlander slapped his back saying and what took you so long the fox grunted half annoyed his friend had been able to follow his thoughts so well something else occurred to him we need to start right at sunrise tomorrow he said what why van did not seem to believe his ears i have my reasons they must be good ones to make a slugabed like you want an early start all right captain sunrise it is they topped the last rise just as the sun climbed over the eastern horizon it flamed off the greater inner sea and transformed the water to a lambent sheet of fire dazzling to the eye tiny black dots on that expanse were ships merchantmen with broad sails billowing in the fresh morning breeze and arrogant galleys striding over the waves like outsized spiders on oared legs elise who had never seen the sea cried out in wonder and delight she squeezed gerins hand the fox beamed proud as if hed created the vista himself van also nodded his appreciation very nice captain very nice he told the baron if thats all you can find to say youd likely say the same if farris herself offered to share your bed shes your goddess of love and such things at gerins nod van went on ill tell you fox that reminds me of a story which ill hear some other time gerin said firmly straight ahead on a spur of land thrusting out into the sea lay elabons capital all his attention centered there a thousand years before he knew it had been nothing but a farming village then the sithonians came west across the sea and the infant city now a center for sithonian trade with the folk they deemed barbarous westerners acquired its first wall its inhabitants learned much from the sithonians little by little it extended its sway over the fertile western plain drawing on ever greater reserves of men and resources soon it swallowed up the sithonian colonies on the western shore of the greater inner sea nor could the sithonians come to the aid of those colonies for sithonia itself divided into rival confederacies led by its two greatest citystates siphnos and kortys fell into a century of bloody civil war all the while elabon waxed no sooner had kortys at last beaten down her rival than she had to face the army of carlun worldbestrider whose victory ended the elabonian league and began the empire of elabon a great marble statue of him ten times as high as a man still looked east from the shore it was easy to spy silhouetted against the bright sea not far away from carluns monument stood the palace imperial gleaming like an inverted icicle it shot a spearpoint of marble and crystal to the sky an eternal fire burned at its apex a guide from afar to ships on the inner sea round it was a wide space of welltrimmed gardens so the palace itself almost seemed a plant grown from some strange seed near the palace was the nobles quarters their homes were less imposing by far than the emperors residence but most were far more splendid than anything north of the kirs to gerins mind though the rest of elabon was the empires true heart men of every race and tribe dwelt there it boiled and bubbled cauldronwise with the surge of life through its veins there was a saying that you could buy anything in elabon including the fellow who sold it to you the fox could have gazed on the city for hours but from behind a gruff bass voice roared move it there you whoreson do you want to diddle the whole day away the speaker was a merchant a loudly unhappy one gerin waved back at him this is the first time ive seen elabon in eight years he apologized the merchant was not appeased may it be your last then ever again you stand gawking you boyloving booby and here i am trying to make an honest living from tightfisted nobles and little bandit lordlings and all my thirty wagons are piling into each other while you crane your fool neck i ought to set my guards on you and its a mark of my good temper and restraint that i dont now move it gerin twitched the reins and got the horses moving van chuckled fellow sounds like a sergeant i knew once like any town south of the mountains elabon had its ring of crucifixes because of the citys size the crosses made a veritable forest brightwinged gulls from off the inner sea squabbled with ravens and vultures over the dead meat on them the stench was overpowering elise produced a wisp of scented cloth and pressed it to her nose gerin wished for one of his own expanding through long years of security the capital had outgrown three walls two had vanished altogether their bricks and stones going to swell the growth only a low ridge showed where the rammedearth core of the third had stood gerin took the wagon down the citys main street the locals affectionately called it the alley it ran due east arrowstraight from the outskirts of the capital to the docks and was filled with markets and shops from one end to the other the fox drove past the lane of silversmiths a trade kizzuwatnans dominated the pottery mart where sithonians and elabonians cried their wares odorous eateries serving the fare of every nation subject or neighbor to the empire the great canvasroofed emporium where wheat imported from the northern shore of the inner sea was sold a small nest of armorers and smiths the baron had to promise van they would come back later and so much else he began to feel dizzy trying to take it all in at once beggars limped prostitutes of both sexes jiggled and pranced scribes stood at the ready to write for illiterate patrons minstrels played on every corner and no doubt thieves lurked to despoil them of the coins they earned running shouting lads were everywhere underfoot gerin marveled that any of them lived to grow up he pricked up his ears when he heard one shouting turgis his head swiveled till he spied the boy snatch him van he steered toward his target talking the horses to calm in chaos right you are captain van reached out and grabbed up a ragamuffin whose first beard was just beginning to sprout you can lead us to turgis gerin demanded i can sir and swear by all the gods and goddesses no finer hostel than his exists anywhere spare me the glowing promises im known to turgis tell me lad how is the old butterball hes well enough my lord indeed he is and generous of food though sparing of praises you turn left here sir he added within moments gerin was lost in the maze of the capital he did not think turgis hostel had formerly been in this district the old fraud must have moved his guide who called himself jouner gave directions mixed with shrill abuse directed at anyone who dared block the narrow winding back streets the abuse often came back with interest jouner was also extravagantly admiring of his chargesespecially elise she blushed and tried to wave him to silence not recognizing that his manner was part professional courtesy still the fox heard sincerity in the lads voice too most of the houses in this part of the city were twostoried flatroofed structures their whitewashed outer walls defined the twisting paths of its streets despite occasional obscenities scrawled in charcoal from the outside one was much like another but within the austerity gerin knew would be courtyards bright with flowers and cheerfully painted statuary some perhaps would be enlivened further by floor mosaics or intricately patterned carpets woven by the urfa poorer folk lived in apartment houses islands in elabons slang solid and unlovely the brick buildings towered fifty and sixty feet into the air throwing whole blocks of houses into shadow more than once jars of slops emptied from some upper window splashed down into the street sending passersby running for cover watch it van bellowed up an instant later two more loads just missed the wagon thats one of the first things you learn to watch for here gerin told him remembering his own experience they hold the high ground when at last the travelers came to turgis establishment the baron was agreeably surprised by the marble columns on either side of the entranceway and the closecropped lawn in front of the hostel itself go right in jouner said scrambling down ill see to your horses and wagon many thanks lad gerin said as he descended he gave the boy a couple of coppers then helped elise down taking the opportunity to hug her briefly have a care with that shanda horse van warned jouner he snaps the boy nodded as he began to head for the stable elise said a moment jouner how do you live in this stench puzzlement crossed jouners face stench my lady what stench travelers always complain about it but i dont notice a thing turgis met the travelers at the front door his bald pate brown as the leather apron he wore gleamed in the sunlight a smile stretched across his fat face the ends of it disappearing into a thick graying beard you appear to have come up in the world a mite gerin said by way of greeting crave pardon sir no wait i know that voice though youve had the wisdom to hide your face in hair turgis grin widened a cocky young whelp by the name of gerin badly miscalled the fox not so aye it is you old bandit also van of the strong arm and the lady elise turgis bobbed a bow you have a most lovely wife fox the lady is not my wife gerin said oh my lord van nor mine van grinned oh ho ho turgis laid a finger alongside his nose and winked elise spluttered indignation not that either gerin said its a long story and more complicated than i like i daresay it must be well it would honor me if you tell it youll hear it before the day is done never fear turgis it does my heart good to see you again and to know youve not forgotten me i turgis son of turpin forget a friend never gerin had hoped for that opening then no doubt you recall just as well the promise you made the night i left the city the smile disappeared from turgis face what promise was that lord gerin we both looked into our cups too often that night and it was a long time ago you wont wriggle out as easy as that you saucy robber you know as well as i you gave me an oath if ever i came this way again id have my rooms for the same rate as i had them then what you insolent whelp this is a whole new buildingor had your ohsoperfect memory not noticed that are you fain to hold me to a drunken vow may your fundament fall out and the way prices have risen why i could weep great buckets and your flinty heart would not be so much as an oath damn your eyes an oath gerin said both men were laughing now turgis talked right through him softened think of my wife think of my children my youngest son egginhard would study wizardry and for such school nothing less than which is his hearts desire much silver is needed if he would be a conjurer let him magic it up and not have his father steal it think of my poor maiden aunt turgis wailed when i was here last your poor maiden aunt ran the biggest gambling den in the city you bloodsucker an oath remember as my head lives only a third more would satisfy me on that your head would live entirely too well would you be known as turgis the oathbreaker may all the grapes in every vineyard you own turn sour dont own any at all truth to tell too far north is your memory jogged yet turgis hopped on one foot hopped on the other foot plucked a gray hair from his beard and sighed heavily all right i recollect bah the innkeeping trade lost a great one when you became a pirate or baron or whatever it is you do im sure youre a howling success now go howl and let me lick my woundsor do you carry courtesy so far what do you think van gerin said his comrade had watched the altercation with amusement reckon so captain if your friend can fix me up with a hot tub big enough for my bulk who dares call turgis son of turpin a friend of this backwoods bandit were i half my age and twice my size id challenge you for that as is however go down this corridor third door on the left you might follow him gerin even your name stinks in my nostrils at this moment and for you my lady we have somewhat more elegant arrangements if you would care to follow me turgis led elise off to whatever facilities he had for making beautiful women more so she seemed as much captivated by the innkeeper as was gerin himself though this was a new building the same atmosphere of comfort and good cheer the fox had always known was here other hostels might have had more splendid accommodations but none of them had turgis the bathhouses masseur was a slim young sithonian with outsized hands arms and shoulders his name was vatatzes as if by magic he had two steaming tubs ready and waiting he helped van unlace his corselet when the outlander shed his bronzestudded leather kilt vatatzes true to the predilections of his nation whistled in awe and admiration sorry my friend van chuckled understanding him well enough gerin and i both like women you poor dears vatatzes said his disappointment did not stop him from kneading away the kinks of travel as the hot water soaked off grime swathed in linen towels and mightily relaxed gerin and van emerged from the bath to find jouner waiting outside ive taken the liberty of moving your gear to your rooms he said follow me if you would sirs he also offered to carry vans cuirass but as usual the outlander declined to be parted from it even for a moment the rooms were on the second floor of the hostel they offered a fine view of the palace imperial a door which could be barred on either side gave access from one to the other dont bother to put things away gerin told jouner id sooner do it myselfthat way i know where everything is as you wish my lord jouner pocketed a tip and disappeared gerin surveyed the room if nothing else it was more spacious than the cubicle he had called his own during his former stay in the capital nor would he sleep on a straw pallet as he had then he had a mattress and pillow both stuffed with goosedown and two thick wool blankets to ward off nights chill by the bed were a jug bowl and chamberpot all of sithonian ware fine enough to be worth a small fortune north of the kirs a footstool chair and stout oaken chest completed the furnishings on the chest were two fat beeswax candles and a shrine to dyaus with a pinch of perfumed incense already smoking away above it hung an encaustic painting of a mountain scene done by a sithonian homesick for his craggy native land the baron quickly unpacked and threw himself onto the bed sighing with pleasure as he sank into its soft stuffing van rapped on the connecting door this is the life he said when gerin let him in i havent seen beds so fine since a bordello i visited in jalor i dont know about you fox but im all for sacking out for a while its been a long hard trip i was thinking the same thing gerin told him yawning van went back into his own room the baron knew he should go down to see how elise liked her chamber in the womens quarters enervated from the hot bath and massage and tired from many nights with little sleep he could not find the energy the next thing he knew jouner was knocking on the door my lord he called turgis bids you join him in the taproom for supper in half an hours time thanks lad ill be there gerin yawned and stretched he heard jouner deliver the same message to van who eventually grumbled a reply it was a bit past sunset tiwazs razorthin crescent almost invisible in the pink in the west the fox splashed water on his face then went rummaging through his gear for an outfit that might impress turgis and not incidentally elise after some thought he decided on a maroon tunic with sleeves flaring out from the elbows and checked trousers of contrasting shades of blue a necklace of gold nuggets and a belt with a bronze buckle in the shape of a leaping longtooth shanda work that completed the outfit wishing for a mirror he combed his hair and beard with a bone comb i look the very northerner he thought well fair enough thats what i am he set out for the taproom folk of every race filled the highceilinged hall three musiciansflautist piper and mandolinplayerperformed on a small stage at one end but they were all but ignored every mans attention was on turgis cook a dark burly fellow with hooked noise bushy beard and black hair drawn back into a bun he worked behind a great bronze griddle in the center of the room and in his own way was more a showman than the musicians he kept up a steady stream of chatter about every dish he was preparing and knives were quicker in his hands than in those of any warrior gerin had ever seen its gleam reflecting off his sweaty face bronze danced as if alive shining in the torchlight dicing vegetables and slicing meat with a rhythm of its own no not quite with a small shock gerin realized the knives were providing a percussion accompaniment to the music from the stage a waiter hovering by his elbow turgis sat at a quiet corner table he surged to his feet and embraced gerin who pointed to the cook and asked where did you find him hes something isnt he turgis beamed hes good for business too just watching him makes people hungry he turned to the server saying bring me my special bottle you know the one i mean bring some ordinary good wine too andhmmfour glasses the foxs eyes widened that cant be the same special bottle you used to keep when i was here before the very same and not much lower either where would i get another you know as well as i that it was salvage from a ship of some unknown land that wrecked itself down in the southeast on the bay of parvelas rocks aye its precious stuff my friendsee i still call you that highway robber though you bebut then how often do we look upon friends thought lost forever not often enough truth in your words truth in your words the waiter returned careful not to spill even one drop turgis worked at the cork of the flask they had been discussing even that flask was special small and squat and silvery like no other glass gerin had seen here it is turgis said nectar of the sun gerin had a sudden terrible fear that when van came down he would loudly announce he had traveled with whole shiploads of the brew by rights there should be no more than this one miraculous bottle at turgis murmured invitation the baron enjoyed the rare drinks rich fragrance a silence fell over the hall for a moment gerin thought his noses pleasure had made him ignore his other senses but the quiet was real he looked up there in the doorway stood van helm and armor gleaming crimson cloak over his shoulders matching helms crest he was a splendid sight indeed too splendid for gerin heard a mutter of superstitious marvel come in and sit down you great gowk he called before everyone decides youre a god vans earthy reply sent relieved laughter echoing through the room the outlander joined his friend and his host he looked with interest at the bottle gerin still held never seen glasswork like that before he said and the fox too knew relief a few moments later elise arrived the buzz of conversation in the taproom again lowered this time in appreciation as gerin rose to greet her he realized once more how fair she was he had grown used to her in battered travelers hat and sturdy but unlovely clothes now in a clinging gown of seagreen linen she was another creature altogether and startlingly beautiful turgis servitors had subtly enhanced the colors of her eyes and lips and worked her hair into a pile of fluffy curls the style became her it was popular in elabon this year and several other women in the hall wore their hair thus the baron saw more than one jealous glance directed at elise and felt proud to have earned the affection of such a woman turgis was also on his feet he bowed and kissed elises hand the sunshine of my ladys beauty brightens my hostel he exclaimed when he saw he had flustered her he added with a wink what in dyaus name do you see in this predacious lout who brought you here put at her ease she smiled and sat turgis poured a drop or two of his nectar of the sun into each of the four glasses then resealed the flask he raised his glass to past friendships now restored and successes yet to come everyone drank gerin felt the brew caress his tongue like smooth silk like soft kisses he heard vans hum of approval and was glad his fartraveled friend had found a new thing to enjoy turgis poured again this time from the local bottle as gerins stomach began to growl the waiter returned bringing dinner just in time he thought to save him from starvation the first course was a delicate clear soup made flavorful by bits of pork and chopped scallion it was followed by what turgis called a meat tile which convinced the fox that turgis cook was a genius as well as a showman simmered and sauteed pieces of lamb and veal in a spicy sauce which also featured pounded lobster tail and nutmeats whole lobster tails garnished the incredible creation gerin had never tasted anything so delicious in his life he could hardly look at the fruits and spunsugar confections that came after all the while turgis made sure no glass stayed empty long the barons head was beginning to spin when turgis announced now i will have the tale of your coming here all three travelers told it each amplifying the others accounts gerin tried to slide through the tale of his fight with the aurochs but to his annoyance elise made him backtrack and tell it in full turgis looked at him shrewdly still carrying your lantern with a hood on it are you he turned to elise my lady here we have the most talented of men the only one who does not know it being himself he can sing a song cut a purse even mine the unprincipled highwayman tell you what that fingerlong bug is on friend vans cuirassand the cure for its bite as well snarling an oath van crushed the luckless insect no need for that the fox said it was only a walkingstick and it doesnt bite at all its sole food is tree sap you see turgis said triumphantly the wine had flushed his face and loosened his tongue he can conjure you up an everfilled purse of mud perhaps gerin said wishing turgis would shut up the innkeepers paean of praise made him nervous most plaudits did as a second son hed seldom got them and never quite worked out how to deal with them he knew his virtues well enough and knew one of the greatest was his ability to keep his mouth shut about them they were often of most use when employed unexpectedly turgis was not about to be quiet besides all that he said this northern ruffian is as kind and loyal a friend as one could ever hope forelise and van nodded solemnlyand worth any three men you could name in a brawl i well recall the day he flattened three rascals who thought to rob me though he wasnt much more than a stripling himself you never told me that one van said they were just tavern toughs gerin said and this fellow here did a lot of the work hes pretty handy with a broken bottle me turgis said no one wants to hear about me fat old slug that i am what happened after the aurochs was slain the hosteler howled laughter to hear how mavrix had been thwarted truly i love the god for his gift of the grape but much of his cult gives me chills the baron quickly brought the journey down to the capital too quickly again for elise she said once more he leaves out a vital bit of the story you see as we traveled we came to care for each other more and more try though he would to hide himself behind modesty and gloom she gave him a challenging stare he would not meet her eye riveting his attention on his glass she went on and so its scarcely surprising that when he asked if he might come south to court me when the trouble is done i was proud to say yes lord gerin my heartiest congratulations turgis said pumping his hand my lady i would offer you the same but i grieve to think of your beauty passed on to your children diluted by the blood of this ape gerin jerked his hand free of the innkeepers grip a fine excuse for a host you are to insult your guests insult i thought i was giving you the benefit of the doubt turgis poured wine all around a sudden commotion drowned out his toast two men who had been arguing over the company of a coldly beautiful sithonian courtesan rose from their seats and began pummeling each other three husky waiters seized them and wrestled them out to the street turgis mopped his brow a good thing they chose to quarrel now the could have broken osnabrocs concentrationsee here he comes a rising hum of excitement and a few spatters of applause greeted osnabroc a short stocky man whose every muscle was so perfectly defined that it might have been sculpted from stone he wore only a black loincloth in his hand he carried a pole about twenty feet long a crosspiece had been nailed a yard or so from one end a pair of young women followed him they too wore only loincloths one of red silk the other of green both had the smallbreasted tautbellied look of dancers or acrobats gerin doubted if either was five feet tall the musicians vacated the stage and osnabroc ascended more torches were brought each girl took one and set the rest in brackets after a sharp short bow to his audience osnabroc arched his back and bent his head backwards setting the pole on his forehead he balanced it with effortless ease at his command both girls shinnied up the pole torches in their teeth once at the crosspiece they turned somersaults flips and other evolutions so astounding gerin felt his heart rise into his throat all the while the pole stayed steady as a rock one girl slid down headfirst leaving the other hanging by her knees twenty feet above the floor but not for longshe flailed her arms once twice and then she was upright again going through a series of yet more spectacular capers despite her gyrations the supporting pole never budged a grimace of concentration distorted osnabrocs face sweat ran streakily down his magnificent body who do you think has the harder job turgis whispered to gerin osnabroc or his girls i couldnt begin to tell you the baron answered turgis laughed and nodded its the same with me i couldnt begin to tell you either van though had no doubts his eyes were only on the whirling girl just think he said half to himself of all the ways you could do it with a lass so limber she all but flies speak to me not of people flying turgis said as the second girl slid down the pole to a thunderous ovation she skipped off the stage followed by her fellow acrobat and osnabroc he sagged now as he walked and his forehead looked puffy van tried to catch the eye of one of the girls but with no apparent luck disappointed he turned his attention back to turgis what do you have against people flying he asked nothing against it precisely it does remind me of a strange story though he waited to be urged to go on his companions quickly obliged him he began youve told me much of the trokmoi tonight this story has a trokme in it too he was drunk as they often are and since the place was crowded that night he was sharing a table with a wizard you know how some folk when they go too deep into a bottle like to sing or whatever well this lad flapped his arms like he was trying to take off and fly finally he knocked a drink from the wizards hand which was the wrong thing to do the wizard paid his scot and walked out and i thought id been lucky enough to escape trouble but next thing i knew the northerner started flapping again andmay my private parts shrivel if i liesure enough he took off and flew around the room like a drunken buzzard a boozard maybe gerin suggested i hope not turgis said what befell elise asked he did lass on his head he was doing a fine job of flying just like a bird but the poor sot smashed against that candelabra you see up there and fell right into someones soup he earned himself a knot on the head as big as an egg and i hope enough sense not to make another wizard annoyed at him this taletelling gets to be thirsty work turgis added calling for another bottle of wine but when he opened it and began to pour elise put a hand over her glass a few minutes later she rose pausing only to bestow a hurried but warm kiss on gerin she made her way to her room the three men sat drank and talked a bit longer turgis said gerin youre no fool like that trokme was youre the last man i ever would have picked to make a sorcerer your mortal foe it was his choosing not mine the wine had risen to gerins head adding vehemence to his words the gods decreed i am not to be a scholar as i had dreamed so be it most of my bitterness is gone theres satisfaction in holding the border against the barbarians and more in making my holding a better place for all to live vassals and serfs alike much of what i learned here has uses in the north we no longer have wells near the cesspits for instance and we grow beans to refresh the soil and though my vassals know it not ive taught a few of the brighter peasants to read what you have van stared at the fox as if hed never seen him before aye and im not sorry either gerin turned back to turgis weve had no famines round fox keep despite two bad winters and no peasant revolts either wizard or no wizard no skulking savage is going to ruin all ive worked so hard to kill he may kill methe way things look now he likely will kill mebut dyaus knows hell never run me off he slammed his glass to the table with such violence that it shattered and cut his hand the pain abruptly sobered him startled by his outburst his friends exclaimed in sympathy he sat silent and somber staring at the thin stream of blood that welled from between his clenched fingers viii after the alleys hurleyburley the calm nearly trafficless lanes of the nobles quarter came as a relief jouner had given the fox careful directions on how to find elises uncles home for a miracle they proved good as well as careful valdabrun the stout lived almost in the shadow of the palace imperial despite his closeness to the empires heart the grounds of his home were less imposing than those of many nobles in less prestigious areas no carefully trimmed topiaries adorned his lawns no statuary group stood frozen in midcavort nor did the drive from the road wind and twist its way to his house under sweetly scented trees it ran directly to his front door straight as the elabon way the dominant impression his grounds gave was one of discipline and strength the baron hitched the horses van gave both beasts feedbags eluding a snap from the shanda pony he cuffed it grumbling poxy animal would sooner have my hand than its oats valdabruns doorknocker was a snarling bronze longtooths head gerin grasped a fang swung it up then down he had expected the knock to set off sorcerous chimes many southern nobles liked such conceits but there was only the honest clang of metal on metal after a stir inside a retainer swung open the door sirs lady how may i help you he asked crisply the mans speech and bearing impressed gerin he seemed more soldier than servitor is your master in the fox asked lord valdabrun no but i expect him back shortly would you care to wait if you would be so kind this way then executing a smart aboutturn the steward led them to a rather bare antechamber he briefly saw to their comfort then said if you will excuse me i have other duties to perform he left through another door gerin heard him bar it after himself a womans voice low and throaty came from behind the door gerin could not make out her words but heard the steward reply i know not lady namarra they did not state their business nor did i inquire deeply i will see them the woman said the bar was lifted valdabruns man announced sirs lady my lord valdabruns ah companion the lady namarra and went off as namarra entered van sprang to his feet gerin was only a blink behind no matter what he felt toward elise valdabruns companion was quite simply the most spectacular woman he had every seen tiny catlike and exquisite the clinging silk she wore accented her figures lushness her hair worn short and straight was the color of flame like a fire it seemed to give out more light than fell on it yet for all that incandescent hair she was no trokme woman her face was soft rounded and smallfeatured her skin golden brown her eyes a slightly darker shade of gold were subtly slanted but rounded as if in perpetual surprise the strange combination more than anything save perhaps her purring name made gerin think her feline she wore no jewelryshe herself was ornament enough and more she studied the fox with some interest van with a good deal more and elise with the wary concern one gave any dangerous beast suddenly found in the parlor out of the corner of his eye gerin saw elise returning that look he felt a twinge of alarm namarra swept out a lithe arm to point at the baron you are he introduced himself and van and was on the point of naming elise when he was interrupted and your charming ah companion namarra used the same deliberately ambiguous intonation the steward had applied to her voice dangerously calm elise replied i am elise ricolfs daughter the fox noticed she made no claim of relationship to valdabrun the name of elises father meant nothing to namarra she turned back to gerin may i ask your business with my lord the baron was not sure how to reply he had no idea how much of the nobles confidence and trust his woman enjoyed he was framing an equivocal answer when a door slammed at the back of the house seconds later the steward reappeared to announce his masters presence enough of this foolishness let me by valdabrun the stout said as he surged into the antechamber gerin hastily revised his notion of what the nobles sobriquet implied valdabrun was edging toward fifty balding and did in fact carry a considerable paunch but the fox was sure he would break fingers if he rammed a fist into it shaven face or no here was a soldier and no mistake hard eyes firm mouth the set of his chin all bespoke a man long used to command nor was he slow to see he faced two of his own breed the air in the room crackled as the three strong men took one anothers measure each in his own way was a warrior to reckon with gerin supple clever always waiting for a foe to expose a flaw van who fought with a berserkers delight and a drillmasters elegance and their host who reminded the fox of one of carluns or ros great captains a man with scant polish or flair but possessed of an almost brutal indomitability the very concept of retreat alien to him the tableau held for long seconds elise shattered it exclaiming uncle and throwing herself into valdabruns startled arms the stern expression dropped from his face to be replaced by one of utter bafflement namarras face changed too her eyes narrowed her lips drew back exposing white pointed teeth a cat she was and feral she laid a hand on valdaruns arm my lord she began be still my dear he said and she was still though restive gerins respect for him grew he untangled himself from elise young lady you will explain yourself he told her still in that tone of command she was as matteroffact as he of course as i told your lemannamarra bristled but held her tongueim elise daughter of ricolf the redand your sister yrse my mother always said you would know this locket she drew it up from between her breasts freed it of its chain and handed it to valdabrun he examined it at arms length his sight had begun to lengthen as it often does in the middle years his face softened as much as that craggy countenance could yrses child he said softly this time he folded her into a bearlike embrace behind his back namarras expression was frightening elise introduced gerin and van to valdabrun ive heard of you sirrah he told the fox one of those who never pay their taxes aye i pay them in blood gerin answered soberly valdabrun surprised him by nodding so you do youngling so you do he exchanged a bonewrenching handclasp with van that left both big men wincing then announced now i will have the tale of your coming here he visibly composed himself to listen as they had the night before to turgis the three of them told their story i never thought that harebrained scheme would work valdabrun observed when elise spoke of her fathers plan to find her a husband the noble proved a far more skeptical audience than turgis had firing probing questions at gerin on balamungs wizardry politics in the northlands mavrixs cultists and whatever else caught his interest well well he said at last the whole thing is so unlikely i suppose it must be true child you are welcome to stay with me as long as you like he told his steward to take her gear from the wagon then turned to namarra who appeared less than delighted at his nieces arrival kitten show elise around while i talk with these rogues of course we can talk as we go come child in namarras redlipped mouth the word was poisonously sweet that would be wonderful elise answered ive always wanted to talk to a woman of your ah experience a tiny smile on her face she kissed van and gerin fiercely hugged the fox and whispered this will be hard hurry back please she followed namarra out when the door closed behind her gerin felt the sunshine had left the day valdabrun seemed oblivious to the byplay between the two women that proved again to the baron that he was more used to the field than to the imperial courts intrigues after his niece and mistress were gone he said bluntly fox if half what youve said is true your arse is in a sling id be lying if i said i liked the odds gerin agreed advice from me would be nothing but damned impertinence right now so ill give you none but i will say this if any man is slippery enough to slide through this net you may be that man yet you seem to have kept your honor too im glad of it for my nieceshow strange that seemssake he shifted his attention to van could i by any chance persuade you to join the imperial guard his smile showed he knew the question foolish before he asked it van shook his head the plume of his helm swayed gently youre not like most of the popinjays here valdabrun you seem a fighting man so you tell me where will i find better fighting than with the fox there you have me valdabrun said gentlemen i would like nothing more than talking the day away over a few stoups of wine but i must get back to the palace the eshref clan out of shanda have forced a pass in the skleros mountains and their brigands are plundering northern sithonia his imperial majesty thinks paying tribute will get them to leave i have to persuade him otherwise the eshref van said is gaykhatu still their chief i believe that was the name yes why send troops the outlander said decisively hell run i knew him out on the plains and he always did you knew him on the plains valdabrun shook his head i wont ask how or when but i do give thanks for the redeand when i talk with his imperial majesty ill term it expert testimony or some such tripe dyaus what drivel ive had to learn in the past year or so as van and gerin drove away from valdabruns home the baron was heavyhearted over parting from elise necessary though he knew it was van on the other hand was full of lickerish praise for namarra and lewd speculation on the means valdabrun who was certainly no beauty used to keep her at his side his sallies grew so unlikely and so comical that gerin finally had to laugh with him where now van asked as the alleys turmoil surrounded them once more the sorcerers collegium its in the southwestern part of the city near the apothecaries district i should know when to turn but he did not he never learned whether the building he sought as a marker was torn down or if he had simply forgotten its looks in the eight years since hed seen it last whichever before long he knew he had gone too far west along the alley he turned to passersby for directions at first he got no responses save shrugs and a few vaguely pointing fingers realizing his mistake he tossed a copper to the first halfway intelligentlooking fellow he spied the mans instructions were so artfully phrased accompanied by such eloquent gestures that gerin listened as if spellbound he had all he could do to keep from applauding instead he gave his benefactor another coin the mans thanks would have drawn an aurochs into a temple unfortunately the sorcerers collegium was nowhere near where he claimed gerin expended more coppers and most of his patience before he finally found it there was nothing outwardly marvelous about the building that housed it a gray brick island not much different from scores of others in the capital but it was discreetly segregated from its neighbors by a broad smooth expanse of lawn none of the nearby buildings had a window that faced the collegium they only gave it blank walls of stucco timber or brick perhaps fearing the sorceries emanating from it though the collegium accepted students only from within the empire folk of various races called on it for services many odd vehicles and beasts were tied in front of it to his horses alarm gerin hitched the wagon next to a camel some urfa had ridden up from the desert no sooner had he done so than three muscular individuals appeared and asked if the gentlemen in the wagon would pay them to watch it ill see you in the hottest firepit in the five hells first gerin said genially you know as well as i the collegium has spells to keep thieves away from its clients the largest of the bravos a fellow who would have been a giant beside anyone but van shrugged and grinned sorry boss he said but the two of you looked such rubes it was worth the chance now you know better so be off with you after exchanging a final goodnatured insult with the baron the ruffians ambled away looking for less worldly folk to bilk gerin shook his head when i was a student the same sort of rascals were about preying on strangers inside the collegium the ground floor was lit mundanely enough by torches some of them flared crimson green or blue but that was the simplest of tricks scarcely sorcery at all merely involving the use of certain powdered earths a greater magic kept the chamber free of smoke but let the nose detect the pinches of delicate incense burning in tiny braziers set along the walls and mounted on the sturdy granite columns that supported the collegiums upper stories the procedures on the ground floor of the collegium reminded gerin of nothing so much as those of the imperial bank orderly lines of clients snaked their way toward young mages seated at tables along the north wall once there they explained their problems in low voices most were helped on the spot but from time to time a wizard would send one elsewhere presumably to deal with someone more experienced van bore queueing up with poor grace i dont fancy all this standing about patience van said its a trick to overawe people the longer you have to wait the more important you think whoever youre waiting for is bah van made as if to spit on the floor but changed his mind it was too beautiful to soil an abstract mosaic of tiny glass tesserae of silver lilac and seagreen glittering in the torchlight the man in front of them finally reached a wizard and poured out his tale of woe like a spilled jug of wine glug glug glug at last the wizard exclaimed enough enough follow thisa blob of pink foxfire appeared in front of the startled fellows noseand it will lead you to someone who can help you he turned to gerin and van said courteously and what my i do for you gentlemen you may call me avelmir my true name of course is hidden avelmir was younger than gerin his round smoothly shaved face smiling and open his familiar a fat gray lizard about a foot long rested on the table in front of him its yellow eyes gave back gerins stare unwinkingly when avelmir stroked its scaly skin it arched its back in pleasure gerin told his story when he was done avelmirs smile had quite gone you pose a difficult problem sir baron and one in which i am not sure we can render timely assistance let me consult here he glanced down at a scrap of parchment we are badly understaffed as you must be aware and i fear we shall be unable to send anyone truly competent north of the kirs before hmm seventyfive to eighty days what gerins bellow of outrage whipped heads around in that time ill be dead with my keep and most of the northland aflame for my pyre avelmirs manner grew chillier yet we find ourselves under heavy obligations in the near future the nature of which i do not propose to discuss with you if you do not care to wait for our services against your barbarous warlock hire some northern bungler and may you have joy of him good day sir you outrage choked the fox the battlegleam kindled in vans eyes shall i break the place apart a bit captain i would not try that avelmir said quietly and why not van tugged at his sword it came halfway free then struck he roared a curse avelmirs hands writhed through passes when gerin tried to stop him the reptilian familiar puffed itself up to twice its size and jumped at him he drew back not sure if it was venomous sweat started forth on vans forehead and an instant later on avelmirs the outlander gained an inch lost it again then more and more blade began to show at last it jerked clear with a howl of triumph van raised his sword arm gerin grabbed it with both hands for a moment he thought he would be lifted off the floor and swung with the blade but reason returned to vans face the outlander relaxed avelmir had the look of a man whod fished for minnows and caught a shark into the dead silence of the great chamber he said we must see if a way can be found follow this a blue foxfire globe popped into being an inch in front of gerins nose startled he took a step backwards the foxfire hurried away like a man on an important errand gerin and van followed the ball of light led them down a steep spiral stairway into the bowels of the collegium gerins excitement grew here he knew the potent sorceries were undertaken when he was a student he had been restricted to the upper floors as the eerie guide led him down echoing corridors he realized for the first time how much of the collegium was undergroundand how little he had understood its true extent he and van passed doors without number most were shut more than one bore runes of power to ensure it stayed so many of the open ones were innocuous a smithy a chamber in which glassblowers created vessels of curious shapes and sizes a crowded library but a winged tailed demon thrashed within a pentacle in one room it glared at the fox with fiery eyes its stench followed him down the hall what do you suppose would happen if we didnt choose to follow our magical guide van said nothing good im sure the foxfire winked out in front of a closed door gerin knocked there was no reply he lifted the latch the door silently swung open the chamber was far underground and held no lamps but it was not dark a soft silvery gleam which had no apparent source suffused it behind a curiously carven ebony table sat an old wizard who looked up from some arcane computation when the privacy of his cubicle was breached his amber silk robes rustled as he moved he nodded to gerin and van if you need a name for me call me sosper that was clearly a pseudonym for he was no sithonian though his phrases were polished he spoke with a western accent he must have been born somewhere on the long peninsula that jutted into the orynian ocean he smiled at van no need to keep hand on hilt my friend it will avail you nothing as i am no child in shaping spells of sealing the outlander confident as always in his own strength tried to draw his sword was frozen fast gerin would have believed sosper without test the man radiated power as a bonfire radiates heat gentle but overwhelmingly selfassured sosper cut off the baron when he began to speak why do you question avelmirs judgment i can give you no aid nor can the collegium until the time he specified what happens among barbarians is of little moment to us in any event and less now you may perhaps be able to deduce the reason having once studied here no look not so startled my young friend who knows the chick better than the hen trying to master his surprise gerin turned his wits to the problem sosper had set him he found no solution and said so do you not a pity in that case there appears to be no need for further conversation leave me i pray so i may return to my calculations at least tell me why you will not aid me gerin said balamung is no ordinary mage he has more power than any ive seen here for the first time sosper spoke with a touch of asperity i am under no obligation to you sir rather the reverse for you take me away from important matters and as for your trokme i care not if he has the book of shabethshiri he has you dont seem to have listened to a word i said how can you know this have you seen its terrible glow with your own eyes sosper was skeptical almost contemptuous no but i spoke with a woodsrunner who has you accept the untrained observations of a savage as fact my good man a hundred generations of scriers have sought the book of shabethshiriin vain i doubt a barbarian hedgewizard could have found it where they failed no lost it is and lost it shall remain until the one no grave shall hold brings it back to the world of men gerin had not heard that bit of lore before it chilled him to the marrow but his protests died unspoken the old man before him had been right for so long and grown so arrogant in his rightness that now he could not hear anything that contradicted his set image of the world he was talented brilliant and deafened by his own rigidity leave me sosper said it was order not request followed close by van gerin left the chamber ice was in his heart the door swung closed behind them of its own accord like a faithful servant the foxfire ball reappeared to guide them back to its creator on their return avelmir looked to be considering some remark at their expense but gerins stony visage and an ominous twitch of vans great forearm muscles persuaded him to hold his tongue what now captain the outlander asked as they left the collegium gerin shook his head in dejected bewilderment great dyaus above how should i know every move i make rams my head into a stone wall the sibyl carus now this maybe balamung was right maybe i can do nothing to fight him still i intend to go on tryingwhat else can i do and i can do one thing for myself right now whats that get drunk van slapped him on the back sending him staggering down the steps best notion ive heard in days where do we find a place it shouldnt be hard nor was it not five minutes ride from the collegium stood a small tavern set between an apothecarys shop and an embalmerwhere the druggist sends his mistakes i suppose gerin said he read the faded sign over the tavern door the barons roost hah anything that roosted here would come away with lice in its feathers someone doesnt seem to care van pointed to the matched blooded dapples and fine chariot tied in front of the tavern he must be slumming gerin slid down and hitched the wagon next to the fancy rig the barons roost had no door only a splotchily dyed curtain once perhaps forest green inside it was dirty dark and close its few patrons from the look of them mostly burglars pimps and other smalltime grifters gave gerin and van a wary onceover before returning to their lowvoiced talk hemp for smoking gerin heard one say to another i can get it for you of course i can how much do you want what can i give you boys asked the fat man behind the bar his hard eyes gave the lie to the jovial air he tried to cultivate wine gerin said and quiet the quiets free for the wine id see your silver first van laughed at that show too much silver in a dive like this and half the jackals herell decide theyre wolves today they dont seem to be troubling him do they the taverner jerked a thumb at the noble slumped over the far corner of the bar three jars of various vintages stood before him from his slackjointed posture they were empty or nearly so for all i know hes one of them or their boss van said at that the noble slowly swung round a golden earring caught candlelight and glinted who is it he asked loftily who dares impute me a part of this place in any way save my location a swacked grin spread across his face as he focused on gerin and van as i live and breathe the wenchstealers rihwin what are you doing here gerin exclaimed i i am becoming preternaturally drunk though if i can still say preterprethat word i have not yet arrived i shall be honored to stand you gentlemen a round anyone filching so luscious a lass as elise from wolfar of the axe deserves reward yet after she was gone what point to my staying in the northespecially as my welcome had worn rather thin so three days later home i fared and here i am considering it gerin decided it was quite possible rihwin would have taken no sidetrips to delay his journey with his load of cares the fox was glad to see any face he knew he answered you can buy for us if we can buy for you fair enough rihwin turned to the tapster a double measure of siphnian for my comrades and quickly they have considerable overtaking to do the wine the taverner brought had never seen siphnos and the amphora in which it came was a crude local imitation of sithonian ware at any other time gerin would have stalked out of the dive now he relished the warmth rising from his belly to his brain when the vessel was empty he ordered another then another no amateur toper himself rihwin watched in disbelief as van poured down mug after mug of wine heaven above and hells below he exlaimed i toast your capacity the three men drained their cups and i your fine company van said the cups emptied again riwhin and van looked expectantly at gerin he raised his mug a murrain take all magicians he drank van drank all but me rihwin said he drank too whats that gerin was abruptly half sober whatsarpwhat excuse me i pray i am not well riwhins head flopped onto his arms he slept gerin shook prodded and nudged him to no avail the southerner muttered and whimpered but would not wake weve got to get him out of here the fox told van van stared owlishly who out of where not you too gerin snarled before he flickered out this candle said he was a wizard a murrain take all wizards van shouted he drank the baron tried to whip his fuzzy wits into action at last he smote fist into palm in satisfaction id wager you think youre quite the strong fellow he said to van i am that the outlander allowed between swigs and sober too i doubt it gerin said in fact id bet youre too puny and too drunk even to carry this chap herehe indicated the inert rihwinout to the wagon go howl captain van slung rihwin over his shoulder like an empty suit of clothes and headed for the door gerin paid the taverner and followed van slung rihwin into the back of the wagon so hard gerin hoped the noble was unhurt will you own you were wrong he said it seems i have to gerin answered smiling inside pay up then tell you what ill race you back to turgis double or nothing you take the wagon and ill drive rihwins chariot doesnt seem quite fair van complained privately gerin would have agreed he loaded his voice with scorn not game eh youll see van untied the wagon from the hitching rail leaped aboard he cracked his whip and was gone gerin was right behind him pedestrians fled every which way tumbling back into shops and displays for their lives rihwins team was as fine as it looked but the fox still had trouble gaining on van the outlander with more weight behind him bulled through holes gerin had to avoid he also drove with utter disregard for life and limb his own or anyone elses they were neck and neck when they reached the alley they stormed down it and then right outside the wheat emporium they descended on a great flock of geese being driven to slaughter gerin doubted it was the flock which had delayed them on their way to the capital that one still had to be on the road van never slowed down he had time for one bellowed gangway before he was into the middle of the geese gerin still a length or two behind the fox glimpsed blank despair on the face of one goosetender then the air was full of terrified honking squealing cackling defecating big white birds some flew into the grain market they promptly began to devour the wheat there swearing merchants tried to drive them back into the street only to retreat in dismay as the birds fought back with buffeting wings and savage pecks and bites half a dozen geese flapped their way through the secondstory window of a bathhouse an instant later four nude men leaped out the same window a duncolored hound contested the right of two geese to a cartload of peaches when five more birds joined the fray the dog ran off tail between its legs squawking contentedly the victors settled down to enjoy their spoils yet another goose seized a trollops filmy skirt in its beak the goose tore it from her legs and left her half naked in the roadway her curses only added to the turmoil somehow or other the racers got through any pursuit was lost in the gallinaceous stampede gerin took the lead for a moment then lost it when van quite by accident found a shortcut the baron was gaining at the end but van pulled into turgis forecourt a few seconds in front plucking a feather from his beard he walked over to the fox broad palm out pay up if you please you know we forgot to set a stake i owe you twice nothing which the subtle sithonians assure us remains nothing van pondered this nodded reluctantly then well just have to race back he declared he took two steps toward the wagon and fell on his face the pound of galloping hooves brought turgis out his front door on the run what in the name of the gods is going on he shouted oh its you gerin i might have known the baron lacked the patience to trade gibes with him he boiled with urgency do you have a potion to sober up these two right away he nodded toward van and rihwin whom he had lain beside his friend the noble had stayed unconscious all through the wild ride aye but theyll not be happier for it turgis vanished into the hostel he returned a moment later with a small tightly stoppered vial he poured half its contents into van gave the rest to rihwin as the drug took effect the two of them thrashed like brokenbacked things then spewed their guts on the ground sudden reason showed in rihwins eyes wiping his mouth he asked what am i doing here where for that matter is here who do you think you are my good man he added when van still in pain rolled up against him his voice showed much of his usual cheerful hauteur the outlander groaned with any luck ill die before i remember theres an earthquake in my brains rihwin rose gingerly he looked from van who stayed on the ground with head in hands to gerin none too steady on his feet himself i congratulate you my friends practice has made you a superior pair of kidnappers tell me which of you has wed elise and which intends to marry me i confess i have given little thought to my dowry go howl gerin said tell me at once is it true youre a wizard where did you learn that in that horrid dive how drunk was i it were better to say i am all but a mage i completed the course at the collegium but never graduated nor was i linked to a familiar why not of what interest is this to you may i ask rihwin you will have my story i promise you gerin said now tell me yours before i throttle you very well the fault i fear was my own i learned all the required lores mastered the spells they set me met every examination completed each conjuration with adequate resultswhich is to say no fiend swallowed me up and all this i accomplished on my own for he who nominally supervised my work was so concerned with his own goetic researches that he had scant moments to lavish on his pupils not the wizard who styles himself sosper gerin asked indeed yes how could you know that ive met the man go on please came the night before i was to be consecrated mage and in my folly i resolved to repay my mentor for all his indifference he is a man who likes the good life is sosper for all his sorcerous craft and he dwells near the palace imperial at midnight i essayed a small summoning when the demon i evoked appeared i charged it to go to my masters bedchamber give his couch a hearty shake and vanish instanter once he awoke what i ordained the demon did a reminiscent grin lit rihwins face oh it was a lovely jape even warlocks are muzzy when bounced from slumber and sosper suspecting nothing other than a common earthquake rushed in his nightshirt to the palace to inquire after the emperors safety i would have given half my lands to see his face when he found the temblor his private property but it takes a mighty wizard to befool such a man for long and i alas had nowhere near the skill to maintain my appearance of innocence gainst his inquiry which leaves me here almost a mage and glad i suppose my punishment was no worse than expulsion rihwins tale was in keeping with the judgment gerin had formed of him at ricolfs holding a man who would dare anything on the impulse of a moment never stopping to consider the consequencesbut one who would then jauntily bear those consequences whatever they were banking on that mercurial nature gerin plunged into his own tale and so he finished i found i could get no proper mage and was in despair not knowing what to do meeting you in the tavern seems nothing less than the intervention of the godsand on my behalf for once fare north with me to be my aid against the trokmoi rihwin studied him wearing his usual expression of amused cynicism like a gamblers stiff face you know i suppose that i have every right to bear you illwill for winning the love of a girl for whose hand i struggled over the course of a year so you do gerin said stonily and you know i find your northern province uncouth unmannered and violent nothing at all like this soft smiling land rihwin if you mean no say no and stop twisting the knife but my dear fellow fox i am trying to say yes what gerin stared at him why do you think i traveled north a year ago if not for the adventure of it and the change i was stifled by the insipid life i led here were it not that i am in a bad odor up there i doubt i should have returned at all van struggled to his feet good for you keep the same ground under your feet too long and you grow roots like a radish butwhat you said of elise gerin was floundering now what of it that i lost her was my own foolish fault and none others i was not in love with her nor she with me aye shes a comely maid but ive found there are a good many of those and most of them like me well i entered ricolfs contest much more to measure myself against the other suitors than for her sake the last of his foppish mask slipped away and he spoke with a seriousness the baron had never heard from him lord gerin if you truly want my aid i will meet you here in three days time ready to travel i pray your pardon for not being quicker but as im here i should set my affairs in order before faring north again does it please you dumbfounded gerin could only nod rihwin sketched a salute climbed into his chariot and departed his horses whickered happily at the familiar feel of his hands on the reins what do you know van said more to that fellow than he lets on gerin was thinking much the same thing it occurred to him that he had seen rihwin only on a couple of the worst days of his life now he began to understand why ricolf with longer acquaintance had thought the southerner a fit match for elise more than once over those three days the fox wondered if rihwin would have second thoughts but he was too busy readying his own return to waste much time on worry van acquired a stout ash spear a little light but what can you do and four examples of another weapon gerin had not seen before flat rings of bronze with sharp outer edges their central holes were sized so they fit snugly onto the outlanders forearms theyre called chakrams van explained i learned the use of them in mabalal theyre easier to throw straight than knives and if i just leave them where they are they make a forearm smash unpleasant for whoevers in the way when the baron paid turgis the innkeeper put an arm round his shoulder youre a good friend fox im sorry to see you go you remind me of the days when i still had hair on my pate please note however you brigand i am not so sorry as to make you any rash promises the last one cost me dear enough rihwin arrived on the morning he had set and as ready as he had vowed gone was his thin toga he wore a leather tunic and baggy woolen trousers a sword swung at his hip armor and a quiver of javelins were stowed behind him and he had set a battered bronze helm on his curls his left ear though still sported a golden ring its possible to ask too much of me you know he said sheepishly when gerin pointed at it rihwin for all i care you can wear the damned thing in your nose lets be off the baron drove the wagon up the alley van stayed in the rear compartment out of sight gerin did not want to be stopped by some irate merchant whod had his goods smashed or scattered in the wild ride and now recognized one of its perpetrators he was confident he was immune from being identified so save for his northern dress he looked like just another elabonian thus it came as a small shock when someone waved frantically and called his name elise he said great dyaus above what now ix elises story was simple enough if unpleasing valdabruns delight at guesting his unknown niece had faded the fading quickened when he realized how cordially elise and namarra despised each other it all blew up at dawn this morning in a glorious fight elise said she reached into a pocket of her traveling coat and brought out a lock of namarras fiery hair black at the roots youll notice may i be of service my lady rihwin asked a spell for an enemys ruin is easy when one has a lock of hair with which to work i know enough magic for that myself gerin said not wanting rihwin to help elise in any way at all the hussy hardly merits being blasted from the face of the earth simply because she and i dont get along elise said she asked rihwin how is it you are in the city and in gerins company he briefly explained she said when last i saw youand more of you than i wanted to ill have you knowi would have thought youd never want to go back to the northlands again he flinched at that but answered they hold no terror for me so long as i am not required to face your father where shall i take you now gerin asked elise you must have other kin here i do but i know none of them by name nor would it do me much good if i did my uncle is not a man to use halfmeasures he swore hed make sure i was no more welcome in any of their houses than in his that leaves me little choice but to travel north with you gerin realized she was right get moving will you and talk later van said from his comfortless perch in the back of the wagon i feel like an ostrich in a robins egg once they were out of the city he emerged from confinement and stretched till his joints creaked let me ride with you a while rihwin he said i like the bounce of a chariot under my feet do you indeed rihwin said he flicked the whip over his matched dapples they leaped forward sending the light car bounding into the air whenever its bronzeshod wheels struck a stone set an inch or two higher in the roadbed than its fellows van was unruffled he shifted his weight with marvelous quickness not deigning to clutch at the chariots handrail rihwin gave up after a wild quarter of a mile slowing his horses to a walk as gerin caught up he asked elise does he always act so ive rarely seen him otherwise the day he came to court me he stepped down from his car kissed me then kissed my father twice as hard but he has such charm and nonchalance that the outrageous things he does dont grate as they would from someone else what ah do you think of him gerin asked carefully as a possible husband you mean i could have done much worse she laid a hand on his arm but i could do much better too and i think i have guard duty was easier to bear with three men to carry the load golden math a waning crescent had been in the sky when rihwin woke gerin to stand the third watch elleb three days past full was nearing the meridian tiwaz had just set tell me how is it you know sorcery rihwin asked to gerin he seemed to be saying how could a backwoodsman like you hope to master such a subtle art the baron had met that attitude from southerners too often during his first stay in the capital touched on an old sore spot he said shortly surprising as it may seem i spent two years studying in the city including a turn at the collegium though a short one did you really what did you study besides magecraft far from being condescending riwhin showed eager interest natural philosophy mostly and history history great dyaus above man did you ever hear maleinos lecture yes often he interested me what do you think of his cyclical notion of historical development i was so impressed by the peroration he always used that i memorized it peoples and cities now have great success now are so totally defeated as no longer to exist and the changing circuit revealed such things before our time and will reveal them again and the revelations will not cease so long as there be men and battles and he would stalk off like an angry god yes and do you know where hed go gerin said to a little tavern close by to drink resinated winehow do sithonians stand the stufffor hours on end rihwin looked pained you just shattered one of my few remaining illusions im not saying hes not a brilliant man i do think he presents his ideas too forcefully though and makes too little allowance for variations and exceptions to his rules i cant quite agree with you there all but oblivious to their surroundings they fenced with ideas arguing in low voices until rihwin exclaimed is it growing light already they made good progress the next day and the next and the next reaching the pranther river at the end of the fourth day out of the capital they camped near its southern bank the night was quiet save for the rivers gentle murmur pale clouds drifted lazily from west to east obscuring now the pale thin waxing crescent of nothos now tiwazs bright full face now rosy elleb which came into the sky halfway through the midwatch gerin whose watch that was endured the muttering of the ghosts for another couple of hours then nudged van his friend woke with a thrash anything happening he asked not so youd notice gerin said aye it seems restful enough van looked down whats this look what ive been all but sleeping on captainanother aoratos plant he plucked it from the ground gerin eyed it with distaste now that im only standing one watch in three i dont need anything to keep me awake at night and the leaves are so bitter they shrivel my tongue throw it away id sooner not i want to see if rihwin knows of it suit yourself as for me i can hardly keep my eyes open it was still nearly dark when van woke him something moved over by the river behind that stand of brush the outlander whispered i couldnt quite make out what it was but i dont like it lets have a look grabbing for sword and trousers the baron slid out of his bedroll he roused elise and rihwin told them to give him and van a few minutes and then to use their own judgment then he slipped on his helm and followed van down toward the pranther as always the fox marveled at vans uncanny ability to pick his way through undergrowth his own woodscraft was better than most but once or twice an arm or shoulder brushed a branch hard enough to make it rustle his comrade made never a sound van froze when he came to the edge of the brush a moment later gerin eased up beside him following with his eyes the outlanders pointing finger trokmoi he hissed hand tightening of itself on swordhilt a pair of the barbarians sprawled by the riverbank their attention seemed focused on the stream their tunics were not checked in the usual northern fashion but were all over fylfots these were balamungs men but they did not move not even when gerin parted the curtain of bushes and walked toward them his bafflement grew with every step he came up close behind them and still they were oblivious then he bent down and prodded one of them the trokme toppled he was dead his face an agonized rictus in his throat stood an unfletched wooden dart half its length stained with an orange paste a matching dart was in his companions unmoving chest a fat green trout lay between the trokmoi bone hook still set in its mouth what in the gods holy names van burst out a grim smile formed on gerins face i do believe the rivermen have done us a good turn he said can you think of any reason balamung would send men south except to hunt us and here almost up with their prey they stopped to do a little fishingin the one river in all elabon men dont fish he explained how the rivermen had come to the pranther van shook his head poor damned fools to die for a trout but it will make us a fine breakfast he stooped to pick up the fish gerin grabbed his arm and stopped him a reptilian head was watching them from the river no expression was readable in the rivermans unwinking amber eyes but he held an envenomed dart ready to throw all right keep the blasted thing van flung the trout into the pranther the riverman dove after it surfacing a moment later with it in one webbed hand a grave nod and he was gone whats toward riwhin called from the bushes the baron was glad to see hed had sense enough to don armor and to carry his bow with an arrow nocked and ready he was a good deal less glad to see elise behind rihwin he wished she wouldnt always run toward trouble frowning he told them what had happened rihwin said that trokme must hate you indeed to work so hard for your destruction or perhaps he fears you gerin laughed bitterly why should he i doubt im more than a pebble underfoot to hima sharp pebble aye but a pebble nonetheless hooves thuttered on the bridge called dalassenos revenge rihwin half drew his bow expecting more trokmoi but it was only a dour courier in the black and gold of the empire a leather message pouch slung over one shoulder he headed south fast as his lathered horses would take him make way he shouted though no one blocked him just once gerin said id like to see one of them have more to say than make way its no more likely than a wolf climbing trees though the fox disliked elabons courier corps all the barons north of the kirs saw it as part of the thin web binding them to the empire and they were right the couriers carried news faster than anyone else but only on imperial business later that day another courier came south at the same headlong pace gerin called after him for news he got none they refused even to gossip fearing it might somehow compromise them cursing gerin hurried his own northward pace rihwin as it happened did not know of the aoratos plant or its uses and that is passing strange he said for i thought surely the collegiums herbalists were aware of the properties of every plant that grows within the empire he took the little bush from van and studied it i must say it seems ordinary which is likely why no ones bothered with it here van said on the plains it stands out a good deal more i must try it tonight rihwin said the taste is foul gerin warned him what if it is if the effects are as interesting as claimed i may be on the brink of discovering a whole new vice he gave a voluptuarys leer but spoiled it by winking if you were half the carpet knight you pretend to be youd have debauched yourself to death years ago gerin said and if you were as sour as you let on youd long since have pickled in your own juice rihwin retorted a shot with so much justice that gerin chuckled and owned himself beaten he stood first watch that night by sunset he had grown so edgy that he decided to chew some aoratos leaves himself regardless of their flavor he felt fatigue flow away as the juice coursed through his veins the curious extra sense the plant conferred showed him a squirrel asleep in its nest high in an aspen tree a fox stalking a vole a nightjar whipping after fluttering moths the ghosts seemed troubled thanks to his added perception gerin could almost make out the cause of their alarm but in the end it eluded him he did not know whether hed swallowed more leaves this time or this was a more potent aoratos but its effects were still strong in him when he woke rihwin they made the baron reluctant to seek sleep at once he was also curious to learn what the southerner would think of the plant pah rihwin almost choked on the first mouthful but choked it down a gourmets delight it is not he chewed more leaves a few minutes passed his breath began to whistle more quickly through his nostrils his voice grew soft and dreamy how bright tiwaz is like polished silver after another moment is that a ferret over there gerin he pointed into the darkness the baron felt his own mind reach out i think it is remarkable and the ghostshear them wail they talked idly for a while trying with scant success to find some everday sensation comparable to that induced by the aoratos this is foolishness gerin said at last if there were half a dozen things like it it would not be marvelous at all astutely reasoned rihwin answered his tone mildly sarcastic from that it would follow he paused in midsentenced exclaimed the ghosts are gone they were fled away as suddenly and completely as if driven to shelter by the rising sun the gloom outside the campfires glow seemed somehow strange and flat surrounded by this great stillness the cry of a hunting owl came shockingly loud gerins surprised senses were still groping for an explanation when rihwin now feeling the aoratos more strongly than did the baron whispered i know why they fled look north looking was not what was required but gerin understood the blood froze in his veins as he sensed the approaching demon only the aoratos plant let him do so without it the flying monster would have stayed unseen undetected until it descended on the travelers like a hawk stooping on roosting fowl the huge demon drew swiftly nearer like a stone hurled from a gods hand even with the aoratos its shape was hard to define gerin was most reminded of the jellyfish that floated in the greater inner sea but the analogy was imperfect for balamungs sendingthe baron had no doubt it was suchsurveyed with three bright pitiless eyes the landscape over which it sailed for mouth it had a rasping sucker disk set with hundreds of tiny curved teeth the edges of its gross body blurred and wavered like a stone seen through running water still while in this plane it had to be vulnerable to weapons however fearsome its appearance though fear gripped him gerin strung his bow and set an arrow in it his fingers worked more of themselves than under his conscious direction but the demon halted well out of bowshot the barons heart sank he saw no way to lure it into range before it began a killing rush too swift to give him a good shot whistling tunelessly rihwin glanced from bow to demon the creature gave no sign of immediate attack it seemed as uncertain as the men it faced words formed in the barons mind how do you know of me the manthing who sent me forth promised easy meat not warriors with weapons to hand for no reason gerin understood rihwin was grinning nor is that the only way in which your master deceived you he said he spoke softly to avoid waking van and elise who could not sense the demon it felt his ideas as he and gerin perceived its i name no manthing master its thought dinned in gerins head more quietly it asked and how else am i deceived why by thinking you can do us harm when you cannot so much as touch us rihwin answered airily how not the demon asked gerin was tempted to do the same they had no protection against it as it surely knew but rihwin was not perturbed consider he said to reach us you first must traverse half the distance not so what of it the demon snarled then you will travel half the remaining interval and then half of that and half that and so on forever you may come as close as you like but reach us you never will gerin felt the demon muttering to itself as it pursued rihwins chain of logic it did not seem very intelligent relying on invisibility and ferocity it had rarely needed much in the way of wits at last it said you are wrong manthing and my showing you this will be your death terrifyingly quick it was twice as close as before it halted for a moment do you see it halved the gap again paused to show itselfand gerin drove his arrow cleanly through its central eye it screamed like a woman broken on the rack and was gone fleeing back to whatever plane balamung had summoned it from gerin thought that agonyfilled cry had to wake everything for miles but only he and rihwin seemed to hear it van and elise slept on and all was unchanged out in the darkness no not quitethe ghosts returned their murmurs now far less fearfilled than before the baron picked up the denuded aoratos bush he hefted it thoughtfully thank the gods for this little plant he said to rihwin without it wedve been nothing but appetizers for that devil at the moment i am still too terrified to move let alone think about anything so abstract as giving thanks you have an unpleasant and powerful enemy my fellow fox ive already told you that didnt you believe me before as for fear you handled yourself better than i didi thought we were done for till you stalled the demon rihwin shrugged that paradox always did intrigue me i first heard a variation of it posed at the collegium purportedly to demonstrate that a longtooth could never catch its prey even were the victim five times slower than it its logically perfect but it cant be true wheres the flaw i havent the faintest idea nor did my instructor your elucidation with the bow seemed as elegant as any gerin tried to sleep he was too keyed up to find rest quickly he was still awake when rihwin passed the watch to van and listened to his friends sulfurous oaths at not having been waked to help fight the demon van was still grumbling complaints into his beard as his comrades at last gave in to slumber the next morning gerin let elise drive for a while and tried to get more sleep in the back of the wagon he knew van had managed the trick on the way south now he wondered how every pothole was magnified tenfold when felt all along his body and rumbling wheels and creaking axles did nothing to help his repose redeyed and defeated he came forward to take the reins again traffic was light for which he gave thanks he wished van had been able to buy a pair of shanda horses instead of just the one the shaggy little animal pulled magnificently it seemed never to tire its harnessmate the gray gelding was willing enough but lacked the steppe beasts endurance it exhaustedly hung its head at every rest stop gerin was afraid its wind would break if he pushed it much harder from the chariot rihwin was sharing with him van pointed up the road at an approaching traveler and said someones coming in one awful hurry probably another whoreson of a courier gerin said he reached for his bow nonetheless a courier it was whipping his horses as if all the fiends of all the hells were after him the beasts scarlet flaring nostrils and lathered sides said they had been used so for some time way clear the way the courier shouted as he thundered past he was gone in the blink of an eye but not before gerin saw the long trokme arrow lodged in the crown of his broadbrimmed hat north of the kirs the blow had fallen rihwin stared blankly at the dismayed looks his friends wore like gerin elise and van had recognized that arrow for what it was elise hid her face in her hands and wept when the baron put an arm around her he almost steered the wagon into rihwins chariot careful captain van said gerins laugh was shaky here i am trying to make elise feel better and look at me will someone please tell me what the trouble is rihwin asked plaintively gerin did in a couple of curt sentences despite the gray geldings exhaustion he urged more speed from his horses thats good thinking van called you can bet theres a mob a few hours or a day behind that courier all of them hightailing it south as fast as they can go best make haste while the roads still clear a pox i hadnt even thought of that gerin added another worry to his list he tried to comfort elise who was still sobbing beside him she shook his arm away i wish i had never lefti should be with my father she cried even harder i know he said quietly but no one can change what you did not god or man all we can do now is wait to see how things are north of the kirs and not borrow trouble till we know wonderful he told himself you talk as if you thought you really could do itand if your own guts knot any tighter you can use them for lute strings despite his own doubts his words seemed to reach elise she raised her tearstreaked face trying without much success to smile as the hours passed and the kirs loomed ever taller on the horizon a spurious calm came to the northbound travelers they talked of life in the capital legends from kizzuwatna swordfishfishing on the bay of parvela south of sithoniaanything except the trokmoi and what was happening on the far side of the mountains as van had guessed they soon began meeting refugees fleeing the trokme invasion the first one they saw brought a sardonic smile to gerins face there stood carus beos son tall in his chariot he used his whip with more vigor than the baron thought he still had he shot passed gerins party without recognizing them the marchwarden of the north was but the precursor of a steadily swelling stream of fugitives many with better reasons to flee than his the warriors who appeared had the look of defeated troops they straggled south in small dejected parties and many were wounded now and again gerin saw a minor baron among them sometimes leading his family and a small party of retainers more often alone haggard and afraid the fox kept hoping to find a man he knew so he could stop him and grill him at length for two days he was disappointed on the third he spied a merchant who had been to fox keep two or three times a man called merric forkbeard the trader was still leading a string of donkeys but their packsaddles were all empty gerin looked in vain for the two youths who had accompanied merric in times past when merric heard the baron call his name he pulled off the road to share what word he had he took a skin of wine his hands shook as he raised it to his lips he had only a few more years on him than did gerin but looked to have added another ten in the past few days his thin face which gerin remembered as full of quiet humor was gray and drawn his eyes haunted i cant tell you as much as id like fox he said running fingers through thinning sandy hair six days ago i was on the road between drotars holding and clain the fluteplayersa good bit southwest of your keep i guess that iswhen i saw smoke ahead it was the plaguetaken woodsrunners burning out a peasant village and acting as if not a soul in the world could stop them i turned around and headed southand ran into an ambush he bit his lip thats when i lost my nephews they died cleanlyi think gerin tried to express his sympathy but merric brushed it aside its done its done he said tiredly he took another pull at the wineskin went on i will say youre the last man i ever expected to see south of the mountains i was looking for help against the trokmoi though i didnt find much even if you had it would do you little good what why i came through the pass hours ago even then officers and men were rushing about making ready to seal it off what use would your aid be trapped on this side of the kirs gerin stared at him aghast hours ago you say aye then i have no time to waste bandying words with you i fear the gods keep you safe merric and may we meet again in happier times the baron twitched the reins and got his wagon into motion van and rihwin followed close behind in the northerners chariot merric watched them speed north i dont think im the one who needs the gods for my safety he muttered to himself now gerin could show the gray gelding no pity once north of the kirs he might be able to replace it but unless he forced an allout effort from it now all such problems would cease to matter the rich southern countryside flashed by in a blur to the north the kirs grew ever taller their crowns of snow were smaller than they had been twenty days before high summer was drawing near the stream of fugitives continued to thicken clogging the road and stretching the barons nerves tighter yet had that stream failed all his hope would have vanished with it for he would have known the pass was sealed he raced through the grimy town of fibis past its crucifixes and into the foothills now cursing desperately at every slight delay the gray began to fail its nostril flared to suck in great gulps of air and its sides heaved with the effort it was making but it plainly could not keep up the killing pace much longer gerin felt its anguish as keenly as if it were his own strange he thought how in the end all his hopes rode not on his own wit or brawn but on the stamina of a suffering beast much too slowly the pass drew near another party of refugees appeared ahead blocking the roadway and forcing the fox to the verge no these were not refugeesthey were the garrison troops who had manned the pass they marched south in good order spears neatly shouldered if they were pulling out the pass would be closed very soon even curses failed gerinhad he come so far to miss by so little at last the gap came into sight the barons heart descended from his throat when he saw it was still unblocked but at his approach an officer stepped into the road backed by a double squad of archers the officer stepped forward with a salute introduced himself as usgild son of annar i am most sorry sirs lady no travel is permitted beyond this point we are but minutes from ending contact with the north as it is under strong barbarian attack i knowthats why im here gerin quickly outlined his need having heard him out usgild shook his head i cannot take the responsibility for delaying a measure vital to the safety of my empire as if to underscore his words his archers nocked arrows can nothing persuade you gerin asked hearing the finality in usgilds voice perhaps he thought frantically i can bribe him but he knew that had to be futile usgild seemed honest even if he wasn t gerin did not have enough money to buy him nonetheless he rummaged through his pocketsand his fingers closed on the tiny bronze imperial hand the agent tevis had left behind in grizzards tavern he drew it forth and displayed it on his upturned palm can nothing persuade you he repeated not even this he was afraid usgild would doubt his right to the token but the officer sprang to attention at the sight of the most potent official talisman the empire knew my lord i had no idea never mind all that gerin said determined to give him no chance to wonder send a man at once to hold things up until we are through hanno the officer bawled one of his archers raced for a chariot gerin decided more not less effrontery would make him seem genuine my supplies are a bit low i could use some field rations and alsohe held his breatha fresh horse to replace this poor creature usgild was beyond questions at once under his efficient direction his men met gerins needs a sturdy bay stallion replaced the gelding which barely had the strength to be led away soldiers stowed square loaves of journeybread salt beef smoked sausages and lumps of pale hard cheese in the back of the wagon they and their commander eyed the fox with almost servile respect doing his bidding as though they thought their lives were hanging in the balance they probably did gerin thought sourlyan imperial hand was no one to trifle with he wondered why tevis had seen fit to give him the emblem of his office could a hand have realized the barons in their way served the emperor too it was hard to credit a southern man with such breadth of vision but then tevis whatever else he had been was no ordinary southerner usgild broke into gerins thoughts my lord may i ask your mission in the north i intend to seek out and slay the wizard who controls the trokmoi for the first time gerin spoke simple truth and for the first time usgild looked unbelieving the baron hardly blamed him as he himself had no idea how to put an end to balamung the soldier hanno returned flicking a salute to gerin he said imperial hand or no sir if i were you id hustle down the pass you ve got some wizards mighty peeved at you they were about halfway through their spells when i told them to hold up and theyre not what youd call pleased about having to wait and start over a party like usgilds must have been covering the northern end of the pass the gap through the kirs so congested and noisy when gerin had come south was achingly empty and silent the empires fortresses stared emptyeyed at wagon and chariot moving lonesomely where hundreds of men beasts and wains usually passed half a dozen sorcerers paced the battlements of their sparkling glassy towers they too glowered down on the baron and his comrades though they were too high and too far for him to read their faces the very snap of their robes in the breeze bespoke annoyance as soon as he was past the wizards began their spells anew moving in sharp precisely defined patterns and chanting antiphonally their voices thin and high in the vast quiet followed gerin a long way down the pass i know that spell rihwin said but to think of using it on such a scale his voice trailed away he urged his dapples out in front of the wagon the commander of the pass had been no fool to stop southbound traffic he had posted at the gaps northern outlet not a token force of archers but a solid company of spearmen and charioteers they were needed the road stretching north was full of fugitives shouting begging threatening gesticulating but leaderless and not quite daring to rush the orderly ranks of gleaming spearheads standing between themselves and the southland the din was dreadful or so gerin thought for a moment then the earth shook beneath the wagon the subbass roar of endless tons of cascading stone left his ears stunned and ringing a dustfilled blast of wind shrieked out of the pass behind him it caught a couple of birds and sent them tumbling through the air guardsmen and refugees cried out in terror but no sound from a merely human throat could pierce the avalanche looks like im home for good gerin said no one could hear him either but what did that matter the fact itself seemed clear enough x as inconspicuously as he could gerin made his way through the shaken solidery no one tried to stop him if any of the imperial troops had he would have shown them the hand he was glad he did not have to he did not want to find out how they would react to the symbol of a regime which had just marooned them on the wrong side of the mountains those who had fled their homes and lands in the face of the trokme onslaught now parted before gerin stepping aside like wolves in the presence of a longtooth any man going north of his own free will had to be of superior stuff not to be hindered by the likes of them rihwin let the baron catch up to him then said you will surely need a fighting tail later why not start collecting it now gerin shook his head these are the ones who ran first and fastest i might be able to shame some into coming with me but theyd likely disappear again at the first sign of a red mustache right you are captain van said later well run into some who got honestly beat bushwhacked like poor merric or just too many woodsrunners and not enough of them that bunch will be aching for revenge or a second chance or what have you theyll be the ones we take along the two of you make good sense riwhin said adding thoughtfully theres more to this business than meets the eye they rolled through cassat not long before nightfall fighting heavy southbound traffic all the way the town was nearly deserted most of its soldiers and the folk who catered to them must have fled with carus beos son looters prowled through abandoned shops and taverns seeking valuables drink more potent than water or perhaps just shelter for the night at most times gerin would have been after them sword in hand to his way of thinking they were worse than trokmoi scavengers preying off the misfortunes of others now he had more important concerns he drove by wanting to put as much distance as he could between the rats nest cassat had become and his camp for the night only nothos crescent was in the sky when the sun went down math was a day and a half past new and lost in the glow of sunset tiwaz would not rise till midnight and ruddy elleb less than two hours before the next sunrise strange not to have the kirs staring us in the face elise remarked her three companions round the campfire nodded to gerin it was not only strange but wonderful for the past couple of days the mountains and the sealing of the pass had loomed over him like a death sentence now he felt reprieved tomorrow he would need to start thinking of balamung and the trokmoi again but as he drew in a deep breath of cool night air made flavorful by the fires smoke he deliberately suppressed such worries some responsibility though had to stay with him we need to be really careful on watch tonight he said some of the fools on the run will be more afraid of the trokmoi than the ghosts theyll likely be on the move tonight and who knows the woodsrunners may be this far south already travelers in the night there were but no trokmoi and no problems at least during the barons watch but when he woke the next morning to the sound of rihwins fervent cursing he knew something had gone wrong what now he muttered groping for his sword the plaguetaken wines gone sour rihwin said its no better than vinegar great dyaus above from the howl you raised i thought it was balamung come in person worse things have happened than sour wine my friend so have better ones you cannot know what torment my year at ricolfs was away from the sweet grape aye and look at the trouble you got into once you had it back van said rihwin ignored him by the gods id thought a years separation long enough but here i am bereft again if you must have you precious wine gerin snapped are you not mage enough to call it back from vinegar if not why did i ask you to come with me rihwin refused to notice the expasperation in gerins voice but eagerly seized on his idea your wits are with you my fellow fox i learned that spell naturally elise murmured so low only gerin heard and its easy to cast as usual the southerner was quick to fit action to thought he rummaged through his gear producing a packet of grayish powder and a minor grimoire gerin was relieved to see him checking the spell before he used it but still felt a gnawing sense of unease things were moving too fast and out of his control rihwin fed tinder to the nearly dead embers of the fire coaxing them back into flame he sprinkled a few drops of the turned wine onto the fire chanting an invocation in sithonian the gray powder followed it produced an aromatic cloud of smoke rihwin chanted on and to thee o great mavrix gerins unease became alarm but too late with a whistling hiss the summoned god in all his effeminate finery stood before rihwin so mavrix screeched bouncing with wrath you are in league with this miscreant and have the gall to seek my aid the furious deity pointed a finger at gerin somethow it did not seem strange that the digit should lengthen till it thumped the barons chest i will never help you wizard never never mavrix shouted dancing around the little fire in a sort of wardance and you shall never have the chance to ask my aid again mortal wretch now and forevermore you have forfeited your right to work sorcery and be thankful i leave you the remainder of your pustulent life take that oxgoad the god added for gerins benefit he stuck out a long pink tongue like a frogs made a gesture street urchins often used in the capital and vanished what was all that in aid of rihwin asked whitefaced i told you before the god and i had a disagreement not long ago disagreement forsooth the next time you have a disagreement with a god my dear gerin please let me know in advance so i can take myself elsewherefar elsewhere rihwin tried to resume his interrupted spell stopped in confusion a pox the pestilential godlet did it i still know every spell i ever knew but i cant use them no wine no magic he seemed ready to burst into tears so for the moment was gerin he had gone south with high hopes and returned withwhat a suddenly useless wizard and some sour wine no fool wait he told himself before his mood altogether blackenedtheres elise and shes worth troubles a dozen times worse than these his gloomy side added or she will be if troubles no worse than these at all dont kill you first the elabon way continued packed with refugees they fled south toward a safety that no longer existed carrying on their backs or in handcarts such pitiful belongings as they had salvaged pushing north against them was so slow that at last much against his will gerin decided to leave the highway and travel on back roads though less direct he hoped they would also be less traveled his hopes were justified most of that day he made better progress than he had since hed first seen that accursed imperial courier but as the first cool evening breezes began to blow what must have been the whole population of two or three farming villages jammed the narrow track on which he was traveling the peasants had their women children and meager possessions in ramshackle carts driven by oxen or asses they drove their flocks of cattle and sheep before them when the baron tried to tell them the way through the kirs was blocked they listened in dull incomprehension as if he were speaking some foreign tongue and continued on their way the same thing happened three more times in the next two days gerins pace slowed to a crawl once more he had the feeling the whole world was against him he was brusque even with elise and so churlish toward rihwin and van that the outlander finally growled captain why dont you shut up and do us all a favor shamefaced the fox apologized later that day gerin heard a commotion ahead but thick woods and winding road kept its nature hidden he van and rihwin reached for their weapons but when the path opened out into a clearing they put them downthere would be no fighting here instead of trokmoi they had come upon yet another group of peasants taking flight and the local lordlet trying to talk them out of it or so gerin thought at first a moments listening showed him the noble had given up on that and was telling them what he thought of them for going you cheesefaced goatbuggering arselicking whores get the nobles command of invective was marvelous even van listened in wideeyed admiration the fellows appearance complemented his delivery he was a solidly made man of about thirtyfive he had a fierce red face with one eye covered by a leather patch thick brows and a tangled black beard he wore a bearskin cape over broad shoulders and massive chest and carried a brace of scabbardless swords on his belt lizardlivered graverobbing sodomites the abuse rolled off his tenants like water from oiled leather they were going whether he liked it or not despite the three troopers and two chariots he had at his back there were at least twenty men in the exodus each with scythe mattock or pitchfork close at hand gerin wished they would have been as ready to take up arms against the trokmoi as the peasants began to move the minor baron noticed gerin who in the five hells are you he growled why arent you on the run like these pissweeds here gerin named himself and his friends he asked are the woodsrunners so close then to send your villeins flying close ive yet to see one of the poxridden bandits for all theyve sent these dungheaded clods aflying aye and most of my fighting men too ive seen partridges with more heart in em than they showed he spat in utter contempt and slowly began to calm im nordric oneeye in case youre wonderinglord hereabouts not that i look to have much left to be lord over friend nordric rihwin said would it please you to fare north with us and take vengeance on the barbarians who have caused such chaos nordric lifted an eyebrow at the southerners phrasing but the notion of hitting back at the trokmoi was too tempting for him to resist please me great dyaus above id like nothing better those sheepfuttering lousebitten woodsrunning robbers he rumbled on for another couple of angry sentences then he and one of his men climbed aboard one chariot and the other two soldiers into the second his driver gerin learned as they began to travel was amgath andars son one of the last pair was effo and the other cleph but the fox was not sure which was which neither of them said much nor for that matter did amgath that did not surprise gerin nordric talked enough for four not only that he kept peppering his speech even on the most innocuous subjects with fluent explosive profanity rihwin steered close to gerin its as well for him hes short an eyeotherwise theyd surely style him nordric swillmouth the baron grinned and nodded he was still glad to have nordric along he did not think the foulmouthed baron would shrink from a fight or his men either facing trokmoi in battle had to be less terrifying than confronting an angry nordric afterwards though armed nordric and his men carried few provisions gerin had resupplied from imperial stores at the pass but he knew what he had would not feed eight people long the food would go even faster if he gathered more followers that meant spending time hunting instead of traveling something he resented but whose necessity he recognized more companions though also meant more men to stand watch freed from the need to break his sleep with a watch in three gerin spent the early evening sitting by the fire with rihwin he studied the southerners grimoires with a desperate intensity that he knew was almost surely futile still he persisted the vengeful mavrix had taken rihwins power to work magic but not it seemed his ability to pass on what he knew here rihwin pointed to an incantation written in the sinuous kizzuwatnan script this is another spell for the destruction of one s enemies when a bit of their spittle hair or nail parings is in ones possession how does it differ from the more usual one the one i would have set on the fair namarra it has the advantage of needing no elaborate preparation but is more dangerous to the caster unless perfectly performed it will fall on his head rather than the intended victims hmm the spell looked simple enough involving only a couple of genuflections and some easy passes with the left hand but as gerin studied its verbal element his first enthusiasm faded the kizzuwatnan text was one long tonguetwister full of puns subtle allusions to gods he barely knew constantly shifting patterns of rhyme and rhythm he almost passed at once to the next charm then stung by the challenge and artistry of the ancient versicle he stopped and read it again and again until it was fairly well lodged in his mind i have it he said at last adding i think whats next here is one ive always found useful it keeps horses hooves sound and strong and helps prevent all sorts of lameness yes i can see where that would be a good thing to know ah good its in sithonian too let me have a closer look and soon the veterinary magic was also stored in the barons capacious memory the next day dawned luminously clear the sun leaped into a sky of almost southern clarity and brilliance the fine weather pleased gerin less than it might have under other circumstances in such heat armor became an itchy sweaty torment but trouble was too close to chance removing it thus the baron longing for relief from the sweltering day was glad to hear the rush of river water ahead but almost at the same instant he became aware of other sounds rising above the streams plashing the clash of bronze on bronze the deep battle cries of elabonian fighting men and the higher wilder yells of the trokmoi van was driving rihwins chariot when he caught the noise of combat his head jerked up like that of a dog suddenly taking a scent a fight he shouted his voice pure glee the gods beshrew me a fight he sent the light car bounding forward with such a rush that he almost pitched the startled rihwin into the roadway nordric and his driver were right behind the stocky baron swearing sulfurously on his heels were his liegemen leaving gerin to bring up the rear the fox cursed as fervently as nordric but for a different reason the last thing he wanted was to expose elise to the risks of war but he had no choice for dyaus sake stay in the wagon and dont draw attention to yourself he handed her his bow and quiver use them only if you have to black willows grew along the riverbank under their low spreading branches a grim drama was under way with seven southerners battling twice as many trokmoi the elabonians had accounted for four woodsrunners but three of their own number were down and the survivors desperately fighting back to back at the waters edge when unexpected rescue arrived the trokmoi shouted in dismay as gerins band leaped from chariots and wagons and loosed murder among them van was a thunderstorm gerin and rihwin a pair of deadly snakes striking and flickering away before being struck in return nordrics men fought with dour competence but the petty baron himself brought the worst terror to the barbarians at last come to grips with the foes who had turned his life upside down he went berserkermad his ruddy features darkening to purple incoherent cries of raw rage roaring from his throat spittle flecking his beard with white swinging a sword in each meaty hand he rampaged through the trokmoi oblivious to his own safety as long as he felt flesh cleave and bones shatter beneath his hammerstrokes the trokmoi broke and ran after half of them had fallen all but one were cut down from behind by the vengeful elabonians an arrow from the wagon brought down the last of them who had outdistanced his pursuerselise once more proving her worth the onslaught was so sudden and fierce that nordrics man cleph was the only elabonian badly hurt he had a great gash in his thigh gerin washed it with wine and styptics and bound it up but the bleeding would not stop cleph was pale and clammy and seemed partly out of his wits youre going to have to tie off his leg van said i hate to gerin answered if i leave the tie on for more than a few hours the leg may go gangrenous and if i take it off hell probably start bleeding again look at him though hell damn well bleed out on you right now if you dont do something in a hurry van said shaking his head gerin applied the tourniquet the flow of blood slowed to a trickle but cleph remained semiconscious muttering curses under his breath against demons only he could see nordrics battledemon on the other hand deserted him after the fight was done a man in a daze he wandered across the small field of combat staring at the results of his own butchery dip me in dung and fry me for a chicken he grunted apparently not much believing what he saw friend nordric must your every phrase have an oath in it rihwin asked thats not so nordric began but his driver amgath interrupted him i fear it is my lord he said remember what happened when holgar the raven bet you a goldpiece you couldnt go a day without saying something vile you son of a whore youre on you said and forfeited on the spot the four footsoldiers gerin and his comrades had saved were glad to take service with him two of them had lost brothers to the trokmoi and another a cousin they were all burning to retaliate the worst thing about dying here said one would have been knowing wed only taken a woodsrunner apiece with us elise found herself less troubled over the trokme shed slain than she had been at ikos which in turn troubled her that evening she said to gerin i dont understand it he was only running away and the driver back at the sibyls shrine was trying to kill us but the first death left me sick for days and now i feel almost nothing only that i did what i had to do which is nothing less than true the fox said though he knew it did not help much he stood a late watch and a strange one in that no moons were in the sky tiwaz was new that night elleb a thin crescent golden math a fatter one and pale slowmoving nothos just past first quarter by an hour past midnight it was cool quiet and amazingly dark countless dim stars the baron had never seen before powdered the sky with silver their light for once not drowned by the moons cleph died early the next day he had never really come to himself after the shock of the wound and whenever the tourniquet was loosened it began to bleed again they hastily buried him and pressed on two men joined them that day half a dozen more on the next footsoldiers all of necessity gerin was reduced to a pace a walking man could keep he wondered it the added numbers were worth the delay and considered moving ahead with chariots alone van and nordric were all for it rihwin advised caution events soon proved him right the barons fighting tail was emerging from forest into cleared fields when a wild shout from ahead made them all grab for weapons just out of bowshot waited a force of trokmoi of nearly the same makeup as their own four chariots and a double handful of retainers afoot about half the northerners wore plundered elabonian armor the others were in their native tunics and trousers except for one tall gaunt barbarian who was naked but for shield and weapons gerin heard a growl go up behind him he knew the men at his back were wild to hurl themselves against the trokmoi but he did not want to fight at this moment against this foe the little armies were too evenly matched even if he won the battle he would be defenseless against the next band of woodsrunners he happened across the trokme seemed to have similar thoughts which puzzled the baron most northerners fought first and questioned later he watched bemused as the chief winded a long straight horn he was no trumpeter but gerin recognized the call he had blown parley he waved an agreement got down from the wagon and walked alone into the field he ignored the scandalized murmurs of his men those stopped abruptly when van announced the next one of you who carps will be carp stew his huge right fist fingers tight round the sweatstained leather grip of his mace was a persuasive argument the northerner met gerin halfway between their men empty hands outstretched before him plump for a woodsrunner but catcourteous the trokme bowed low and said i am dagdogma the son of iucharba who was the son of amergin the great cattlethief who was the son of laeg the smith who was gerin composed himself to wait out the genealogy which if it was like most others would go back ten or twelve generations to a god sure enough dagdogma finished who was the son of great fomor himself he waited in turn gerin did not think it wise to reveal his true name to the barbarian call me tevis he said picking the first name he thought of like dagdogma he spoke in elabonian the son of dagdogma prompted politely nobody i fear ah well a mans a man for all hes a bastard and a fine crew you have with you not that we couldnt deal with them but im thinking twould be a shame and a waste of my lads and yours both to be fighting the now gerin studied dagdogma suspecting a trick things he had not noticed at first began to register the elabonian womens rings the trokme had jammed onto his little fingers the gleaming soft leather boots he wore instead of the woodsrunners usual rawhide the booty piled high in his chariots the baron suddenly understood this was no northern wolf just a jackal out to scavenge what he could with as little effort as possible the fox was filled with relief and contempt at the same time his talk with dagdogma went quickly and well since each for his own reasons neither man had any stomach for fighting the trokme trotted back to his men he moved them off along a forest track running west clearing the way north for gerin and his troop but gerins own warriors were unhappy he had talked his way past the trokmoi instead of hewing through them i came in with you to kill the whoresons not pat em on the fanny as they go by said one of the men who had joined just that day if youre going to fight your fool war like that count me out id sooner do it right he stamped away followed by four more footsoldiers of like spirit van looked questioningly at gerin asking with his eyes whether to bring them back by force the baron shook his head he had no use for unwilling followers in turn he eyed nordric curiously hed expected the hottempered lordlet to leave him the moment he ducked a confrontation nordric spat he said that was just a pig in a red mustache and scarce worth the slaughter therell be real fighting soon enoughi think you draw bloodspilling like honey draws flies just what i need gerin thought but he had the uneasy feeling nordric was right as he and his band moved north the next day signs of the devastation the trokmoi were working became more frequent corpses by the roadside some elabonian warriors some woodsrunners and all too many serfs hacked down for the sport of it empty peasant villages some abandoned others gutted smoking ruins livestock wantonly slaughtered and now rotting in the sun fields of wheat and oats trampled into ruin or torched and a good many keeps overthrown a couple of castles now flew northern banners some of the trokmoi at least had come to stay their raiding parties were everywherebands of half a dozen men or so under no real leadership out more for the joy of fighting and the hope of booty than for balamung or the conquest of the world the trokmoi seemed surprised to see a sizable party of elabonians under arms they gave them a wide berth the farther north gerin went the fewer refugees he came across most of those who had fled had already fallen to the barbarians perished on the road or made their way south the few fugitives he did encounter could tell him little they had been skulking in the woods for days now none wanted to join him his homelands agony brought torment to the fox how could he alleviate it even if he beat balamung twenty years of peace will hardly repair this he said bitterly that night and when has the border ever known twenty years of peace only the moons almost evenly spaced across the sky were above all strife nothos had been nearly due southeast at sunset math a day past first quarter elleb just at it rushing toward his three slower siblings tiwaz was now a fat waxing crescent as twilight deepened the fourfold shadows they cast spread fanwise from men chariots and trees the ghosts began their senseless night whispers although gerins troop was still traveling by back roads elise began to recognize the cast of the land the next morning pointing to a keep crowning a hillock ahead she said that holding belongs to tibald drinkwater one of my fathers vassals we must be less than a day from home the fox had not dared hope he could come this far unscathed an unfamiliar confidence began to grow in him it was rudely dashed when he drew closer to tibalds keep and discovered it had been abandoned and looted and its palisade torn down a little later the path they were following merged with the elabon way without hesitation gerin led his band onto the highway they sped north for the castle of ricolf the red van left rihwins chariot and joined the fox he took over the driving elise despite her protests was relegated to the rear of the wagon if they traveled openly through country held by their foes they had to do so in battle order one of the new footsoldiers took vans place with rihwin as van tested the edge of one of his chakrams with a callused forefinger he said softly captain if ricolfs holding has fallen youll look a right fool coming up on it in the open like this if ricolfs holding has fallen ill be in too much trouble to care how i look the last time gerin traveled this stretch of road it had been too dark and he was going too fast to pay much attention to landmarks by now though elise was on land she had known since birth as soon as we round this next bend well be able to see the keep she said aye there it is van said a moment later and the red banner still flying too but whats all that folderol around the moattents and things he drew up the wagon gerin waved the rest of his little force to a halt its a dyausaccursed siege camp thats what it is the baron said who would have thought it from the trokmoi freeze blast and damn balamung still though i think we may be able to give them a surprise he climbed down from the wagon and talked briefly with his men they nodded and readied themselves the trokmoi had set up their perimeter just out of bowshot from the ramparts of ricolfs castle intending to starve it into submission a scallop in the outer edge of the moat showed where they had tried to hurry matters by filling it and storming the walls that plainly had failed no one raised an alarm as gerin and his men drew close as the baron had noticed the woodsrunners did not seem to think an armed party could belong to anyone but themselves but sooner than the fox hoped a sharpeyed trokme raised a shout esus taranis and teutates the southrons it is quick as he was he was too late gerins men were already rushing forward foot and chariotry alike a flight of fire arrows sent trails of smoke across the sky the arrows landed on the woolen fabric of the trokme tents a second flight followed the first a couple of archers had time for a third release before they had to reach for spear and sword to defend themselves from the barbarians who came rushing from the siege line to meet this new threat the trokmoi hurled themselves into battle with their usual ferocity these were no fainthearts like dagdogma and his crew but gerins attack cast them into confusion and after the first few moments they had no leader to direct their courage van took care of that he sent a chakram spinning into the throat of a gildedhelmed noble it cut him down in the midst of a shouted order what fine things chakrams are van told gerin as he readied another knifeedged quoit i can cast them and drive at the same time as he had in the capital he handled the wagon as if it were a chariot the baron who had both hands free felled two barbarians with wellplaced arrows battle madness seized nordric harder now than it had by the river disdaining even his sword he leaped from his chariot seized a trokme and broke him over his knee like a dry stick an instant later he was down himself caught in the side of the head by the flat of a northerners blade three elabonian footsoldiers held off the trokmoi until he was on his feet and fighting again leaderless or no the woodsrunners badly outnumbered gerins men he was beginning to wonder if hed bitten off more than he could chew when as hed hoped their camp began to blaze many of them pulled out of the fight in dismay they tried to fight the flames or salvage what belongings and booty they could then ricolfs drawbridge thudded down he and his men fell on the barbarians from the rear ricolf and a few of his followers had harnessed their chariots their arrows spread destruction through the northerners the battle was suddenly a rout the trokmoi fled singly and in small groups turning to loose an occasional arrow but not daring to stand and fight ricolf and his charioteers rode a short distance in pursuit but had no real mass of fugitives to chase they soon reined in then the men from the besieged castle were all over gerins troopers they squeezed their hands pounded their backs and yelled congratulations and thanks but their jubilation faded as they recognized first rihwin and then gerin and van curiosity replaced it that grew tenfold when elise stuck her head out of the wagon many shouted happily to see her but as many seemed confused ricolf returned from the hunt his jaw dropped when he caught sight of rihwin who was having a hurt arm attended to what are you doing here he growled rihwin flinched he started to stammer a reply but ricolf paid no heed he had just seen gerin van and his daughter gerin waited in some apprehension not sure what the older barons reaction would be ricolf got down from his chariot speechless and shaking his head he folded elise into his arms then turned to the fox i might have known trouble would lure you back kidnapper he said gerin was relieved to hear no anger in his tone your timely return has an explanation im sure would you hear it now this very instant if any man is entitled i am having recovered some but not quite enough of his usual aplomb rihwin suggested perhaps to cool his throat after his exertions my fellow fox could use a cup of wine he stopped abruptly the glare ricolf turned on him was frightening rihwin you are a fine young man in many ways ricolf said but if ever i hear the word wine in your mouth again i vow it will have my fist there for company so unmoistened gerin plunged into the tale his comrades did not let him tell it unhindered but he controlled the flow of it and it went well he saw ricolfs men many of whom had given him hard looks when he began coming round as he spoke when he was done ricolf stayed silent a long time he finally said do you know i believe you no one would make up such an unlikely story the last person who said something like that was valdabrun gerin told him from what i remember of my brotherinlaw he has trouble believing the sun comes up each morning he misses a good deal of the juice in life a twinkle in his eye ricolf asked elise do you mean to tell me youd rather have this devious wretch than a forthright warrior like wolfar she kissed the fox by way of answer ricolf turned to gerin frankly fox i thought you had more sense than to get involved in a tangle like this one frankly so did i hmm a year ago i had elises wedding plans firmly in hand and now i seem to have very little to say about them as i recall gerin you said something about a mind of her own you were right the gods know this though i say and mean i think you will make my daughter a good husband but there will be no rushed wedding for fear of what the future may bring if it should bring ill such a wedding had better never happened when the trokmoi are driven away that will be time enough i cant quarrel with you gerin said he saw disappointment cross elises face but ricolfs demand was only just under the circumstances van said ricolf would you put a fist in my face if i asked for a mug of ale in your face ricolf laughed youre like the thousandpound thrush in the riddle who perches where he pleases things are a bit tightthe damned barbarians have been sitting outside for some days were a long way from being starved out though come along all of you well see what we can do you spoke of wolfar in jest a moment ago gerin said what happened to him after i ah left suddenly when he woke up which wasnt soon youre stronger than you think he tried to beat down the door of my chamber and have me send all my men after you at once id have done it too were it not for the note elise left behind ricolf said elise looked smug gerin pretended not to notice ricolf went on when i said no things grew unpleasant wolfar called me an oathbreaker and worse he said hed pull my castle down around my ears for me after that i told him he could take his carcass away while he still had ears of his own i see what you meant about him gerin he can be mild as milk when it suits him but cross him and he raves its the streak of wereblood in him gerin said it runs thinly in many families on both sides of the niffet you know but strong in his he told ricolf what had happened to wolfar when nothos and math were full together the older baron frowned i had not heard of that if i had id never have asked him here lucky such conjunctions are rare for all their joy over driving away the trokmoi neither gerins men nor ricolfs could work up much revelry the day was drawing to a close both bands were exhausted even van as dedicated a roisterer as was ever born contented himself with little more than the single mug of ale he had asked of ricolf men gnawed at smoked beef and hard bread cheese and sundried fruit then they sought bedrolls or fell asleep where they sat gerin woke in ricolfs great hall at sunrise the next morning still holding the same halfempty cup over which he d dozed off the day passed in watchful waiting everyone expected the trokmoi to try to restore their siege but the morning slipped by with no sign of the barbarians tiwaz rose at noon overlooking only peace elleb followed a couple of hours later he was trailed at hourly intervals by math and pale nothos and all was still quiet i think you may have driven them away for a while ricolf said to gerin the fox pointed to heaven wishing ricolfs words into the ear of dyaus as men began to realize the woodsrunners would not be back at once they began the celebration theyd been too worn to unleash the night before gerin and ricolf quickly saw they could not stop it the warriors needed release the barons did what they could ordering a few reliable men to stay sober and stand sentry lest the trokmoi dare a night attack among the troopers gerin chose was amgath andars son nordric oneeyes driver nordric himself happened to be close by he reinforced the foxs orders keep your eyes open you son of an unwed shemoose or ill wear your family jewels on a necklace does he always use his men so ricolf whispered to gerin no usually hes worse someone by the main gate got out a mandolin and began to play gerin thought fleetingly of tassilo and rihwin and of how a couple of foolish drunks had changed his life leaving elise tomorrow he thought would be harder in its own way than facing the trokmoi that he had done many times but only once had he left the woman hed come to love and then in hands he thought safe now even behind ricolfs sheltering walls elise was in nearly as much danger as he when one of ricolfs men passed him an earthen jug of ale he gave it back still corked he knew drink would only lower his spirits further he watched as van came up with his clay flute to accompany the mandolinplayer the man who had offered gerin ale soon joined them with one of the long horns the trokmoi favored that surprised the fox few elabonians played the northern instrument the music was loud and cheery but powerless to expel gerins gloom the sun sank and was forgotten most of the men in the holding gathered by the gate song followed bawdy song sentries shouted refrains from the stations on the wall when too many throats grew dry at once van spun things along with a tale of his days on the plains of shanda a story of high daring and higher obscenity then the soldiers roared into another ballad to escape the gaiety he could not share gerin wandered into the castles great hall dyaus altar had no offering before it now nor were the benches crowded with feasters one warrior snored atop a table his head rested in a puddle of dark sticky ale in a corner another trooper was kissing the bare breasts of a serving maid neither he nor his partner paid the fox any mind gerin walked through the dark hall kicking at rushes and bones once in the corridor beyond he stopped and looked about which sconces torch he wondered had he used to flatten wolfar was it the one by that muchscarred wooden door or its neighbor a few feet down the hallway unable to recall he turned a cornerand almost ran into elise later he realized he must have been trying to find her searching for the one happiness hed found in a collapsing world at the moment no thoughts intruded she was warm in his arms her lips and tongue met his with the same desperation he felt where he whispered stroking her hair follow me it was he thought the chamber in which hed slept on his way south that seemed fitting somehow he chuckled under his breath elise made a questioning sound he shook his head its nothing love the straw of the matress rustled as he drew her down she softly cried out beneath him three times first in pain then in wonder and then at last in joy when she rose to leave the pain of separation was nearly more than gerin could bear she bent down for a last kiss said softly come back to me and was gone he was sure he would toss for hours after the door closed behind her almost at once though he fell into a deep and dreamless sleep xi it was nearly noon the next day before the fox and his companions began the last leg of their journey he left the wagon behind ricolf lent him his own stout threeman chariot and with it a lean weathered man named priscos son of mellor his driver and shieldman gerin suspected ricolf guessed what had happened the night before why hed left the celebration so early it showed in no overt way but as the fox made small talk with the older man while getting ready to leave he felt an acceptance a closeness between them of a different sort from their earlier friendship he was glad ricolfs good opinion mattered to him elises farewell was wordless he tasted tears on her lips as they kissed goodbye he van and priscos climbed into ricolfs chariot nordric and amgath were beside them as were rihwin and effo the survivors of the fighting tail the fox had recruited along the way and a few volunteers from ricolfs holding they were twentytwo in all with four threeman and five twoman chariots priscos clucked to the horses the little army started to move the gatekeepers lowered the drawbridge one of them caught gerins eye as he passed what are you running off with this time my lord he asked nothing you dont see vukov the fox answered pleased he remembered the fellows name he doubted the gatekeeper had had a happy time the morning after elise left he turned for a last glimpse of her but the cramped confines of the gatehouse already blocked his view priscos was a man of few words most of them about horses you dont see many shanda beasts hereabouts he remarked where did you come by this one whats the name of that town in the mountains gerin van asked cassat aye thats where i picked him up cheap toothe clod of a horsetrader didnt know what he had hes been a rare worker theyre ornery i hear priscos said he went on more to himself than gerin or van reckon i can handle that though gerin was sure he could priscos had an air of quiet competence he liked as the sun sank they camped by what had been the border station between ricolfs land and bevons now the square wooden building which had housed ricolfs guardsmen was only charred ruins one more debt to pay the baron thought among so many the ghosts were strange that night their keenings and wailings were more intense and also more nearly understandable than the fox had ever heard one in particular flitted round him as if drawn like moth to flame for all its efforts he could neither make sense of what it would tell him nor recognize its pallid form in the flickering firelight that is an uncanny thing rihwin said watching the wraiths frantic but vain efforts to communicate likely its like a shanda spirit seeking to lure you away from the light so it can drink your blood van said gerin shook his head i feel no harm in it even if i cant understand what it would say besides van every ghost in the north country must have had a glut of blood by now to that the outlander had no reply but a grave nod remembering the fraternal strife tearing bevons barony even before the trokmoi invaded gerin wanted to cross it in a single day if he could he did not want to camp inside it if he could expect night marauders anywhere bevons tortured land would be the place and tortured it was the foxs band passed two battlefields before the sun was high in the southeast the woodsrunners had plundered both fields but all the bloated naked corpses seemed to be elabonians here brother had fought brother and fought with a hate greater than they turned against the trokmoi as he surveyed the second meadow filled with bodies gerins face was stony and full of bitterness poor fools he said he wondered if his words were not an epitaph for all the northland whichever brother had won the war he had not enjoyed victory long a lot of the keeps still standing were held by small bands of trokmoi they hooted in derision as they saw gerins force go by but did not move against it they think us beneath contempt the fox said to van and perhaps we are honh the next time i care what a woodsrunner thinks will be the first a bit more than halfway through bevons barony they passed a roadside holding destroyed in a way gerin had never imagined before the timbers of one whole wall of the palisade lay like jackstraws in the bailey as if kicked in by a monster boot the stone keep itself was a pile of broken rubble something white stuck out from under one limestone slab as the baron drew closer he saw it was the skeleton of a human hand and arm picked clean of flesh by scavengers no one elabonian or trokme garrisoned this keep this is the work of your balamung rihwin asked hes not mine i wish with all my heart id never heard of him gerin said but he had to nod as he spoke his warriors eyed the shattered keep with awe fear and wonder handtohand fighting against the trokmoi was all very well but how could they hope to hold against sorcery like this even nordric was grim and quiet i wonder why such powerful wizardry has not been used further south rihwin said few castles could stand against it yet here so close to the niffet is the first sign weve had of anything more than a simple barbarian invasion what difference does it make gerin said bleakly staring once more at the blasted holding maybe none maybe a great deal one explanation i can think of is that your northern mage may have so much trouble trying to lay low one particular keepi name no names mind youthat he has had little leisure to help his men elsewhere gerin gave him a grateful look the line of hope the southerner had cast him was thin but he was all but drowning in despair anything that buoyed his spirits was welcome his renewed optimism and his hope of crossing bevons lands in one day both collapsed not long after noon his band came to the top of a low rise there they stopped in horror and dismay for the next three or four miles the elabon way and most of the surrounding landscape had been brutally wiped out of existence all that was left was a ruined expanse of rawedged muddy craters some a hundred feet across and twenty deep they overlapped one another in the mangled earth as if the same giant who had pulverized the keep had then amused himself by pelting the ground with thousands of huge boulders but there were no boulders no visible explanation of how the devastation had been committed chariots were not built to cross such terrain twice gerin and his band had to stop to mend wheels battered by halfburied fragments of roadbed and treetrunk and once more to fix the axle of nordrics car when it broke van repaired it with bronze nails leather lashings and a large measure of hope he said it may hold and then again it may not all we need now is for a horse to break a leg in this mess gerins fingers moved in a protective sign may the ears of the gods be closed to you they barely managed to escape the ruined land before the sun set all four moons were low in the east slowmoving nothos being most nearly full and tiwaz still closest to first quarter that night the ghosts were louder and more insistent than gerin had over known them again one in particular tried to deliver some message to him again he did not understand although he failed something in him responded to the ghost as if it was the shade of someone he had once known well irked by the riddle he could not solve he pored over rihwins grimoires until sleep overtook him he and his men came on another band of desolation not far into the lands of palin the eagle this was worse than the one before the ravaged area held several streams and ponds their water made the trek a nightmare of slimy clinging mud in some places chariots sank axledeep in the muck the warriors had to get out and slog through it on foot to lighten the load enough to let the horses move the cars at all men and beasts alike were filthy and exhausted when at last they reached flat solid ground to his disgust gerin found several fat leeches clinging to his legs though some daylight was still left the fox decided to camp when he came to an unfouled creek in which to wash most of his men spent by the days exertions collapsed into slumber almost at once only rihwin kept any semblance of good cheer that surprised gerin he had expected the southern dandy to be dismayed at his present unkempt state oh i am my fellow fox i am he said with a grin when gerin asked but what pray can i do about my plight save laugh moreover i truly begin to think balamung has wreaked all this havoc for no other purpose than sealing aid away from your lands did you not tell me a mage was warding your keep aye or so i hope at any rate siglorel shelofas son hes southerntrained true but i dont know how long he can stand against one such as balamung for one thing he drinks too much by your reckoning so do i yet did it keep you from bringing me along on this mad jaunt also never forget that while crisis makes cravens of some in others it burns away the dross and leaves only their best from your mouth to dyaus ear gerin said touched again by rihwins efforts to reassure him what the southerner was saying held just enough sense to keep him thoughtful too maybe balamung did have some unknown reason to fear him and maybe he told himself ill do as van says and flap my arms and fly to fomor neither was likely despite the gift of fowls blood the ghosts were a torrent of halfseen motion a clamorous murmur of incomprehensible voices the spirit which had visited gerin on the two previous nights returned once more he could see its illdefined features writhing in frustration as it failed again to impart its tidings you know captain van said i may be daft but i think the poor wraith even looks a bit like you gerin shrugged for one thing though the ghosts were extraordinarily immanent of late they remained cloudy and indistinct for another the fox like most folk in the empire and the lands it knew had only a vague idea of his features mirrors of polished bronze or silver were uncommon and expensive even the best gave images of poor quality he probably had not seen his own reflection more than a dozen times since taking over his fathers barony the holding of raff the ready palins vassal who had guested gerin and van on their way south was only a burntout shell the little pond beside it was rubblechoked and fouled with the bodies of men and beasts gerin viewed the ruins with sadness but little surprise too many years of peace had led raff to neglect his walls he could not have put up much of a fight not in his dilapidated keep late that afternoon the fox passed from palins land and entered his own once more the roadside guardhouses on either side of the border were deserted but had not been burnt the borderstone itself had been uprooted by the trokmoi gerin cursed when he saw its mosscovered runes effaced by fylfots chipped into the rock as if balamung was claiming the land for his own so perhaps he was gerin and his band had not gone far before they tripped some sorcerous alarm the wizard had planted a misty image of the blackrobed sorcerer appeared in the road before them back are you fox in spite of it all well youll have no joy of it my lads will see to that and soon with a scornful laugh the projection vanished the spell your enemy placed here was plainly set to react to you and no one else rihwin said in which case gerin finished for him theres sure to be another charm in action now not far away telling a few hundred woodsrunners to come down and make an end of me well what can i do but go on balamung has thrown away the advantage of surprise in his vainglory for whatever thats worth arms at the ready they moved ahead as the sun sank low in the west as they passed a tiny crossroads a whoop from behind some brush told them they had been seen archers nocked arrows spearmen tightened grips on their weapons they did not have long to wait chariots and infantry together a veritable army thundered down the cross road toward them at its head was wolfar of the axe his hairy features split in a bloodthirsty grin when he recognized the fox what luck its the wenchstealing sodomite himself he roared to his men then to gerin ill make a capon of you to keep you from having such thoughts again had wolfars rancor against the fox driven him into the arms of the trokmoi gerin would not have thought that even of his western neighbor yet here he was there was scant time for such thought gerin shot at wolfar but missed his arrow tumbled one of the men behind wolfar out of his chariot rihwin and the other bowmen let fly too dropping a couple of other men and sending a chariot down in crashing ruin as one of its horses was hit but to stand and fight was madness for wolfar had easily ten times gerins force north the fox shouted to his followers well outrun the footsoldiers at least and meet him on more even terms north they fled in the gathering dusk wolfar howled hatred close behind arrows flew up almost all went widethe jouncing chariots made poor shooting platforms captain van shouted in gerins ear what in the five hells is that up ahead only his will kept the baron from hysterical laughter whatever else wolfar was he was shown to be no traitor what does it look like its the wizards bullyboys come to finish us off were on the horns of a dilemma sure enough but maybe just maybe theyll gore each other instead of us the leader of the trokmoi was an immensely tall immensely fat blond barbarian who filled most of a threeman chariot by himself he stared in dismayed amazement at the force of chariotry bearing down on him instead of the small band hed expected this looked like the leading detachment of an army as large as his own he frantically reined in shouting deploy you spalpeens dont be letting em get by you now the trokmoi shook themselves out into a wide line of battle some afoot others still in their cars but gerin did not intend to take evasive action he and his men stormed toward the center of the trokme line hoping to slash through and then let the northerners and wolfars men slaughter each other to their hearts content but the trokmoi were too many and too quick to be broken through so easily they swarmed round the foxs chariots slowing the momentum of his charge and stalling him in their midst their huge leader left his car to swing a great bludgeon with deadly effect he crushed the skull of rihwins chariotmate then lashed out at priscos gerins driver took the blow on his shield it all but knocked him from the chariot the baron chopped at the trokme with an axe the barbarian quicker than his girth would have suggested ducked the stroke a horse shrieked as a woodsrunner drove a dagger into its belly for a moment rihwin was close by gerin weve got to get out of here he cried if you have any notion how id love to hear it gerin said a barbarian tried to climb into his chariot van hit the man in the face with a chakrambraceleted forearm he screamed through a torn bloodfilled mouth and fell away then suddenly the pressure of the woodsrunners on gerins beleaguered band slackened as wolfar hurled himself into the sea of trokmoi after the man he hated hes mine you arselickers hes mine he roared the barbarians turned to meet this new and much more dangerous threat gerin tried to extricate his men from the now threecornered battle it was not easy the trokmoi had not forgotten them and to wolfars men the woodsrunners were only obstacles blocking the way to their real target unnoticed by anyone in the melee the sun sank below the horizon as it set the four moons rose within seconds of one another all of them full the last time that had happened had been close to three centuries before elabons capital was founded huge tides swamped lowlying coastal areas drowning small towns and wrecking great ports prophets the world around cried doom and in those lands where the taint of wereblood ran through a folk no moons at quarter or crescent counteracted the pressure to change shape exerted by the light of a full moons disk those with only the thinnest most forgotten trace of wereness were now liable indeed compelled to take beast form hills off to the east briefly shielded the battlefield from the rays of the rising moons then they topped the low obstacle and washed the fighters in their clear pale light gerin was trading axecuts with a scrawny greeneyed trokme who fought without armor when his foe dropped his weapon bewilderment and alarm on his face the fox had no idea what was happening to him but was not one to let any advantage slip his stroke was true but the northerner ducked under it with sudden sinuous ease the trokmes body writhed twisted and then the baron was facing no trokme but rather a great wildcat it spat fury and leaped at him he had no time to wonder if he had lost his mind razorsharp claws tore at the bronze facing of his shield snarling jaws full of jagged teeth snapped at his arm he brought his axe crashing down between the mad eyes of the cat felt its skull splinter under his blow hot blood spattered his arm the carcass lay still a moment twitching gerin stared in disbelief the awful wound he had inflicted healed before his eyes bones knit skin and fur grew together as he gaped the wildcats eyes opened and caught sight of him it yowled gathered itself for a second springand was bowled over and spun to the ground by an outsized wolf they rolled away locked in a snarling clawing embrace the battlefield was a world gone mad at first the fox thought some spell of balamungs intended for his destruction had gone awry he soon realized the chaos was far too general for anything of that sort then quite by accident he saw the four full moons understanding came but brought no relief only terror nearly half the fighting men had gone were in one beastshape or another the field was littered with corselets greaves and helms they escaped when the change came over them the werecreatures fought former friends foes and fellow beasts with an appalling lack of discrimination a bellow of red rage from beside gerin made him whip his head around fearful lest van too was falling under the influence of the moons not so the outlander in dispatching one of wolfars men who had remained both human and combative had taken a cut on his forearm more and more those who kept their human form left off fighting one another and banded together against the ravening werebeasts at the barons side were three trokme foot soldiers but neither they nor he had any leisure in which to quarrel the werebeasts were so lithe and fast they found it easy to slip through the quickest human guard and fasten claws or fangs on flesh even when they were killed men gained only momentary respite from their onslaught within seconds of taking the most ghastly wounds they grew whole once more men caught away from their fellows were for the most part quickly killed one pair of exceptions was nordric oneeye and his driver amgath their chariot had foundered in the middle of the field when vans repairs failed at last and the cars axle broke beneath it the werebeasts made short dreadful work of their horses but nordric was in full berserker rage and fast and savage as any shapechanger with one mighty stroke of his sword he cut a leaping werewolf in two then seized its tail and hurled the spouting hindquarters far away live through that you backscuttling demons get he shouted still had the werebeasts not battled each other with the same ferocity they gave those who had not changed they would have made short work of them all as it was boar stomped and tusked wolf a pair of wildcats sprang at a stag the stag tossed one away with a wicked swipe of its antlers but went to its knees as the other reached its back then the werewolf was beset in turn by a gigantic badger the shapechangers gerin noted seemed to keep the same body weight they had possessed as men a couple of hawks far too heavy to fly stumped about the battlefield their cruel beaks gaped as they screamed challenge to all and sundry nor were they long without foes a wolf attacked one a fox the other between beaks talons and battering wings both soon had cause to regret it the majority of the werebeasts were wolves foxes or wildcats but deer boar bear badger and wolverine were all commonly represented along with these mundane creatures though were several oddities one of wolfars men must have had some urfa blood in his past for a miniature but combative werecamel moaning snorting and spitting struck shrewd blows with its forefeet at the carnivores assailing it off to one side lay a tremendous salmon a corselet still round the middle of its body it flopped and gasped in the air it could not breathe it could not die either because of the vitality of its wereblood in the convulsions of the field two transformed creatures stood out one was the wolf which had been wolfar his passion against gerin was so fierce that he kept it in beast shape he fought to force his way through the press and close his jaws on the foxs throat his howls of fury held almost understandable curses buried within them yet even the werewolfar gave way before a great tawny longtooth which from its bulk must have been the animal shape of the swagbellied trokme commander it flailed its way through the imbroglio with hammerlike blows of its paws blows that sent even werebeasts reeling back stunned the monster cat came up to the stalled chariot in which nordric and his driver still held out amgath snapped his long lash at it hoping to keep it at a distance it squalled in pain and anger but instead of being repulsed ran at him he dropped the whip and grabbed a short thrustingspear too late a single cuff crushed his face and broke his neck the longtooths rush overturned the chariot and tumbled nordric among the ravening werebeasts gerin was sure he was doomed in an instant though he was on his feet a sword in either hand his curses pierced the cacophony of beastnoises around him he seemed to face every way at once flashing blades keeping death at bay he drove off one werebeast after another trokmoi and elabonians shouted together their cheers turned to groans as he went down a wildcat clinging to his back van leaped from the chariot and ran to his rescue the wolf that had been wolfar bounded toward him slavering jaws agape yellow eyes blazing hatred the outlander was ready when it sprang a blow of his spiked mace shattered its skull the wereflesh healed with unnatural speed but van was past by the time the wolf regained its feet he kicked the cat away from nordric it lashed out at the first thing it hit another even bigger wildcat while they tried to gut each other with raking claws van hauled nordric erect side by side they fought their way back to the chariots nordric was battered and bleeding but still full of fight gerin and van had to hold him back from throwing himself once more against the werelongtooth that had killed amgath theres no vengeance to gain against a beast you cannot kill gerin said hell be in human shape again you knowmaybe youll meet him then nordric let himself be persuaded a true measure of the punishment he had taken wolfars chief lieutenant schild stoutstaff had not gone were now he began to rally to himself such of his overlords men as were left the trokmoi too gravitated toward a pair of their nobles gerin thought it a good time to vanish discreetly from the field followed by all his surviving menrihwin and nordric in the formers chariot and three more warriors in another carhe edged toward the cover of the woods their departure went unmarked by stillstruggling men but one werebeast saw the wolf that was wolfar bayed angrily and started to lope after them before he could clear the battlefield the longtooth knocked him down from behind it tried to bury its fangs in werewolfars neck the werewolf tried to twist free but his foes great weight held him down wolfar writhed wriggled and clamped his teeth on one of the longtooths forelegs bones crunched the longtooth screamed it tore at the wolfs belly with its hind feet wolfar let go but only to snap at the longtooths throat any greater purpose was forgotten in the fighting madness now gripping him outmatched physically he was nearly the longtooths match because of the fury that drove him gerin thanked the gods he and the poor handful of followers left him had made good their escape giving quiet directions to priscos he guided them north through a web of tiny trails no one who had not lived in the barony could have followed them in the dark at last he judged it safe to stop the din of battle had long since died behind him but the night was far from still more than the usual number of animals ranged the woods many were men caught in the open by the werenight and now running wild bloodlust in their souls that led to another thought what hell was the werenight playing in keeps under siegeespecially in castle fox always assuming it had not fallen dont worry about it captain van said when gerin spoke aloud whatevers going on inside its just as bad out and that you can bet on balamung or no the trokmoill be in no shape to take advantage of things tonight maybe a weresnake will swallow the cur and solve our problem for us such happy endings happen more often in romances than in fact i fear gerin said but the outlander had heartened him something else occurred to rihwin great dyaus above i wonder whats happening south of the mountains the fox shied away from that idea with even a small part of its populace turned were the capital s narrow winding streets and dark alleys would be a worse jungle than any forest through which hed pass he thought of turgis and hoped the innkeeper was safe not so the sorcerers collegium he started to send a curse down on its head then stopped suddenly ashamed of himself now i understand why the southern wizards offered me no help he exclaimed they must have known this was coming and been making ready to meet it sosper as much as told me so no wonder they needed to keep every man they had in the southlands despite exhaustion gerin found sleep hard to come by so did his men they were all in pain from wounds taken fighting the trokmoi wolfars warriors or the werebeasts also the light of the four full moons seemed to allow the ghosts fuller access to this plane than at more normal times they floated round the campfire sometimes darting up to one or another of the men to try to give such advice as each thought important thanks to the moons they were sometimes able to make themselves understood but that understanding did not always make their listeners see why the wraiths deemed their news important what possible difference does it make to me that the price of barley in the capital dropped two coppers a bushel three days ago rihwin demanded the spirit that told him did not explain the ghost that had been straining for days to get through to gerin drifted toward him again captain i take oath it looks like you van said face a little wider maybe but leave out that and what looks like a broken nose and it could be your twin father dyaus above gerin whispered dagref is it you he moved to embrace his slain brothers shade but it was like trying to hold a breeze the ghost withdrew a few paces slowly and sadly shaking its head gerin recalled that gesture well his older brother had always used it when the fox did something foolish the memory brought sudden tears to the barons eyes though he and dagref had not always been close dagref was half a dozen years older while gerin as he approached manhood found the soldiers life dagref took to so naturally did not suit him at all or so i thought then gerin said to himself here i am living it the lips of dagrefs ghost were moving but the fox still could not make out any words he heard his brothers voice in his mind but so windblown and blurred by echoes that he could not grasp dagrefs meaning once more he begged the wraith grimaced in exasperation but started over this time its meaning or a sentence of it was clear you still dont keep the stables as clean as our father would have liked dagrefs ghost said it shook its head again in the gesture so familiar to gerin then satisfied it had finally got across what was necessary disappeared into the darkness leaving gerin more bewildered than before what did it say van asked gerin told him van tugged at his beard gave the fox a quizzical look its hounded you for days to let you know youre a scurvy excuse for a housekeeper tell me captain was your brother crackbrained of course not the news dagrefs ghost had given was plainly important to it gerin cursed himself for failing to see why he turned the ghosts enigmatic words over and over in his mind but came no closer to understanding them half a nights sleep brought no new insight he was glad though when he woke to see the sun shining through the trees to the east and all the moons gone from the sky you look like death warmed over van said theres dried blood all over your face the baron scrubbed with his fingers saying i must have done enough tossing and turning to open up a cut or two he pounded left fist into right palm damn everything what was dagref trying to tell me he got no good answer to that either from his own wits or from his comrades when he put the riddle to them perhaps he wants you to have a good storage place for my cheap barley rihwin suggested gerin glared at him but it made as much sense as anything else not long after they left camp they came upon the mangled and partially eaten carcass of a brown bear beside it slept a naked trokme awakened by their approach he leaped up and fled into the woods red hair streaming behind him rihwin stared in disbelief no man could and no man did van said grimly look at the tracks bear and wildcat it shouldnt have been too hard in were shape the woodsrunner would have taken no hurt then he had his feast curled up afterwardsand changed back when the moons set the forest path was punctuated by random death another bear horribly torn a trokme with his throat ripped out a pair of elaboninan warriors so mutilated as to appall even gerins hardbitten crew a crofters cottage its flimsy door torn from leather hinges a blackened puddle of blood luring flies at the threshold gerin did not need to look to be sure no one was alive inside he hoped the deaths there had been quick live trokmoi still lurked in the woods an arrow from hiding grazed the side of gerins helm he and rihwin shot blindly into the undergrowth the sniper unhurt let fly again hitting priscos left arm just below the shoulder the driver cursed and tore out the arrow then ripped at his tunic for cloth to bandage the wound the rest of the elabonians jumped from their chariots they ran for cover then stalked the barbarian sharpshooter the trokme no fool held his wellconcealed position until he had what he thought was a good shot at van but in his cramped quarters he could not draw bow to his ear only to his chest the outlanders stout cuirass turned his shaft van shouted in rage and rushed at the thicket from which the arrow had come the trokme fled a blow of vans mace felled him from behind before he had taken ten strides like a charging longtooth the outlander was deadly quick in a short rush he surveyed the snipers corpse without a hint of remorse a pity the craven bushwhacker didnt die slower he said if he wanted to fight he should have come at us like a man gerin had planned and executed enough ambushes in his time to keep a discreet silence when they returned to the chariots priscos was matteroffact did you get him he asked at gerins nod he said good and jerked the reins to get the horses moving north again they returned to the elabon way no more than a couple of hours journey south of fox keep gerin was sickly aware he was returning without even the ragtag army which had set out from ricolfs holding the werenight had seen to that his main hope now was that it had disrupted balamungs men more than the elabonians then that hope died too a shout rang out from the flanking forest heres more o the buggers a score and more of footsoldiers charged from the woods spears ready to cast swords bared but the fox was still reaching for his bow when he realized the cry had been in his own tongue not the woodsrunners and when the onrushing warriors spotted him or more likely spied van and his distinctive armor they stopped so abruptly that one man stumbled and fell to his knees then they came on again but now in friendship and joy raising a cheer to chill the heart of any trokme in earshot gerin recognized them as drago the bears men their commander was one of dragos chief retainers fedor the hunter the fox did not know fedor well he usually stayed behind at dragos keep as deputy when his overlord went to castle fox but gerin had never been gladder to see anyone than this heavyset scarfaced warrior fedor led his men up to the fox we thought you dead my lord he said accusingly the trokmoi and their cursed wizard claimed you were when they tried to get me to yield the castle of the bear to them dragos holding stands gerin said you beat back an attack the wizard led himself great dyaus fedor how his magic has leveled more keeps than i can count oh he tried to shake the holding down after i said no to him so he did fires and smokes and flying demons and i dont know what all but the castle of the bear is good and solid and it sits on bedrock as for the resthe shrugged with the same stolidity drago would have shownwe were inside and they were outside and thats the way it stayed the wizards lightnings blasted one breach but no woodsrunners came through it alive they paid a lot more than half the butchers bill my lord after a while theyd had enough and went away listening to the bald report gerin decided fedor had not had the imagination to see he had no chance and going on phlegmatically where a more perceptive man would have despaired he had endured something to be said for dullness after all the fox thought but fedor was not yet done you need not look so surprised my lord fox keep still holds too you know the barons heart gave a great bound within him no he said softly i did not know aye it does fedor seemed oblivious to the impact his news had on the fox theyre under siege true but they managed to sneak a messenger to us through the woodsrunners lines some trick of your wizard siglorel i understand sixty men set out from the castle of the bear two days ago but after last night he shrugged again for a while i thought id lost my wits but i was too busy staying alive to worry about it werent we all gerin said thanks to the footsoldiers the final approach to fox keep was slower now but gerin would not have traded them for all the treasures of ikos a final fear gripped him that the keep had fallen after its messenger went out then van pointed north right on the skyline captainthe very tip of your watchtower and i thinkhe squinted aye i think its your banner atop it as his men exulted gerin tried to follow his friends pointing finger he had to say your eyes are better than mine but that van saw what he claimed the baron had no doubt he had surmounted every stumbling block now save the last putting an end to the mightiest mage the world had seen in two thousand years and even as he quickened his pace toward his castle he realized he still had no idea how to do that xii castle fox had taken a fearful beating gerin saw as he and his men sped toward it part of one wall had fallen to be replaced by a lower makeshift bulwark of timbers and earth for some reason the logs of the palisade were painted a sour dark green though the watchtower still stood gaps had been bitten into some of the upper stonework of the keep still on the whole the trokme investment was a shabby job mighty sorcerer or no balamung was only a woodsrunner when trying to besiege a holding his magic could not flatten he knew nothing of engines or stratagems but had to rely on the ferocity of his troopsand ferocity counted for little against a fortress with determined defenders broken bodies littered the ground below the palisade here as at the castle of the bear their bravery and inexperience were making the trokmoi pay more than their share of blood but what ferocity could do it would just out of bowshot from the palisade balamung harangued his men nerving them to yet another charge against outwall and gate despite the repeated maulings the elabonians had given them despite the horrors of the werenight just past they waved their weapons and cheered at his speech for all the world like so many outsized destructive children the foxs men on the palisade caught sight of gerin before the trokmoi did their yells made balamung pause in midword he looked up an evil orange glow lit his eyes his voice sounded inside the foxs head scornful and exasperated at the same time its infernally hard to kill that you are well so long as youre here you can watch your fine castle die for im fresh out of patience with your puppydog of a wizard indeed and i am the lean sorcerer gave quick orders to his men fifty or so loped toward the fox just to make sure you dont joggle my elbow now balamung said the rest advanced on the palisade the baron found their discipline remarkableand alarming hed hoped his sudden advent would draw all the barbarians from the walls and free his men inside to sally against them the first arrow hissed past his head another found the breast of one of rihwins proud dapples the southerners chariot slewed flipped over he and nordric both veterans of such mishaps landed lightly they were on their feet at once to face the oncoming trokmoi more arrows flew past the fox shot a couple in return then he yelled to priscos wed all better get down the horses will just have to take their chances the driver chewed his lip unhappy at the thought of abandoning the beasts but knowing not all spills ended so luckily as rihwins he pulled to a halt his long face doleful sword in hand he followed gerin and van to the ground he ran to the horses evading a snap from the shanda pony he slashed through their traces and slapped both beasts rumps with the flat of his blade they galloped away leather straps trailing priscos gave gerin a wintry grin all right my lord i expect im ready now the baron had no time to answerthe trokmoi were upon them he glimpsed a hurled stone just in time to flick up his shield and knock it aside a wildhaired northerner naked but for a helm and one greave thrust at his legs with a short pike he skipped aside van rammed his own longer spear into the trokmes belly he jerked it free with an expert twist bloody entrails came with it at first progress toward fox keep was not hard though outnumbered almost two to one by the trokmoi balamung sent to hold them off the elabonians had better weapons and armor than their foes but soon the lack of order the baron had looked for before began to cost his relieving force more and more trokmoi gave up the attack on the palisade and ran toward the handtohand fighting they loved so well their wizard leader cursed shrilly and tried to bend them to his will again but had little luck wizard or no leader or no he could not change the habits of the proud wild folk he led a tall noble in brightly burnished scalemail confronted the fox its dumnorix son of orgetorix son of he began he got no farther for an arrowa trokme arrow by its length and fletchingsuddenly sprouted in his throat and sent him spinning to the ground then the baron was facing a woodsrunner who must have learned his swordplay from an elabonian forsaking the usual slashing style of the trokme he thrust wickedly at gerins face belly and face again his wrist was quick as a snake but rihwin sprang to gerins side his slim blade darted at the trokme unable to stand against two such swordsmen the barbarian sprang back among his comrades both sides slowed to a brief panting halt not fifteen feet from the fox a sweaty barbarian leaned on his spear he was picking his teeth with a gory forefinger he caught gerins eye and grinned good fighting and in truth that was all the twisted corpses the gashed limbs the terror and agony meant to him a sport something to enjoy and at which to excel gerin wearily shook his head too many on both sides of the border felt thus someone threw a stone someone else cast a spear the heat of battle again grew to a boil shouting like men struck mad a wedge of trokmoi slammed into the middle of gerins thin line splitting his force in two the larger half led by nordric made for the repaired breach in the palisade that thought gerin was largely because his berserker comrade saw more trokmoi there than anywhere else nordric and his companions fought their way into range of covering arrows from the palisade its defenders cheered their every forward step for his own fragment which included van rihwin and priscos the baron had another goal balamung himself the blackrobed mage hood flung back to show his face stalked menacingly round the palisade under one arm he carried the book of shabethshiri the codex was bound in light finegrained leather perhaps tanned human hide no arrow bit the wizard though the men on the palisade sent many his way some flared into brief blue flame others flew wild others simply vanished arrogant and contemptuous balamung stood dry under a rain of death he opened the book of shabethshiri and began to chant even fighting desperately a furlong away gerin felt the power the wizard gathered saw the air around him shimmer with pentup energies his hair tried to prickle upright under his helm the trokmoi who had been assaulting the wall of the palisade on which the spell would fall sprinted away for their lives balamungs chant rose to a crescendo he shouted in the dread kizzuwatnan tongue paused shouted again sheets of red flame flowed from his fingertips the fire engulfed the wall of the palisade gerin watched in awe and consternation not even ashes he thought could remain when that incandescent flood receded but the palisade withstood the fiery bath unharmed still the same sour green which had bemused the fox before i think your own wizard has won a point rihwin said parrying a spearthrust that was a notion new to gerin it had not occurred to him that the ugly paint might be a sorcerous defense balamung shouted in frustrated wrath his flapping black cloak gave him the aspect of a starveling vulture he loped toward the repaired section of the palisade crying to siglorel southron fool youll pay for not bending the knee to me less than a bowshot from where gerin battled his minions the trokme mage opened his fell grimoire and began another spell redoubling their efforts the baron and his men tried to close with the wizard while his sorcery distracted him but they had all they could do to stay alive pushing forward against the barbarians was impossible the fox could only watch as fire shot once more from balamungs hands it caught and clung to the untreated timbers of the improvised barricadeand to the back of a woodsrunner not quick enough to get away a human torch he shrieked and fell and burned gerins men within fox keep braved arrows to beat at the flames with hides and pour water and sand on them but could not douse the wizardfire then siglorel clad in robes no less black than balamungs appeared at the top of the burning stretch of palisade as rihwin had said when faced with the supreme challenge of his life he turned his back on the alepot and fought balamungs spells to a standstill now he worked with unhurried skill ignoring the missiles flying around him his fingers flashed in intricate passes as his hands fell when his spell was done the flames fell too leaving the bulwark smoldering but intact you dare to show yourself in my despite balamung hissed gerin shuddered at the malice in his voice siglorel gave his foe a tired grave nod then dareand die balamungs arm swept down lightning cracked from a clear sky a flick of siglorels hand sent the bolt smashing harmlessly to the ground the backlash of energies from the wizards dueland simple fear tooheld trokmoi and elabonians frozen where they stood unwilling witnesses to a struggle more dire than any in which they fought balamung was clearly the stronger the lightnings he hurled crashed ever closer to his enemy his whirlwinds spun up great clouds of choking dust that all but hid the palisade his demons flew shrieking through the winds and dove on siglorel like huge batwinged falcons no levinbolt though seared through siglorels heart no wind seized him and flung him to his doom though the warrior who had been at his side had time for but one brief scream of terror as balamungs tornado tore him from castle fox no demon drank his blood face gone dead white from strain hands darting now here now there like those of a man wracked by fever siglorel somehow kept an evertightening circle of safety round himself once or twice he even managed to strike back balamung contemptuously swatted aside his lightnings as if they were beneath his notice the end gerin saw was inevitable balamung cursed in balked outrage as his weaker opponent evaded destruction again and again but each escape was narrower each drained more of siglorels waning strength then the trokme wizard chuckled terribly he briefly checked the book of shabethshiri at his gesture a plane of pulsing violet light sprang into being on either side of siglorel as balamung brought his hands toward each other the planes of force he had created began to close upon his antagonist siglorel tried to check the inexorable contraction but all his knowledge all his cantrips were of no avail against the ancient mighty sorcery balamung commanded ever nearer each other drew the planes of force so that now siglorel held them apart not with his magic but by the power of his strongly muscled arms and shoulders the desperate tableau held for half a minute no more then only a crimson smear lay between the glowing planes gerin expected his own life to be similarly crushed away but balamung a cat toying with a helpless mouse took too much pleasure in the barons dismay to end the game so quickly full of noxious confidence his voice sounded in the barons ear first you can watch your fine keep fall then ill get round to dealing with yourselfif my lads have not done it for me that seemed likely gerin and van fought backtoback much of the time now many of the warriors who had accompanied them were gone attacked at the same time by one trokme with a sword and two more with spears priscos went down while balamung was speaking rihwin and gerin killed the spearmen but priscos lay where he had fallen balamung began another spell a clot of black smoke rose before him it quickly began to take shape and solidity even after his invocation ceased that which he summoned continued to grow the demon was roughly anthropoid but twice the height of any man and broad in proportion forced to bear its huge mass its short thick legs were bowed but they carried it well enough its huge arms hanging almost to the ground ended in grasping taloned hands its skin was black and green and wet like a frogs it was grossly male its chinless lower jaw hung slack showing row on row of sawedged teeth a bifurcated tongue lashed in and out the demon had no nose only red slits to match the banked fires of its eyes above those eyes its forehead sloped straight back its batlike ears swiveled and twitched at every sound obeying balamungs shouted command it waddled toward castle fox the trokmoi scattered before it as he watched it near the keep gerin saw a plume of smoke curl up from within the palisade one of the outbuildings was alight whether from balamungs magic or a mere firearrow he did not know the wizard saw it too he laughed youll no more be putting your betters in the stables to sleep will you now at their mages order the trokmoi raked the palisade with arrows forcing its defenders to keep their heads down a few elabonians shot back two arrows pierced the demon it wailed and gnashed its teeth but did not slow then nordric rushed at it a sword in either hand curses rising even over its cries all the barbarians around him had fled at the demons onset but in his blind fury he knew only the attack the demon stopped as he charged it was confused no doubt to see a human running toward it then confusion gave way to a fullthroated bellow of pain and rage for nordrics first stroke ripped into its thigh purplishred ichor spurted from the wound gerin and the elabonians cheered frantically and were joined by more than a few trokmoi not happy with the unholy ally balamung had given them but the demon faster than its bulk suggested slipped by nordric s next rush an arm longer than he was tall snaked out a huge hand seized him in a chestcrushing embrace no last oath passed his lips as his swords fell from nerveless fingers the demon brought the freshkilled dainty to its mouth the horrible jaws slammed shut the monster flung what was left of the broken body behind it and resumed its advance on the palisade reaching the repaired section of wall it grasped a charred timber near the top enormous muscles bunched under its glabrous hide the timber groaned screamed and came loose with a splintering crash the demon tossed it aside grabbed another and pulled it free then another and another more arrows thudded into its flesh but so thick were its muscles that they guarded its vitals almost as well as a corselet the trokmoi shouted in excitement as they saw the barrier torn apart when the breach was all but complete an elabonian with more courage than sense attacked the demon with a spear a heavy forearm knocked aside his weapon the demon lashed out with a broad flat foot the elabonians body torn nearly in two by that terrible kick flew through the air to land well within the courtyard of fox keep balamung cried out once more in whatever fell tongue he used to control the monster he had summoned it turned away from the keep moved ponderously toward gerin and his embattled comrades the smoke from the burning stables grew thicker as the warriors who had been fighting the flames abandoned that task to meet the trokmoi swarming into the breach more afraid of their hideous partner than the men they were facing the woodsrunners who had opposed the fox gave way as the demon neared out of the corner of his eye gerin saw van closely studying the oncoming monster the tight smile on the outlanders face puzzled him until he realized his friend had at last found a foe to overawe him then shouts from the keep made every head whirl the demon batears unfurled to the fullest extent turned to meet the new challenger bearing down on it duin the bold mounted on a horse and carrying the biggest spear he could find had rammed his way through the trokmoi at the breach he thundered toward the monster shouting to draw its attention from gerin and his companions the part of the foxs mind which regardless of circumstances observed and recorded fine details now noted that duin was not riding bareback he sat on a rectangular cloth pad cinched tight round the horses middle his feet were in leather loops depending from either side of the pad duin rode straight at the demon which gathered itself to meet him his lance powered by the hardcharging horse plunged deep into the monsters belly the improvised stirrups kept him atop his mount and added even more impact to the blow the goresmeared bronze spearpoint jutted from the demons back its roar of agony filled the field though blood bubbled over its lips it plucked duin from his horse and slammed him to the ground he lay unmoving the demons shrieks faded to gurgles it swayed toppled fell clawed fingers opened and closed on nothing then were still but balamung did not let the trokmoi dwell on the defeat of his creature have no fear lads he said im after having more of the beasts which theyll not find easy to stop and look the palisades broken and theres fire in the courtyard one more good push and we ll need push no more he opened the book of shabethshiri began again the dreadful invocation which had called the demon from its plane gerin looked from the congealing smoke of the trokmes magic to the smoke puffing up from the stablesthe stables where balamung had slept three years before the stables which as his brothers ghost had reminded him had not been well cleaned from that time to this sudden wild hope burned through him if a single one of balamungs hairs was buried in the old dry straw of the burning outbuildingand if his own memory still held the spell he had learned from rihwin more out of sheer annoyance from any expectation it would ever be of use what have i to lose he muttered to himself and began a woodsrunner leaped at him when he dropped his sword and shield van stretched the man lifeless in the dirt the outlander had no idea what his friend was doing or indeed whether he still had all his wits but would guard him as long as breath was in his body chanting in the harsh kizzuwatnan tongue left hand moving through passes fast as he dared the fox went to his knees in the first of the three required genuflections as he rose he remembered the words of the sibyl of ikos words he had thought filled only with doom confidence tingled along his veins warm like wine he grinned savagely aye he was bowing to the mage of the north but he did not think balamung would appreciate the compliment that newfound confidence almost made him careless his tongue stumbled in a particularly intricate passage of the spell for a moment his body filled with frightening heat but he recovered and raced on driving to be done before balamung could finish his own magic and realize himself attacked he bowed for the last time shouted the last kizzuwatnan curse and stood if he had blundered he would soon be dead either from the recoil of his spell or the overwhelming power of his foe he had won the race balamung was still incanting his demon materializing before him half a minute passed in anticlimax gerin watched his enemy in baffled despair then the fire in the stables reached the two or three hairs still left from the wizards visit long before balamung paused for an instant brushing a sleeve of his robe across his forehead as if to wipe away sweat then little yellow flames licked at the robe and at his flesh as well smoke poured from his body the halfformed demon vanished balamung screamed a cry of utmost anguish that stirred horror though from the throat of a foe the wizard beat at his flaming chest with arms no less afire he knew the author of his destruction the instant his dreadful eyes seized the foxs a clawlike hand speared at gerin for a final malediction flame dripped down the pointing index finger before the spell was cast the allconsuming fire left of balamung only gray flakes of ash the wind tossed them high in the air and blew them away he had read his stars aright no man would ever know his grave for there was nothing of him to bury and with him burned the book of shabethshiri that evil tome which had survived so long seemed at the end more tenacious of life than the wizard who briefly owned it only slowly did the flames grip its pages gerin would have taken oath that he saw those pages flutter and rustle in an almost sentient effort to put out the fire and escape their fate but the spells shabethshiri had amassed in ancient days now turned to smoke one by one and as each was destroyed the power of the book grew less at last the fire engulfed it altogether and it was gone a strange pause followed neither side could quite believe balamung had truly perished gerins men in fox keep recovered first shouting the fox the fox they battered their way through the dismayed trokmoi at the breach and rushed toward the baron and his few remaining comrades the woodsrunners scattered before them drago the bear took gerin in an embrace that hurt even through armor right behind him were rollan simrin widins son and most of the borderer crew they were thinner and dirtier than the fox remembered but still men to be reckoned with and happier than he had ever seen them gerin had hoped their onslaught coupled with the death of the wizard at his moment of triumph would send the trokmoi fleeing for the niffet but a northern chieftain stopped the rout before it began he cut down with his own hand a barbarian running past him are we men or snotnosed weans he roared its but southrons were fighting not gods they bleed and they dieand its not many of em are left to be killed the trokmoi sensed the truth in his words so with sinking heart did the fox though magic had failed the barbarians edged bronze might yet suffice we havent enough men to fight in the open here back to the castle before they cut us off he commanded keep the best order you can drago began to protest he looked from the regrouping barbarians to the white scar over gerins eye and thought better of it for the first hundred yards or so the retreat went smoothly then the trokmoi gave a hoarse cheer and charged direct as always van went straight for the northern leader reasoning that his death might kill the spirit hed given his men but not even the outlanders might let him bull his way through the trokmoi their noble commander declined combat like few barbarians gerin knew he was aware he had more value for his band than his swordarm alone the baron and his men were within the shadow of the palisade when rihwin swore and fell an arrow through his calf an axewielding trokme leaped in for the kill though prone rihwin turned the first stroke with his shield before the woodsrunner could make a second drago speared him in the side gerins burly vassal slung rihwin over his shoulder like a sack of turnips he ran for the breach with the rest of the elabonians thus through the gap torn in the palisade gerin reentered fox keep the outbuildings afire before him the trokmoi hard on his heels cursing the noble who had rallied the northerners he shouted for pikemen to hold the gap the barbarians outside the keep listened to the passionate oratory of their selfappointed leader with much argument and wasted motion they formed a ragged line of battle at em the noble cried now he led the charge himself arrows and javelins took their toll of the onrushing barbarians but they did not waver they slammed into the thin line the fox had built against them spear and shield sword and corselet kept them out van was everywhere at once smiting like a man possessed bellowing out a battlesong in the twittering tongue of the plains he hurled his spear at the leader of the woodsrunners and cursed foully when he missed he took out his rage on the trokmoi nearest him blood dribbled down the leatherwound handle of his mace and glued it to his hand as always gerin fought a more wily fight but he was in the front line his lefthanded style giving more than one woodsrunner a fatal halfsecond of confusion when at last the trokmoi sullenly pulled out of weaponrange though gerin realized how heavy his losses had been simrin widins son was on his knees clutching at an arrow driven through his cuirass into his belly fandor the fat lay dead behind him along with far too many others almost everyone who could still wield a weapon was at the breach and almost everyone bore at least one wound shouts of alarm came from the watchtower and two sides of the palisade ladders ladders the few defenders still on the wall raced to the threatened spots one ladder another went over with a crash but already redmustached barbarians were on the walkway they fought to hold off the elabonians until their comrades could scale the wall for the final surely victorious assault on fox keep gerin knew such weariness as he had never felt before he had endured the terrors of the werenight slain a wizard more deadly than the world had known for a score of centuries for what an extra hour of life merely for the lack of a few men his holding would fall despite all he had done a doublebladed throwing axe hurled from the walkway flashed past him it buried itself in the bloodsoaked ground but instead of pressing home their attack the trokmoi cried out in despair and fear the foxs troopers shouted in sudden desperate urgency the barbarians on the wall fled back to their scalingladders and scrambled down them trying to reach ground outside the keep before its defenders sent their escape routes toppling bewildered the baron looked south and saw the most unlikely rescue force conceivable thundering toward fox keep wolfar of the axe in mans shape once more still had with him a good third of the twohundredman army he had led before the werenight gerin more than half expected wolfars men to ignore the trokmoi and attack him but they stormed down on the barbarians the bloodthirsty baron at their head the trokme noble tried to rally his men yet again wolfar rode him down at his fall the woodsrunners broke and ran flying in all directions they had already taken one assault from the rear and had kept their courage after balamung died just as his triumph seemed assured now courage failed them they threw away weapons to flee the faster most ran for the niffet and most never reached it for wolfars warriors fought with savagery to match their overlords gerin did not let his men join the pursuit he kept them drawn up in battle array at the breach unable to believe his longtime enemy would not try to deal with him next their numbers were near even though wolfars men were fresher but when wolfar returned from the killingground he and his vassal schild stepped over the contorted bodies of the trokmoi who had died before the palisade to approach fox keep unarmed i ought to cut your liver out fox wolfar said by way of greeting but i find i have reason to let you live the notion galled wolfar so badly he could go no further schild spoke for his chief over whom he toweredhe was as tall and lean as wolfar was short and stocky and was one of the few men serving under wolfar whom gerin respected he said as you can guess once we pulled ourselves together after whatever madness struck last nightgerin started to explain the werenight but decided it could waitwe came north after you but a little south of here we caught a woodsrunner fleeing your keep he told us youd killed their wizard the one you warned me of not long ago is it true aye its true dearly bought but true then youve earned your worthless life wolfar said looking toward the corpse of the demon duin had killed it was already starting to stink youve done a great thing damn you and i suppose i have to let it cancel whats between us from the past he started to offer gerin his hand but could not bring himself to do it the fox knew there was still no liking or trust between them that was not so of their mensoldiers from both sides broke ranks to fraternize in their shared victory over balamung and the trokmoi they forgot the enmity that had existed between them though he did not want to do it gerin felt he had no choice but to invite wolfar and his troops to help man castle fox and make it defensible once more to the barons secret disappointment wolfar accepted at once a holding with too few soldiers in it is almost worse than none at all he said i worry about my own keep the men i left behind rattle around in it like dried beans in a gourddo they not schild hmm schild gave him an unclassifiable look aye my lord the garrison there is very small indeed as wolfars men filed into the holding gerin assigned them duties some to the palisade others to help some of his own men plug the breach still others to help the wounded or fight the fires still flickering in the outbuildings wolfar did not object to his dispositions he seemed content to let the fox keep overall command inside fox keep gerin was glad to find that rihwins injury was not serious you re not hamstrung and the arrow went clear through your leg otherwise wed have to cut it out which is nothing to be taken lightly the baron told him as is though you should heal before long if i put spikes on my wrists and ankles do you think ill be able to climb trees like a cat rihwin asked adjusting his bandage i see no reason why not odd rihwin murmured i never could before go howl gerin threw his hands in the air and went off to see to other injured men if the southerner could joke at his wound he would soon mend had they taken place at any other time gerin would have reckoned the next days among the most hectic of his life as if was they scarcely stood comparison to what had gone before true four days after balamungs fall the trokme chieftain who had turned longtooth in the werenight led an attack on fox keep by then though the breach in the palisade was repaired and the holding had fresh supplies drawn from the countryside nor did the woodsrunner have patience for a siege he tried to storm the walls and was bloodily repulsed he himself jumped from a scaling ladder to the palisade walkway wolfar took his head with a single stroke of the heavy axe that gave him his sobriquet then the ladder went crashing over half a dozen trokmoi tried to leap clear as it fell the ladders that stayed upright long enough for the barbarians to come to grips with the elabonians were few after their leader was slain inside the keep they lost their eagerness for the fight in a way that second attack by the trokmoi was a gift from the gods it further united wolfars men and gerins against a common foe and again reminded them how petty their old disputes were now a good lesson gerin thought he regretted that the province north of the kirs had not learned it sooner wolfar surprisingly seemed to take the lesson to heart he did not much try to hide his animosity toward gerin but he did not let it interfere with the running of the keep he never mentioned elise he was as cordial as his nature allowed toward the barons men and insisted on praising fox keeps ale though by now it was coming from the barrelbottom and full of yeast gerin would sooner have seen him surly he did not know how to react to this new wolfar for schild on the other hand his admiration grew by leaps and bounds when the fox learned from a prisoner of a band of trokmoi planning to raft over the niffet wolfars lieutenant led a joint raiding party to ambush the barbarians as they disembarked the ambush was a great success the trokmoi paddled back across the river after leaving a double handful of men dead on the shore on the raiders return wolfar was so lavish in their praise and so affable that gerins suspicion of him redoubled but beyond this uncharacteristic warmth the thickshouldered baron as yet showed no hint of what was in his mind hes given me every reason to trust him gerin told van one night and i trust him less than ever probably just as well for you van said gerin was not sorry to find his worries shared word of balamungs death spread quickly it raised the elabonians spirits but disheartened their foes who had leaned on the wizards supposed invincibility two days after the defeat schild had engineered for the band of southbound barbarians a large troop of trokmoi came north past castle fox except for keeping out of bowshot they ignored the keep intent on returning with their booty to the cool green forests north of the niffet another large band came by a day later and another two days after that as if the appearance of the third group of retreating trokmoi had been some sort of signal wolfar stumped up to the fox in the great hall and said abruptly time we talked whatever wolfar had been hiding it was about to come into the open of that gerin felt sure stifling his apprehension he said as you wish the library is quiet he led his western neighbor up the stairs wolfar seemed less disconcerted by his strange surroundings than gerin had hoped what a bastardly lot of books you have fox he said where did you pick them all up here and there some i brought back from the southlands some i ve got since a few came from my father and a couple i just stole mmm wolfar said then he fell silent leaning back in his chair at last gerin said you said you wanted to talk wolfar whats on your mind you dont know fox wolfar sounded honestly surprised if its elise she wont marry you you know shed sooner bed a real wolf as if what she wanted had anything to do with it still shes only awhat word do i needa detail maybe go on now gerin was genuinely alarmed this coldblooded calculator was not the wolfar he had expected save in his utter disregard for anyone else the fox wanted to keep him talking until he had some idea of what he was dealing with id thought better of you gerin we dont get along but i know youre no fool you have no excuse for being stone blind go on gerin said again wishing wolfar would come to a point all right on this stretch of the border we have the only two major holdings that didnt fall now tell me what aid did we get from the marchwarden of the north or our lord emperor hildor wolfar tried to put mockery in his voice but managed only a growl less than nothing as well i know how right you are fox you can see as well as ibetter i suppose if youve really read all these booksthe empire hasnt done a damned thing for us the past hundred years enough by all the gods with the confusion on the borderand deep inside too from some of the things youve saidthe two of us could be princes so well established that by the time elabon moved its fat arse against us wed be impossible to throw out you and i no wonder wolfar had changed gerin thought whistling softly anyone carrying that big an idea on his shoulders would change and might buckle under the strain of it something else bothered the fox too but he could not place it what would you have us be princes of he asked our side of the border is so weak the trokmoi can come down as they wish with or without their wizard for now we cant hope to hold them think though we can channel their force into whatever shape pleases us save for them were the only powers on the border now and we can use them against whoever stands against us that idea gerin liked not at all he wanted to drive every woodsrunner back across the niffet not import more as mercenaries he said after a while theyd decided theyd sooner not be used and act for their own benefit not ours with their sorcerer gone they could never hurt us so long as we kept up enough properly manned and alert keeps wolfar argued his elaborate calm worried gerin more than any bluster or nervousness but at last he had it the thing wolfar was trying to hide the blank look schild had given his overlord a few odd remarks from wolfars men everything fell together wolfar he asked what were you doing on my land away from your properly manned and alert keep when you ran into me just before the werenight what do you mean wolfars deepset eyes were intent on gerin just this youve tried to bury me in a haystack without my noticing it almost worked i grant youyoure more subtle than i thought youll have to make yourself plainer fox i cant follow your riddles very well ill be perfectly clear you sir are a liar of the first water and staking everything on your lie not being found out your keep must have been sacked and almost at once or youd still be in it not trotting over the landscape like a frog with itchy breeches in fact youre as homeless as a cur without a master wolfar took a long slow breath reasoned like a schoolmaster fox but your logic fails you at the end oh how so heavy muscles rippled under wolfars tunic i do have a home keep you see this one he hurled himself at gerin the fox sprang from his seat and threw a footstool at wolfars head wolfar knocked it aside with a massive forearm like a crushing snake he reached out for the fox in the first moment of fighting neither man thought to draw sword their hatred suppressed these past few days blazed up out of control too hot for anything but flesh against flesh gerin mad as wolfar then wolfar kicked the fox in the knee he staggered back hearing someone shriek and realizing it was himself the bright pain cut through his bloodlust when wolfar roared forward to finish him he almost spitted himself on gerins blade his own was out the next instant sparks flew as bronze struck bronze wolfar used his sword as if it were an axe hacking and chopping but he was so quick and strong gerin had no time for a telling riposte his movement hampered by his knee he stayed on the defensive awaiting opportunity it came finally a clever thrust a twist of the wrist and wolfars blade and one finger went flying across the room but before the fox could pierce him wolfar kicked the sword from his hand and seized him in a pythonic embrace gerin felt his ribs creak he slammed the heel of his hand against wolfars nose snapping his head back in the capital they claimed that was often a fatal blow but wolfar merely grunted under it still his grip loosened for an instant and gerin jerked free he wondered briefly what was keeping everyone from bursting into the library and pulling the two of them apart they were making enough noise to scare the trokmoi in the woods let alone the men in the castle but no one came wolfar leaped for a sword gerin tackled him before he could reach it they crashed to the floor in a rolling cursing heap then like a trap two hornedged hands were at the foxs throat almost of their own accord his reached through wolfars thick beard to find a similar grip he felt wolfar tense under it gerin tightened his neck muscles as he had learned in the wrestling schools of the capital tried to force breath after precious breath into his lungs the world eddied toward blackness in one of his last clear moments he wondered again why no one was breaking up the fight then there was only the struggle to get the tiniest whisper of air and keep his grip tight after that all he knew was the uprushing welcoming dark the first thing he realized when his senses returned was that he was no longer locked in that death embrace his throat was on fire van and schild stoutstaff bent over him concern on their faces he tried to speak nothing came from his mouth but a croak and a trickle of blood he signed for pen and parchment after a moments incomprehension van fetched them quill scratching gerin wrote what happened as reading was not one of his many skills van held the scrap of parchment in some embarrassment seeing his plight schild took it from him what happened he read my lord gerin you are the only man who knows that gerin looked a question at van aye wolfars dead the outlander took up the tale when he and you went up to have your talk the rest of us sat around the great hall wondering what would come of it then the racket started we all looked at each other hoping it was something simple say a demon from one of the hells or balamung back from the fire but no sure as sure it was you two going at each other we could have had a fight down there to match the one up here if anybody had tried going up the stairs thats just what would have happened so though nobody said much we figured whoever came out would rule here and anyone who didnt like it or couldnt stand it would be free to go no hard feelings and we waited and nobody came out finally we couldnt stand it any longer schild and i came up together when we saw you we thought you were both dead but you breathed when we pried wolfars hands off your neck and hell never breathe againyoure stronger than i gave you credit for captain gerin sat up rubbing his bruised throat looking at schild he managed a thin whisper you knew wolfar was tricking me with his talk of a keep he could go home to and you helped him do it van barked a startled oath but schild only nodded of course i did he was my overlord he always treated me fairly harsh though he was he was not altogether wrong eitherits long past time for us to break away from the empires worthless rule and i cannot blame him for wanting the power he saw here for the taking schild looked gerin in the eye i would not have called you my lord though did i not think you would do a better job with it slowly and deliberately he went to one knee before the fox van followed though his grin showed how little he thought of such ceremonies dazed more ways than one gerin accepted their homage he halfwished he could flee instead all hed ever wanted he told himself was to read and think and not be bothered but when the responsibility for castle fox fell on him he had not shirked it no more could he evade this greater one now he looked at his books wondering when he would find time to open them again so much to be done the trokmoi ousted keeps restored and manned elise wed a solitary bright thought among the burdens duin s stirrups investigated which reminded him how few horses he had left peasants brought back to the land dyaus above where was there an unravaged crop within five days journey he climbed to his feet and walked toward the stairs well he said hoarsely lets get to work afterword when in the early s poul anderson reissued the broken sword after it had been out of print for some years he noted that without changing the plot he had cleaned up the writing i didnt fully understand when i read his afterword hed published the broken sword hadnt he how could it need cleaning up now the shoe is on the other foot werenight was written in bits and pieces from to often in time stolen from my dissertation it first appeared in broken into two parts titled by the publisher wereblood and werenight the same publisher also tagged me with the pseudonym eric iverson on the assumption no one would believe harry turtledove which is my real name and now its time for the book to see print again when i looked over the manuscript i discovered as anderson and no doubt many others had before me that im a better craftsman than i used to be without interfering with the story or characters i invented in my younger days i have taken this chance to cut adjectives adverbs and semicolons and generally tighten things up and ive changed a couple of bitplayers names where id used others that struck me as too similar to them in later fiction all in all this is the book i would have written then if id been a better writer i hope you enjoy it harry turtledove october prince of the north i gerin the fox eyed the new logs in the palisade of fox keep even after five years weathering they were easy to pick out for theyd never been painted with the greenish glop the wizard siglorel had concocted to keep balamung the trokme mage from burning the keep around him the stuff worked too but balamung had slain siglorel even so gerin knew something of magecraft himself but hed never been able to match siglorels formulation in front of those new logs a handful of the foxs retainers sat on their haunches in a circle gerins fouryearold son duren ran from one of them to the next exclaiming can i roll the dice will you let me roll them now drago the bear held the carved cubes of bone rumbling laughter he handed them to duren who threw them down in the middle of the gamblers circle haw twelve no one can beat that drago said he scooped up his winnings then glanced toward gerin the boy brings luck lord glad to hear it gerin answered shortly whenever he looked at his son he couldnt help thinking of the boys mother when hed wed elise hed been sure the gods had granted him everlasting bliss hed thought so right up to the day three years ago now when shed run off with a traveling horseleech only the gods knew where in the shattered northlands she was these days or how she fared the fox kicked at the dirt maybe if hed noticed she wasnt happy he could have done things to make her so or maybe shed just tired of him women did that and men too the great god dyaus knows its too late to do anything about it now he muttered too late to do anything about what captain van of the strong arm boomed as he came out of the stables the outlander overtopped gerins six feet by as many inches and was nearly twice as thick through the shoulders too the reddyed horsehair plume that nodded above his helmet only made him seem taller as usual he kept his bronze corselet polished almost to mirror brilliance years too late for us to do anything about getting imperial troopers up here gerin answered he was the sort who guarded private thoughts even from his closest friends van spat on the ground that for imperial troopers it was too late for those buggers five years ago when the carrionstinking empire of elabon shut all the passes into the north sooner than help us keep the trokmoi out dyaus knows we could have used the imperials then gerin said we could use them still if theyd come and if if theyd keep their hands off whats yours van finished for him well yes there is that gerin admitted he was given to understatement van wasnt he snorted back deep in his throat honh there is that he says you think the emperor of elabon would be happy with the title youve gone and taken for yourself you know what hed do if ever he got his hands on somebody who styled himself the prince of the north dont you hed nail you to the cross so the ravens could sit on your shoulders and pick out your eyes thats what since van was undoubtedly right gerin shifted the terms of the argument he did the same thing whenever he and his friend wrestled using guile to beat strength and weight in wrestling as in argument sometimes it worked and sometimes it didnt he said im not the only one in the northlands with a fancy new title since elabon abandoned us id have company on the crucifying grounds aye so you would van said whats aragis the archer calling himself these days grand duke thats it honh hes just a jumpedup baron same as you and theres two or three others of your elabonian blood and as many trokmoi who came south over the niffet with balamung and stayed even after the wizard failed i know gerin didnt like that for a couple of centuries the niffet had been the boundary between the civilization of the empire of elabonor a rough frontier version of it at any rateon one side and woodsrunning barbarians on the other now the boundary was down and elabons abandoned northern province very much on its own van tapped gerin on the chest with a callused forefinger but i tell you this captain you have the loftiest title so hed nail you highest an honor i could do without the fox said besides its quarreling over shadows anyhow elabons not coming back over the mountains what i really need to worry about is the squabbles with my neighborsespecially aragis of the lot of them hes the ablest one aye hes near as good as you are captain though not so sneaky sneaky since gerins devious turn of mind was what had earned him his fox sobriquet he couldnt even deny that he changed the subject again youre still calling me captain after all these years too is that the sort of respect the prince of the north deserves ill call you what i bloody well please van retorted and if one fine day that doesnt suit your high and mightiness well ill up and travel on i sometimes think i should have done it years ago he shook his head bemused that after a lifetime of wandering and adventure he should have begun to put down roots gerin still did not know from what land his friend had sprung van never talked of his beginnings though he had yarns uncounted of places hed seen certainly he was no elabonian gerin made a fair representative of that breed on the swarthy side longnosed and longfaced with brown eyes and black hair and beard now beginning to be frosted with gray van by contrast was blond and fairskinned though tan his bright beard was that improbable color between yellow and orange his nose had been short and straight these days it was short and bent with a scar across the bridge his bright blue eyes commonly had mischief in them women found him fascinating and irresistible the reverse also applied roll the dice duren squealed roll the dice van laughed to hear gerins son say that maybe well roll the dice ourselves later on eh captain see who goes to fand tonight not so loud gerin said looking around to make sure their common mistress wasnt in earshot shell throw things at both of us if she ever finds out we do that sometimes that trokme temper of hers he shook his head van laughed louder a dull wench is a boring wench i expect thats why i keep coming back to her after every new one you mean sometimes i think theres a billy goat under that cuirass and no man at all gerin said van might have settled in one place but his affections flew wild and free as a gull well what about you he said if her temper doesnt suit you why dont you put her on a raft and ship her back over the niffet to her clansfolk dyaus knows ive thought about it often enough gerin admitted after elise left him hed thought about swearing off women forever no matter what his mind said though his body had other ideas now he laughed ruefully if either of us truly fell in love with her wed be hardpressed to stay friends not so captain van answered if one of us fell in love with her the other would say take her and welcome if we both did now you have me gerin admitted he kicked at the dirt annoyed at being outreasoned even in something as small as this but if you couldnt grant someone elses reason superior when it plainly was what point to reasoning at all van said i think ill roll the dice myself for a while care to join no im going to take another pass at my sorcery if you know what i mean gerin said have a care now van said youre liable to end up in more trouble than you know how to get out of hasnt happened yet gerin answered i have the measure of my own ignorance i think hed studied a bit of magic in the city of elabon as a young man back in the days when people could travel back and forth between the northlands and the heart of the empire but had to give up that and history both when the trokmoi killed his father and elder brother and left him baron of fox keep i hope you do van said pulling broken bits of silver from a pouch he wore on his belt he made for the dice game before he could sit down duren sprang at him like a starving longtooth he laughed grabbed the boy and threw him high in the air three or four times duren squealed with glee gerin made for a little shack hed built over in a back corner of the courtyard it was far enough from the palisade that if it caught fire it wouldnt burn down the castle outwall along with itself thus far he hadnt even managed to set the shack ablaze maybe today he muttered he was going to try a conjuration from a new grimoire hed bought from a lordlet to the southwest whose grandfather might have been able to read but who was himself illiterate and proud of it as with most spells in grimoires it sounded wonderful whether results would match promises was another question altogether the codex of the grimoire had silverfish holes on several of its pages and mice had nibbled its leather binding while it lay forgotten on a high shelf in a larder the spell in which gerin was interested though remained unmutilated in a clear hand the mage whod composed it had written a cantrip which yieldeth a flaming sword that yieldeth had made gerin suspicious along with wizardry and history hed studied literature down in the city of elabon and where he wondered will duren be able to learn such things if he should want to the answer was mournfully clear in the northlands nowhere he knew elabonian hadnt used those archaic forms for hundreds of years which meant the author was trying to make his work seem older than it was but a flaming sword false antique or no he reckoned that worth looking into not only would it make ferocious wounds the mere sight of it should cast terror into the hearts of his foes he hefted the bronze blade hed use it was hacked and notched to the point where it would almost have made a better saw than sword bronze was the hardest toughest metal anyone knew but it wasnt hard enough to hold an edge in continued tough use gerin had the crushed wasps and bumblebees and the dried poison oak leaf hed need for the symbolic element of the spell chanting as he worked and wearing leather gauntlets he ground them fine and stirred them into melted butter the grimoire prescribed olive oil as the basis for the paste but hed made that substitution before and got by with it it was necessary the olive wouldnt grow in the northlands and supplies from south of the high kirs had been cut off he was readying himself for the main conjuration when someone poked his head into the hut great dyaus above are you at it again rihwin the fox asked his soft southern accent reminded gerin of his student days in the city of elabon every time he heard it aye i am and lucky for you at a place where i can pause gerin answered if anyone had to interrupt him he preferred it to be rihwin the man who shared his ekename knew more magic than he did rihwin had been expelled from the sorcerers collegium just before his formal union with a familiar because of the outrageous prank hed played on his mentor he walked into the hut glanced at the sword and the preparations gerin had made for it hed stopped shaving since he ended up in the northlands but somehow still preserved a smooth very southern handsomeness maybe the big gold hoop that glittered in his left ear had something to do with that pointing to the woodandleather bucket full of water that stood next to the rude table where gerin worked he said your precautions are thorough as usual gerin grunted youd be working here beside me if you took them too rihwin had been rash enough to summon up mavrix the sithonian god of wine also widely worshiped in elabon after gerin had earned the temperamental deitys wrath in revenge mavrix robbed rihwin of his ability to work magic and left him thankful his punishment was no worse ah well rihwin said with an airy wave of his hand dwelling on ones misfortunes can hardly turn them to triumphs now can it it might keep you from having more of them gerin replied he was as much given to brooding as rihwin fought shy of it hed concluded though that rihwin was almost immune to change and so gave up the skirmish after the first arrow bending over the grimoire once more he said lets find out what we have here the spell was no easy one it required him to use his right hand to paint the sword blade with his mixture while simultaneously making passes with his left and chanting the incantation proper which was written in the same pseudoarchaic elabonian as its title he suspected the mage of deliberately requiring the left hand for the complex passes to make the spell more difficult but grinned as he incanted being lefthanded himself he was delighted to have his clumsy right doing something simple the painting and passes done he snatched up the sword and cried let the wishes of the operator be accomplished for a moment he wondered if anything would happen a lot of alleged grimoires were frauds maybe that was why this one had sat unused on a shelf for a couple of generations but then sure enough yelloworange flames rippled up and down the length of the blade they neither looked nor smelled like burning butter they seemed more the essence of fire brought down to earth thats marvelous rihwin breathed as gerin made cutandthrust motions with the flaming sword it with a sudden foul oath gerin rammed the sword into the bucket of water a hiss and a cloud of steam arose to his great relief the flames went out he cautiously felt the water with a forefinger when he discovered it remained cool he stuck in his hand cursed hilt got too hot to hold he explained to a popeyed rihwin oh that feels good which no doubt is the reason we fail to find blazing blades closely clenched in the fierce fist of every peerless paladin rihwin answered many a spell that seems superb on the leaves of a codex develops disqualifying drawbacks when actually essayed youre right about that gerin answered drying his hand on the thigh of his baggy wool breeches everyone in the northlands wore trousers the trokme style had conquered completely even rihwin who had favored southern robes was in breeches these days gerin inspected his left palm i dont think thats going to blister smear butter or tallow on it if it does rihwin said but not the ah heated mixture you prepared there with the poison oak leaves and all no ill get rid of that gerin poured it out of its clay pot onto the ground after a bit of thought he scooped dirt onto the greasy puddle if the sole of his boot happened to have a hole he didnt want the stuff getting onto his skin he and rihwin left the shack shadows were lengthening before long no one would want to stay outdoors ghosts filled the night with terror a man caught alone in the darkness without sacrificial blood to propitiate them or fire to hold them at bay was likely to be mad come morning gerin glanced to the sky gauging the hour by the moons nothos pale crescent hung a little west of south golden math at first quarter looking like half a coin was about as far to the east and ruddy elleb pinkish white now washed out by the late afternoon sun halfway between quarter and full stood well clear of the eastern horizon the fourth moon quickmoving tiwaz would be a waning crescent when the serfs went out to work just after sunrise tomorrow as if gerins thinking of the serfs he ruled had brought them to new life a mournful horn blew in the village close by fox keep calling men and women in from the fields gerin looked at the moons again raised one eyebrow in a characteristic gesture theyre knocking off early today he remarked i think i may have to speak to the headman tomorrow hell not love you for making him push the other peasants harder rihwin said who does love me for any reason gerin wondered his mother had died giving birth to him maybe because of that his father had always been distant or maybe his father simply hadnt known what to do when he got himself a thinker instead of a brawler his son duren loved him aye but now it was his turn to have trouble returning that love because whenever he saw duren he thought of elise shed loved him for a while until passion cooled and then just disappeared with only a note left behind begging him not to go after her it was in fact very much the way shed fled with him from her fathers keep he didnt feel like going into any of that with rihwin instead he answered i dont care whether besant bigbelly loves me or not that at least was true i do care that we grow enough to get through the winter for if we dont besant will be bigbellied no more he would say did he dare that all the peasants would be biggerbellied did they not have to pay you a fourth of what they raised rihwin observed he could say it to my face and well he knows it gerin returned im not a lord who makes serfs into draft animals that happen to walk on two legs nor do i take the half some barons squeeze from them but if i took nothing who would ward them from the chariotriding wolves whod swoop down on them he waited for rihwin to say something like they could do it for themselves he was ready to pour scorn on that idea like boiling water splashing down from the top of a palisade onto the heads of attackers farmers didnt have the tools they needed to be fighters the horses the chariots the swords the armor nor did they have the time they needed to learn to use those tools the endless rhythms of fields and livestock devoured their days but rihwin said my fellow fox sometimes you dont know when youre being twitted denied his chance to rend rihwin with rhetoric gerin glared he walked around to the front of the castle rihwin tagged along chuckling as they went inside another horn sounded from a more distant village and then another almost at the edge of hearing gerin said you see if one village knocks off early they all do it for they hear the first horn and blow their own figuring they dont want to work any harder than the fellows down the trail who does like to work rihwin said no one with sense gerin admitted but no one with sense will avoid doing what he must to stay alive the trouble is not all men are sensible even by that standard if you think ill argue with that youre the one whos not sensible rihwin said g g g the great hall of the castle occupied most of the ground floor a fire roared in the stone hearth at the far end and another smaller one in front of the altar to dyaus close by above the hearth cooks basted chunks of beef as they turned them on spits fatwrapped thighbones the gods portion smoked on the altar gerin believed in feeding the god well moreover after his brush with mavrix he figured he could use all the divine protection he could get two rows of benches ran from the doorway to the hearth in winter seats closest to the fire were the choice ones now with the weather mild gerin sat about halfway down one row a couple of dogs came trotting through the rushes on the rammedearth floor and lay at his feet looking up expectantly miserable beggars he said and scratched their ears i dont have any food myself yet so how can i throw you bones and scraps the dogs thumped their tails on the ground they knew they got fed sooner or later when people sat at those benches if it had to be later they would wait van and drago the bear and the other gamblers came in chattering about the game duren frisked among them when he saw gerin he ran over to him exclaiming i rolled the dice a lot papa i rolled double six twice and fiveandsix three times and he would have gone down the whole list but van broke in aye and the little rascal rolled oneandtwo for me and sent me out of that round without a tunic to call my own he shook a heavy fist at duren in mock anger duren safe beside his father stuck out his tongue the dice go up the dice go down drago said shrugging shoulders almost as wide as vans from him that passed for philosophy he was a long way from the brightest of gerins vassals but a good many more clever men managed their estates worse since drago never tried anything new he discovered no newfangled ways to go wrong gerin called to one of the cooks we have enough here to begin fetch ale for us why dont you aye lord prince the man answered and hurried down into the cellar he returned a moment later staggering a little under the weight of a heavy jar of ale the jar had a pointed bottom the cook stabbed it into the dirt floor so the jar stood upright he hurried off again coming back with a pitcher and a double handful of tarred leather drinking jacks he set one in front of everybody at the table duren got a small one then dipped the pitcher into the amphora pouring and refilling until every jack was full take some for yourself too gerin said he was not a lord who stinted his servants grinning the cook poured what looked like half a pitcher down his throat gerin slopped a little ale out of his mug onto the floor this for baivers god of barley he intoned as he drank this for baivers the others echoed as they poured their libations even van imitated him though baivers was no god of the outlanders the deity whose scalp sprouted ears of barley instead of hair held sway in this land rihwin made a sour face as he set down the mug i miss the sweet blood of the grape he said point the first the grape doesnt grow in the northlands and we ve lost our trade south of the high kirs gerin said point the second when you drink too much wine dreadful things happen weve seen that again and again point the third wine lies in mavrixs province and have you not had your share and more of commerce with mavrix true all true rihwin said sadly i miss the grape regardless the cooks came round with bowls of beanandparsnip porridge with tiny bits of salt pork floating in it to give it flavor like everyone else gerin lifted his bowl to his lips wiped his mouth on his sleeve when he was done south of the high kirs they had separate squares of cloth for cleaning your face and fingers but such refinements did not exist north of the mountains off the spit came the pieces of beef while one cook carved them into mansized portions another went back to the kitchen and came out with round flat chewy loaves of bread which he set in front of each man at the table theyd soak up the juices from the meat and get eaten in their turn gerin patted the empty place between van and him put one here too anseis fand is sure to be down before long aye lord prince the cook said and did as he was asked duren started tearing pieces from his round of bread and stuffing them into his mouth gerin said if you fill yourself up with that boy where will you find room for your meat ill put it someplace duren patted his stomach to show the intended destination just as the cook who was carving the beef started loading steaming gobbets onto an earthenware tray fand did come down from castle foxs living quarters into the great hall gerin and van glanced over at each other smiled for a moment and then both waved her to that place between them och youre still not after fighting over me she said in mock disappointment as she came up beneath the mock disappointment gerin judged lay real disappointment she might have resigned herself to their peacefully sharing her but she didnt like it hoping to get her off that bloodthirsty turn of thought gerin called for a servant to pour her a jack of ale he handed it to her himself here you are i thank you sure and i do her elabonian held a strong trokme lilt she was a big fair woman not too much shorter than the fox with pale skin dusted with freckles wherever the sun caught it grayblue eyes and wavy coppercolored hair that tumbled past her shoulders to gerin men of that coloring were enemies on sight he still sometimes found it odd to be sharing a bed with a woman from north of the niffet not odd enough to keep me from doing it though he thought aloud he said to fand should i have put you on a boat across the river after all twould have been your own loss if you had she retorted tossing her head so the torchlight glinted in her hair one thing she had was unshakeable selfconfidenceand why not when two men such as they danced to her tune gerin said my guess is still that you stuck a knife into the fellow who brought you south over the niffet ive told you before gerin dear i brought my own self over thinking life might be more lively here och and so it has been not that i reckoned on yoking myself to a southron she paused to half turn and make eyes at van let alone two im no elabonian van boomed indignantly and ill thank you not to call me one one fine day i hitch a team to a chariot or just go off afoot how many years have you been saying that gerin asked as many as ive been here no doubt less maybe one turn of the fastest moon van shook his head forever bemused he could stay in one place so long a tree now has need of growing roots but a man a man fand said still trying to stir up trouble youll quarrel over whether youre a southron or no but not over me what sort of man is that after making you you should remember well enough from last night what sort of man i am van looked like a cat that had fallen into the cream pitcher fand squeaked indignantly and turned back to gerin will you be letting him speak to me so aye most likely i will he said if she got fed up and left them both hed be sorry for a while but he knew hed also be relieved he didnt feel like a screaming fight now though so he said here comes the meat that distracted her it distracted him too he drew his dagger from his belt and started carving strips off the bone in front of him and popping them into his mouth the dagger like the rest of his personal gear was severely plain with a hilt of nothing more splendid than leatherwrapped bone but it had good balance and he kept the edge sharp sometimes he used plainness to conceal effectiveness van by contrast had the hilt to his knife wrapped in gold wire with a big topaz set into the pommel for him flamboyance served the same purpose selfeffacement did for gerin it disguised the true warrior beneath being dangerous without seeming so gerin had found made the danger double thinking thus he glanced over at fand who was slicing with her own slim bronze blade was she disguising something he snorted and took a long pull at his ale no concealment wasnt in her nature but hed thought as much about elise and where had that got him duren said papa will you help me cut more meat he had a knife too but a small one and not very sharp that helped keep him from getting cut but it also kept him from eating very fast gerin leaned over and sliced off several strips for him splash water on your face when youre done he said he remembered how surprised and delighted hed been to discover the elaborate hot and cold baths the city of elabon boasted north of the high kirs as best he knew there was only one tub and it wasnt at his holding not without a pang hed gone back to being mostly dirty most of the time fand made eyes first at van then at him och a woman gets lonely that she does if youre lonely with the two of us to keep you warm at night would you try a bandit troop next van said she cursed him in the trokme language elabonian not being satisfying enough for her van swore back in the same tongue hed traversed the gloomy forests of the trokmoi before he swam the niffet towing his precious armor behind him on a makeshift raft and splashed up inside gerins holding will you be letting him speak to me so fand demanded of the fox once more probably he answered she picked up her drinking jack and threw it at him she had more fury than finesse it splashed down behind him and sprayed ale onto a couple of the hounds quarreling over bones they separated with a yelp fand sprang to her feet and stomped upstairs not often dull around here van observed to no one in particular its not is it gerin said sometimes i think id find a bit of dullness restful he hadnt known much not since he came back over the kirs to take over his fathers holdings and especially not since the trokmoi and their wizard balamung invaded the northlands balamung was dead now without even a grave to hold him but too many trokmoi still raided and settled on this side of the niffet adding one more volatile element to already touchy politics gerin emptied his own jack in a fashion more conventional than fands went over to the amphora and poured it full again some of his vassals were already swilling themselves into insensibility if i want dull he thought all i need do is listen to the talk around this table dice horses and chariots crops women no new ideas anywhere just old saws trotted out as if they were freshminted from pure gold he longed for the days when hed sat in students taverns arguing sorcerous techniques and the shape of the historical process rihwin the fox knew the pleasures of intellectual conversation but rihwin also knew the pleasures of the wine jar or that failing the ale pot he might complain about having to pour down ale but that didnt stop him from doing quite a lot of it and at the moment he had a serving girl on his lap he would have done a better job of fumbling at her clothes had his hands been steadier van knew his letters hed made a point of learning them when he discovered elabonian could be written he even spoke well of its alphabet gerin gathered hed run across other more cumbersome ways of noting down thoughts in his travels but learning his letters did not make him interested in quoting poetry except for informational content let alone analyzing it as for gerins own vassal barons most of them thought reading a vaguely effeminate accomplishment he wondered why even fewer women than men were literate theyd learned better than to say so to him and had learned he was a good fighting man in spite of having a room that stored several dozen scrolls and codices but that didnt mean they grew interested in thinking too gerin sighed and drank more ale himself sometimes he thought slipping back into near barbarism easier than trying to maintain the standards of civilization hed learned south of the high kirs which is the way civilization falls apart said the part of him that had studied history after one more jack of ale he didnt feel like arguing with that part any more rihwin and the girl had wandered off drago the bear snored thunderously on the floor and took no notice when one of the dogs walked over him duren was asleep too the little boy had curled up catlike on his bench van on the other hand was wide awake and looked more sober than gerin felt the fox raised an eyebrow at him what would you he asked shall we roll the dice after all for the lass you mean van shook his massive head you go to her tonight if youve a mind to shed sweeten up for me in a bit i expect but i havent the patience to get through the shouting thatd come first ill drink a bit more and then maybe sleep myself all right gerin lifted duren off the bench his son wriggled a little but did not wake as he carried duren upstairs the fox was grateful for the banister hed added to the stairway when he came back from the south with it he was much less likely to trip and break not only his neck but the boys he set duren on the bed in his own chamber hoping his son would wake up if he had to piddle in the night otherwise the mattress would need some fresh straw with duren in his arms the fox hadnt been able to carry a lamp or a taper up to the bedchamber with him that left it black as a bandits heart inside he stumbled over some wood toy or other that hed carved for duren and almost fell on his face flailing his arms he managed to keep himself upright and with a muttered curse went out into the hallway a couple of failing torches cast a dim red light there enough at least to let him see where he put his feet the walk to the next chamber was a matter of just a few steps he rapped on the door wondering if fand had fallen asleep if she didnt answer hed go back to his own bed but she did which of you is it now maybe it was the ale but gerin felt mischievous he deliberately deepened his voice and put on a slight guttural accent which dyou think he heard her take three rapid strides toward the door she threw it open and blazed van of the strong arm if youre after thinking ycan then by the torchlight and the brighter flame of the candle beside her bed she realized it wasnt van standing there she scowled at gerin youre a right devil to befool me so and i ought to be slamming the door on the beaky nose of you he looked down that member at her well he said when she didnt do as shed threatened well indeed she said and sighed must be im the fool for taking up with a southron manworse for taking up with a southron man and his great galoon of a friend the both of them at once often enough ive said it but her face softened since i am the fool you may as well come in she stood aside to let him pass closed the door behind him she kept the room scrupulously neat it was by all odds the cleanest part of the castle gerin knew the tunics and skirts and drawers in the cedar chest against the wall would all be folded just the same way beside that chest her sandals and shoes stood in precise pairs he lavished that much care only on his weapons where it could be a matter of life or death fand must have been mending a tunic when he knocked it lay on the wool coverlet to her bed candlelight glistened from the polished bone needle shed used she picked up the tunic set it on the chest she nodded toward the candle shall i blow it out please yourself he answered you know i like to look at you though that won him a smile you southrons are sweeter in the tongue than men of my own folk ill say so much for you maybe theres the why of my staying here a trokme chief now hed just tell me to be after spreading my legs and waste no time about it gerins skeptical eyebrow rose my guess is that any man who told you such a thing would be likelier to get a knife in the brisket than anything else sure and thats the very thing he got the blackhearted omadhaun she said why dyou think a puir lone woman would come to your keep at sunset seeking shelter from the ghosts had his kin caught me theyd have burned me in a wicker cage that they would he knew she was rightthat or some other equally appalling fate south of the high kirs they crucified their miscreants he reckoned himself merciful if a man needed killing he attended to it as quickly and cleanly as he could but hed killed his share and more these past few years his other thought was that fand calling herself a poor lone woman was about as accurate as a longtooth claiming it was a pussycat at need she likely could have shouted down the ghosts she cocked her head to one side sent him a curious look what is it youre waiting for ive no knife the now nor even a needle and a good thing too i say he took a step toward her she one toward him that brought them together her face lifted toward his her arms went round his neck she was crossgrained quarrelsome cantankerousgerin had never settled on just the right word but it lay somewhere in that range on the wool coverlet though she bucked like a yearling colt yowled like a catamount and clawed his back as if she were part wolverine in a way it was immensely flattering even when hed pleased elise which hadnt been all the time nor in the end nearly often enough shed given little sign with fand he had no room for doubt there but a passage with her sometimes put him more in mind of riding out a storm than making love the pleasure he felt afterwards was often tempered with relief for having got through it their sweatslick skins slid against each other as he rolled off her turn over he said turn over is it she said why tell me that youre not one of those whodoyoucallthemssithonians thats itwho like boys and use their women the same way and im not one for that as well you know but the warning delivered she did roll onto her belly he straddled the small of her back and started rubbing her shoulders the warning growls shed let out turned to purrs her flesh was warm and firm under his hands is that too rough he asked as he dug in with his thumbs she grunted but shook her head her bright hair flipped back and forth with a few shining strands covering his fingers and the backs of his hands youve summat here we never found north o the niffet she said sure and there may be more to this civilization youre always after prating of than i thought or ever i came to fox keep he wondered if he should tell her the best masseur hed ever known down in the city of elabon was a sithonian who would have been delighted to do more with him than merely rub his back he decided against it the more people in the northlands who cherished civilization for whatever reason the better off the wartorn country would be as gerins hands moved from her shoulders down her spine he moved down too after a bit fand exclaimed sharply i told you im not one for she broke off then giggled what a sneak of a man yare to put it in the right place from the wrong side she looked back at him over her shoulder different this way better worse even in such matters even at such a time he liked to know exactly how things went but she laughed at him how can i tell you that when weve hardly begun they went on looking for the answer gerin woke the next morning when duren got out of bed to use the chamber pot the light in the bedchamber was gray the sun hadnt risen yet but it would soon gerin got out of bed himself yawned stretched and knuckled his eyes the ale hed drunk the night before had left him with a bit of a headache good morning papa duren said good morning gerin answered yawning again he woke up slowly he tousled the boys hair im glad youre using the pot are you finished my turn then when he was through he pulled on the tunic and trousers hed tossed on the floor after he came back from fands room they didnt have any new spots he could see so what point in changing people were more fastidious on the other side of the high kirs but not much duren underfoot like a cat gerin walked down the hall to the stairs snores came from fands chamber louder snores came from van s one door further down in the great hall of the keep some of the foxs vassals were already up and stirring others lay bundled in blankets on straw pallets the fire in the altar still burned holding night ghosts at bay the doors that led out into the yard stood open to give the great hall fresh air and clear out some of the smoke from the cookfires gerin picked his way through the warriors and went outside in the east tiwazs thin crescent stood low in the brightening sky the other three moons had set torches smoked along the palisade even so duren who had followed his father into the yard whimpered and said i dont like the ghosts yelling in my ears papa to gerin the cries of the night spirits were not yells but whimpers and faint wails none of them understandable as he had fires lit and had given the ghosts blood in the great hall they were not likely to do him or duren harm he set his jaw and endured the cries he heard only with his minds ear children though were supposed to be more sensitive to the spirits than adults a couple of minutes later the first rays of the rising sun touched the top of the tall watchtower that stood above the keep the ghosts sounded frightened for an instant then vanished back into whatever gloomy haunt was theirs while the sun ruled the sky a new day gerin said to duren this is the time for living men to go abroad in the world he patted the boys back heartening him against the terror that fluttered with the ghosts van of the strong arm came out a few minutes later whistling loudly but offkey smoke poured from windows and doorways as the cooks built up the fire to heat the morning porridge van squinted as a strand of smoke stung his eyes there ought to be a way to cook your food without smoking everyone who eats it as if he were a sausage the burly outlander complained gerin narrowed his eyes too but not at the smoke there ought to be a way was a phrase that always set him thinking sometimes nothing came of it but sometimes things did he said remember the newfangled footholders duin the bold came up with so he wouldnt go over his horses tail if he tried to ride maybe we could find a new way to get rid of smoke too remember what happened to duin he got himself killed with his newfangled scheme thats what me id sooner fight from a chariot any day for all his wandering for all the strange things hed seen and done van remained at heart a profoundly conservative man gerin had more stretch to him i think this business of riding to war will end up coming to something a horse alone can cross terrain where a chariot cant go but you have a special trouble therewhere will you find a beast to bear your bulk ive never been small thats a fact van said complacently from the rumbles in my belly though ill be thin if i dont put something in there soon theyll have bread and meat from last night to go with the porridge wont they if they dont theyll be looking for a new master by this time tomorrow gerin answered van clapped his big hands together and hurried back inside the morning proved busy gerin always kept someone in the watchtower life had been dangerous enough before the trokmoi swarmed south over the niffet now danger could come from any direction at any time when the lookouts horn blew men up on the palisade reached for their weapons the gate crew got ready to pull up the drawbridge and defend castle fox against barbarians or men of elabon but after he winded the horn the watchman cried tis but a single man approachinga trader by the look of him sure enough the fellow was no harbinger of a ravening horde he drove a twohorse team from a small neat wagon dyaus give you a good day sir gerin greeted him when he rolled into the courtyard the fox glanced at the sun to get here so early in the day you must have spent last night in the open that i did lord prince the man answered he was small and neat himself with a shortsighted gaze and hands with long slim fingers i bought a couple of chickens from a peasantlikely a serf of yoursand their blood in a trench warded me against the ghosts otes son of engelers i am maker and purveyor of jewelry of all descriptions and also ready to do tinkers work if you have pots and such that need patching aye we have a few of those gerin said if you know the secret of proper soldering youll make a bit of silver before you leave here ive tried but without much in the way of luck but jewelry nowhmm he wondered if he could find a piece fand would like at a price that didnt make his own thrifty soul quail van came up to the wagon and from the thoughtful look on his face might have had the same idea but what he said was youre not the least brave man i ever met master jeweler if you take your wares through this banditraddled countryside alone otes engelers son dipped his head to the outlander you are gracious sir i traveled up into the foxs lands from those of aragis the archer few bandits try to make a living in your holding lord gerin or in hisfew who arent vassals styling themselves barons at any rate he smiled to show that was meant as a joke aye aragis is a strong man gerin let it go at that one of these days he and aragis were liable to fight a war the prospect would have bothered him less had he been less afraid he might lose show us these jewels of yours van boomed otes as hed said had adornments of all descriptions from polished copper with gems of glass paste to gold and emeralds before hed opened all his little cedar chests to display the baubles inside fand came out of the castle to admire them with her two men suddenly she pointed to a brooch isnt that pretty now she breathed sure and it must be trokme work it fair puts me in mind of my auld village on the far side of the niffet that it does smiling the jeweler picked it up and held it in the palm of his hand it was a circular piece about three fingers broad decorated with spirals half silver and half inlaid polished jet as a matter of fact my lady i made this one myself and im as elabonian as they come otes said that it is from a northern pattern though ill not deny twould suit the very tunic i have on me fand said running a hand across the dark blue woaddyed linen she looked from one of her paramours to the other van whod quarreled with her the night before weakened first with a cough he said master otes perhaps youll be good enough to tell me what outrageous price youre asking for this chunk of tin and dirt tin otes screeched dirt are you blind man are you mad feel the weight of that metal and look at the care and the workmanship i put into the piece shaping the tiny slivers of jet one by one and slipping each into its place aye tell me more lies van said sensing that the dicker would go on for some time gerin took his leave he figured he had time to walk out to the village by fox keep talk with besant bigbelly about knocking off too early and be back before van and otes had settled on a price he knew how stubborn van could be and the jeweler looked to have mules blood in him too but before the fox could walk out over the drawbridge the lookout in the watchtower winded his horn again he called down a chariot approaches lord gerin with what looks to be a trokme chieftain and two of his men just a chariot gerin shouted up no army attached i see only the one lord the lookout answered a moment later he added the chieftain is holding up a greenandwhite striped shield he comes under sign of truce gerin called to the gate crew when you spy him give him sign of truce in return well see what he wants before the invasions hed have attacked any northerners he caught on his holding now the trokmoi were powers south of the niffet however much it galled him he had to treat with them who comes one of the men at the gate called to the approaching chariot its diviciacus son of dumnorix i am liegeman to himself himself the great chief adiatunnus son of commus whos fain to have me bring his words to gerin the fox the chieftain answered in elabonian that lilted like fands no quarrel no feud stands between us the now the trokmoi had slain gerins father and brother as far as he was concerned that put him eternally at feud with them moreover he reckoned them deadly dangerous to the remnants of civilization that survived in the northlands after elabon had cut the province loose but in a narrow sense diviciacus was right no active fighting went on between adiatunnus men and those of the fox dropping into the trokme tongue gerin said if its the fox you re seeking i am he aye i grant the truce between your chief and my own self come sit yourself by my hearth drink a stoup of ale and tell me adiatunnus words at your comfort and leisure diviciacus beamed he was a tall thin pale man with a lean wolfish face cleanshaven but for a straggling mustache of bright red he wore a checked tunic and baggy wool trousers tucked into boots a long straight bronze sword hung from his belt the other warrior in the chariot and its driver might have been poured into the same mold as he save that one of them had sandy hair and mustache the other blond inside the smoky great hall diviciacus gulped down his first jack of ale wiped his mouth on his sleeve belched loudly and said sure and youre after living up to the name you have for hospitality lord gerin that yare gerin could take a hint he filled the trokmes drinking jack again then said and what would adiatunnus wish with me pray the northern chieftain controlled several holdings a fair distance south and west of fox keep of all the trokmoi whod settled south of the niffet he was probably the most powerful and the most adept at ridingand twistingthe swirling political currents of the northlands diviciacus came to the point with barbarous directness himself wants to know if youre of a mind to join forces with him and squeeze the pimple called aragis off the arse of mankind does he gerin said in a way that was logical aragis blocked gerins ambitions no less than adiatunnus in another way why wouldnt i be more likely to combine with a man of my own blood against an invader adiatunnus says he reckons you reckon aragis more a thorn in your side than his own self diviciacus smiled at the subtlety of his chiefs reasoning and indeed it was more subtle than most northerners could have produced the envoy went on forbye he says that once the archer is after being cut into catmeat you can go your way and he his with no need at all for the twain of ye to clomp heads like bull aurochs in rutting season he says that gerin didnt believe it would work so he didnt think adiatunnus believed it either which meant he was distracted from what it meant when duren came in and said im bored papa play ball with me or something a fine bairn diviciacus said hed have whatfour summers on him at gerins nod the trokme also nodded and went on aye hes much of a size with my youngest but one who has the same age gerin was so used to thinking of trokmoi as warriors as enemies that he needed a moment to adjust to the notion of diviciacus as a fond father he supposed he shouldnt have been taken aback without fathers the trokmoi would have disappeared in a generation and the lives of all the elabonians north of the high kirs would have become much easier but it caught him by surprise all the same to duren he said i cant play now im talking with this man duren stamped his foot and filled himself full of air preparatory to letting out an angry screech gerin said do you want my hand on your backside duren deflated his screech remained unhowled convinced his father meant what he said duren went off to look for amusement somewhere else good on you for training him to respect his elders him still so small and all diviciacus said now tell me straight how you fancy the notion of your men and those of adiatunnus grinding aragis between em like wheat in the quern it has possibilities gerin didnt want to say no straight out for fear of angering adiatunnus and of giving him the idea of throwing in with aragis instead the fox reckoned aragis likely to be willing to combine with the trokme against his own holdings no ties of blood or culture would keep aragis from doing what seemed advantageous to him possibilities is it and what might that mean diviciacus demanded it was a good question since gerin found himself without a good answer he temporized let me take counsel with some of my vassals stay the night here if you care to eat with us drink more aleby dyaus i swear no harm will come to you in fox keep come the morning ill give you my answer im thinking youd say aye straight out if aye was in your heart diviciacus said dubiously still let it be as you wish ill stay a bit so i will and learn what youll reply but i tell you straight out youll befool me with none o the tricks that earned you your ekename since persuading the trokme not to leave at once in high dudgeon was one of those tricks the fox maintained a prudent silence he suspected diviciacus and his comrades would use the day to empty as many jars of ale as they could better ale spilled than blood he told himself philosophically fand came in wearing the silverandjet brooch just above her left breast diviciacus eyes clung to her my leman gerin said pointedly that recalled to diviciacus the reason hed come if youve allied with us so why not on the field of war he said hope for success in his mission suddenly restored as i said ill talk it over with my men and tell you in the morning what ive decided gerin went out to the courtyard where van was practicing thrusts and parries with a heavy spear taller than he was the outlander for all his size moved so gracefully that he made the exercise seem more a dance than preparation for war when gerin told him what adiatunnus had proposed he scowled and shook his head making common cause with the trokme would but turn him into a grander threat than aragis poses my thought was the same gerin answered i wanted to see if you saw anything on the other side to change my mind van shook his head again and went back to his thrusts and parries gerin put the same question to drago the bears response was simpler no way in any of the five hells i want to fight on the same side with the trokmoi ive spent too much time tryin to kill them buggers that made gerin pluck thoughtfully at his beard even had he been inclined to strike the bargain with adiatunnus his vassals might not have let him he went looking for rihwin to get one more view before he found him the lookout called another man approaches in a wagon great dyaus three sets of visitors in a day gerin exclaimed sometimes no one from outside his holding came to fox keep for ten days or twenty tradeindeed traffic of any sorthad fallen off since the northlands went their own way not only did epidemic petty warfare keep traffic off the roads but baronies more and more either made do with what they could produce themselves or did without who comes called a warrior up on the palisade i am a minstrel tassilo by name came the replyin sure enough a melodious tenor i would sing for my supper a bed for the night and whatever other generosity your gracious lord might see fit to provide tassilo gerin stood stockstill his hands balling into fists the minstrel had sung down at the keep of elises father ricolf the red the night before she went off with gerin rather than letting herself be wed to wolfar of the axe just hearing tassilos name and his voice brought those memories sweet and bitter at the same time welling up in the fox he was anything but anxious to listen to tassilo again but all the men who heard the minstrel name himself cried out with glee songs tonight by dyaus maybe hell have ones weve not heard a lute to listen tothatll be sweet hearing that gerin knew he could not send the man away for his retainers entertainment they didnt have to make themselves was rare and precious if that entertainment made him wince well hed endured worse sighing he said the minstrel is welcome let him come in when tassilo got down from his light wagon he bowed low to the fox lord prince weve met before i think at ricolfs holding was it not the circumstances as i recall were irregular the minstrel stuck his tongue in the side of his cheek irregular you say aye theres a good word for it thats the business of a minstrel though isnt itcoming up with words i mean being moderately skilled in that line himself gerin respected those who had more skill at it than he he eyed tassilo curious you ve not visited fox keep since i fled south when the trokmoi swarmed over the niffet lord prince and ive spent most of my time since then down by the high kirs tassilo answered he had an open friendly expression and looked as much like a fighting man as a singer with broad shoulders and a slim waist in the northlands any traveling man had to be a warrior as well if he wanted to live to travel far what brought you north again then gerin asked a barons daughter claimed i got her with child i dont think i did but he believed her i thought a new clime might prove healthier after that gerin shrugged he had no daughter to worry about he said the men look forward to your performance tonight lying a little he added having heard you those years ago so do i the minstrel could sing and play no doubt about that the foxs memories were not tassilos fault after a few more pleasantries gerin strode out over the drawbridge and headed for the peasant village a few hundred yards away chickens and pigs and skinny dogs foraged among round huts of wattle and daub whose thatched conical roofs projected out far enough to hold the rain away from the walls children too young to work in the fields stared at gerin as he tramped up the muddy lane that ran through the middle of the village he stuck his head into besant bigbellys hut which was little different from any of the others the headman wasnt there but his wife a scrawny woman named marsilia sat on a wooden stool spinning wool into thread she said lord if youre after my man hes out weeding the garden the garden was on the outskirts of the village sure enough besant was there plucking weeds from a patch of vetch not only did he have a big belly he had a big backside too which at the moment stuck up in the air resisting the urge to kick it gerin barked why have you been blowing the horn with the sun only halfway down the sky besant jerked as if gerin had kicked him after all he whirled around scrambling awkwardly to his feet llord gerin he stuttered i didnt hear you come up if you dont want more unexpected visits make sure you work the full day gerin answered well all be hungrier come winter for your slacking now besant gave gerin a resentful stare he was a tubby sloppylooking man of about fifty in homespun colorless save for dirt and stains here and there i shall do as you say lord prince he mumbled the ghosts have been bad of late though feed them more generously then or throw more wood on the nightfires gerin said youve no need to hide in your houses from an hour before sunset to an hour past dawn besant nodded but still looked unhappy the trouble was he and gerin needed each other without the serfs gerin and his vassal barons would starve that much besant bigbelly knew but without the barons the little villages of farmers would be at the mercy of trokmoi and bandits peasants with pitchforks and scythes could not stand against chariots and bronze armor and spears and swords the headman did his best to ignore that half of the bargain gerin said remember ill be listening to hear when you blow the horn come evening he waited for besant to nod again then walked off to see how the village fared the gods willing he thought the harvest would be good wheat for bread oats for horses and oatmeal barley for ale rye for variety beans peas squashes all grew well under the warm sun so did row on row of turnips and parsnips cabbage and kale lettuce and spinach gardens held vetch onions melde radishes garlic and medicinal herbs like henbane some fields stood vacant the grass there lengthening for haymaking cattle and sheep grazed all the way out to the edge of the trees in others a couple of lambs butted heads they might as well be barons gerin murmured to himself the peasants were hard at it as usual weeding like besant repairing wooden fences to keep the animals where they belonged unbaling straw to repair a leaky roofall the myriad tasks that kept the village going gerin stopped to talk with a few of the serfs most seemed content enough as overlords went he was a mild one and they knew it he spent more time in the village than hed intended the sun was already sinking toward the treetops when he headed back to fox keep no besant wont blow the horn early tonight not with me here so long he thought well have to see about tomorrow when he returned to the castle the cooks were full of praise for the way otes son of engelers had fixed half a dozen pots the fox nodded approvingly the large sale the jeweler had made to fand or rather to van hadnt kept him from doing the other half of his job on seeing otes himself gerin invited him to stay for supper and pass the night in the great hall by the way he grinned and promptly accepted the neat little man had been expecting that in the great hall tassilo was fitting a new string to his lute and plucking at it to put it in proper tune duren watched him in popeyed fascination i want to learn to do that papa he said maybe you will one day gerin said stored away somewhere was a lute hed had as a boy hed never been much good with it but who could say what his son might accomplish after supper tassilo showed what he could do in honor of my host he said i shall give you some of the song of gerin and the dreadful night when all the moons turned full together he struck a plangent chord from the lute and began gerin who had lived through that dreadful night five years before recognized little of it from the minstrels description much of that had to do with the way tassilo composed his song he didnt create it afresh from nothing that would have overtaxed even the wits of lekapenos the great sithonian epic poet instead like lekapenos tassilo put his song together from stock bits and pieces of older ones some of those were just for the sake of sound and meter the fox quickly got used to hearing himself called gallant gerin every time his name was mentioned it saved tassilo or any other poet the trouble of having to come up with a new epithet every time he was mentioned in the story and some of the pieces of old songs were ones gerin had heard before and which didnt perfectly fit the tale tassilo was telling now the bits about battling the trokmoi went back to his boyhood and likely to his grandfathers boyhood as well but that too was part of the convention more depended on the way the minstrel fit the pieces together than on what those pieces were all the same gerin leaned over to van and said one thing i remember that tassilo isnt saying anything about is how bloody frightened i was ah but youre not a person to him not really van replied youre gallant gerin the hero and how could gallant gerin be afraid even with every werebeast in the world trying to tear his throat out at the time it was easy gerin said which won a laugh from van hed been through the werenight with gerin bold van tassilo called him which was true enough but he hadnt been immune to fear either and yet the rest of tassilos audience ate up the song drago the bear whod gone through his own terrors that night pounded on the table and cheered to hear how gerin had surmounted his it might not have been true but it sounded good duren hung on tassilos every word long after the time he should have been asleep in bed even the trokmoi whose fellows had been on the point of putting an end to gerin when the chaos of the werenight saved him listened avidly to the tale of their peoples discomfiture wellturned phrases and songs of battle were enough to gladden them even if they came out on the losing side tassilo paused to drink ale diviciacus said to gerin give me your answer now fox dear ive not the patience to wait for morning gerin sighed it must be no i thought as much the trokme said yes is simple but no needs disguises youll be after regretting it so will your chief if he quarrels with me the fox answered tell him as much diviciacus glared but nodded when gerin who was yawning himself tried to pick up duren and carry him off to bed his son yelled and cried enough to make the fox give it up as a bad job if duren wanted to fall asleep in the great hall listening to songs hed let him get away with it this once gerin yawned again he was tired whether duren was or not with a wave to tassilo he headed for his bedchamber what with fand and van in the next room the noise up there proved almost as loud as what the minstrel made and even more distracting gerin tossed and turned and grumbled and just when he finally was on the point of dropping off got bitten on the cheek by a mosquito he mashed the bug but that woke him up again he lay there muttering to himself until at last he did fall asleep because of that the sun was a quarter of the way up the sky when he came back down to the great hall van who was just finishing a bowl of porridge laughed at him see the slugabed id have gotten to sleep sooner if someone i know hadnt been making such a racket next door gerin said pointedly van laughed louder make any excuse you like you outslept your guests no matter what all three lots of them are long gone they want to get in as much travel as they can while the suns in the sky id do the same in their boots gerin looked around where s duren i thought he was with you captain van said didnt you take him up to bed the way you usually do no he wanted to listen to tassilo some more gerin dipped up a bowl of porridge from the pot over the fire raised it to his mouth after he swallowed he said hes probably out in the courtyard making mischief in the courtyard he found drago the bear pouring a bucket of well water over the head of rihwin the fox both of them looked as if they d seen the bottoms of their drinking jacks too many times the night before no ive not seen the boy all morning drago said when gerin asked him nor i the dripping rihwin said he added if he made as much noise as small boys are in the habit of doing id remember seeing him painfully his eyes were tracked with red yes hed hurt himself last night gerin frowned thatsodd he raised his voice duren he put two fingers in his mouth let out a long piercing whistle that made rihwin and drago flinch his son knew he was supposed to come no matter what when he heard that call he also wasnt supposed to go by himself too far from castle fox to hear it wolves and longtooths and other wild beasts roamed the woods so sometimes did wild men but duren did not come now gerin began to worry maybe he thought the boy had gone off to the peasant village hed done that alone once or twice and got his backside heated for it but often a boy needed a lot of such heatings before he got the idea gerin remembered he had when he was small he walked over to the village ready to thunder like dyaus when he found his son but no one there had seen duren either a cold wind of dread in his belly gerin went back to castle fox he sent men out in all directions beating the bushes and calling durens name they came back scratched by thorns and stung by wasps but without the boy duren was missing ii gerin paced between the benches in the great hall making rihwin and van and drago move out of the way one of those three must have snatched him he said diviciacus or tassilo or otes i cant believe duren would go wandering off where we couldnt find him not of his own accord if youre right captain weve eaten up a lot of the day looking around here van said i know gerin answered unhappily ill go out and send others in chariots as well even so if dyaus and the other gods are kind one of us will catch up with ourguests he spat the last word guestfriendship was sacred those who violated it could expect a long unhappy time in the afterlife unfortunately though fear of that didnt paralyze all rogues whod want to steal a little boy drago the bear growled his big hands moved in the air as if closing round a neck gerins more agile wits had already started pursuing that one diviciacus might to give adiatunnus a hold on me he said i dont think adiatunnus would have ordered itwho could guess ahead of time if the chance would come upbut i dont think hed turn down a gift like that if it fell into his lap duren might give him a hold for now but hed get nothing but grief from you later van said aye but since i turned him down for a joint move on aragis hes liable to think hed get only grief from me anyhow the fox answered thinking hes liable to be right too aloud he went on speaking of aragis otes the jeweler came from his lands and aragis might not turn down a hold on me either youre right there too drago said making more choking motions youre leaving out tassilo van said i know gerin kicked aside a doggnawed bone i cant think of any reason hed want to harm me i can rihwin the fox said can you indeed gerin said surprised what is it rihwin coughed his smoothly handsome face went a couple of shades pinker than usual youll recall lord that when last you made the acquaintance of this tassilo i was in the process of ah disqualifying myself from marrying the fair elise i hadnt tasted wine in too long you understand disgracing yourself is more like it van said blunt as usual gloriously drunk rihwin had stood on his head on a table at ricolf the reds and kicked his legs in the air while wearing a southernstyle toga and no drawers he coughed again perhaps your word is more accurate friend van though not calculated to make me feel better about the incident or myself be that as it may i resume elise having found you no more to her taste lord gerin than her father did me she might possibly have engaged the services of this minstrel to rape away the boy for her to raise gerin bit down on that like a man whose teeth closed on a worm in an apple ever since elise left him hed done his best not to think about her whenever he did it hurt he had no idea where in the northlands she was whether she was still with the horse doctor with whom shed gone away or even whether she still lived but what rihwin said made enough sense that he had to ask himself those questions now slowly he answered aye youre right worse luck that could be so he plucked at his beard as he weighed odds i still think the trokmoi are likeliest to have stolen duren so van and i will go southwest after them which way did tassilo fare west toward the holding of schild stoutstaff or thats where he told the gate crew he was heading drago answered gerin grunted if tassilo had duren with him he might well have lied about his chosen direction or he might not have schild had been the leading vassal to wolfar of the axe he wasnt a deadly foe to gerin as wolfar had been but he was no great friend either though hed acknowledged the fox his suzerain after gerin killed wolfar he forgot that whenever convenient he might shelter tassilo or at least grant him safe passage all right rihwin gerin said you ride west to schilds border and past it if his guards give you leave if they dont he paused for effect tell them they and their overlord will have cause to regret it rihwin nodded as you say now otes gerin said again drago answered he said he was heading east along the emperors highway to see if hagop son of hovan had tinkers work for him he didnt think hed sell hagop much in the way of jewelry skinflint was the word he used i think for hagop its a good one gerin said judiciously all right you go after him then ill do that lord drago said and strode out of the great hall gerin was as sure as if his eyes could follow that drago was heading for the stables to hitch his team to his chariot and that he d ride out after otes the minute the job was done to drago the world was a simple place his liege lord had given him an order so he would follow it gerin sometimes wished he couldnt see all the complications in the world around him either van said youll want me to ride with you eh captain well need a driver as well if were to take on diviciacus and his friends on even terms youre right on both counts gerin said he thought about adding another chariot and threeman team of warriors too but decided against it van was worth a couple of ordinary men in a fight and the fox did not denigrate his own skill with his hands and raffo redblade whod been driving for them for years hadnt earned his ekename by running from fights the fox added and well send widin simrins son south to ask what aragis knows van find himhell be in the courtyard somewhereand get him moving too the decision made gerin took his armor down from the wall and put it on bronze greaves first then leather cuirass faced with scales of bronze and last of all a plain pot of a helmet none of it was polished none of it looked the least bit fancythe fox left that to van but his own gear was sound it did what he wanted it to do it kept edged and pointed metal from splitting his flesh as far as he was concerned nothing else mattered he slung his quiver over his shoulder took down his bow and then grabbed his shield that was a yardwide disk of leather and wood with bronze edging to keep swordstrokes from chewing it up most elabonian warriors had gear much like the foxs some men went in for gold or silver ornamentation but he wanted nothing of the sort curlicues and inlays could catch and hold a point while rich armor made a man a special target on the battlefield with his outlandish armor van of the strong arm was always a target on the battlefield but no one yet had been able to strip his crested helm and twopiece corselet from him along with his spear he carried a sword a mace and several daggers he was also a fine archer but did not use the bow in combat affecting to despise slaying foes from afar as unmanly foolishness gerin said as he had many times before as long as youre alive and the other fellow isnt nothing else matters you get no points for style not in war you dont van brandished his spear captain thats never been a problem his grin showed only a couple of broken teeth more evidence as if more were needed he was more dangerous with weapons in hand than anyone hed run up against practical as usual gerin went into the kitchens and filled a leather sack with twicebaked bread that would keep indefinitely and that needed someone with good teeth to eat it and strips of smoked mutton even tougher than the bread if he had to fight from the chariot the sack would go over the side if he didnt he and van and raffo could travel for a few days without worrying about supplies gerin shouldered the bag and carried it out to the stables raffo a gangling young man with pimples along the margin of his beard looked up from hitching the horses to either side of the chariot shaft be good to get out on the road lord gerin he said getting the animals into the double yoke and securing them to the shaft with straps that ran around the front of their necks it would be better if we were going out for a different reason gerin said heavily raffos face fell hed forgotten that the fox had given up on expecting tact from his men they were he sometimes thought with something approaching despair only a couple of steps more civilized than the trokmoi improving that was a matter for generations not just years even keeping them from falling back into barbarism often seemed none too easy he stowed his shield on the brackets mounted on the inside of the car it made the side wall higher van walked into the stables then his place in the chariot was on the right side he set his shield into its stowage place too and grunted approvingly when he saw the sack of supplies thats good he said now well just need to buy a fowl from the peasants if we camp out in the open or bleed out our prey if we go hunting have to give the ghosts something after all aye gerins voice was abstracted the chase wont be easy diviciacus and his friends have half a days start on us and more than one road they can choose to go back to adiatunnusand we dont even know they have my boy he wanted to scream in rage and fear instead he grew more quiet and withdrawn than ever he was not one to show worry on the outside only one way to find out van said true true gerin turned to raffo are you done harnessing the beasts by way of answer the young driver vaulted into the car the fox clapped him on the back good lets travel the sixspoked wheels began to spin the bronze tires on those wheels rattled and clattered as they bounced over pebbles gerin felt every tiny thing the wheels went over too had he not needed the most speed he could get and had he not thought he might have to fight to get duren back he would have taken a wagon instead but the chariot it had to be a day of standing in this car and well wobble on solid ground like sailors coming off a ship long at sea he said the chariot rumbled out through the gateway over the drawbridge and away from fox keep speak to me not of sailing said van who had done his share of it youre not likely to get seasick in the car here and thats a facta fact you can thank the gods for too ive puked up my guts a time or three and ive no wish to do it again south and west raffo said musingly which road would they have taken lord gerin would they have fared south down the elabon way and then gone straight west toward adiatunnus castle or do you think they went along the lesser roads that run straighter between here and there the fox rubbed his chin as he considered at last he said if theyre going down the elabon way widin will come on them for hes taking that road toward aragis holding hed be one against three van pointed out gerin grimaced i know but he wouldnt be foolish enough to attack them if they have duren and he finds out about it hell get word back to the keep we can plan what to do nextgo to war with adiatunnus i expect i didnt think you wanted to do that yet lord gerin raffo said i dont gerin answered but i will but if we go the same way widin has we narrow the search more than i want i aim to throw my net as wide as i can hoping to catch something in one strand of the mesh aye makes sense to me van said which eased the foxs mind somewhat his burly friend had a keen eye for tactics though gerin reckoned himself more adept in planning for years ahead raffo steered the team down a way that headed toward adiatunnus lands within a couple of minutes the clearing where gerins serfs scratched their living from the soil disappeared behind the chariot forest closed in on either side of the road which but for the ruts from wagons and chariots might have been a game track branches reached out and tried to slap the fox in the face he held up an arm to turn them aside whenever he went down a back road like this one he was struck by how lightly civilization rested on the northlands the stink of the castle midden and the bigger one in the peasant village were out of his nostrils now the woods smelled green and growing as if man with his stinks had never come this way in the virgin pines and elms robins sang sweetly chickadees twittered and jays cried their harsh metallic calls a red squirrel flirted its tail as it clambered up a tree trunk but gerin knew better than to idealize the forest as some sithonian poets most of whom had never set foot outside the city of elabon were wont to do wolves ranged through the woods in hungry winters theyd go after flocks or the herders who tended them longtooths would take men as they would any other prey winter or summer and the aurochs the great wild ox of the forest was nothing to take lightlya few years before gerin had almost died under the horns and trampling hooves of a rogue bull he motioned for raffo to stop the chariot with a puzzled look the driver obeyed but for the bird calls and the soft purling of a stream somewhere off out of sight silence closed down like a cloak to the fox who was comfortable with only himself for company it felt pleasant and restful van though quickly started to fidget he pulled a bakedclay flute from a pouch on his belt and began playing a tune whose notes ran in no pattern familiar to elabonian music thats better he said too bloody quiet here gerin swallowed a sigh and tapped raffo on the shoulder lets get going again id sooner listen to jingling harness than to vans tweedles aye lord gerin now that you mention it so would i raffo flicked the reins the horses snorted resentfullytheyd started cropping the grass that grew between the rutsand trotted down the road at the next village gerin asked the serfs if theyd seen the chariot full of trokmoi come past they all shook their heads as if theyd not only not seen such a thing but never heard of it either the fox scowled were too far north or too far south and dyaus only knows which that or theyve gone down the elabon way as raffo feared he pounded his fist on the chariot rail in frustration too far northd be my guess van said the track we were on curved i think till it ran nearer west than southwest i didnt note that myself but youre most often right about such things gerin said raffo the next road we come on that heads south you take it till it crosses one leading in the direction we really want to go or until it peters out he thought not all paths connected to others the peasants watched as their overlord rode out of the village though still on land he ruled directly rather than through one of his vassal barons he seldom came here save when collecting what was due him each fall he wondered what the serfs thought of this unexpected appearance most likely they were relieved he hadnt demanded anything of them shadows lengthened as the chariot rattled and rumbled through woods that seemed to grow ever thicker i wonder if this road ever does join up with anything else van said if it doesnt pretty bloody soon were going to have to turn back and head for that last village to buy a couple of chickens gerin said i dont want to have to count on just fire to keep the ghosts away raffo pointed with his free hand looks like more light up ahead lord gerin might be only a meadow mind you but it might be fields too and fields mean another village it was fields gerin felt like cheering no sooner had the chariot emerged from the woods than the quitting horn called the peasants in from their labor the fox looked around yes i know this placepinabel oddeyes is headman here im used to coming here from the west though not out of the north pinabels left eye was blue his right brown brown and blue both widened when gerin rolled into the center of the village pinabel bowed very low llord prince what brings you here he stammered the nervousness he showed made gerin wonder what sort of cheating he was doing but hed have to worry about that later my sons been kidnapped he announced baldly pinabel and the other serfs who heard exclaimed in dismay family ties mattered to them not least because those were almost all too many of them had he went on i think three trokmoi who visited fox keep yesterday may have taken him that brought more murmurs from the peasants they were even more afraid of the trokmoi than of night ghosts and with reason the ghosts could be propitiated but the woodsrunners ravaged as they pleased but when gerin asked if pinabel and the others in the village had seen the chariot diviciacus and his comrades were riding they all denied it he believed them much as he wished he thought they were lying pinabel said they might have gone through by way of the next road south its very great i hear though i have never traveled far enough to see it maybe gerin didnt have the heart to tell the headman that next road was just another muddy track like most serfs pinabel had never traveled more than a few hours walk from where he was born will you stay with us till morning lord prince pinabel asked night comes soon he gestured to the east where elleb only a day before full had already risen math hung halfway up the sky while nothos almost at first quarter showed near enough where south lay and in the west the sun was near the horizon when it set the ghosts would come out but gerin shook his head i want to push on as long as i mayevery moment may prove precious sell me two chickens if you would so i can give the ghosts blood when they come aye lord prince pinabel hurried away he returned a couple of minutes later with a pair of hens their legs tied with strips of rawhide gerin gave him a quarter of a silverpiece for them probably more than they were worth but the smallest bit of money he had in the pouch at his belt pinabel oddeyes bowed himself almost double as the chariot bounced away raffo observed most lords would have said give me two chickens there that hadnt occurred to gerin he said those birds arent remotely part of the dues pinabels village owes on its land i have no right just to take them from him neither does any other elabonian lord with his serfs if i understand your ways aright van said the thing of it is most wouldnt let that stop em youre probably right gerin said with a sigh but the way i see it i owe my peasants fair dealing just as they do with me if i dont give it how can i expect to get it in return often enough you wont get it in return no matter what sort of dealing you give van said youre right the fox sighed again but when i dont im not soft on that either gerin was scrupulously fair anyone who thought him weak on that account soon regretted it if i dont stop now lord gerin well not have time to make ready to meet the ghosts raffo said pointing to the western skyline the sun red as hot copper had to be just on the point of setting gerin thought about pushing on for another furlong or two but regretfully decided raffo was right at his nod the driver reined in gerin jumped down and gouged out a trench in the soft dirt by the side of the road that did the edge of his dagger no good but it was the only digging tool he had van handed him the trussed fowls he cut off their heads one after the otherthe knife was still sharp enough for thatand let their blood spill into the trench none too soon he still held the second hen over the hole when the ghosts came they were as ever indistinct the eye would not could not grasp their shape they buzzed round the blood like carrion flies soaking up vitality from it because hed given them the gift they were not fierce and angry and terrifying as they would have been otherwise but tried to give him good advice in return he could not understand them he had never been able to save on the werenight when his brothers shade managed to deliver a message of truly oracular obscuritythough hed been able to use it later to destroy balamung just when the opposite result looked far more likely van bent over a firebow twirling a stick with a rawhide lace to start a blaze for the evening he shook his head like a man bedeviled by gnats i wish theyd quit yowling in my mind he grumbled but then he grunted in satisfaction here we go raffofeed me tinder a bit at a time you know how aye raffo had been crumbling dry leaves he poked some into the hole where the stick from the firebow spun van breathed gently on the sparks hed started hoping to fan them rather than blowing them out you have it raffo said and gave him more tinder to feed the new little flames with the fire well and truly started he passed van larger twigs to load on soon the thick chunk of branch on which the outlander had used the firebow would also catch i wish it were that easy all the time van said gut those birds fox and pluck em so we can get ourselves outside them they re better fare than what we brought with us youre right there the plucking job gerin gave the hens was quick and decidedly imperfect he didnt care he was hungry he picked out the birds hearts livers and gizzards from the offal to roast them over the fire then threw the rest of the guts into the trench with the blood he raffo and van drew stems of grass for the night watches few bandits dared the ghosts to travel by night but gerin was not the sort to take unnecessary chancesthe necessary ones were quite bad enough and the beasts of the forest being without souls themselves took no notice of the night spirits they usually did not attack travelers encamped in the woods but you never could tell van drew the short stem and chose the first watch gerin and raffo drew again this time raffo won and picked the watch that led to dawn since i get to have my sleep broken up i may as well take what i can get of it gerin said and wrapped himself in a blanketas much to keep off the bugs as for warmth for the night was mild van shook him awake with the cheerful insouciance of a man whod already done his share of a job nothing much doing captain he said while gerin tried to break free of the fog that shrouded his wits van took off the helm corselet and greaves hed worn through his watch cocooned himself in his blanket and was snoring by the time the fox began to think himself awake gerin put on his own helmet and sword but did not bother with his cuirass he paced back and forth not willing to sit down until he was sure he wouldnt doze off the fire had died into embers he fed it twigs and then branches and brought it back to briskly crackling life that drove away some of the ghosts flittering near and reduced their murmur in his mind by the time hed taken care of that he felt more confident he could stay awake he walked to the edge of the circle of firelight and sat down with his back to the flames his night vision almost ruined when hed stoked them slowly returned the moons had wheeled a good way through the sky nothos was nearing the western skyline math well west of southwhen her golden gibbous disk sank below the horizon it would be time for the fox to rouse raffo elleb looking like a bright new bronze coin neared the meridian here and there in the forest birches mingled with ash and oak and pine by the light of the moons and the nightfire their pale trunks seemed almost to gleam against the darker background gerin wished his ears could grow more sensitive to the dark the way his eyes did off in the distance a barn owl hooted the trokmoi thought the souls of dead warriors inhabited the pallid night birds the fox had his doubts about that but hed never tried a sorcerous experiment to find out one way or the other he spent a while trying to figure out how such an experiment might be run and what he could do if he found the trokmoi were wrong making the arrogant woodsrunners doubt themselves in any way was likely to be worthwhile you know he said to himself in a low voice the midwatch isnt so bad after all i dont get enough time of my own with no one havering at me to do this or decide that right this moment in smallor sometimes not so smalldoses he relished solitude perhaps three parts of his fourhour watch had gone by when a coughing roar not far away roused him from contemplation or rather jerked him out of it by the scruff of the neck no one could ignore a longtooths hunting cry a mans blood knew it meant danger one of the horses let out a frightened snort the fox found his left hand on the hilt of his sword without conscious memory of how it had got therenot that a sword would stop one of the great hunting cats if it chose to hunt him the longtooth to his vast relief came no closer to the campsite well he muttered im not sleepy now he felt as if hed had ice water splashed over him when a nightjar swooped down to grab one of the moths fluttering around the fire he almost jumped out of his skin he woke raffo as soon as math set the driver looked toward the west saw the moon was down and nodded in approval no one ever said you werent one for right dealing lord he said blurrily around a yawn gerin wrapped himself in his blanket once more he kept an eye on raffo to make sure the younger man wouldnt go back to sleep as he almost had raffo though took watchstanding seriously and paced about as the fox had gerin feared he himself would have trouble dozing off again but in spite of his worries quickly drifted away the rising sun made him rise too his eyes came open just as the ghosts vanished for the day he got to his feet feeling elderly van was still snoring gerin roused him cautiously the outlanders first waking actespecially when he was disturbedwas usually to grab for a weapon this time though he seemed to remember where he was and came to himself without violence he headed for the forest saying either i go off behind a bush or i burst where i stand i watered the grass on watch so i dont have that worry gerin said buckling on his right greave raffo harnessed the horses the chicken bones and guts were already beginning to stink the travelers moved upwind before they gnawed on bread and smoked meat are we ready raffo asked looking around the little camp to make sure nothing had been forgotten gerin looked too if they had left something behind he would have blamed himself they climbed into the chariot raffo driving gerin behind him on the left van on the right raffo flicked the reins the horses started forward when they came to a stream raffo let the animals have a brief drink gerin scooped up some water in the palm of his hand too and freshened what he carried in the waterskin at his belt at the next road that ran west raffo swung the chariot onto it a little village lay not far from the crossroads the appearance of their lord so early in the day was a prodigy for the peasants when he asked if theyd seen diviciacus and his comrades the day before one of the men nodded aye just before noon it were he said a couple of other people nodded the fox scowled he was on the right track aye but no closer to the trokmoi than when hed set out if they were traveling hard maybe they had a reason did they have a boy with them he asked and then amplified that my son i mean the serfs looked at one another didnt see no boy lord answered the fellow whod spoken before that wasnt what gerin wanted to hear had the trokmoi cut durens throat as if he were some sacrifice to the night ghosts then dumped the corpse by the side of the road horrid dread filled him his father his brothernow his son too if that was so he vowed hed not rest till every redmustached robber south of the niffet was dead or routed back to the northern woods even as he made it he knew the vow to be impossible of fulfillment he spoke it in his mind all the same it would give his life a target take everything you can from the horses he told raffo his voice harsh now we have to catch them before they win back to adiatunnus lands aye lord gerin but raffo sounded doubtful they have a long lead though gaining enough ground wont be easy the more so as we may have to keep casting about for the road they took i know that gerin growled but ill have answers from them if i have to wring out each word with hot pincers van thumped him on the shoulder easy captain easy we dont even know they ever had the lad mind you but they must have gerin stopped shook his head assuming something was so because you thought it had to be was one of the flaws in logic that made the savants in the city of elabon laugh he took a deep breath and said youre right we dont know they had him he wondered if he ever would or could know had diviciacus and his crew killed duren and tossed his body into the woods scavengers would make short work of it he knew too well that his son had only a little meat on his bones when hed charged out after the trokmoi hed figured he or drago or rihwin or widin would catch up with duren s kidnappers rescue the boy and return in triumph to castle fox now he realized hed been making assumptions there too uncertainty in a way felt even worse than being sure of durens death would have how long could he go on wondering without going mad then he thought that after a while he wouldnt be uncertain any more hed have to reckon duren dead if he wanted to keep on living himself push them he said to raffo this time the driver did not answer back he flicked the whip over the horses backs they leaned into the harness pushed their pace up to a fast trot the chariot rolled through another peasant village and then drove by the small keep of notker the bald one of gerins vassal barons aye lord gerin notker called from the palisade they came by here yesterday sometime past noon but they showed shield of truce just as they had on the way to your castle so i thought no more about it did they have duren with them gerin asked two sets of serfs had already answered no to that but the fox put the question again anyhow maybe he thought with what he knew to be irrationality a noble would have noticed something the serfs had not but notker shook his head your son lord he said no i saw him not what then is it war between the woodsrunners and us despite the truce sign by the gods i wish i knew gerin tapped raffo on the shoulder to drive on before notker asked any more questions he couldnt answer toward the middle of the afternoon they passed the boundary stone that had marked the border between gerins holdings and those of his southwestern neighbor capuel the flying frog no one had seen capuel since the werenight gerin sometimes wondered if his ekename had been a clue to a were strain in his family and hed turned toad when all the moons rose full together more likely though the trokmoi had slain him the boundary stone lay on its side these days ruining the charms for peace and prosperity that had been carved into it whether that was cause or effect gerin did not know but capuels former holding knew no peace these days none of his vassals had been able to take any kind of grip on the land the fox held some of it himself trokmoi had overrun a couple of keeps and the rest was given over to banditry the first peasant village the chariot passed was only a ruin some of the houses burned the rest falling to pieces from lack of care some grain grew untended in weedchoked fields but before another generation passed no sign would be left that man had ever lived here captain we may need to stop to hunt toward sunset and i dont mean for the trokmoi van said whos going to sell us a chicken in country like this gerin didnt answer he knew van was right but didnt want to admit it even to himself stopping to slay an animal with whose blood to propitiate the ghosts would make him lose time on diviciacus not gain it the next village was still inhabited but that did the travelers no good only a handful of people remained in what had been a fairsized hamlet when one of them spotted an approaching chariot he let out a yell full of fear and desperation everyonemen women childrenfled from fields and houses into the nearby woods wait gerin shouted i just want to ask you a couple of questions no one paid him any attention he looked helplessly to van the outlander said you ask me captain these poor buggers have got themselves trampled too often lately to take chances when somebody who looks like a warrior comes by no doubt youre right the fox answered sighing doesnt say much for the state the northlands are in does it your serfs dont run from you lord gerin raffo said thats so gerin said but theres more to the northlands than my holdingsand if i took in these lands id do it by war so the peasants here wouldnt get the chance to learn i treat them decently theyd just go on running when they saw me coming raffo didnt answer unless he should be involved in fighting to gain control of land beyond gerins holding it was too remote to matter to him that made him typical not otherwise which saddened gerin he tried to think in larger terms van said youre not the only baronexcuse me captain princethe serfs dont flee what aragis does to the ones who run that he catches makes all the others think three times before they try it hes a hard man gerin agreed harder than need be i think but it may be that hard times require a hard man who can tell for certain do you know what your trouble is captain van said no but i daresay youre going to tell me the fox answered raising that eyebrow of his every so often van found a flaw in him rarely the same one twice the infuriating thing was that more often than not he had a point your trouble captain is that youre so busy trying to understand the other fellows point of view that you dont give enough heed to your own gerin clutched his chest and lurched in the chariot as if pierced by an arrow vans chuckle rumbled deep in his chest that was a hit though and the fox knew it he said understanding the other fellow has its uses too sometimes he may even be right and what does that have to do with the price of tin van said all you really need worry about is that he does what you have in mind are you sure youre not really a trokme after all gerin asked mildly that earned him the glare hed expected the chariot rattled past a burnedout keep perched atop one of the charred logs sat a fat bustard van tapped raffo on the shoulder pointed the driver pulled back on the reins the horses stopped and began to graze van reached for gerins bow i saw the birdwill you let me do the hunting he asked go ahead the fox answered van might think slaying men with the bow an effete way to fight but he was a fine archer nonetheless the outlander strung the bow gerin handed him an arrow he dropped down from the chariot and slid toward the bustard light on his feet as a stalking longtooth the bustard grubbed under its wing for mites van got to within twenty paces before he stood still nocked the shaft drew the bow and let fly the arrow hit the bustard just below where it had been scratching it let out a startled squawk and tried to fly but tumbled off its log into the ditch that had not served to protect the palisade van scrambled in after it when he came out again he carried the bird by the feet and wore an enormous grin well shot gerin said pleased the hunt had been so successfuland so brief blood for the ghosts and supper for us the very thing i was thinking van said before long sunset forced the travelers to a halt gerin and van got out of the chariot and one with sword the other with spear moved cautiously through the woods on either side of the road until gerin came upon a small clearing screened off by trees he hurried back to the dirt track whistled to let van know hed found what he was after youve got a place to keep us away from prying eyes do you the outlander said slipping out from between a couple of oaks despite his bulk he moved so quietly that gerin had not heard him till he spoke indeed i do in my own lands i wasnt much worried about making a fire out where anyone could see it here though it might draw serfs on the run banditswho knows what why take the chance the fox turned to raffo unharness the horses we can lead them back to the clearing too the ways not badly overgrown aye lord gerin raffo freed the animals from the central shaft he and the fox led them away to tether them in the clearing van joined them a few minutes later i dragged the chariot off the road and into the bushes he said it wont be so easy to see now good gerin nodded and if one of the horses goes lame now we know we can hitch you to the shaft in its stead maybe well let the horse ride in your place in the car i thank you captain van said gravely always good to see how you look out for the welfare of them that serve you so it is suspecting hed come off worse in that exchange gerin dug a trench to hold the blood from the bustard van had killed earlier in the afternoon when the bird had bled out he frowned i hope that will be enough he said wed better build the fire bigger than we would have otherwise or well have dreadful dreams all through the night after the sun went down the ghosts did buzz gratefully around the offering the travelers had given them but they rose from it faster than the fox would have liked to see as if they were men getting up from the table still hungry they also braved the light and heat of the fire to gain more vital essence from the cutup chunks of bird gerin van and raffo were roasting the fox drew first watch after he woke raffo for the middle stint he fell asleep almost at once his dreams were dreadful monsters rampaging over the northlands with men in desperate and what looked like losing struggle to drive them back at first in one of those almostconscious moments dreams sometimes have he thought he was harking back to the werenight but he soon realized that was not so these monsters seemed more appalling than mere wild beasts armed with the remnants of human wit that still clung to them when van shook him awake at sunrise he rose with such alacrity that the outlander gave him a curious look and said youre not apt to be so cheerful of a morning bad dreams gerin muttered sliding a foot into a sandal aye i had em too van shook his head all manner of horrid creatures running loosethe gods grant i had a sour stomach or some such to make me see such phantoms in my sleep the fox paused with the sandal strap still unfastened that sounds like the same dream i had he said slowly and i raffo agreed i wouldnt have minded spending more time on watch and less in my blanket and how often do you hear me say something like that they hashed it out over breakfast each recounting what he remembered of his dreams as best gerin could tell they were all the same i dont like that he said the omen is anything but good his fingers shaped a sign to turn aside ill luck the sign worked well enough for small misfortunes whatever misfortune lay ahead he feared it would not be smallwith duren missing it was already large he offered the sign as a man without food in his house will offer a neighbor a stoup of water not much but the best he can do van said if it is an omen we wont be able to escape it whatever it may prove to mean one way or another well get through he seized his spear made a sudden savage thrust as if to dispose of any troublesome foretellings the fox wished he could match his friends confidence van had never found anything even the werenight he couldnt overcome with brawn and bravery gerin trusted his own power less far he said lets get on the road they passed another couple of mostly deserted villages that day and a wrecked keep and about noon the fox saw on a distant hill a building that wasnt quite a keep but was far stronger and more elaborate than anything a serf would need raffo saw it too and scowled blackly if thats not a bandits nest you can call me a shanda nomad thats what it is all right and right out in the open too gerin spat into the dirt of the road to show what he thought of it everythings going to the five hells when bandits set themselves up like barons who do you think the first barons were van said bandits who got rich most likely thats how it was a lot of places anyhow insulting my ancestors are you gerin said id be angrier if i didnt know you were probably right even so one fine day were going to come down here and burn these bandits out before they get the chance to turn into barons were getting close to the lands adiatunnus holds raffo said hes liable not to like that aye he might have in mind to use these buggers whoever they are as a buffer between him and me gerin agreed that he has it in mind though doesnt mean it will happen so the sun had slid more than halfway down toward the west when the chariot clattered up to a new border stone standing by the side of the road the boulder was carved not with elabonian designs or letters but rather with the fylfots and spirals the trokmoi favored in the roadway itself stood a couple of redmustached northerners one with a spear the other with a sword the one with the spear called in lilting elabonian who might you be coming to the lands of the great chief adiatunnus his own self i might be anyone i am gerin the fox gerin answered did adiatunnus liegeman diviciacus pass this way he did that the border guard gave gerin a look more curious than hostile and im after thinking its fair strange fox for you to be after him so have you changed your mind now over the matter anent which diviciacus was sent forth for to talk with you i have not gerin answered at once which made both trokmoi scowl but neither am i at feud with adiatunnus nor with any of his does peace hold between us or not he reached for the bronzeheaded axe in its rest on the side wall of the chariot van hefted his own spear not in a hostile way but thoughtfully as if to find out how heavy it was it certainly made the trokmoi thoughtful the man who had spoken before said sure and youve no need to be fighting us now for all diviciacus ranted and carried on about what a blackhearted spalpeen you were foxthese are his words mind and none o my ownhe said not a whisper of faring forth to fight as i told him i had no quarrel with adiatunnus gerin agreed but tell me thiswhen diviciacus rode through here did he have with him in the chariot a boy of four summers not to put too fine a point on it did he have my son before you answer think on this if you lie we shall be at feud and to the death the two northerners looked at each other this time the one who had the sword replied fox by esus taranis and teutates i swear he did not that was the strongest oath the trokmoi used and one they did not swear lightly the fellow went on if we aimed to go to war with you wed up and do it stealing a child now he spat bad cess to any man whos after trying such a filthy thing aye the other warrior said did one of ours do such to you fox wed hand him back nicely tied and all for you to do with him as you thought best you could make him last days so and wish every moment hed never been born ive two lads and a girl of my own and id use the same way any ogre of a man who so much as ruffled a hair on their heads without my leave his anger and sincerity were unmistakable maybe adiatunnus had set him and his friend here just because they lied so well but gerin couldnt do anything about that not without an army at his back he said i shall believe you but remember what i said if youve not spoken truth och but we have so weve nought to fear the fellow with the sword said i hope you find the bairn safe fox his friend nodded adding since youre apt to be spending the night in the open would you want to buy a hen from us now you probably stole it gerin said without rancor thats what all you trokmoi south of the niffet arejust a bunch of damned chicken thieves indeed and were not the northerner with a spear answered indignantly we came south because you elabonians are after having so many things better and better than chickens to steal since that was nothing but the truth gerin could not even argue with it he tapped raffo on the shoulder his driver slewed the chariot in the narrow roadway and started east back toward castle fox sensible van said this set of woodsrunners seemed friendly enough but well want to put some distance between them and us all the same one of their higherups is liable to decide were worth hunting through the night my thought exactly gerin agreed raffo go by back roads while the day lasts so long as they lead north or east if we stay on the main track i think were asking for trouble aye lord gerin raffo said and then after a moment im sorry we didnt find your son gerin sighed so am i i have to pray that rihwin or drago or widin had better luck than we did he tried not to think about what might be happening to duren too many of the pictures his imagination came up with were black ones we were so sure the trokmoi had run off with him too van said another man might have put that you were so sure like any proper friend the outlander shared responsibility as well as credit well know more when we get back to the castle the fox said wondering how hed keep from going mad till then rihwin the fox spread his hands lord gerin schild stoutstaffs border guards declined to give me leave to pass into their overlords land for whatever it may be worth they say tassilo did enter that holding but that they saw no sign of any small boy with him for whatever it may be worth gerin repeated if he had duren trussed up in the back of the wagon it may be worth nothing at all or on the other hand he gave up shaking his head in frustration and dismay hed hoped hed find answers at fox keep not just more questions but questions seemed in better supply turning to widin simrins son he asked any luck with you widin was a young man but wore his beard long and forked an antique style he shook his head the same as rihwin lord prince aragis borderers say theyd not seen rihwinnor tassilo nor otes eitherbut would not give me leave to enter their lords land drago the bear said as for otes son of engelers lord gerin far as i can tell hes just vanished off the face of the earth no trace of him eastwards thats certain well what happened to him gerin growled but he knew that could have a multitude of answers too the jeweler might have run into bandits he might have been taken ill and laid up at some little peasant village which drago had gone right past or he might have decided not to fare east after all no way to be certain especially now that drago the bear had decided to give up the trail and return to fox keep gerin might have wished for more diligence from him but he d done what he was told which was about what he was good for as if uneasily aware his overlord was dissatisfied with him drago tried to change the subject lord gerin you shouldnt let schild get by with the insolence he shows you these days he bent the knee and set his hands in yours after you slew wolfar but youd never know it by the way he acts he has his nerve he does keeping your vassals off his land when hes properly a vassal his own self in law youre right gerin said trouble is we havent much law north of the high kirs so long as he hasnt warred on me or attacked my lands when i was busy elsewhere ive always had more important things to do than forcing him to heel but when its your son lord prince widin asked softly gerin sighed aye now its my sonnot that tassilo seems to have had him ill send schild a courier with a letter his border guards wont hold back a courier under my orders to take the message to their lord theyd better not anyhow drago said twould be against all polite usage down in the heart of the empire gerin thought drago would have made a perfect man of law he lived in a world where precedent bulked more real and larger than reality that often served him wellit saved him the trouble of thinking which was not his strength anyhow but when he had to confront something new and unusual he might as well have been unarmed rihwin the fox said i hope the mere sending of a letter will not offend schilds ah delicate sensibilities you mean will he get angry because my courier can read and he cant gerin asked rihwin nodded gerin said it shouldnt be a problem schild may not have much in the way of learning but he doesnt hate people who dounlike some i could name some who are my vassals he thought if you did want to make him worry about you captain you could use one of those serfs youve taught their letters van said makes me worry too drago muttered just loud enough to let gerin hear no i try not to let word of that leak out of the holding gerin said the times not ripe not yet still dont know why you started that crazy business anyhow lord widin said why because theres too much ignorance running around loose in the northlands thats why gerin said widin and drago both stared at him in incomprehension van shook his massive head hed known what the fox was up to for years and hadnt complained about it but that didnt mean he approved even rihwin who was himself not only literate but possessed of a formal education better than gerins seemed dubious one of the things of which the serfs remain cheerfully ignorant is their own miserable lot he remarked let them learn to think to reason and they will surely wonder at the justice of an order which keeps them in their huts and the barons who rule them in grand keeps like this one they wonder at that anyhow gerin said the northlands have never been free from peasant revolts and thats only grown worse since the trokmoi came over the niffet but my serfs among them the ones ive taught have stayed loyal where those of other lords rose belike thats sofor now van said but often too it works out that a man whos too hungry and worn to rise up will go on working where even a pack mule would drop dead give that same man a bit of hope now and a full belly and then try to crack the whip on him well youd better have a good place to hide is all i have to tell you gerin clicked his tongue between his teeth that had some truth to it his own reading of history said as much but he answered i have to take the chance if i dont this whole land will slide back into barbarism in two generations time and the only way youll be able to tell elabonians from trokmoi will be by black mustachios in place of red im not ignorant drago said indignantly hearing i am all the bloody time wears thin lord gerin i know how to war and raise horses and keep order in my own holding what else do i need suppose theres a drought and you need magic done to get some rain gerin asked i hire a mage of course where do you suppose the mage learned his art if hes any good at the sorcerers collegium down in the city of elabon but northlands mages cant do that any morewere cut off remember if we want to have another set of mages come along to replace the ones who die we ll just have to find some way to train them ourselves that means reading and writing too you know drago scowled you dont argue fair fox there i must disagree rihwin said lord gerins arguments strike me as logical enoughand logic also seems to me to be a civilized appurtenance worth preserving the question is whether the risks inherent in seeking to make civilized men of serfs outweigh the benefits to be gained from that course if successful gerin abruptly sickened of the dispute a murrain on it he growled the only thing that truly matters now is who has duren and what theyre doing to him i said the same thing before we all set out searching but i hoped wed know something when we came back to fox keep instead here we are sitting along this same cursed table five days later and just as ignorant as the moment we set out rihwin gave him a sidelong glance where chariots rumbling down roadways and men beating bushes fail sorcery might serve i speak purely in the abstract you understand my own abilities along those lines having been raped away by the angry god but the possibility deserves mention it would deserve more mention if i were more of a wizard gerin sighed oh aye you have the right of it and ill try but ive essayed such magics before and never yet found what i was looking for and by the time we can find a proper mage and bring him here the trail will have grown cold attempting a spell while convinced it will fail is the surest way to guarantee such failure rihwin said i know that too but i find optimism hard to come by when i see no good reason for it the fox wished he could cast aside his gloom as rihwin had said he would have been a better wizardthough never a good one he thoughtwithout it but it was as much a part of him as the scar over his left eye just then fand came into the great hall she pointed to rihwin and widin and drago i know they had no luck she said are you after finding your lost boy and him so small and all no gerin said and the one word pressed the weight of defeat and despair more heavily onto his shoulders och the black shame of it to be snatching children fand said she meant it gerin judged but hers was a nature that held the troubles of others in mind for only a little while before returning to her own concerns and fair lonely i was too with both my men off on a sleeveless errand still and all though they might have brought something back with them to make amends for being gone so long she looked hopefully from gerin to van the outlander answered first maybe i should bring my hand across your greedy backside does that seem fair when you think on what we were about when van spoke in that rumbling tone of warning as if he were an earthquake about to happen sensible men walked soft but fand was nothing if not spirited herself she shouted greedy is it to be asking a simple question of you often enough theres a question you ask of me aye and with the understanding my answer had better be yes too or id be sorry for it and you call me greedy a pox take you if a pox did take me where would i likely get it van retorted youve been staying with me too long gerin murmured thats the sort of crack im apt to make fand didnt hear him she let her wrath fall on van you who knows where youd be likely to come by the pox you think i dont know youll cover anything with a slit like a billy goat in the springtime ive more to fear from your wanderings than you from mine go on now tell me im a liar van turned the color of the embers smoldering on the hearth thats the way of a man he sputtered drago rihwin and widin nodded so did gerin though he was less inclined to make a tomcat of himself och i know that fand tossed her head in fine disdain but since it is why blame me for whatd be the fault of your own self gerin worked so hard to choke down laughter that he had a coughing fit van wasnt the only one whod spent a lot of time with him no togawearing sithonian sophist could have done a neater more logical job of punching holes in the outlanders gibe than fand just had van looked his way will you not come to my aid he asked plaintively as if alone on the field and beset by a host i think our lady here was greedy too but as for the rest you got yourself into it and you can get yourself out gerin rose and headed for the stairs as for me im going to see what sort of search spells i can use to try to find my son bass and alto shouts like angry kettledrum and horn followed him up to his library he knew of no greater hoard of books anywhere in the northlands yet he also knew how inadequate the collection was there were hundreds of grimoires for instance but he owned fewer than ten with them he had lekapenos epics a few codices of history a couple on natural philosophy a treatise on horsemanship another on war a school set of sithonian plays many of them crumbs from lekapenos banquetand that was all so much knowledge stored away in volumes he would never see let alone own thinking of his own ignorance saddened him he went through the grimoires one after another looking for a spell that would let him see either who had taken duren or where his son was now he found a fair number of them but had to dismiss most out of hand some were beyond his limited abilities as a mage some required ingredients he could not hope to obtain dried seacow flipper from the greater inner sea for instance and too many needed wine even if it hadnt been unavailable he would have been afraid to use it the last thing he wanted was to attract the angry notice of mavrix i wonder if ale would do he muttered running a finger down the closely written column of a cantrip that looked promising except for prescribing a silver bowl full of wine as the scrying medium a sentence near the end of the spell leaped out at him whereas the aspect of baivers god of barley is dull sodden and soporific whilst that of mavrix lord of the sweet grape to whom the cry of evoii rings out sparkles with wit and intelligence the illadvised operator who seeks to substitute ale for wine will surely have cause to regret his stupidity it was only an idea the fox said as if talking things over with the author of the grimoire that author was a sithonian though the foxs copy was an elabonian translation hed already found several scornful references to the westerners who had conquered and then been all but conquered by the more anciently civilized land and equally short shrift given to other elabonian gods gerin plucked at his beard as he thought substituting butter for olive oil had worked out well enough no matter what this snooty sithonian said using ale in place of wine could also succeed and he was and always had been on good terms with baivers he picked up the grimoire saying ill try it he had a silver bowl it had been at fox keep since his grandfathers day hed been thinking about melting it down along with the rest of the odd bits of silver in the keep and starting his own coinage now he was glad hed never got round to doing that and ale of course was easy to come by he took the bowl and a pitcher of the strongest brew in his cellar out to the shack where he essayed his magics before he began the conjuration he took a while studying the text of the spell making sure he could slip in baivers name and standard epithets for those of mavrix he nodded to himself that ought to work he didnt think hed need to modify any of the mystical passes that accompanied the charm i bless thee baivers god of clear sight and call upon thee lift the darkness of night he intoned and poured the silver bowl half full of golden ale he smiled a little when he thought of that mixing gold and silver even symbolically ought to make the spell work better as often happened the sound of his chanting drew rihwin who stood in the doorway to see what he was up to gerin nodded to him and set a finger to his lips to enjoin silence rihwin nodded back he knew a man working magic did not need and sometimes could not tolerate distraction again the wizard who had written the grimoire made the operator perform the more difficult passes with his left hand again gerin gratefully accepted that because it made the spell easier for him soon he thought the ale would turn clear as crystal and he would be rewarded with a glimpse of durens face or at least of his surroundings he caught himself yawning in the middle of the spell whats wrong he thought he couldnt say it aloud he was in the middle of the chant as if from very far away he watched his sorcerous passes grow languid listened to his voice turn fuzzy lord prince lord gerin with a great effort the fox opened his eyes anxious faces crowding close blocked light from the smoking torches that lit the great hall gerins eyebrows came down and togetherlast he remembered he hadnt been in the great hall and torchlighting was hours away what happened he croaked he discovered he was lying in the rushes on the floor when he tried to sit up he felt as if hed forgotten how to use half his muscles among the faces peering down at him was rihwins would that you could tell us lord gerin the southerner answered you fell asleep or perhaps your spirit left your bodyhowever you would have itin the middle of the spell you were using weve tried from that time to this to rouse you but to no avail till now aye thats the way of it drago agreed we didnt know what in the five hells to do nextstick your foot in the fire maybe im glad it didnt come to that gerin said from rihwin the suggestion might have been a joke drago though had neither the wit nor the temperament for jokes when he said something he meant it that odd unstrung feeling was fading gerin managed to get to his feet van ever practical gave him a jack of ale its not enchanted captain but its pretty good he said gerin gulped down half the jack before he choked and spluttered thats it he said thats what went wrong this time the chap who wrote the grimoire was smarter than i am he warned that baivers influence on the spell was soporific and thats just what he meant the elabonian pantheon is so dismayingly stodgy rihwin said like many of his educated countrymen he preferred the sithonian gods to those native to elabon but van said honh remember how much joy you had of mavrix rihwin flinched but was honest enough with himself to nod acknowledging the justice of the hit never mind any of that gerin said his wits were beginning to work more clearly again and his body to seem as if it might be fully answerable to him after all ive learned something from this escapade which may in the long run make it worthwhile whats that van asked a beat ahead of the rest that whatever magic i can do isnt going to let me find my son and find him i will gerin counted stubbornness a virtue if you kept hitting at a problem sooner or later it was likely to fall down he went on using ale for wine in the spell might have knocked me out but by dyaus there are eyes that never sleep not by dyaus drago said by biton you mean or do i mistake you no you have the right of it gerin said ill fare forth to the sibyl at ikos her verse will tell me what i need to know he hesitated then added if i can understand it of course iii after the empire of elabon conquered the land between the high kirs and the niffet the elabonians pushed an allweather highway the elabon way north from the town of cassat to the river so they would always be able to move troops against invaders or rebels no large numbers of imperial troops had been seen in the northlands for generations before elabon severed itself from its province north of the kirs but the highway remained far and away the best land link the northlands boasted even barons who did little else maintained the stretch of the elabon way that ran through their territory if for no other reason than to make sure they collected tolls from travelers along the road hard on the horses hooves van remarked as the wagon rumbled onto the flagpaved roadbed so it is gerin said nothing to be done about it though unless you want to throw away the road whenever it rains for more than two days straight getting a wagon through hubdeep mud isnt much fun cant argue with that van agreed still we dont want the animals lamed or stonebruised either no well we wont push them hard not when its a five days run to ikos gerin said as a matter of fact the horses arent what worries me most you always have something to worry aboutyoud be worried if you didnt van said what is it this time ricolf the reds would be a logical place to stop for the third night the fox answered or it would have been the logical place his voice trailed away if ricolf werent elises father if elise hadnt up and left you van finished for him aye that does complicate your life doesnt it you might say so gerin agreed dryly ricolfs not my vassal when elise was with me there seemed no need and afterwards i hadnt the crust to ask it of him nor has he ever sought my protection hes done well enough on his own when elise was with me i had a claim on his keep once he died now that shes gone i suppose duren is the rightful heir shes ricolfs only legitimate child and none of his bastard sons lived which means duren is ricolfs only grandson too van said he ll need to know about the boy disappearing or let me put it another wayhed have cause to quarrel with you if you rode by without saying so much as a word gerin sighed i hadnt thought about it quite like that but i fear youre right im his guestfriend from years gone by but itll be bloody awkward just the same he thinks elise never would have run off if id done dyaus if id known what i should have done id have done it he wont think better of me for letting duren be kidnapped either captain you feel bad enough about that all by yourselfyou wont hardly notice anyone else piling on a little more only you would think of making me feel better by reminding me how bad i feel now the method was gerin admitted to himself nicely calculated to suit his own gloomy nature sitting beside him on the wagons bench van stretched and looked about with an almost childlike delight good to be out on the road again he said fox keeps all very well but i like having new things to see every minute or every bend in the roadnot that the elabon way had many bends in it but you take my meaning so i do the fox looked eastward quickmoving tiwaz now a day past first quarter had raced close to nothos whose pale gibbous disk was just rising over the treecovered hills he shook his head just as tiwaz gained on nothos so troubles seemed to gain on him with every day that passed and his own pace was too slow to escape them theres a pleasant thought van said when he spoke his conceit aloud tell you what fox instead of sleeping in the open tonight what say we rest at the next serf village we come upon theyll have ale there and youll be better for drinking yourself drunk and starting off tomorrow with a head that thumps like a drum then at least youll know what ails you i know what ails me now gerin said durens missing what i dont know is what to do about it and that eats at me as much as his being gone nevertheless he went on reflectively headman at the next village south is tervagant beekeeper his ale doesnt have the worst name in the lands i hold van slapped him on the back nearly hard enough to tumble him out of the wagon the very thing trust me captain youll be better for a good carouse thats what rihwin thought and he ended up with his robe round his ears and his pecker flapping in the breeze even so the fox reined in when they rolled up to tervagants village the headman a nervous little fellow who kept kneading the front of his tunic with both hands as if it were bread dough greeted the arrival of his overlord with illconcealed alarm wwhat brings you so far south llord prince he asked my sons been stolen gerin answered flatly tervagants eyes widened the news the fox saw had not reached the village till this moment he set it forth for the headman and the crowd of listenersmostly women and children for the men still labored in the fieldswho gathered round the wagon lord prince i pray the gods give you back your boy tervagant said everyone else echoed his words noble and peasant shared the anguish a missing child brought the headmans hands fell away from his tunic his face which had been pasty gained color another one whos glad im not looking into his affairs gerin thought he wondered just how many village headmen had little schemes of their own in play one of these days hed have to try to find out not today though tervagant ducked into his hut came out with a ramshorn trumpet he glanced at gerin for permission before he raised it to his lips the fox nodded tervagant blew a long unmusical blast some of the peasants looked up from their work in surprise the sun was low in the west but not yet brushing the horizon the men came in happily enough though shall we kill a pig lord prince the headman asked aye if you can without hurting yourselves gerin answered the thought of fatrich pork made spit rush into his mouth he added the blood from the beast will give the ghosts what they want too some of the blood tervagant corrected thriftily the rest we ll make into blood pudding in good times serfs lived close to the edge in bad times theyand the nobles they supportedfell over it they could afford to waste nothing the pig like any other was half wild with a ridge of hair down its back tervagant lured it to him with a turnip then cut its throat he had to spring back to keep it from tearing him with its tushes blood sprayed every which way as the beast ran through the village until it fell over and lay kicking thatll keep the ghosts happier than if the blood went into a nice neat trench van said the fire the villagers made was big enough to hold a fair number of ghosts away by itself they butchered the pig baked some of it in clay and roasted the rest living up to his ekename tervagant went into his hut came out with a pot full of honey and glazed some of the cooking meat with it the delicious aroma made gerin hungrier than he had been before along with bread ale and berries preserved in more of tervagant s honey the pork proved as good as it smelled a sizable pile of rib bones lay in front of gerin when he thumped his belly and pronounced himself full van had found a pointed rock and was cracking a leg bone to get at the marrow more ale lord prince one of the peasant women asked thank you he held out the cup theyd given him she smiled as she filled it for him she was he noticed not badlooking with light eyes that told of a trokme or two in the woodpile she wore her hair long and unbraided which meant she was unmarried yet she was no giggling maid when he asked her about that her face clouded i had a husband lord prince youre right i did but he died of lockjaw year before last im sorry gerin said and meant ithed seen lockjaw thats a hard way to go aye lord prince it is but you have to go on she said he nodded solemnly hed had quite a bit of ale by then whats your name he asked her ethelinda lord prince well ethelinda he said and let it hang there now she nodded as if hed spoken a complete sentence after supper tervagant waved gerin and van into a couple of huts whose inhabitants had hastily vacated them the gods grant you good night lord prince master van he said me i intend to give the gods some help van said while hed been sitting by the fire and eating a couple of young women had almost come to blows over him now he led both of them into the hut tervagant had given him watching that gerin shook his head too bad no one could find a way to put into a jar whatever the outlander had and yet the fox was not altogether surprised to find ethelinda at his elbow when he went into the hut the headman had set aside for him youve no new sweetheart he asked her some lords took peasant women without thinking past their own pleasure along with hunger though that was the sort of thing liable to touch off an uprising as usual gerin was careful but ethelinda shook her head no lord prince good gerin had to duck his head to get into the hut it was dark inside and smelled strongly of smoke he shuffled in found a strawfilled pallet with his foot here we are the straw rustled as he sank down onto it then again when ethelinda joined him there she pulled her long tunic off over her head that was all she wore gerin took a little longer getting out of his clothes but not much by the way she clung to him he guessed shed been telling the truth about having no sweetheart he didnt think anyone had touched her so for a long time that made him take care to give her as much pleasure as he could and at the last moment he pulled out and spurted his seed onto her belly rather than deep inside her he thought he would make her grateful but she said what did you go and do that for in anything but a happy voice to keep you from making a baby he answered wondering if shed made the connection between what theyd just done and what might happen most of a year later every time he thought he had the measure of serfs ignorance he ended up being startled anew ethelinda knew that connection though i wanted to start a baby she said i hoped i would you did gerin rolled off her and almost fell off the narrow pallet why if i was carrying your baby i could go up to fox keep and youd take care of me she answered i wouldnt have to work hard at least for a while oh gerin stared through the darkness at her she was honest anyhow and he admitted to himself she was probably right no woman had ever claimed hed put a bastard in her he was moderate in his venery and to keep such things from happening often withdrew at the instant he spent but he would not have turned away anyone with whom hed slept maybe you shouldnt have pulled out the darker side of him murmured with duren gone youre liable to need an heir even if he is a bastard he shook his head sometimes he got trapped in his own gloom and lost track of what needed doing he couldnt let that happen not now his son depended on him ethelinda sat up and reached for her tunic do you want me to go away lord prince she asked well be crowded on this bed but stay if you care to gerin answered the nights not so warm that wed be sticking to each other wherever we touched thats so she agreed i always did like having somebody in a bed with me thats how i grew up with all my brothers and sisters and my father and my mother while she was alive all packed tight together sleeping just by yourself is lonely she tossed the tunic to the dirt floor and besides who knows what might happen later on what happened was that gerin slept the night through and didnt wake up till after sunrise when ethelinda rose from the pallet and finally did put her tunic back on when she saw his eyes open she gave him a scornful glance as if to say some stallion you turned out to be he bore up under that without getting upset unlike van he didnt wear some of his vanity in his trousers he looked around the peasant hut for a chamber pot when he didnt see one he got up dressed quickly and went off into the bushes by the village to relieve himself the reek that rose from those bushes said he was but following the peasants practice when he came back van was standing outside the hut hed been given tweedling away on his flute the two women whod gone in there with him both clung to him adoringly his grin was smug the fox felt like throwing something at him but contented himself with saying time we got moving we can eat as we travel as you will van walked over to the horses which were tethered to the low branches of a maple you harness the leader then and i ll see to the off beast youre so hot to be on the road the two of us togetherll get us on our way in a hurry that afternoon the wagon rolled into the holding of palin the eagle palin who had trokmoi on his western flank acknowledged gerin as his suzerain and because hed needed the foxs help more than once against the woodsrunners was more sincere about his submission than schild stoutstaff not far into palins land gerin and van came upon a belt of devastation for several miles the elabon way and the land to either side of it had been cratered by balamungs destructive sorcery now that weeds and shrubs had had five years to spread over the craters they looked less raw and hideous than they had when they were new but the ground remained too broken for farmers to work the elabon way itself was in fair repair that was at gerins order he did not want the main road south from fox keep to remain a ruin the repairs he knew did not come up to the standard the elabonian empire had set when it pushed the highway north to the niffet with the resources of a realm behind them the imperial artisans had built to last with a deep bed of gravel and stone stone flags cemented together and good drainage to either side of the roadway with peasant levies working in time snatched from their fields the fox hadnt had a prayer of matching such construction cobblestones and gravel did give the rebuilt stretch of the elabon way a surface that while it was hard on hooves did not turn into gluey mud whenever rain fell strange gerin said as the wagon jounced along over the uneven surface whenever i travel this stretch of road i remember trying to fight my way north over it just before the werenight youre not likely to forget that van agreed me i find it strange to travel the same stretch of road more than once im too used to seeing something new every day to be easy with the idea of going back and forth back and forth boring to see the same hills on the skyline every day i want to find out whats on the other side of them those hills gerin pointed west they shelter trokmoi and bandits not what i meant van said captain youve no poetry in you and thats a fact i suppose not i do the best i can without it thats all toward evening they passed the keep of raff the ready where theyd guested on their last trip south to ikos no guesting at raffs tonight the keep had fallen to the trokmoi and nothing but tumbled ruins remained gerin shook his head remembering the fine meal raff had fed him tonight it would be hard bread and sausage and sour beer and whatever they managed to hunt up to keep the ghosts happy a red fox scurried across the road in front of the wagon it paused by a clump of houndstongue sitting up on its haunches with its own tongue lolling out as it watched the horses and men van tapped gerin on the shoulder rein in let me grab the bow and well have our evenings offering what where gerin said van pointed to the fox right there are you blind not to see it gerin stared first at the fox then at his friend youre enough like a brother to me that i often forget youre not elabonian born its not our custom to kill the animals that give us our ekenames all my luck such as it is would run away if i tried to slay a fox you wouldnt van said i would id be abetting you gerin shook his head in the spirit world it would count for the other the spirit world will do more than count if we dont find something with blood in it pretty soon van grumbled looks like all the peasants hereabout have fled and a night in the open with only a fire to hold the ghosts at bay is nothing to look forward to something will turn up gerin sounded more confident than he felt but hardly more than a minute after hed spoken he spotted a big fat gray squirrel sitting on the topmost branch of an oak sapling that really should have been cleared away from the side of the road now he did rein in van had seen the squirrel too he was already reaching into the back of the wagon for the bow the bowstring thrummed as he let fly the squirrel toppled out of the little tree and lay feebly kicking on the mossy ground below it had stopped moving by the time van walked over and picked it up he hefted it in his hand it should serve he said not a whole lot of meat but what there is will be tasty baked in clay gerin said if youd shot at the fox the gods might not have put the squirrel in our path if theyre so grateful for me being good why didnt they put a nice fat buck in that tree instead of a rat with a fuzzy tail that wont give us two good bites apiece abandoned scoffer gerin said though he had to fight to get words past the laughter that welled up when he pictured an antlered stag perched atop a sapling show some respect for the gods of elabon i give them as much as they deserve and not a bit more van said ive done enough traveling seen enough gods to know theyre stronger than i am but ill be switched if i can see that some of em are a whole lot smarter than i am gerin grunted remembering mavrixs long pink tongue flicking out like a frog as the deity had mocked him and taken away rihwins sorcerous ability you may have something there though youll not be happier for it if some god hears what youve said ifsobe that happens ill just go on to someplace else where the writ of elabonian gods doesnt run van said the thing about gods is theyre tied to the lands of those that worship them and mehe thumped his chestim not just like you to be so sure youd get away gerin said but then something else occurred to him gods can travel though as their worshipers dolook at the way the sithonian deities have taken hold in elabon and i fear well have trokme gods rooting themselves here in the northlands now that the woodsrunners have made homes south of the niffet youre likely right i hadnt thought of that van said not a crew id be happy with as neighbors their yen for blood is as bad as the one the trokmoi have themselves i should know the woodsrunners were all set to offer me up till i got free of them yes youve told that tale gerin said he shook his head one more thing to worry about trouble was he seemed to add to that list almost every day he halted the wagon as long as he and van had an offering for the ghosts for tonight he wouldnt worry about any of the things on that list till tomorrow splitting the night into two watches rather than three left the fox and van yawning as they started traveling a little past sunrise im slower than i should be and thats not good gerin said when we cross bevon brokennoses holding well need all our wits about us bevon brokenland would be a better name for him thats certain van said cant argue with you there gerin replied bevons sons had been squabbling over their fathers holding five years before bevon himself was still alive but universally ignored beyond a bowshot from his keep gerin pointed ahead there we are thats progress if you like your fort you mean aye i expect so its about the only thing that keeps the elabon way open through bevons lands anyhow despite a wooden palisade the building wasnt a keep in the proper sense of the word no stone castle sat inside the wall only a blockhouse also of wood gerin had run up the fort and put a garrison in it less than a year after the werenight to make sure the road stayed clear bevon and all four of his sons had protested furiously but couldnt unite even to get rid of the foxs men one day soon captain youll just quietly claim the land along the road as part of your own holding wont you van said without your patrols itd be the howling wilderness it was before you put your men hereand its like you to let the facts talk before you open your mouth yourself that has been in my mind lately as a matter of fact gerin gave his friend a look half respectful half annoyed i like it better when no one else can pick out whats in my mind live in a keep for a while with a man and he will rub off on you van added however much he doesnt care to in the hopewhich was realizedof making gerin scowl a threechariot patrol team came north up the elabon way toward the fort seeing the wagon they made for it instead to see who was on the road gerin waved to one of the men in the lead car hail he called loudly how fares the road onsumer lord gerin the bulky blackbearded man called back i thought that was your wagon though im just now close enough to be sure we had a quiet run down to ricolfs border and back so the road is well enough his face clouded but what of you is this the business widin simrins son spoke of my son being stolen you mean yes gerin said all my searches went awry those after the men who might have taken him and the one round fox keep as well im off to ikos to learn if the sibyl can see farther than i did dyaus and biton grant it be so onsumer said the driver and warrior who shared the car with him nodded vigorously i can but hope gerin said widin told me he learned nothing new on his run down here have you had word of anything unusual from bevons sons one of them i suppose could have arranged to kidnap duren though id not have thought any of them had the wit to plan such a thing onsumer shook his head no lord gerin nothing of the sort i think the lot of them are too busy trying to slaughter one another to worry about outsiders even ones they hate we havent had an attack on the fort in close to a year but the strife among the brothers never ends youre probably right gerin said all the barons in the northlands squabbled among themselves and didnt pay heed to the trokmoi till it was too late i wonder if we elabonians learned the joys of faction fighting from sithonia i wouldnt have the faintest idea about that onsumer said he was a good enough soldier and far from stupid but all he knew of the wider world hed heard in minstrels songs he got the horses moving again good luck to you onsumer called as the wagon rolled by his comrades waved to gerin then they turned around and headed back toward the fort an hour or so later van pointed to a column of black smoke rising in the distance somebodys burning his neighbor out there or i miss my guess better they battle each other than my men gerin said but better still if they didnt battle at all honh what are the odds of that on the face of it not good gerin admitted still it used to happen elabon not so long ago was a single empire stretching from the niffet east past the lesser inner sea into the seething river plains of kizzuwatna now its falling apart when the emperor and his court think more of putting gold in their own belt pouches now than worrying about where the empire will be a generation hence that happens its not just the ones at the top van said its everyone who s strong out to get rich off the ones who arent and to put a fist in his strong neighbors eye aye thats the way of it gerin said in the early days they say elabonian warlords would go back to the plow once theyd won a war he grinned wryly of course who knows what tales of those early days are worth near the southern edge of bevons unhappy holding lay another belt of devastation from balamungs sorcery as before the wagon bounced roughly over the equally rough repairs gerin had had the local peasants make van said remember how bevons sons tried to stop you from fixing the road each of them screaming hed do it himself oh yes the foxs laugh was less than mirthful and if id waited for that id be waiting still and so would durens grandson when gerin had come into ricolf the reds holding five years before only a couple of guards kept watch at the border now a fort like the one hed built on bevons land stood strong to keep out banditsand perhaps to keep out his own men as well the thought saddened him a guardsman strode out from the open gateway of the fort to ask his business the fellow started slightly when he recognized gerin and van gerin started slightly too he had no idea what this warriors name was but hed been at the border on that other journey too the fox remembered those first days when hed known elise and snuck her out of her fathers keep as vividly as if they were just past now that only ashes lay between him and her he often wished he could forget somehow that only made him remember more intensely lord prince ricolfs man said his voice polite but wary what brings you to the holding of ricolf the red is it the matter your vassalwhat was his namespoke of some days past widin simrins son gerin supplied yes it has to do with my sonricolfs grandson weve had no luck finding himim for the sibyl at ikos to see if biton will grant her sight of where the boy might be may it prove so the guard said since its but you and your comrade here and no host in arms behind you pass on lord prince no host in arms behind me gerin said angrily does ricolf look for one ive no quarrel with him but i may by dyaus if he keeps thinking that way you had no quarrel with bevon either yet your men stay on his land against his will we dont want that happening here ricolf ought to get down on his knees and thank me for that gerin ground out if my men didnt keep order along the elabon way youd have more trouble spilling into this holding than you dream of but ricolf keeps his own house quiet and needs no help from me just pass on the guard said gerin flicked the reins so violently the horses sprang forward with startled snorts van said a good thing were away i thought you were going to jump down and murder that fellow for a counterfeit copper i would have gerin rubbed at the scar over his eye he was sure it was white now it always went dead pale when he got furious worst of it is the fools only echoing what ricolf says would you sooner we didnt stop of ricolfs holding then van asked now that you mention it yes but the fox sighed has to be done thoughas you say durens his grandson after all i expect i ll get through it i wouldnt show my face in his holding if i thought he seriously meant me harmnot without that host in arms behind me anyhow the gods grant it doesnt come to that yes gerin wasnt thinking of the gods alone if he ever did have to take on ricolf his former fatherinlaw was only too likely to call on aragis the archer for aid having aragis extend his power northward was the last thing gerin wanted for that reason as well as for durens sake hed speak softly to the older baron so he told himself anyhow the sun tinged the western sky with colors like the belly of a salmon gerin imagined he felt the ghosts stir though they would not truly emerge until after sunset and from the castle ahead came a boy s cry from the watchtower who comes to the holding of ricolf the red all was so much as it had been five years before that the hair on gerins arms tried to prickle up he felt himself caught in time like an insect in the sticky sap of a pine tree insects so stuck rarely got loose the fox knew the trouble here lay in his own mind but knowing did little to help him get free either he shouted back toward the keep giving his own name and vansjust as he had then but then ricolf had been eager to let him in theyd become friends on gerins earlier journeys south now who could say what ricolf thought now whatever it was the drawbridge lowered thick bronze chains rattling and squealing over the spokes of the winch as the gate crew turned it the horses hooves drummed like thunder when they walked across the timbers over the moat water plants added touches of green there but the smell said that ricolfs men used the barrier to empty their slop jars ricolf the red stood in the bailey near the gate waiting to greet gerin he was a broadshouldered thickbellied man heading toward sixty his manner still vigorous and his hair still thick though now mostly white rather than the trokmelike shade that had given him his sobriquet when he opened his mouth to speak gerin saw hed lost a front tooth since the last time theyd met guestfriendship is a sacred trust ricolf said his deep voice younger than his years with that trust in mind i greet you fox and you also van of the strong arm use my keep as your own while you stay here you are gracious as always gerin said ricolf hadnt sounded particularly gracious he sounded more like a man doing a duty he didnt much care for gerin thought more of him for that not less sometimes his own sense of duty was all that kept him going pah this for graciousness ricolf kicked at the dirt i hear somethings amiss with my grandson and i want to know everything there is to know about it first elise now duren he shook his big hardfeatured head i wasnt the luckiest man born to link my family to you thats not what you thought when you gave me your daughter gerin answered as steadily as he could as always anger and longing surged in him when elise came to the front of his mind he went on the gods know i am not a perfect man will you entertain the notion that elise may not have been a perfect woman the notion does not entertain me ricolf kicked at the dirt again well well speak of that later whats your pleasure for supper we killed a sheep this afternoon so theres mutton or we can chop a couple of hens down to size if the two of you would rather mutton gerin and van said in the same breath the fox added weve been traveling a good deal these past few days and mostly supping on the fowls weve killed as bloodofferings for the ghosts thought as much ricolf answered but i figured i owed you the choice he was indeed meticulous in observing the rituals of guestfriendship inside ricolfs great hall fatwrapped bones smoked on dyaus altar at the cookfire servants roasted ribs and chops a big bronze pot boiled busily above it van stabbed a finger toward it thatll be the tongue and tripe the lungs and lights he asked aye ricolf said which of the dainties do you care for most the tongue the outlander answered at once have you got any rock salt to scatter on it i do that ricolf answered a trokme turn of phrase he probably would not have used before he got woodsrunners for neighbors the holding has several good licks one of them near big enough to mine salt from had ricolfs holding been gerins he suspected he would have mined salt and sold it to his neighbors the only concern ricolf had beyond his own borders was foes who might come at him past that he was content with his land as he found it gerin wondered if he himself would ever be content with anything bread and ale and meat distracted him from such worries he gnawed roasted mutton from ribs then tossed them to the dogs tripe was slippery and gluey under his knife chewy in his mouth the kidneys strong smell cut through the smoke that filled the hall and foretold their flavor he stuffed himself full but van outdid him ricolf watched the outlander with awe tinged by alarm he said dyaus id forgotten how you put it away you could eat a man out of his barony theres a deal of me to keep fed van replied with dignity would you pass me the pitcher of ale ah thank you youre very kind he poured from the pitcher into a delicately carved rhyton part of the great stock of southron goods ricolf had laid on to impress the band of suitors for elises hand elise was gone the drinking horns the even more elaborately carved bathtub and other such things remained and probably lacerated ricolfs spirit whenever he saw or used them van poured the horn of ale down his throat hardly seeming to swallow he filled it again drained it with the same ease by the look ricolf gave him the older man expected him to slide under the table at any moment instead he got up and spoke softly to one of the young women whod fetched food gerin listened to her giggle and was not surprised when a little later she and the outlander went upstairs together the fox wished he could have gone upstairs too even alone but ricolfs eyes held him the whitehaired baron said your harvests must have been good in spite of everything or youd not be able to afford to keep him around i dont begrudge him his appetites gerin answered not any of them the rest of his spirit is in proportion as may be as may be but van was not what ricolf wanted to talk about and gerin knew it ricolf stared down at his own drinking horn for a while before he went on well fox what in the five hells happened with duren you mean youve heard everything i know about that gerin answered someone snatched the boy and when i find out who he was hell be sorry for the day his father woke up with a stiff one in his breeches oh no doubt ricolf drank smacked his lips brought his fist down onto the table youll track the whoreson down and make him pay youre bloody good at all that sort of thing prince of the north these days are you ill not deny youve earned the title you hold more landor control it which amounts to the same thinkthan anyone else in the northlands save maybe aragis and one or two of the cursed trokmoi and you run it better too youre generous the fox also took a pull at his ale he could feel it buzzing inside his head maybe that was what made him burst out i wish i were shut of the whole business and just left to be what id like so do we all ricolf said but you do it well like it or no which brings me to what id truly learn how was it you didnt do as well by elise gerin wished he were drunk enough to fall asleepor a good enough mime to pretend he was that drunk but he wasnt not either oneand he knew he owed ricolf an answer he drank some more as much to give himself time to think as for any other reason ricolf waited patient and stubbornly unmoving as a boulder i suppose part of it was that her life at fox keep wasnt as different as shed hoped from what she had here gerin said slowly he snorted air out through his nose wherever elise was now shed surely found a different life whether it was better was a different question altogether go on ricolf said you know what the first flush of passion is like gerin said it masks everything bad or even boring about whomever it lights on after a while though you can wake up and realize this isnt what you had in mind isuppose thats what elise did none of it your fault eh ricolfs rumbling baritone flung sarcasm as a catapult flung stones i didnt say that gerin answered looking back i guess i took a lot for granted i figured everything was all right because she didnt complain out loudand ive always been one who doesnt necessarily expect things to be perfect all the time so i didnt worry so much when they werent i think perhaps elise did after we fell in love and when things got rocky they looked worse to her than maybe they really were if id realized that sooner oh who knows what id have done ricolf chewed on that with the air of a man finding something on his plate other than what hed expected now he drank and thought a while before he spoke i respect that knack you have fox for looking at yourself and talking about yourself as if you were someone else not many can do it for this i thank you gerin said dont ricolf held up a bigknuckled hand the trouble with you is you dont know how to do anything but stand back from yourself and from everybody around you you talked about how my daughter might have felt after passion cooled but what about you did you go back into that keep inside your head the one you mostly live in you shame me gerin said quietly why for asking a question no because the answer is so likely to be yes and you know it very well if sarcasm had stung truth cut like a knife the more so for being unexpected ricolf yawned im getting old to sit around drinking half the night he said come to that im getting old for anything else too only a handful of serfs on this holding who were born before i was one winter not so far from now lung sickness will get me or ill fall over with an apoplexy that wouldnt be too badquick anyhow youre strong yet gerin said alarmed for his host few men spoke so openly of death lest a god be listening if you do go out youll go fighting that could happen too ricolf said im not as fast nor as strong as i was and theres plenty of fighting around and what becomes of the holding then id hoped to last long enough to pass it on to duren but now aye but now gerin echoed if ricolf died heirless his vassal barons would brawl over the holding just as bevons sons had been doing for so long further north and ricolfs neighbors would be drawn in aragis coming up from the south the trokmoi from the west perhaps biting off a chunk and the fox did not see how he could stand aloof he even had a claim of sorts to the barony as if picking that from his head ricolf said aye a couple of my vassals might think well of you because you were wed to elise more of em though are likely to think less of you because she ran off and if she ever came back here wed to a man with a fighting tail of his own gerin upended his drinking horn poured the last draft down his throat that thought or rather nightmare had crossed is mind too most often of nights when he was having trouble sleeping he said i have no notion how likely that is nor what id do if it happened a lot would depend on who and what the fellow was on whether you thought you could use him you mean ricolf spoke without rancor he drained his own rhyton then pushed to his feet im going up to bed do you want to come along so i can show you the chamber ive set aside for you the keeps not packed with suitors now i dont have to give you one of the little rooms down here off the kitchens ill come gerin said and rose too ricolf carried a lamp as they went up the stairs he didnt say anything the fox counted that something of a minor triumph hed been dreading this interview since the day elise left him and he seemed to have got through it ricolf opened a door as gerin walked through it into the little bedchamber the lamplight revealed the older man asked quietly do you miss her another knife in the night gerin said yes now and then quite a lot sometimes he stepped into the room and shut the door before ricolf could stab him with any more questions south of ricolfs holding the land grew debatable once more gerin and van traveled in armor the fox keeping his bow ready to hand the elabon way seemed all but deserted that suited gerin fine the fewer people he saw the fewer people who saw him he knew too well how vulnerable the wagon was to a goodsized band of raiders the roads that ran into the elabon way from east and west were dirt tracks like the ones up in the foxs holding pieces of the elabon way were just dirt here too peasants had prised up the paving stones for the houses and maybe barons for their keeps too that hadnt been so the last time gerin visited ikos five years before he said taking stones from the roadway used to be a crime that would cost a man his head or put him up on a cross a good law if you ask me roads are a lands lifeblood no law left up here but what comes from the edge of a sword van said most lands are like that when you get down to it south of the high kirs elabon isnt or wasnt gerin said law counted for more than might there for a lot of years it was even true here for a while no more though youre not wrong about that they rolled slowly past another connecting road at the crossroads stood a granite boulder carved with pictures showing where the road led a crude keep surrounded by farms and horses thats not the one we want eh captain van said no were looking for an eye with wingsthats bitons mark we re not far enough south to come to it yet i dont think i hope it will still be there some of the crossroads stones i thought i remembered from my last trip to the sibyl arent here any more you were paying attention to stones van shook his head in disbelief far as i could see you were so busy panting over elise you didnt have eyes for anything else thank you my friend i needed that just now i truly did gerin said the visit with ricolf had left him glum enough if van was going to rub salt in the wounds theyd sting even worse but van perhaps mercifully kept quiet after that like gerins his eyes went back and forth back and forth every time the wagon went by a clump of bushes or some elm saplings growing closer to the road than they should have he shifted the reins to his left hand so he could grab his spear in a hurry if he needed it the fox soon became certain some crossroads stones were missing he and van rolled past a hollow in the ground that showed where one had recently been removedso recently the grass hadnt filled in all the bare dirt someones losing trade on account of that he said sadly i wonder if he even knows about halfway between noon and sunset gerin spied the winged eye he sought id have guessed itd be there van said you steal it youre fooling with a god and what man with a dram of sense does that how many men have sense gerin returned which made his comrade grunt he added not only that how many are wise enough to realize theyre stealing from biton and not just from some petty lordlet they dont know beforehand theyll find out pretty soon van said which was likely enough to be true that gerin had to nod the farseeing god looked after what was his the wagon swung east down the road that led to the sibyl and her fane gerin remembered the lands away from the elabon way as poorer than the baronies along the main northsouth route they didnt seem so now that wasnt because theyd grown richer rather the holdings along the chief highway had suffered more from the trokmoi and from the nobles squabbles among themselves when elabon conquered and held the northlands the road that bore the empires name had also been one of the chief routes along which colonists had settled farther from the elabon way the folk native to the land were more in evidence they were dark like elabonians but slimmer and more angular their faces full of forehead and cheekbones old customs lingered away from the highway too lords castles grew scarce most of the peasant villages held freeholders men who owed no part of their crop to a baron gerin wondered how theyd fared when trokme raiders swooped down on them they had no lords to ride to their defense either the freeholders measured him and van with their eyes when the travelers paused in a village to buy a hen before evening caught them youre for the sibyl then asked the man who sold it to them his elabonian had a curious flavor to it not quite an accent but oldfashioned as if currents of speech had swept up the elabon way too but never reached this little hamlet that we are gerin answered youve rich gear the peasant observed be you nobles van spoke first me im just a warrior anyone who tries taking this corselet off my back will find out what kind of warrior i am and wont be happier for knowing either i can take care of myself too gerin said peasants without lords had to defend themselves which meant they needed weapons and armor robbing people who already had them seemed a likely way to acquire such if that was in the peasants mind he didnt let on but then he wouldnt gerin thought he said aye the both of you have that look go on then and the gods watch over you through the night as soon as they were out of earshot gerin spoke to van who was driving put as much space between that village and us as you can if you find a side road just before sunset go up it or down it a ways well want to camp where we can hide our nightfire right you are van said id have done the same thing without your saying a word mind but im glad you have the same thoughts in mind as i do on your watch sleep with your bow your sword and your shield and helm where you can grab them in a hurry if i thought i could id sleep in armor tonight the fox said van grunted out a short burst of laughter and nodded they traveled until the ghosts began to wail in their ears then setting his jaw gerin sacrificed the hen to calm the spirits a boulder shielded the light of the fire from the little track down which they traveled to get off the main road to ikos gerin had the first watch nothos and tiwaz stood close together low in the east at sunset both were approaching full though swiftmoving tiwaz would reach it a couple of days sooner than nothos math would not rise until almost halfway through his watch and van alone could commune with elleb for the ruddy moon would stay below the horizon till after midnight the fox moved as far away from the fire and the bloodfilled trench near it as the ghosts would allow he wanted to be sure he could spot trouble coming down the road from the village where hed bought the chicken his bow was strung his quiver on his back and ready for him to reach over his shoulder and pull out a bronzetipped shaft sure enough just about the time when golden math began peeping through the leaves of the trees he heard men coming along the road from the west they werent trying very hard to keep quiet they chattered among themselves as they ambled eastward they all carried torches he saw when they came to the crossroads even so the ghosts bothered them one said this havering is fair to drive me mad an we dont find them soon im for my hut and my wife ah but will she be for you in the middle of the night another asked the lot of them laughed they paused at the narrow track down which gerin and van had gone a couple of them peered toward the fox he crouched lower behind the bush that concealed him hoping the light of three moons would not betray him to the peasants maybe their own torchlight left them nightblind for they did not spy him after some muttered discussion they kept heading east down the main road perhaps half an hour later they came straggling back now their torches were guttering toward extinction and they hurried on toward their village mayhap tis as well we found the whoresons not one of them said gerin recognized the voice of the fellow whod sold him the hen theyd have slain some or ever we overcame them we need arms somebody answered belike but we need men to wield them too the henseller replied you were in the fields and saw them not a brace of proper rogues ready for aught wed have given the ghosts our own blood had we broiled ourselves with them i tell you as the peasants withdrew the argument got too lowvoiced for gerin to follow the peasant whod sold him the chicken was right he and van would have sold their lives dear even so he was nothing but glad the farmers or robbers or whatever they reckoned themselves to be hadnt found him and his comrade no matter how dearly you sold your life you could never buy it back the fox drew back down the path toward his camp he didnt think the locals would come out again and he proved right when math had traveled a little more than halfway from the horizon to the meridian he woke van and told him what had passed expected as much the outlander answered setting his crimsoncrested helm on his head and adjusting the cheekpieces they had that look to em so they did not likely theyll be back not so late in the night no gerin got out of armor as van donned it wouldnt do to count on that though hardly vans rumbling chuckle had next to no breath behind it tell you something else captain on the way home we make sure we roll through this place around noontime so were none too close to it the night before or the night after cant argue with you gerin yawned enormously havent the wit to argue with anything right now i just want to sleep if i get killed while youre on watch ill never forgive you nor have the chance either van said chuckling again gerin crawled under the blanket conceding him the last word he awoke unmurdered the next morning to the savory smell of toasting sausage van had built the fire up from embers and was improvising breakfast the flames sputtered and hissed as grease dripped down into them gerin accepted a sharp stick with a length of hard sausage impaled on it burned the roof of his mouth when he tried to take a bite while it was still too hot to eat swore and then did manage to get the meat down van finished before he did and harnessed the horses while he was getting into his cuirass and greaves a jay perched on a branch of a spruce seedling screeched at the outlander all the while he pointed at it youd best be quietsome lands ive been through the folk reckon songbirds good eating as if it understood him the jay shut up elabonians eat songbirds now and again gerin said we catch em with nets usually not with bow and arrow aye that makes sense van said theyre so small and swift youd need to be a dead shot to hit em and youd waste a slew of arrows he fastened a last strap come along captain lets be off the forest deepened and took on a new aspect as they rolled on toward ikos perhaps gerin thought taking on an old aspect was a better way of describing it elabonian traders and explorers back in the days before ros the fierce brought the northlands under imperial control described them as almost unbroken forest from the high kirs to the niffet and all the way west to the orynian ocean around the sibyls shrine at ikos that ancient forest survived undisturbed some of the gnarled oaks and deep green pines might have been saplings when the men round what would become the city of elabon were still unlettered barbarians some of them might have been saplings before the kizzuwatnans in their river valleys scratched the worlds first letters onto clay tablets and set them in an oven to bake maybe the shaggy beards of moss hanging from many of those trees helped muffle sound or maybe some lingering power clung to the forest some of the trees that grew there at any rate gerin had never seen outside these confines whatever the reason the woods were eerily still even the squeak and rattle of the wagons ungreased axles seemed diminished far above the roadway branches from either side interlaced cutting off a good part of the daylight and turning the rest cool and green and shifting if we could drive the wagon under the sea it might look like this gerin said maybe so van kept craning his neck looking up down all around i dont like this placeand i dont think it likes people either it wishes we werent here and so do i id argue with you if only i thought you were wrong gerin kept not quite hearing things pacing alongside the road as if tracking the wagon not quite seeing them no matter how quickly he turned his head toward what he hadnt quite heard van mused i wonder what would happen if come a dry summer some lord sent his peasants in here with axes and torches gerin wondered if the forest and the things that dwelt in it understood elabonian he feared they did for all at once the cover of branches over the road grew thicker and lower while most of those branches suddenly seemed full of thorns the very roadway narrowed with treesmany of them full of thorns toocrowding close as if ready to reach out and seize the intruders once or twice he was sure he saw eyes staring balefully at him from behind the leaves but he never got a glimpse of the creatures to which they were attached nervously he said you were just joking there werent you my friend what oh aye van was more than bold enough against any human foe but how could even the boldest man fight a forest eyeing the growing number of encroaching branches he went on all this lovely greenery in truth it would be a dreadful shame to peel even one leaf off its stem for a long moment nothing happened but just when gerin was about to grab for his sword and start slashing away at the aroused trees and bushes everything returned to the way it had been the sun played through breaks in the overhead canopy the road widened out again and the trees went back to being just trees whatever had been moving along with the wagon went away or at least became altogether silent whew van muttered under his breath place must have decided i was just joking after allwhich i was of course he added that last in a much louder voice of course you were gerin agreed heartily then his voice fell all the same well spend tonight in one of the lodgings round ikos not in this wood that will further prove we mean no harm to the powers here vans eyes met his the two men shared one thought it will also keep anything in the forest thats still angry from coming down on us the words hung unspoken in the air gerin didnt want to give any of those possibly angry things ideas they didnt have already the sun was low in the west behind gerin and van when they topped a rise and looked down into the valley wherein nested bitons gleaming white marble shrine and leading down from within it the rift in the earth that led to the sibyls chamber last time we came this way we camped in the woods van said as you say though better to pay the scot at one of the inns down there tonight a little town had grown up in front of the sibyls shrine catering to those who came to it seeking oracular guidance aye youre right gerin sighed he didnt like silver going without good cause come to that he wasnt overfond of paying silver even with good cause but he did not want to spend a night in these uncanny woods they were liable to shelter worse things than ghosts he twitched the reins and urged the horses forward when hed visited ikos before the town in front of the shrine had been packed with elabonians from both the northlands and south of the high kirs sithonians kizzuwatnans trokmoi shanda nomads and other folk as well a big reason gerin had preferred to camp in the woods then was that all the inns had bulged at the seams now as the wagon rolled into town he found the dirt streets all but empty several of the inns had closed a couple of them by their dilapidated look had been empty for years the innkeepers who survived all rushed from their establishments and fell on him and van with glad cries gerin hardly needed to haggle with them they bid against one another until he got his lodging supper and a promise of breakfast for half what hed expected to pay the taproom in the inn was all but deserted apart from gerin and van only a couple of locals sat at the tables drinking ale and telling stories theyd probably all heard a thousand times the innkeeper brought ale and drinking jacks to his new guests and what would your pleasure for supper be he asked bowing as low as if the fox had been hildor iii emperor of elabon not chicken he and van said much as they had at ricolfs youve traveled some way then and spent nights in the open the innkeeper pursed his lips to show he sympathized i killed a young pig this afternoon i was going to smoke and salt down the flesh but i do some lovely chops flavored with basil and thyme and wild mushrooms its a splendid dish if i say so myself and one i dont have the chance to prepare as often as id like these days true the cooking of it takes a while but where have you gentlemen to go in the meantime gerin and van looked at each other they nodded the fox said your trade has fallen off since the trokmoi swarmed over the niffet and the empire shut the last passage up from the south good my sir you have no idea the innkeeper rolled his eyes sometimes i think all of us left here make our living by taking in one anothers washing the shrine has fallen on hard times that it has and every one of us with it does the old sibyl still live gerin asked id not expected to find her breathing when i was last here five years ago now nothing would surprise me no biton took her for his own last year the innkeeper answered the god speaks through a younger woman now tis not that the quality of oracle has suffered thats cost us tradehe made haste to reassure the foxonly that fewer folk now find their way hither i understand gerin drained his jack dry the innkeeper hastened to refill it gerin drank again sighed with something close to contentment good to relax here away from the ghosts away from robbers in the night with only the worries that brought me here to carry on my shoulders that my humble establishment is able to ease your burdens does my heart good the innkeeper declared to say nothing of your coin hoard gerin said dryly the innkeeper turned his head to one side and coughed as if mention of money embarrassed him then he paused plainly listening over again to what gerin had said a moment before robbers in the night good my sir so men begin to hold the ghosts at bay and the gods in contempt men on the very road that leads here the fox said and told of the free peasants whod looked to arm themselves at his and vans expense they didnt come on us for which dyaus be praisedand biton too for watching over usbut they werent out there in the darkness just for the journey i heard them speak i know what im talking about sometimes i think the whole world is guttering down toward darkness like a candle on the last of its tallow the innkeeper said sadly even my dreams these days are full of monsters and pallid things from the underground darkness at night in my bed i see them spreading over the land and poor feeble men powerless to do aught against them gerin started to nod here was another man who shared his gloomy view of the world then he gave the innkeeper a sharp look i too have had dreams like that he said and i van put in i tell you the truthi mislike the omen maybe the sibyl will shed light on it gerin did his best to sound hopeful but feared his best was none too good iv the horses were curried till their coats gleamed and hitched to the wagon waiting when gerin went out to the stables to reclaim them he tipped the groom whod cared for them saying you did more here than was required of you lord youre generous beyond my deserts the fellow answered but gerin noticed he did not decline the proffered coin every other time gerin had visited the sibyls shrine the area around the fenced forecourt had been packed with wagons chariots and men afoot and with all the visitors passionately eager to put their questions to bitons oracle as soon as possible the only way to get in quicklysometimes the only way to get in at allwas to pay off one of the gods eunuch priests the fox had prepared himself for that eventuality at his belt swung two mediumheavy pouches one an offering for the temple the other though the word would not be used in public a bribe for the priest who would conduct him to the shrine he soon discovered he was going to save himself some money when he and van came to the gate in the marble outwall only three or four parties waited ahead of them just a few more rolled up behind the wagon instead of shouting cursing chaos the oracleseekers formed a single neat line van recognized what that meant too lets see the priests try to squeeze anything past their due out of us today he said laughing to their credit the priests did not try they took the suppliants one group at a time leading away their animals to be seen to while they consulted the sibyl everything ran as smoothly as the turning spokes of a chariot wheel gerin wished all his visits had gone so well he also wished this particular visit hadnt been necessary a plump beardless fellow in a robe of glittering cloth of gold approached the wagon bowing to gerin and van he said gentles you may call me kinifor i shall conduct you to the sibyl and escort you from her chamber once the god has spoken through her his voice was pleasant almost sweet not a mans voice but not a womans either thinking of the mutilation eunuchs suffered gerin always felt edgy around them because the mutilation was not their fault he always did his best to conceal those feelings he swung a plump leather sack into kinifors equally plump hand this is to help defray the cost of maintaining your holy shrine the eunuch priest hefted the bag not only to gauge its weight but to listen for the sweet jingle of silver you are generous he said and seemed well enough pleased even without any special payment straight to him gerin wondered if the temple would see all the money in the leather sack the priest went on descend if you will and accompany me to the temple as gerin and van got down from the wagon another priest this one in a plainer robe came over and led the horses away the travelers followed kinifor through the gate and into the fencedoff temenos surrounding the shrine the first thing the fox saw was a naked corpse prominently displayed just inside the gateway hideous lesions covered the body gerin jerked a thumb at it another wouldbe temple robber just so kinifor gave him a curious look am i to infer from your lack of surprise that you have seen others biton smote for their evil presumption another anyhow gerin answered with the chaos thats fallen on the northlands since the last time i was here though i wondered if your god was up to the job of protecting the treasures here from everyone whod like to get his hands on them this is bitons precinct on earth kinifor said in shocked tones if he is not potent here where will his strength be made manifest perhaps nowhere gerin thought when the elabonians conquered the northlands theyd taken biton into their own pantheon styling him a son of dyaus but the trokmoi brought their own gods with them and seemed to care little for those already native to the land if they prevailed biton might fail for lack of worshipers van cast an appraising eye on the treasures lavishly displayed in the courtyard before the temple the statues of gold and ivory others of marble painted into the semblance of life or of greening bronze the cauldrons and mixing bowls set on golden tripods the piled ingots that reflected the suns rays in buttery brilliance the outlander whistled softly i wondered if i misremembered from last time i was here but no theres a great pile of stuff about for your god to watch over priest the farseeing one has protected it well thus far one of kinifors hands shaped a gesture of blessing long may he continue to do so the white marble temple that housed the entrance to the sibyls cave was in a mixed sithonianelabonian style a gift of oren the builder to win the favor of bitons priesthoodand the god himselfnot long after the northlands came under elabonian sway the splendid fane elegantly plain outside and richly decorated within was surely magnificent enough to have succeeded in its purpose seemingly out of place within all that gleaming stone polished wood and precious metal was the cult image of biton which stood close by the fissure in the earth that led down to the cavern wherein the sibyl prophesied the temple was a monument to elabonian civilization at its best to everything gerin labored to preserve in the northlands the cult image was something else as he had the last time he visited the shrine the fox tried to imagine how old the square column of black basalt was as he had then he failed this was no realistic image of the god carved with loving care by a sithonian master sculptor or some elabonian artist who had studied for years in kortys the only suggestions of features the column bore were crudely carved eyes and a jutting phallus yet somehow perhaps because of the aura of immeasurable antiquity that clung to it the cult image carried as much impact as any polished product of the stonecutters art seat yourselves gentles kinifor said waving to the rows of pews in front of the basalt column and pray that the lord bitons sight reaches to the heart of your troubles whatever they may be the eunuch sat beside gerin bowed his head and murmured supplications to his god the fox also prayed though unsure how much attention biton paid to petitioners requests some gods like mavrix seemed to listen to every whisper addressed to them even if they did not always grant requests others such as dyaus the father of all were more distant he didnt know where in that range biton fell but took no chances either as soon as he finished his prayer he glanced up at the cult image just for a moment he thought he saw brown eyes staring back at him in place of the almost unrecognizable scratches on the basalt he shivered a little hed had that same odd impression on his last visit to the shrine bitons power might not reach far but it was strong here at its heart puffing a little a plump eunuch priest climbed up out of the fissure in the earth that led down to the sibyls chamber behind him came a grizzled elabonian with a thoughtful expression on his face with a nod to gerin he strode out of the temple and away to reclaim his team and vehicle kinifor said nothing now prevents us from seeking the wisdom biton imparts through his sacred sibyl if you will please to follow me stepping carefully as you descend on his previous visit gerin had had to fight for his life against trokmoi dissatisfied with what they heard from the oracle he looked down to see if bloodstains still remained in the cracks between the tesserae of the mosaic floor he saw none which pleased him kinifor stepped into the cave mouth gerin followed darkness illuminated only by torches not nearly close enough together swallowed him the air in the cave felt altogether different from the muggy heat hed endured in the temple it was damp but cool with a constant breeze blowing in his face so that the atmosphere never turned stagnant kinifors shadow his own and vans swooped and fluttered in the torchlight like demented birds flickering shadows picked out bits of rock crystalor possibly even gemsembedded in the stone of the cave walls one glint came red as blood was that a ruby we just passed gerin asked it could be so kinifor answered biton has guided us to many treasures underground is it your god or your greed van asked kinifor spluttered indignantly the outlander laughed at the priests annoyance just then they came to a branch of the cave that had been sealed up with stout brickwork what about that didnt you have to wall it up because your prying roused things that would better have been left asleep well yes kinifor admitted reluctantly but that was long ago when we were first learning the ways of this cave the bricks say as much if you know how to read them gerin did instead of being flat on all sides the bricks bulged on top as if they were so many hardbaked loaves of bread that style had come out of kizzuwatna in ancient days not long after men first gathered together in cities and learned to read and write and work bronze he took a long look at those bricks they couldnt possibly reach back so far in time could they after that first long look came a second one loafshaped bricks had not held their popularity long in kizzuwatna they required more mortar to bind them together than those of more ordinary shape some of the mortar on these after biton only knew how many centuries had begun to crack and fall away from the bricks little chips lay on the stone floor of the cave the fox pointed to them frowning i dont remember your wall there falling apart the last time i came this way i hadnt noticed that kinifor confessed some evening when no suppliants seek the sibyls advice we shall have to send down a crew of masons to repair the ravages of time his laugh was smooth and liquid like the low notes of a flute if the barrier has sufficed to hold at bay whatever lies beyond it lo these many years surely a few days one way or the other are of scant import but gerin held his tongue the eunuch priest was bound to be right and yetthis wasnt a slow accumulation of damage over many years unless he and kinifor were both wrong it had happened recently the rift wound deeper into the earth kinifor led gerin and van past more spellwarded walls several times the fox saw more loose mortar on the ground he would have taken oath it had not been there when hed last gone down to the sibyls chamber but forbore to speak of it again kinifor plainly did not intend to hear whatever he had to say the priest raised a hand for those who accompanied him to halt he peered into the chamber that opened up ahead then nodded gentles you may proceed do you seek privacy for your question to the sibyl privacy would have cost gerin an extra bribe he shook his head no you may hear it and her answer too its no great secret as you say kinifor sounded sulky most people who thought a question important enough to put to the sibyl also thought it so important that no one other than biton and his mouth on earth could be trusted with it gerin had been of that opinion on his latest visit now though he did not mind if the priest listened as he enquired about his sons fate kinifor stepped aside to let the fox and van precede him into the sibyls underground chamber as before gerin marveled at the throne on which she sat it threw back the torchlight with glistening nacreous highlights as if carved from a single black pearl yet contemplating the oyster that could have birthed such a pearl sent his imagination reeling it is a new sibyl van murmured very low gerin nodded instead of the ancient withered crone whod occupied this chamber on all his previous journeys to ikos on the throne sat a pleasantfaced woman of perhaps twentyfive in a simple white linen dress that fastened over her left shoulder and reached halfway between her knees and ankles she nodded politely first to kinifor then to those who would question her but when she spoke she might have been the old sibyl reborn step forward lads she said to gerin and van her voice was a musical contralto but it held ancient authority though the fox and the outlander were both older than she they were not merely lads but babes when measured against the divine power she represented gerin obeyed her without hesitation coming to the crone on that seat had seemed natural to him finding a new young sibyl there made him think for the first time of the life she led bitons mouth on earth was pledged to lifelong celibacy indeed pledged never even to touch a whole man here far below the ground she would stay day upon day the god taking possession of her again and again as she prophesied her only company even when above the earth he assumedhe hopedshe was allowed out of the chamber when no more suppliants came eunuchs and perhaps serving women thus she would live out however many years she had he shivered it struck him more as divine punishment than reward what would you learn from my master biton the sibyl asked gerin had thought about how to ask that question all the way south from fox keep if the god got an ambiguous query the questioner was liable to get an ambiguous reply indeed biton was famous for finding ambiguity even where the questioner thought none lurking taking a deep breath the fox asked is my son alive and well and if he is when and where shall we be reunited that strikes me as being two questions kinifor said disapprovingly let the god judge gerin answered to which the priest gave a grudging nod biton evidently reckoned the question acceptable the mantic fit came over the young sibyl harder than it had with the old her eyes rolled up in her head she thrashed about on the throne careless of her own modesty and when she spoke the voice that came from her throat was not her own but the same powerful baritone her predecessor had usedbitons voice the sibyls doom we speak of now and worry less about the child to flee ikos midst fearful row durens fate may well be mild all ends among which is the vow pledged by an oracle defiled the god left his mouth on earth as abruptly as his spirit had filled her she slumped against an arm of the throne in a dead faint kinifor said gentles the lord biton has spoken you must now leave this chamber that the sibyl may recover and ready herself for those who come here next but the sibylor biton if youd rathersaid next to nothing about the question i asked gerin protested most of that verse had more to do with you by the sound of it than with me that is neither here nor there kinifor said the god speaks as he will not as any man expects who are you mortal to question his majesty and knowledge to that gerin had no answer only frustration that he had not learned more from the query over which hed pondered so hard on the journey down from his keep he took what coals of comfort he could biton had urged him not to worry but what if that was because duren was already dead and so beyond worry would the god have mentioned him by name if he was dead especially when gerin had not named him who could say what a god would do where the fox had done his best to prevent ambiguity it had found him out dismayed he turned to go van pointed to the sibyl who remained unconscious should the lass not have come back to herself by now youd not bring new folk down here if they were to find her nearer dead than alive kinifor opened his mouth perhaps to say something reassuring but before he did he too took another look at the sibyl a frown crinkled the unnaturally smooth skin of his face this isunusual he admitted she should be awake and if a priest is here with her asking what the god spoke through her lips gerin started to take a step toward her then remembered the conditions under which she served biton any touch from him no matter how wellmeaning brought defilement with it he wondered if that was what the last line of her prophecy meant then stopped worrying about prophecy while she sprawled unconscious he asked kinifor do you want to tend to her while we make our own way back up to the temple he might as well have suggested burning down the fane that cannot be the eunuch priest gasped for one thing you might well lose your way take a wrong turning and never be seen again for another some turns lead to treasures not displayed above ground no one not connected with the cult of biton may turn his eyes upon them i know what biton does to those who would be thieves gerin protested but kinifor shook his head so vehemently that his plump jowls wobbled van as usual spoke to the point well what about the wench then kinifor went over to her put a hand in front of her nose and mouth to make sure she was breathing felt for her pulse when he straightened his face held relief as well as worry i do not believe she will perish in the next moments let me guide you back to the surface of the earth after which she shall of course be properly seen to honh van said seems to me you care more about bitons gold and gauds than about his sibyl kinifor answered that with an injured silence which suggested to gerin that his friend had hit the target dead center but this was the priests domain not his so he let kinifor lead him out of the sibyl s chamber and back up the length of the cave to bitons temple still grumbling and looking back over his shoulder van reluctantly followed to give kinifor his due he hurried along the stony way pushing his corpulent frame till he panted like a dog after a long run surprisingly soon light not from torches showed ahead though the priests body almost obliterated it as he climbed out of the cave mouth gerin came right after him blinking until his eyes grew used to daylight once more about time rasped the toughlooking fellow who waited impatiently for his turn at the oracle take me down there priest and no more nonsense i fear i cannot sir kinifor answered the sibyl seems to have suffered an indisposition and will not be able to reply to questioners at least for some little while that brought exclamations of dismay from the other eunuchs within earshot they hurried to kinifor to find out what had happened he quickly explained two of bitons servitors hurried down into the cave mouth if she has not yet returned to herself we shall bring her out one of them said as he disappeared the elabonian warrior whose question was delayed shouted this is an outrage when no one paid any attention to him he shouted viler things than that his face turned the color of maple leaves in fall gerin looked down his long straight nose at the man do you know what you remind me of sirrah he said coldly you remind me of my fouryearold son when he pitches a fit because i tell him he cant have any honied blueberries till after supper who in the five hells do you think you are to take that tone with me the fellow demanded setting his right hand on the hilt of his sword im gerin the fox prince of the north gerin said matching the gesture with his left hand you should be thankful i dont know your name or want to the redfaced man scowled but did not back down gerin wondered if he would have to fight in bitons shrine for the second time in two visits the temple complex had guards but most of them were outside the fane keeping an eye on the treasures displayed in the courtyard and on any visitors who careless of bitons curse might develop itchy fingers then from the entrance to the shrine someone called any man who draws his blade on gerin the fox especially with van of the strong arm beside him is a fool of course youve been acting like a fool fellow so that may account for it the angry elabonian whirled and what do you know about it you interfering old polecats twat he snarled apparently not caring how many enemies he made the newcomer strode toward him he was a tall lean man of perhaps forty with a forwardthrusting face a proud beak of a nose and dark chilly eyes that put gerin in mind of a hunting hawks he said id be the fool if i didnt make it my business to learn all i could of gerin the fox i am grand duke aragis also called the archer the angry color drained from the face of the impatient warrior as he realized hed caught himself between the two strongest men in the northlands with a last muttered curse he stomped out of the temple though he took care to step wide around aragis well met gerin said he and aragis were rivals but not open enemies well met aragis answered he turned his intent gaze on the fox i should have thought i might find you here after word of your son are you aye gerin said stonily and you on business of my own aragis said which is none of my business gerin suggested aragis noddedonce he was not a man given to excess gerin said have it as you wish whatever your question is you may not be able to put it to the sibyl any more than that bigmouthed ruffian was why not aragis asked suspiciously the idea that gerin should know something he didnt seemed to offend him before the fox could answer the two priests who had gone down to see how the sibyl fared came back up into the temple they carried her between them her face white and her arms dangling limply toward the ground does she live gerin called to them in some alarm good sir she does one of the eunuchs answered but since her senses do not return to her well take her to her own dwellinghe nodded his head to show in which direction from the shrine that lay and minister to her there at the very least she can rest more comfortably in her bed than in the underground chamber surely though the lord biton will aid in her recovery that would have come out better had it sounded more like assertion and less like prayer why should the lord biton care van asked blunt as always down below there he sounded like he was getting out of the prophecy game you rave good sir and tread the edge of blasphemy as well the priest answered he looked for support to kinifor who had heard the sibyls last prophecy the eunuch who had accompanied gerin and van made a strange snuffling sound almost one a horse would produce as he blew air out through his lips slowly he said the verses may lend themselves to the interpretation proposed other interpretations however must be more probable even such a halfhearted admission was enough to shock the other two priests clucking to themselves they carried the unconscious sibyl away kinifor said i begin to fear there will be no further communing with the lord biton this day perhaps everyone here would be well advised to return to his inn there to await the sibyls return to health we shall send word directly that occurs and shall seek no further fee for your inquiries youd better not aragis put as much menace into three words as gerin had ever heard and if the wench ups and dies i expect my silver back the eunuch twisted his hand in a gesture to turn aside the evil omen the lord biton would not summon two sibyls to himself in such a short span of time he said but his words like the other priests lacked confidence people filed out of the shrine muttering and grumbling to themselves kinifor went out to let those who waited in the courtyard know they would be disappointed in their hope for an oracular response their replies like those in the temple ranged from curious to furious with rough humor aragis turned to gerin what did you ask her anyway to put her in such a swivet to marry you gerin growled down deep in his throat and took a step toward the archer unlike the fellow whod started to move on him though he mastered himself i ought to just tell you its none of your cursed business he said but since you already know why im here whats the point i asked after my son as youve figured out for yourself thats a bad business aragis answered the whoreson who did it may come to me seeking advantage from it by dyaus if he does ill run up a cross for him and youll have the boy back fast as horses can run i swear it if it happens so ill be in your debt the fox said id be lying if i told you the idea that you had something to do with it was never in my mind aragis scowled because were the two biggest we circle round each other like a couple of angry dogsi dont trust you either as you know full well but i did not have my hand in this and i will not seek to profit from it come what may would you were it my lad i hope not gerin said aragis chewed on that then slowly nodded he looked sincere but his face as gerin had already seen showed what he willed it to not necessarily what he felt that was useful for a ruler as gerin knewhis own features were similarly schooled van said all right archer if you dont care to circle and watch and not trust suppose you do tell us why you came up to ikos so long as its not life or death for your holding that we know for a moment aragis was nonplussed gerin hadnt been sure he could be then his usual watchful expression returned as he considered the outlanders words at last he said fair enough i suppose i rode here because ive had bad dreams i hopedi hope stillthe sibyl could put meaning to them what sort of dreams gerins curiosity was as dependable as the changing phases of the moons aragis hesitated again perhaps not caring to show a rival any weakness but after another pause for thought he murmured if i can t understand them you bloody well wont either he raised his voice to answer the fox theyve been filled with horrid things monsters call them what you will overrunning my landsoverrunning the rest of the northlands too for all i could tell he grimaced and shook his head as if talking about the visions made him see them again i too have had this dream gerin said slowly and i van agreed and the innkeeper from whom weve taken rooms gerin said i did not like the omen when it was van and i alone now with four he checked himself four i know of i should sayi like it even less wherever else we rub fox ill not argue with you there aragis ran a hand down to the point of his graying beard did the sibyl say anything to you of this before she had her fit what verse did she speak why dont you ask him how big his is as long as youre snooping van said like most men aragis seemed a stripling when set against the burly outlander but he had no retreat in him he reached for the sword that hung on his belt before van could grab any of the lethal hardware he carried gerin held up a hand hold both of you he said aragis you know what the question was the answer has nothing to do with you so i can give it without fear youll gain from it he repeated the oracular response aragis listened intently still rubbing his chin and now and then plucking at his beard when gerin was done the other noble gave a grudging nod aye thats nought to do with me and might even hold good news about duren mixed in there but what of the rest ive never heardor heard ofa reply so filled with doom no wonder the sibyl wouldnt wake up after she delivered it i wonder if its got summat to do with the dreams weve had van said aragis and gerin both looked at him as if animated by a single will their hands formed the same sign to turn away evil off with you omen aragis exclaimed the fox nodded vehemently van said its not much of an omen talk and fingertwitchingll turn aside the little vole will turn and bite in the eagles claws gerin answered one time in a thousand or a thousand thousand hell draw blood and make the bird drop him with omens you never know which ones you can shift so you try to shift them all now it was vans turn to look thoughtful might be something to that i suppose i know what id sooner do though now that the sibyls not going to give you what youre after and whats that gerin asked though he thought he knew the answer sure enough van said go back to the inn and hoist enough beakers of ale that we dont care about omens or sibyls or anything else if theres nothing for us here we should head straight off to fox keep gerin said but he sounded doubtful even to himself van looked at the sun you want to start up the road just a bit before noon so we can camp for the night in the middle of the haunted wood begging your pardon captain thats the daftest thought youve had in a goodish while gerin prided himself on his ability to admit mistakes youre right it is and if were stuck with spending another day at the inn how better to pass it than with a carouse he looked doubtfully at aragis polite talk with his main rival in the northlands was one thing a day of drinking with him something else again aragis studied him with the same question on his face the fox realized that while he and the selfstyled grand duke were very different men their station gave them common concerns that was disconcerting he hadnt tried mentally putting himself in aragis shoes before after a moment of awkward silence the archer resolved the problem saying the way back to my holding is straight enough and ill be free of the woods well before sunset if i start now so i think ill head south he stuck out his hand gerin clasped it whatever comes i hope we get through it without trying to carve each others livers he said the only one whod gain from that is adiatunnus aragis eyes grew hawkwatchful again i hear he sent to you you were worried whether his men stole your boy youre telling me you didnt join forces with him thats just what im telling you gerin answered the five hells will vomit forth the damned before i join hands with a trokme he waited for aragis to say something like that aragis didnt he only nodded to show hed heard then walked off to reclaim the chariot or wagon in which hed come to ikos cold fish van said judiciously not a man who makes an easy enemy though or i miss my guess you dont the fox answered weve met only a couple of times before so i dont have his full measure as a man but what hes done in building up his holding speaks for itself and you heard what he had done after his men hunted down a longtooth that had been taking cattle from one of his villages no somehow i missed that one van said tell me he had an extra strong cross raised and nailed and lashed the beasts carcass to it as a warning to others of its kindand more to the point as a warning to any men who might have thought about trifling with him mm itd make me think twice i expect van said well lets amble after him and get back our animals the beasts and the vehicles they drew waited outside the walled courtyard around the temple by luck the lowranking priest whod taken the wagon by the gate stood close to it now that meant gerin didnt have to convince someone else he wasnt absconding with the property of another as he climbed in he pointed to a thatchroofed wooden cottage not far away is that where the sibyl lives when shes not prophesying he asked so it is good my sir the priest answered his smooth face held worry i saw her carried there not long since and heard rumors and tales so strange i know not what to believe even those who brought her seemed confused did the mantic trance take her for you it did in fact she lost her senses just afterwards and did not get them back again as she usually does without repeating the oracular verse gerin told the priest what had happened in the underground chamber the corners of the eunuchs mouth drew down even further biton grant she recover soon he exclaimed never has the good god seen fit to call two sibyls to himself so quickly the temple suffers great disruption while the search for a new maid to speak his words goes on to say nothing of the fees you lose when the oracle is quiet gerin said remembering sacks of silver hed pressed into priests pudgy palms but in injured tones the eunuch replied i did say nothing of those fees perhaps he was genuinely pious stranger things had happened gerin supposed he twitched the reins urging the horses back toward the inn the innkeeper and the head groom met him in front of it youll honor my establishment with another nights custom the innkeeper asked eagerly adding i trust all went well for you with the sibyl i gather there was some sort of commotion in the temple like anyone else he delighted in gossip not in the templeunder it van said gerin let him tell the tale this time the outlander was a better storyteller than he anyhow when gerin told what he knew he did it baldly laying out facts to speak for themselves van embellished and embroidered them almost as if he were a minstrel when he was through the innkeeper clapped his hands bowing he said good my sir if ever you tire of the life you lead which i take to be one of arms you would be welcome to earn your bread and meat here at my inn for surely the stories you spin would bring in enough new custom to make having you about a paying proposition thank you sir but im not quite ready yet to sit by the fire and tell yarns for my supper van said if youll fetch gerin and me a big jar of ale though thatd be a kindness worth remembering seeking to be even more persuasive gerin let silver softly jingle the innkeeper responded with alacrity he shouted to his servants as gerin and van went inside and sat in the taproom grunting with effort two men hauled a huge amphora up from the cellar right behind them came another fellow with a flatbottomed pot full of earth the fox wondered at that until the two men stabbed the pointed base of the amphora down into the pot it wont stand by itself on a wooden floor dont you see the innkeeper said and if the two of you somehow empty it you wont be able to stand by yourselves either good thats the idea van boomed you have a dipper there my friend so we can fill our jacks as we need to ah yes i see it splendid if we do come to the point where we cant walk youll be kind enough to have your men carry us up to our beds weve done it a few times or more than a few said one of the men whod lugged in the amphora for you though we ought to charge extra seeing as youre heavy freight he looked ready to bolt if van took that the wrong way but the outlander threw back his head and laughed till the taproom rang the innkeeper hovered round gerin like a bee waiting for a flower to open the fox didnt take long to figure out why hed jingled silver but he hadnt shown any now he did the innkeeper bowed himself almost double as he made the coins vanishno easy feat for he was almost as round as some of the temple eunuchs once paid he had the sense to leave his guests to themselves van filled two jacks passed one to gerin he raised on high the one he kept confusion to oracles he cried and poured the redbrown ale down his throat he let out a long sigh of contentment ahhhh gerin also drank but more slowly halfway through he set down his jack and said the poor sibyl seemed confused enough already i hope shes come back to herself well so do i van admitted he clucked impatiently come on captain finish up there so i can pour you full again ah thats better he plied the dipper before upending his own refilled jack he went on i wonder if for a woman with juice in her like the new sibyl looks to have letting the god fill you makes up for long years without a man to fill you not a swap id care to make anyhow i had the same thought myself when i saw her in the chamber in place of the crone whod been there time out of mind gerin answered i dont suppose biton would speak to anyone who wasnt willing to listen though mm maybe not van kicked him under the table what shall we drink to this round without hesitation gerin raised his jack and said dyaus curse and bitons too on whoever kidnapped duren he emptied the jack in one long pull his throat working hard van shouted approval and drank with him after a while they stopped toasting with each round and settled in for steady drinking gerin felt at the tip of his nose with thumb and forefinger it was numb a sure sign the ale was beginning to have its way with him suddenly half drunk he decided he didnt feel like sliding sottishly under the table van filled his own jack lowered the dipper into the amphora and brought it dripping toward gerins when he turned it so the dark amber stream poured into the jack it quickly overflowed he scowled at the fox youre behindhand there only the care with which he pronounced behindhand gave any clue to how much hed poured down himself i know go on without me if youve a mind to if i drink myself stupid today ill drink myself sad i can feel it coming on already and i have plenty to be sad about even with my wits about me the outlander looked at him with an odd expression gerin needed a moment to recognize it he hadnt often seen pity on his friends blunt hardfeatured face van said the real trouble with you captain is that you dont let go of your wits no matter how drunk you get me im like most folk after a while i just stop thinking nice to be able to do that now and again if you say so gerin answered ive lived by and for my wits so long now i suppose that id sooner keep em about me all the time id feel nakedworse than nakedwithout em poor bastard van had drunk enough to make his tongue even freer than it usually was i tell you this though a long time ago i learned it was cursed foolishness to try and make a man go in a direction he doesnt fancy so you do what you feel like doing me i intend to get pieeyed tomorrow morning ill have a head like the inside of a drum with two trokmoi pounding on it but ill worry about that then all right gerin said youve touched wisdom there you know me honh van said with deep scorn i dont know from wisdom all i know is ale feels good when its inside me and i feel good when im inside a wench and a nice friendly fight is the best sport in the world who needs more no really the fox had enough ale inside him to make him painfully earnest so many folk arent content to let their friendshe almost said the people they love but knew with accurate instinct that that would have been more than van could put up withbe what they are they keep trying to make them into what they think theyre supposed to be van grunted foolishness was all he said he plied the dipper yet again then burst into raucous song in a language gerin didnt know the outlander went to the jakes several times over the course of the afternoon as the ale extracted a measure of revenge when he came back from the latest of those visits he zigzagged to the table like a ship trying to tack into port against a strong wind his chair groaned when he threw his bulk into it but held even after more drinking he was able to paste an appreciative smile on his face when a servitor brought over flatbread and a juicy roast of beef he used his eating knife to carve off a chunk that would have done a starving longtooth proud and methodically proceeded to make it disappear lubricating the passage with ale after so many years comradeship the outlanders capacity no longer amazed gerin even if it did still awe him the innkeeper watched van eat and drink with amazement too glum amazement that he hadnt charged more if the fox was any judge gerin did his best to damage the roast too but beside vans his depredations went all but unnoticed twilight faded into night torches their heads dipped in fat for brighter flames smoked and crackled in bronze sconces gerin drained his jack one last time set it upside down on the table and got to his feet he moved slowly and carefully that being the only sort of motion he had left to him im for bed he announced too bad too bad theres still ale in the jar van said he got up himself to peer down into it not a lot of ale but some dont make me think about it the fox said im going to have a headache in the morning as is why bring it on early you van said what about me pity showed on his face again this time selfpityhe had indeed drunk titanically if hed managed to make himself maudlin gerin climbed the stairs as if each were a separate mountain higher than the last triumphand a bellyful of alesurged in him when he got to the second story the floor seemed to shift under his feet like the sea but he reached the room he shared with van without having to lean against the wall or grab at a door that too was triumph of a sort he rinsed out his mouth with water from the pitcher there though he knew it would be a cesspit come morning anyhow then he undressed and flopped limply onto one of the beds he pulled off his sandals hoping van wouldnt choose the same bed and squash him whenifthe outlander made it upstairs sometime in the middle of the night the fox sat bolt upright in bed eyes staring heart pounding his head was pounding too but he ignored it the horror of the dream that had slammed him out of sodden slumber made such merely fleshly concerns as hangovers meaningless by comparison worst of all he couldnt remember what hed seenor perhaps the darkness of the dream had been so absolute that even imaginary vision failed something dreadful was brewing somewhere in the dark the room in which he lay was dark too but not so dark that he could not see light from all the moons save elleb streamed in through the window painting crisscrossing shadows on the floor in the other bed van snored like a bronze saw slowly cutting its way through limestone just as gerin tried to convince himself the dream no matter how terrifying had been only a dream and to go back to sleep the outlander stirred and moaned that he could move at all amazed the fox the room reeked of stale ale van shoutednot in elabonian not in words at all but like an animal bawling out a desperate alarm one of his big hands groped for and found a knife he sprang to his feet naked and ferocious his eyes utterly devoid of reason its all right gerin said urgently before that mad gaze could light on him and decide he was the cause of whatever night terror van faced its only a dream lie down and sleep some more a dream van said in a strange uncertain voice no it couldn t be he seemed to shrink a little as consciousness came back by the gods maybe it was at that i can hardly believe it he set the knife back on the floor sat down at the edge of the bed with a massive forearm across his eyes gerin understood that now he noticed his own throbbing head and vans had to be ten times worse the outlander stood again this time to use the chamber pot gerin also understood that pass it to me when youre done he said i thought i was lost in a black pit van said wonderingly things were looking at me i know they were but i couldnt see even the shine of their eyestoo dark how could i fight them if i couldnt see them he shuddered then groaned i wish my head would fall off even the moonlight hurts my eyes i had a dark dream too though i dont remember as much of it as you do gerin said analytical even hung over he went on odd that youve drunk much more than i have yet you recall more i wonder why captain i dont give a vans reply was punctuated by a frightened wail that came in through the window with the overbrilliant moonlight the fox recognized the innkeepers voice even distorted by fear more than his headache more than his own bad dream that fear kept him from falling back to sleep van said nothing but by the way he tossed and fidgeted he lay a long time wakeful too breakfast the next morning was not a happy time gerin spooned up barley porridge with his eyes screwed into slits against the daylight van drew up a bucket of water from the well outside the inn and poured it over his head he came back in dripping and snorting but turned aside with a shudder from the bowl of porridge the innkeeper offered him the innkeeper did his best to seem jolly but his smiles although they stretched his mouth wide failed to reach his eyes little by little he stopped pretending and grew almost as somber as his suffering guests i have some word of the sibyl good my sirs he said tell us gerin urged youll give me something to think about besides my poor decrepit carcass van did not seem capable of coherent speech but noddedcautiously as if afraid the least motion might make his head fall off the innkeeper said i hear she still lies asleep in the bed where the priests put her now and again thrashing and crying out as if she has evil dreams i wonder if hers are the same as mine and vans gerin said darkness and unseen things moving through it i sawor rather did not seethe same last night the innkeeper gave a theatrical shiver his eyes flicked over to dyaus altar by the fireplace the king of the gods might hold the ghosts at bay but seemed powerless against these more frightening seemings that came in the night van made a hoarse croaking noise then said i wonder what aragis dreamt last night he didnt quite whisper but used only a small piece of his big voice more would have hurt him are you sure you wont eat something gerin asked him well want to do a lot of traveling today to get beyond the wood and also past that peasant village where they hunted us in the night im sure van said quietly still youd make a fine mother hen captain but if i put aught in my belly now wed just lose time stopping the wagon so i could go off into the woods and unspit you know best the fox said the porridge was bland as could be but still sat uncertainly in his own stomach and lurched when he stood up i do think we ought to go upstairs and don our armor though however much we hurt were liable to have some handwork ahead of us aye youre right van answered id be happier to sit here a whilesay a year or twotill i feel i might live or even want to but youre right with careful stride he made his way to the stairs and up them gerin followed the rasps and clangs of metal touching metal made the foxs head hurt and by vans mutters did worse to him dont know how im supposed to fight even if i have to gerin said if i could drive somebody away by puking on him i might manage that but im not good for much more i feel the same way van said but no matter how sick i am if its a choice between fighting and dying i expect ill do the best job of fighting i can cant argue with that gerin said if you think ill be looking for a fight today though youre daft nor i and im a sight fonder of them than you are van said the thing of it is a fight may be looking for you why do you think im doing this gerin shrugged his shoulders a couple of times to fit his corselet as comfortably as he could then jammed his bronze pot of a helm over his head sighing he said let s go just a moment van adjusted the cheekpieces to his own fancy helm then nodded by his pained expression that hurt too anticipating still more future pain he said and well have to listen to the cursed wagon wheels squeaking all the rest of the day too gerin hadnt thought of that when he did his stomach churned anew weve got to do something about that he declared stay here a while longer van suggested weve stayed too long already thanks to you and your carouse curse me if i want to spend another useless day here because you drank the ale jar dryand i helped i admit it the fox added hastily he plucked at his beard thinking straight and clear through a pounding headache was anything but easy but after a few seconds he snapped his fingers i have it ill beg a pot of goose grease or chicken fat or whatever he has from the innkeeper it wont be perfect the gods know but it should cut the noise to something we have hope of standing van managed the first smile hed risked since he woke up he made as if to slap gerin on the back but thought better of it perhaps he imagined how he would have felt had someone bestowed a similar compliment on him in his present delicate condition by the gods captain it cant hurt he exclaimed i was thinking wed have to suffer the whole day long and no help for it no point in suffering if you dont have to gerin said and i cant think of a better way to use wits than to keep from suffering the innkeeper produced a pot of chicken fat without demur though he said theres a cure for a long night i never ran across before aye thats just what it is but not the way you mean the fox explained why he wanted the fat the innkeeper looked bemused but nodded gerin crawled under the wagon and applied a good coat of grease to both axles when he came out and stood up again van said well draw flies no doubt gerin said after a while itll go bad and start to stink too and somebody will have to scrub it off for today itll be quieter wouldnt you say thats worth it oh aye you get no quarrel from me there vans laugh was but a faint echo of his usual booming chortle but it served thing of it is im usually the one with no thought but for today and youre always fretting about tomorrow or the year after or when your grandsons an old graybeard odd to find us flipflopped so the fox considered that then set it aside too much like philosophy for early in the day especially after too much ale the night before shall we be off might as well van said can i humbly beg you to take the reins for the first part of the go i dont think you hurt yourself as bad as i did fair enough gerin clambered onto the seat at the front of the wagon the reins slid across the calluses on his palms van got up beside him moving with an old mans caution the lord biton bless the both of you good my sirs the groom said gerin flicked the reins the horses leaned forward against their harness the wagon rolled ahead it still rattled and creaked and jounced but didnt squeak nearly as much as it had van looked wanly happy thats first rate he said with even a bit o luck ill feel like living by noon or so about what i was hoping for myself gerin said he drove out of the stable yard and around to the front of the inn the wagon wasnt as quiet as all that but it was enough quieter than it had been to satisfy him the innkeeper stood by the entryway and bowed himself double as the wagon passed him the lord biton bless the both of you he said as the groom had may you come again to ikos before long and may you recall my humble establishment with favor when you do they didnt used to act like that before the empire blocked the last pass through the kirs gerin murmured then they had guests up to the ceiling and sleeping in the horses stables and they hardly knew or cared whether they saw anyone in particular again reminds me of a story captain indeed it does van said a sure sign he was feeling better have i told you how they get the monkeys to pick pepper no i dont think ive heard that one gerin answered how do they he got no further for the horses gave a snort of alarm and reared in terror trying to fight them under control gerin thought their unexpected motion the reason the wagon swayed beneath his fundament as if suddenly transformed to a boat bobbing on a choppy sea then van shouted earthquake and he realized the whole world was trembling hed felt earthquakes once or twice before years ago the ground had twitched then subsided almost before fear could seize him this quake was nothing like those the shaking went on and on it seemed to last forever through the roar of the ground and the creaking of the buildings in the town of ikos he heard cries of fear after a moment he realized the loudest of them was his own a couple of inns and houses did more than creak they collapsed into piles of rubble and when the fox looked down the street toward the temple of biton he saw with horror that the gleaming marble fane was also down along with great stretches of the wall that protected the holy precinct when the earth finally relented and stood still gerin realized his hangover was gone terror had burned it out of him he stared at van who stared back his usually ruddy face fishbelly white captain that was a very bad one the outlander said ive felt quakes a time or two here and there but never any to compare with that nor i gerin said the ground shook again just enough to send his heart leaping into his mouth he scrambled down from the wagon and ran toward the nearest fallen building from which came painfilled shouts van ran right beside him together they pulled away timbers and plaster until they could haul out a fellow who but for a couple of cuts and a mashed finger had taken miraculously little hurt all the gods bless you the man said coughing my wifes in there somewhere careless of his own injuries he began clawing at the wreckage himself gerin and van worked with him men and women also came running from buildings that had stayed upright then someone screamed fire flames born in the hearth or on dyaus altar or of some flickering lamp were loose and growing black smoke thin at first but all too quickly thicker boiled up to the skyand not just from the downfallen inn where the fox labored every wrecked building was soon ablaze the shrieks of those trapped under beams rose to a new and dreadful pitch along with everyone else gerin fought the fires as best he could but there were not enough buckets not enough water flames grew spread began to devour buildings the earthquake had not tumbled hopeless van said coughing and choking against the smoke that now streaked his face with soot we dont get away were going to cook too and the wagon and horses with us gerin hated to retreat but knew his friend was right he looked again toward bitons overthrown temple by the gods he said softly and then shivered when as if the gods were listening the ground shook again i wonder if the sibyl foresaw this when she prophesied yesterday theres a thought vans face lit up and heres another with the wall down and the temple guards likely either squashed or scared to death whats to keep us from scooping a wagonload of gold out of the holy precinct youre braver than i am if you want to chance bitons curse gerin said remember the corpses weve seen of those who tried stealing from the temenos by vans expression first sulky and then thoughtful he hadnt remembered but did now gerin went on but lets head over there anyhow we ought to see if we can do anything for the poor sibyl if i know those greedy priests theyll be so worried over the temple and their treasures that theyre liable to forget herand she may not even be aware to remind them shes alive the thought of her lying in the rubble trapped and unconscious and perhaps forgotten raised fresh horror in him he could not imagine a lonelier way to die right you are captain now van got into the wagon and took the reins without hesitation maybe the shock of the earthquake had made him forget his morningafter pains too gerin scrambled up beside him the horses snorted both in fear and from the billowing smoke the fox counted himself lucky that they hadnt bolted when the fires started he was anything but sorry to get away from the flames himself along with so much else the goldandivory statues of ros and oren had fallen in the earthquakefallen and shattered into the pieces from which they were made orens head its features plump and unmemorable but decked with a crown heavy with gold and sparkling with rubies sapphires and emeralds had bounced or flown out beyond the overthrown marble wall that delimited bitons precinct gerin and van looked at each other the same thought in both their minds so much goldwhispering a prayer of propitiation to biton the fox leaped down from the wagon he seized the image of the dead emperors head ready to cast it aside at the first sign of the curse striking home and devoutly hoping that would be soon enough grunting at the weight of gold he picked up the head and crown and chucked them into the back of the wagon we wont need to fret about money for a bit van said beaming and even the abstemious fox could only nod the quake struck so early in the day that hardly anyone had yet come in hope of hearing the sibyls prophetic verse only one wagon and one chariot had their horses tethered out in front of the dwelling the sibyl used as her own the cottage still stood while chunks of the marble wall around the temple precinct had come down with gruesome result on the priest who the day before had tended gerins team seeing the sibyls dwelling intact made the fox hesitate maybe we should just head for home he said doubtfully those fellows over there will be able to take care of her without violating ritual he pointed through a gap in the wall toward figures running around by the ruined temple van looked that way too his eyes were sharper than gerins perhaps because unlike the fox he spent no time peering at faded script in crumbling scrolls he grabbed the mace off his belt captain youd better look again whatever those things are you dont want em tending the sibyl what are you talking about they must be priests and they gerins voice broke off as squinting he did take another look he saw priests all right but they were down on the ground not one of them moving over them bent pallid shapes hard to make out against the white marble of the temple they didnt quite move or look like men though one of them raised his head and saw the wagon the bottom of hisitsface was smeared with red gerin didnt think the thing was hurt the blood around its mouth likelier said it had beenfeeding as van had seized the mace so gerin grabbed for his bow the pale bloodstained figure loped toward the wagon the fox remained unsure whether it was man or beast it carried itself upright on two legs but its forehead sloped almost straight back above the eyes which were small and themselves bloodred and its mouth was full of teeth more formidable than anything gerin had seen this side of a longtooth ice ran down his back the quake must have knocked down the underground walls the warded ones he exclaimed and these are the things the wards held back belike youre right van answered but whether you are or not dont you think youd better shoot that one before it gets close enough to take a bite out of us whatever it was eating before doesnt seem to have filled it staring at the pallid monster gerin had almost forgotten he was holding his bow he pulled an arrow from his quiver nocked drew and let fly in one smooth motion the monster made no effort to duck or dodge it might never have seen a bow before the arrow took it in the middle of its broad chest it clawed at the shaft screaming hoarsely then crumpled to the ground the scream drew the attention of a couple of other monsters how many of them had lived underground gerin wondered and for how long whatever the answer was the things were above ground now and looked to be out for revenge against the men who had forced subterranean life on them for so longand on any other men they could sink their teeth into before the monsters rushed the wagon a charge by a squad of temple guards distracted them they attacked the guardsmen with the ferocity of wild beasts the guards had spears and swords and armor of bronze and leather the monsters looked to be faster and stronger than anyone merely human gerin got but a brief glimpse of the fight which looked to be an even match if we mix ourselves up in that all well do is get killed he said to van more of those cursed things keep swarming up out of whats left of the temple well then lets snatch the sibyl and get out of here before they find her and figure shed make a tasty snack van said in other circumstances that would have seemed rough humor remembering the blood round the mouth of the monster hed shot gerin thought the outlander was just stating a probability he jumped down from the wagon when van reined in by the sibyls dwelling the door stood ajar perhaps knocked open by the earthquake gerin ran inside had the quake not thrown pots from shelves and lamps from tables the cottage would have reminded the fox of one inhabited by a prosperous peasant tapestries enlivened whitewashed walls the furniture looked better made than most that hadnt kept stools from falling down though or the clay oven in one corner of the cottage from cracking the sibyl lay on her bed unconscious still in the midst of chaos as gerin stepped toward her the ground trembled beneath his feet once more that was almost enough to send him fleeing out of the cottage in terror of offending biton but he reasoned earthquakes were not in the province of the farseeing god had he angered biton the deity would have shown his displeasure more directly he stooped beside the sibyl who still wore the thin linen dress shed had on in the chamber beneath the ruined temple he wondered if his touch would bring her to herself she stirred and muttered as he lifted her but her eyes stayed closed he hurried back out through the doorway good thing the monsters are still battling in there van said when he returned a wench in your arms is pleasant even if youre not having her but worthless to fight with scoffer gerin said but the rising noise of combat inside the temple precinct warned him he had no time to swap banter with van as gently as he could he set the sibyl in the back of the wagon again she muttered but did not wake he took his seat beside van snatched up his bow and quiver once more nocking another arrow he said let s get out of here right you are van twitched the reins the horses bolted ahead glad to have an outlet for their fear as the wagon rattled past a gap in the fence a monster came through gerin shot it it fell with a roar van pushed the horses up to a gallop skirting the burning town of ikos the wagon plunged into the old woods v not long after noon the sibyl came back to herself by then the travelers were more than halfway through the strange forest that guarded the road to ikos gerin had expected trees fallen across that road perhaps other signs of upheaval from the earthquake he discovered none as far as the woods were concerned the temblor might never have happened good van said when he remarked on that maybe the treesll swallow up those creatures too when they come swarming out of ikos wouldnt that be lovely gerin said likely too much to hope for though because he broke off as the wagon shifted under his fundament it wasnt as hed first feared yet another quake rather he found when he looked back into the bed of the wagon the sibyl had gone from lying to sitting up he nodded to her lady i bid you good day her eyes showed nothing but confusion you are the pair for whom i prophesied just now she said her voice also halting though it suited her appearance well hearing it once more gave gerin a small shock after biton had spoken through her hed almost forgotten she had a voice of her own not just now he said wondering how he could let her know what had happened while she lay unconscious that was yesterday you ve been in bitons trance for more than a whole day impossible it never takes me so she said angrily but a moment later she looked confused again yet if you do not speak truth why am i on the point of bursting halt a moment i pray you van reined in the horses glad of a breather began nibbling grass by the side of the road gerin got down and went around to the back of the wagon he held out a hand here lady ill help you down so you can ease yourself she recoiled as if hed proposed helping her down so he could ravish her are you mad she demanded in a voice like winter i may have no contact whatever with any entire man were i to do so id be sibyl no longer the fox sucked in a long breath she hadnt figured out how shed got into the wagon he could hardly blame her but it didnt make what he had to say come any easier lady i fear that to save your life i had to touch you the gods know im sorry for it but i saw no other way he repeated the oracular verse she had given him and explained the mornings horrors the more he talked the paler the sibyl grew lies she whispered it must be lies youve ruined me and now you seek to twist my own words against me and make me believe you did it for my own good her head whipped around like a hunted animals her eyes lit on the gold and ivory head of oren the builder gerin had thought she was already white as could be but discovered he was wrong youtook this she demanded and the lord biton did not strike you dead a flip answer came to gerins mind he stifled it before it passed his lips lady he did not when i took it it lay outside the bounds of the holy precinct as i said the earthquake knocked everything into confusion the temple itself no longer stands what happened to the chamber where you prophesied i could not say but the quake must have knocked down the warded walls that kept those monsters from coming to the surface van turned and said for all you know fox it might have been the other way round remember the bits of mortar we saw at the base of those walls when kinifor led us down to the lady the things might have been trying for years to breach the magic that held em in check and when they finally did it that couldve made the earth shake youre right it could have happened so gerin agreed but whichever way it was doesnt matter he gave his attention back to the sibyl ladyhave you a name by the way shed been listening to him and van talk back and forth as if they were madmen whose madnesses by chance coincided she snapped back to herself when the fox asked her that question but needed a moment to find an answer for it at last she said i was called selatre they took the name from me when i became bitons mouth but i recall it was mine the bitter curve of her lips was anything but a smile i may as well wear it again for thanks to you ill serve the god no more if all you say is true better you should have left me to die there lady selatre i pray im wrong but i dont think i am when i tell you the only things left alive in ikos by sunset tonight will be the ones that came out from under bitons fane how deep and wide the caves run how many monsters there arei know none of that but i couldnt leave you in your cottage to perish from their teeth and claws not when the question i put to you was what made you swoon away gerin said selatre said if you think saving me was a favor youre wrong lost polluted how can i hope to make my way in the world again now that youve taken away my reason for being you made your way in it before you were sibyl van said roughly and plenty of people go on living whove taken worse hurts than you go into the woods water the ferns and come back and well feed you bread and sausage and ale things always look cheerier with food in your belly and you must be hungry as a longtooth after sleeping the day around selatre sniffed at the homely advice but perhaps because nothing better occurred to her nodded after a moment gerin started to offer his hand again but the first motion made her shrink back with such dismay that he stopped before it was well begun instead he ostentatiously stepped away from the wagon and let her clamber down by herself what do we do if she tries to run to ikos on her own he whispered to van when she walked in among the bushes by the side of the road if the jades that foolish let her go the outlander answered me i dont think she is gerin got out the food van had promised the sibyl she took longer to come back than hed expected and he wondered if she had slipped away the idea of pursuing her through the uncanny forest was far from appealing but just when he was beginning to worry he might have to she returned her face unreadable he pointed to the meal hed fixed from the travel supplies but did not try to give it to her if she didnt want to be touched that was her affair she did manage a quiet word of thanks then fell on bread and sausage and onions and ale as if shed gone without food for ten or twenty days not just one she was still eating when faintly from far down the road to the west came a snarling roar that wasnt bear or longtooth or wolf or any beast gerin had heard before the hair on his arms and the back of his neck prickled up even so van said thats one of the things from the caves if you ask me selatre put down the piece of bread shed been gnawing a terrible sound she said shuddering ive heard it in my nightmares now perhaps i begin to believe you the innkeeper had said she seemed to be having evil dreams that was this morning gerin thought amazed it seemed an age ago in a different world given all that had changed between then and now maybe it was the fox said weve seen monsters in our dreams tooand seen them in the flesh today in the temple compound and if we dont want to see more of them in the flesh i think wed better get rolling again van said if i had to guess id say theyre likely not after us in particular right now just out exploring finding out what aboveground is like after being down below so long but if they come on us i dont think theyd stop with a cheery good day if you take my meaning gerin stood aside to let selatre scramble into the wagon by herself getting her back to fox keep was going to be awkward if she thought any accidental bump the equivalent of a violation of course if that was how she felt she was already convinced hed violated her and he couldnt do anything about it he chewed on the inside of his lower lip no time to worry about any of that now once they were safe away from ikos would be soon enough he said to van ill drive for a while now you can rest your head its all right the outlander answered since the ground started shaking i havent hardly noticed my poor aching noodle the same with me gerin said its not the cure for a long night of drinking id choose though nor i fox nor i van started to laugh but broke off another one of those snarling roars cut through the stillness of the woods the outlander yanked on the reins then reached around behind him into the wagon for the whip he cracked it just above the horses backs gerin thought that was laying it on thick the animals seemed alarmed enough to run hard just from the fierce sound of the roar selatre said have a care please you almost touched me when you were groping back here she sat huddled in a far corner as if certain van had intended to grope her ladyselatrewere not out to do you harm or throw you down in the roadway and have you or anything of the sort the outlander sounded as if he were holding on to his patience with both hands for one thing gerin and i both prefer willing wenches for another or if you think im lying about the first we could have had our way with you four times each before you woke up i know that she answered quietly any touch though pollutes me not just a lewd one lord gerin i grant you meant well when you plucked me from my cottage but id sooner you had not done it to lose that sense of union with the god to know he will never speak through me again because i am his pure vessel no more life stretches long and empty ahead of me the fox exhaled through his nose in impatient anger lord biton would have spoken through you no more whether we came to your dwelling or not if we hadnt youd have been monster fodder before another hour went by and that if you ask me is a short and empty life save perhaps when speaking about a monsters belly which would have been quite comfortably full he twisted around to see how selatre took that he didnt want to flay her with words after all she was suddenly cast into a situation shed never imagined and for which shed never prepared if hed hit too hard he was ready to backtrack and apologize but to his surprise she returned the ghost of a smile next to being devoured i suppose rescue may be a better choice very well i do not blame you for itmuch lady i thank you he could havegiven his nature he easily could havefreighted that with enough sarcasm to make it sting this time though it came out sincere the sibylno the exsibylwas trying to adjust he could at least do the same shadows were lengthening when they came out of the haunted forest that surrounded ikos and into woods like those in the rest of the northlands the transition point was easy to spot as soon as they returned to the normal woods the earthquake showed its effects again not least with a couple of toppled trees stretched across the roadway moving those trunks would have taken half a village of serfs van drove around them through the undergrowth as he did so he said wouldnt have wanted to try this back a ways you go in there who knows if you come out again i like that selatre said you were willing enough to send me off into those woods when i needed to make water did you hope you would be rid of me van coughed and spluttered no lady nothing like that at all if i thought of it at all i thought you were holy enough to have nothing to fear so i may have been once selatre said gloom returning no more they rode on a while in silence after that eyeing the sinking sun gerin said we might do well to look for that spot after we came through the free peasant village they wont know what were about until we roll past them early tomorrow morning if theyre not all downfallen from the quake van added only thing i worry about there captainnot counting the ghosts for weve little to give emis monsters on our trail the ghosts will keep them from traveling at night gerins voice trailed away i hope he finished realizing he had no way of knowing whatif anythingthe ghosts could do to the horrid creatures from the caves we cant go on traveling all night van said whether the ghosts let us or not wed ruin the horses maybe kill em so stoppings still our best plan and i think you picked a good place for it to the foxs admiration van recognized the little side road down which theyd turned a few nights before gerin recognized it tooonce he was on it but the landmarks looked different coming west from the way they had going east and he might well have driven right past the junction the outlander got busy making a fire bow in hand gerin walked through the woods in search of a blood offering for the ghosts when the light began to fade alarmingly before hed found either bird or beast he began turning over stones and pieces of bark he grabbed a fat longtailed lizard before it could scuttle back into hiding it twisted in his grasp and bit his finger hard enough to draw blood from him but he held on and swearing carried the creature to camp van gave it a dubious look thats the best you could come up with he asked and made as if to get up himself but the sun was down by then and the ghosts beginning to haver scowling against their cries he said cut its throat quick it has to be better than nothing gerin made the sacrifice then flipped away the lizards writhing body he peered down into the trench hed dug the blood seemed hardly enough to dampen the dirt at the bottom he wondered if he should have kept hunting till he found a creature with more to give the ghosts but in spite of the paltry offering the night spirits seemed no more vicious than they had at other times when hed camped in the open mildly puzzled but not inclined to complain at his good fortune he pulled a sack of supplies from the back of the wagon selatre accepted the small loaf of hardbaked bread he held out to her but was careful not to let her fingers brush his when she took it he forgot to be irked exclaiming lady i wonder if the holiness you bring from ikosthe last holiness left of ikos i fearisnt helping hold the ghosts at arms length i am holy no more she answered bleakly youre the sibyl no more true gerin said but i wonder if the other is so you didnt abandon biton he chose to leave you how could that be your fault she looked startled and did not answer she looked startled again when gerin and van drew straws to see who would take first watch and who second but shook her head at her own foolishness of course thats needful here she said half to herself who would do it for you we didnt bring any temple guards along thats certain van said he got up and paced about gerin had won his choice and decided to sleep through the first watch the outlander went on here lady you can take my blanket till i wake up the fox then i expect hell let you have his youre generous both of you the sibyl said watching gerin nod even so she made sure she placed herself on the far side of the fire from him before she wrapped the checked square of wool around her and settled down for the night van needed to shake and prod and practically pummel gerin before hed wake the outlander pointed over across the embers to selatre with a grin he said shes human enoughshe snores the grin disappeared now how am i supposed to wake her and get my blanket back without making her think ive got rape on my mind thats what she thinks of touching plain enough you can have mine if you like gerin said too small for my bulk you know mines bigger than the usual van said ill take it if i have to but id really like to roll up in my own gerin did some thinking with his wits midnightslow it wasnt easy at last though he said here i have it he rose creakily and poked around under a tree until he found a long dry stick then he went over to the sibyl and tapped her with it until she jerked awake and sat up how dare you lay hands on she began then she realized gerin hadnt laid hands on her faint firelight and the beams of all the moons but elleb which hadnt yet risen showed her confusion i see she said at last inclining her head to gerin your friend wants his blanket back not so and you found a way to let me know without touching me i wonder if i would have done as well she unwrapped herself and stood here you are van of the strong arm as van came to strip off his armor and claim the blanket selatre stepped back to make sure they didnt bump even by accident she looked away till he was settled then instead of taking gerins blanket at once she said let me walk off into the woods for a moment first she didnt go far because of the ghosts whose wails seemed to gerin to get worse while she was away and came back as fast as shed promised but van was snoring by the time she returned hed said selatre snored too but the fox doubted she came anywhere close to the thunderous buzz he produced the former sibyl wrapped herself in gerins blanket and wiggled around on the ground trying to find a comfortable position she kept squirming for some time while gerin walked back and forth waking up finally selatre said i cant sleep right now nothing too outoftheway about that i suppose not when you lay in your bed through the day and the night and into the next day again gerin said i can still hardly believe that selatre looked up into the sky after a moment gerin realized she was studying the moons when she spoke again her voice held wonder tiwaz is closer to math than he should be and has sped farther past golden nothos what you say there must be so which argues for the truth of the rest of your tale lady i told you no lies nor did van the fox was nettled here hed risked his life to save her and she still wondered if he was nothing more than a kidnapper that irritation came out in the sneer with which he said i trust you dont find yourself polluted by mere talk with a man she flinched as if hed slapped her by no means she answered tonelessly however she turned her back on him and started to wrap his blanket around her once more im sorry he said scraping a shallow trench in the ground with the hobnailed sole of his sandal i shouldnt have said that talk all you care to ill listen he wondered if shed pay any attention to him he would not have blamed her for ignoring him after that gibe but slowly she turned back to him eyeing him with the same grave attention shed given the moon not long before you will forgive me when i say that knowing little of men in general and barons in particular you strike me as unusual she asked his laugh held little mirth since everyone in the northlands says as much why should you be any different i meant no insult selatre said the word of you that came to ikos after biton laid his hand on me and made me sibyl held no reproach indeed you were on the whole well thought of for trying to hold to the standards of the empire of elabon even after elabon abandoned the northlands nice to know someone somewhere had some notion of what i was about gerin said more than my vassals do i think with a deliberate effort of will he forced his thoughts from that gloomy track and changed the subject how did it happen that biton chose you through whom to speak id known he might since i became a woman selatre answered for though i was normal in every other way my courses never began which is a sign of the farseeing ones notice in the villages round his shrine but bitons mouth on earth had served him so long i never dreamt he might one day call her to himself at lastor that his eye would fall on me to take her place how did you know you were the one he wanted gerin asked he came to me in a dream selatres eyes went far away looking through the fox rather than at him slowly she continued it was the realest dream the most lifelike you can imagine the godtouched me i may say no more ive never felt anything like that dream for realness save very much the opposite way with horror rather than delight the evil dreams ive had of late gerin nodded ive had those myself theyre worse than any ive known before thats the truth he wondered if she experienced them even more vividly because of her intimate contact with biton and things of the spirit generally not knowing any way to find an answer to that he chose a different question did you go and proclaim yourself at the temple then no i would have but the very next day the priests came to my village instead biton had sent some of them dreams of me and they sought me out ah the fox said had the dream come to selatre alone he might have thought it sprang from her imagination but if the priests also knew the farseeing god had chosen her to succeed the ancient sibyl not much room was left to doubt biton had sent it endlessly curious the fox found a chance to put a question hed never expected to be able to ask what is it like when biton speaks through you what do you feel or think or whatever the word is its notlikeanything else i know selatre answered when the mantic fit takes hold of me of course i know nothing at all i always have to ask the priest if one is there with me what my response was but while the gods power is coming over me before he takes me fully she didnt go on not with words but she shivered and her eyes were full of longing at last she added and now no more never again no more her voice wept suddenly gerin believed in his belly that she would sooner have died than be rescued at the cost of losing that link with biton it struck him as almost like losing a lover or a husband but with the temple cast down and monsters loose on the northlands the link was surely lost anyhow had he not believed that he would have drowned in guilt maybe selatre conceded the point however reluctantly for she said and now that it is to be no more what lord gerin do you see life holding for me at fox keep what would you have me do gerin had his mouth open to reply before he realized he had no idea what to say what place had he had the keep for bitons former sibyl serving woman apt to be pawed by his vassals and his guests could she return to peasant life after time spent with the god he doubted it and then just as he was about to confess ignorance inspiration struck do you have your letters he asked nobiton spoke to me direct not through scribblings she answered but i always thought i might like to learn id be glad to teach you he said one of the things that goes into keeping up the standards of the empire of elabon as you called it is having a grasp of time and place that goes farther than what youor i or anyonecan keep in your head the more people who read and write the more who can get that wide knowledge civilization needs i teach as many folk as i can as may be selatre said but what has it to do with whatever my life at castle fox would become i have a fair store of books at the keep gerin answered oh any bibliophile south of the kirs would laugh himself silly to hear it called such but i do have several dozen scrolls and codices and i get new onesold ones other folk dont care about most of the timenow and again i had in mind for you if you think it would suit to take charge of them learn whats in them and where it can be found make new copies as theyre needed or if someone asks for such not likely i admit in the state the northlands are in but stranger things have happened what say you she was silent a long time so long he began to fear hed somehow insulted her after all even if hed just intended to find her a place where she could be useful and one that might keep her from some of what she would surely see as indignities then at last she said i am not ashamed to tell you i must apologize lord gerin why he asked startled for what in spite of everything youve said you have to understand i had trouble fully crediting your reasons for snatching me from ikos she answered once you had me back at fox keep who could guess what you might do with me in truth i could guess and my guesses frightened me her laugh came shaky but it was a laugh and instead of putting me in your bed youd put me in your library do you wonder that i needed a moment before i found a way to answer you oh gerin said put that way no he too took a while groping for words before he went on lady enough women are willing that forcing one whos not has always struck me as more trouble than its worth but folk who have wits and can use them are precious as the tin that hardens copper to bronze i judge you may be one of that sort if you are by dyaus ill use you fair and more than fair she said then seemed to surprise herself with a yawn perhaps i shall sleep more after all my heart is easier than i thought it could be im glad of that gerin said as she wrapped herself in his blanket again she seemed to have forgotten the creatures still issuing from the cave under bitons temple he remembered but forbore to remind her let her rest easy while she could the free peasant village whose men had hunted gerin and van through the night on their way to ikos was a sorry place when they and selatre rode up to it at midmorning the next day half the houses had fallen down in the earthquake several bodies lay sprawled and stiff on the grass awaiting burial if theyd built stronger theyd have come through better van said unwilling to waste much sympathy on folk who would have robbed and maybe murdered him maybe so gerin said but maybe not too stronger houses might still have fallenlook at bitons temple and if they did theyd have crushed whoever was inside them this way a lot of people probably managed to crawl out of the wreckage mm something to that maybe van admitted all the same i wont be sorry to see this place behind me he started to urge the horses up from a walk to a trot no wait gerin said which made the outlander grunt in surprise and send him a disbelieving look he explained the lady there has but the one linen dress which is all very well for prophesying in but not what youd want to wear day in and day out i was thinking we might stop and buy another here something of sturdy wool that would do until we got back to castle fox ah theres sense to you after all there usually is but this time i wondered van reined in several of the villagers were in the fields earthquake or no tragedies or no the endless routine of tillage had to go on the women and children and few men who stayed by the houses swarmed toward the travelers wagon noble sirs spare us such aid in our misfortunes as you can give a woman cried others said the same thing in different words the fox stared down his nose at them by dyaus youre better disposed to us now than you were when you came after us in the night to take our armor and swords and mace van added hefting the viciously spiked weapon in question if the peasants had any thoughts of trying to attack now the bloodred reflections of the sun off those bronze spikes did a good job of dissuading them the older man whod sold the travelers a hen spoke for his people lords we all have to live as best we can so i shant go grizzling out imsorries though i expect you wish the five hells would take us but would you see us cast down like this you dont have it as bad as some gerin said the temple at ikos crashed in ruins yesterday the peasants wailed some in genuine horror and distress others gerin judged in fear that with the temple ruined no one would ever again use the road from the elabon way to ikos that was he thought a good guess he went on in aid of which i present to you the lady selatre who was till yesterday the sibyl at ikos and whom we rescued from the wreckage of the place the villagers gasped and exclaimed all over again the fox got down from the wagon to let selatre descend withoutthe gods forfendtouching him van shifted on the seat to make her way out easy the peasants stared at her and muttered among themselves at last one of them called to her lady though the temple be fallen why did you not stay and wait for its repair selatre cast down her eyes and did not answer gerin looked for some gentle way to break the news of the eruption of the monsters from the caves below the fane while he was looking van who minced few words said if shed stayed shed have been eaten the same is liable to happen to the lot of you in the next few days so youd better listen to what we have to say he and gerin as was their way took turns telling the tale of what had happened back at ikos when they were through the fellow from whom theyd bought the chicken who seemed to be a village spokesman said if you didnt have the sibyl with you id reckon you were makin up the tale to pay us back with a fright for wanting to lift the bronze off you and since the lady is here what do you believe gerin demanded in no small exasperation youll find out soon enough whether we lie i can tell you that youve made a point of getting arms and armor however you do it when those creatures come youll need them dont leave them sitting wherever youve got them hidden wear the mail and take the spears and swords out into the fields with you take bows too van said these monsters arent what youd call clever from the little we saw of em they dont know arrows every one you kill from long range is one you wont have to fight up close id say theyre stronger and faster than people and they have nasty teeth the details the fox and van gave were enough to begin to convince the villagers they werent just trying to frighten them maybe well do as you say the old man said after looking over his comrades do whatever you bloody well please gerin said if you dont care about your necks dont expect me to do your worrying for you all id like to do before i get out of here is buy a proper wool dress for the lady ill pay silver for it too though the gods alone know why im dealing justly with folk who aimed to deal unjustly with me when he said silver three or four women ran into their housesthose that still stoodand brought out dresses none of them seemed to the fox to stand out from the others he turned to selatre she felt of them and examined the stitching with the air of a woman who had done plenty of her own spinning and weaving and sewing gerin remembered she had been a peasant before she was sibyl she knew of such things this one she said at last the woman whod produced it tried to set a price more or less equal to its weight in silver gerin who parted with precious metal reluctantly at best let out a loud scornful laugh we dont have to buy here he reminded her other villages must have seamstresses whove not been stricken mad after that she quickly got more reasonable he ended up buying the dress with only a slight wince have you also a pair of drawers you might sell selatre asked the woman shook her head dont wear em but in winter to help keep my backside warm selatre shrugged likely it had been the same where she grew up too do you want to put the dress on here where youll have more in the way of privacy gerin asked her id not thought of that she said thank you for doing it for me she ducked into one of the peasant huts soon returning wearing the wool dress and with the linen one under her arm some of the aura of the sibyls cave left her with the change of clothes she seemed more intimately a part of the world around her not so much a waif cast adrift by circumstance maybe she felt that too she sighed as she stepped around gerin to stow the linen dress in the wagon its as if im putting away part of my past the gods willing you have long years left ahead of you gerin answered he meant it as no more than a polite commonplace but it set him wondering with monsters not only loose on the world but emerging from the ruins of bitons temple who could judge the will of the gods van spoke to the villagers remember what we told you now how sorry youll be in a few days depends on whether you listen to us or not you take no notice today you wont have the chance to be sorry and wish youd paid heed and the lot of you youre just driving away and leaving the trouble behind your wheels said the older peasant who spoke for the peasants he had some reason to sound bitter peasants stayed with their land a journey to the next village was something strange and unusual for them but gerin said if what i fear is true youll just see the creatures before us there may well be enough to torment all the northlands he did not convince the peasant who said aye but youre a lord you can hide behind your stone walls he gestured to the buildings of the village some of them fallen and even those still standing none too strong look at the forts we have to that the fox found no good reply once selatre was aboard the wagon he climbed in too van clucked to the horses and flicked the reins the animals snorted and began to walk the wagon rolled out of the peasant village when theyd gone a couple of furlongs selatre said the man back there was right he and his have no way to shelter against the creatures that come forth against them i know gerin answered sadly i have nothing i can do about it though did i stay to fight id die and so would they and so id do them no good and myself only harm i saw as much selatre said otherwise id not have waited to speak until the villagers could not hear but thats a callous way to have to look at the world lady the worlds a hard place van said begging your pardon but im thinking youve not seen a whole lot of it well now you will and much of what you see i fear will leave you less than joyful selatre didnt answer gerin couldnt tell whether that was because she disagreed with van but was too polite to say so or because she agreed but didnt care to admit it his opinion of her good sense had risen a notch though for the way shed held her tongue where speaking out would have embarrassed him they returned to the elabon way that afternoon selatre exclaimed in pleasure at seeing bitons mark on the stone that marked the side road then remembering what had happened back at ikos she sobered once more gerin said im sorry the stone reminded you of the temple but i must say youre taking it bravely in part i suppose what happened back there still seems unreal not least because i wasnt awake to see and feel it myself she answered and i lived most of my life in a village not much different from the one we went through i know life can be hard van urged the horses onto the stone slabs of the elabon way the drum of their hoofbeats so different from the muffled clopping theyd made on the dirt side road caught selatres notice she exclaimed in wonder heres a marvel who would have thought you could cover over a roadway and use it the whole year around no mud here thats why they made it so gerin agreed you catch on fast the work it must have taken selatre said how far does it run from the kirs up to the niffet the fox said in the old days they could command and have folk heed he clicked his tongue between his teeth remembering the troubles he had keeping the stretch of the elabon way under his control even partly and poorly repaired van said seems to me captain every time we come north toward your holding were in the midst of trouble last time we were heading into the teeth of the trokmoi and now were stormcrows ahead of thosethingscoming out of ikos wed better stay ahead of them too gerin said otherwise we wont make it back to fox keep he pointed to the horses we have to get the best we can from them without making them break down getting stuck somewhere could prove downright embarrassing thats one word for it van said and a politer one than id choose too gerin had hoped to reach some lordlets castle by nightfall all at once the idea of sleeping behind walls too high to be easily climbed developed a new and urgent appeal but the approach of sunset found the wagon on the road with no keep in sight only a peasant village the fox glumly bought a chicken and pushed the horses forward until the first stirrings of the ghosts reluctantly made him stop no sooner than we start out tomorrow well ride past three keeps he grumbled as van spun his firebow the outlander made fire with his usual skill gerin killed the fowl drained its blood as an offering then gutted it and did a hasty job of plucking before he cut it in pieces for cooking thats the way of things captain so it is van agreed he turned to selatre ah thank you ladyis that wild basil youve found yes she set the herb on the ground so he could pick it up and rub the chicken with it before he put the meat over the flames gerin drew first watch selatre curled up in his blanket and tonight fell asleep almost at once when she began to snore something van had mentioned but not a noise the fox had thought to associate with someone a god sometimes possessed the outlander sat up gerin jerked in alarm i thought you were gone too he said reproachfully i nearly was before i thought of something that woke me right up again van said mind you fox im not saying a word against aught youve done since the earthquakeyoud best understand that but what is it gerin asked suspicion in his voice anyone who prefaced his remarks by denying he was going to criticize always ended up doing just that well captain all well and good we rescued the sibyl here even if she wont let herself be touched by the likes of us all well and goodbetter than well and goodyouve figured out a place for her at castle fox if she picks up her letters as you hope but were bringing back with us a lass whos young and not the least comely ive seenand what will sweet fand say to that oh father dyaus gerin didnt know in detail the answer to that question but contemplating it was plenty to make his head start aching shell wonder which of us aims to throw her out of the keep and she wont think a fingers breadth past thatwhich will end up tempting me to throw her out even if the notion hadnt crossed my mind till now just what i was thinking captain hard to have lustful thoughts about a woman whod turn blue if you brushed her hand while you passed her a drumstick but will fand see it the same way i ask you not likely one of the serfs in besants village was a decent potter not for any fancy ware but for serviceable cups and jars gerin had the feeling hed be busy soon when fand got upset crockery started flying the fox scowled at his friend thank you so much i wasnt going to have any trouble staying awake through my watch anyhow now i wonder if ill ever sleep again van started to bark laughter then abruptly stopped might not be safe sleeping in the same bedchamber and thats a fact seeing how she stuck a knife into that trokme mmthere is that gerin tried to look on the bright side maybe shell take it all in good part or maybe shell be so offended when we bring in selatre that shell get up on her hind legs and take the next boat over the niffet since when did fand ever make anything easy outside the bedroom i mean van said he didnt wait for an answerwhich was as well for gerin had none to give himbut lay down again and soon began to snore loud enough to drown out selatre after a while what precisely had happened at ikos began to blur in gerins mind with the tale he told of it at every peasant village and lords holding up along the elabon way the disbelief he met was so strong that sometimes he began to doubt his own memory only when he looked to the former sibyl at his side was he reassured he hadnt imagined it all theyre a pack of fools van said after the travelers rolled out of the keep of one of ricolfs vassals oh i dont know gerin answered resignedly had someone come to fox keep with our tale would you have believed it theyll find out soon enough whether were telling the truth van said and theyll be sorry they think we arent the outlanders pique lasted through a midday meal at the holding of ricolf himself van though so loved to spin stories that telling ricolf about what had happened at ikos restored his good humor ricolf said aye we felt the quake here and lost crockery in it but id not looked for word so weighty as what you bring seeing his former fatherinlaw at least willing to take him seriously gerin said youd be wise to start thinking of ways to keep your peasants safe from the monsters as they spread either by making sure they have a keep they can flee to or by posting armed men among em ah fox you should have been a schoolmaster after all ricolf said smiling not quite enough to take the sting from his words you re so good at telling everyone else what he should do if only youd try telling yourself as well whats that supposed to mean gerin said instead of answering directly ricolf got up from the table and walked out of the long hall into the courtyard gerin followed him ricolf paused by the well gerin started feeling foolish as he walked up to him if the older baron wanted to make a pleasantry at his expense he should have ignored it but he hadnt and now hed lose more face by turning around and walking away than by going on what did you mean by that he repeated i believe you may not know so ill answer straight ricolf said anything at all can happen to a person once the gods delight in keeping us confused so we remember were not so wise nor so strong as they are but when a man does something twice that says more about him than about the way the knucklebones fall you call that a straight answer gerin said dyaus preserve me from a twisty one thenor biton if you aim to take the sibyls station now that shes let go of it the sibyl enters in sure enough ricolf answered leaning back against the stonework of the well this is the second time now fox youve snatched away women you had no proper business taking elise being the first gerin exhaled in annoyance what was i supposed to do ricolf leave the sibyl to be devoured by thosethings if id come here with that tale youd have found some other way to connect it to your daughter and to blame me for it its not as if im in love with selatre as i recall you werent in love with elise either not when you took off with her ricolf said you were just bearing her to her uncle south of the kirs but those things have a way of changing ricolf however our holdings have sometimes rubbed these past few years have i ever used you with less than the courtesy any man owes the father of his wife gerin asked he waited for ricolf to shake his head before he went on then within that courtesy i have to tell you youve got your head stuck right in the dung heap he took a wary step back if ricolf drew blade on him he wanted room in which to fight he had no great worries about holding off the older baron but he wanted to be able to hold him off in a way which suggested to ricolfs warriors that he wasnt trying to murder their overlord merely protect himself ricolf stared as if he doubted his own ears a flush turned his face as red as his hair had once been elise had had skin like that the fox rememberedtransparent as a trokmes then to gerins relief a snort escaped his lips and turned into a guffaw all right fox you win that one ricolf wheezed but he added for now anyhow a year or two down the road well see who laughs last oh go howl gerin said im done im done ricolf pacifically held up his hands dyaus forbid i should try to tell you anything when you already know all thats been written or thought by every wise man since the gods decided theyd like to have a ball they could kick around and made the world to give themselves something interesting to do besides swiving one another i mean and if that gets stale for a man after a while it likely does for the gods too not by the tales that are told of them gerin answered but he let it go at that ricolf waxing philosophical struck him as unlikely enough to make a challenge unwise and indeed ricolfs next words were utterly mundane with all this hurrah behind you youll be all in a sweat to get back to fox keep so i dont suppose youll stay the night youll be wanting a trussed fowl then or some such to hold the ghosts out of your head aye that would be kind of you the fox agreed do you know though selatre seems to calm themnot altogether but partwayby herself i suppose its because she was bitons intimate for so long does she ricolfs tone irked gerin but not enough to make him rise to it the older baron shrugged and said ill see what sort of bird the kitchen crew can scare up for you instead of a hen ricolfs cooks presented gerin with a trussed duck that tried to bite his hand and quacked furiously when he stowed it in the back of the wagon it kept quacking too cant say as i blame it van remarked as he got onto the wagons seat himself i wouldnt be happy if anybody did that to me either can you tie something around its beak gerin asked selatre when the duck went right on making a racket after the wagon rolled out of ricolfs keep and headed up the elabon way once more oh let it squawk what else can it do poor thing selatre said since she was in the back of the wagon with it and had to endure more of the noise than gerin did and since van had already said more or less the same thing the fox let her have her way nonetheless by the time the sun neared the western horizon he looked forward to lopping off the ducks head for more reasons than just keeping the ghosts happy when they stopped to camp for the night he steered the wagon off the road to a little pond that had enough saplings growing close by to screen it away from the casual glance of anyone on the road by night van got down and began gathering dry leaves and twigs for tinder gerin descended too he went around to the back of the wagon and said to selatre hand me out that pestiferous duck if you please well eat him tonight but hes already had his revenge my head aches the exsibyl seemed merely practical not oracular as she picked up the duck by the feet and held it out to gerin warning be careful as you take him hell do his best to bite he wont just quack i know trying to take the duck from selatre without touching her as he did so didnt make things any easier for gerin but he managed and didnt bother mentioning the extra awkwardness if that was how selatre was going to be hed accept it as best he could once he had the duck he set it on the ground he made himself stand by and not offer selatre a hand as she got down from the wagon wondering all the while how long hed need before not offering aid became automatic for him then selatre stumbled over a root exclaimed and started to fall altogether without thinking gerin jumped forward and steadied her thank you she said but then stopped in confusion and jumped back from him as if he were hot as molten bronze im sorry he said though apologizing for having kept her from hurting herself struck him as absurd she shivered as she looked down at the arm hed grabbed then nodded with the same sort of deliberation gerin had shown when he kept himself from helping her down a few moments before its all right she said however much i try to stay away from them these things will happen now that im so rudely cast into the world i may as well do my best to get used to them the fox bowed lady on brief acquaintance i thought you had good sense everything you dothis especiallytells me i was right does it selatres laugh came shaky if thats so why do i feel as if im casting away part of myself not adding on anything new and better change any change often feels like a kick in the teeth gerin answered when the trokmoi killed my father and my elder brother and left me lord of fox keep i thought the weight of the whole world had landed on my shoulders i aimed to be a scholar not a baron and then he broke off then what selatre asked gerin wished hed managed to shut up a few words earlier but hed raised the subject so he felt he had to answer then a few years ago my wife ran off with a horseleech leaving me to raise our boy as best i could his kidnapping was what made me come to ikos yes youve spoken of that selatre nodded as if reminding herself but if you hadnt come by everything else youve told me the creatures that dwelt in the caves under bitons temple would have killed and eaten me after the earthquake if the earthquake would have happened had i not come gerin said remembering the words of doom in the last prophecy biton had issued through selatres mouth van came around the wagon ive already got the fire going he announced are you going to finish off that duck or do you aim to stand around jabbering until the ghosts take away what few wits you have left he turned to selatre take no notice of him lady when he gets into one of his sulks give him a silver lining as you did and hell make a point of looking for its cloud to the hottest of the five hells with you gerin said van only laughed the nettle hed planted under gerins hide stung the worse for bearing a large measure of truth the fox dug a trench in the ground with his dagger then drew sword and put an end to the ducks angry squawking with a stroke that might have parted a mans head from his shoulders much less a birds he drained the ducks blood into the trench for the ghosts van took charge of the carcass itll be greasy and gamy but what can you do he said as he opened the belly to get rid of the entrails gamy or no i like the flavor of duck selatre said duck eggs are good too they have more taste than those from hens thats so but hens are easier to care forjust let em scavenge like pigs gerin said he glanced around even though we were slow with the offering the ghosts are still very quiet lady i think thats your doing no matter that we happened to touch again selatre cocked her head to the side listening to the ghosts as they wailed and yammered inside her head you may be right she said after shed taken their measure i remember them louder and more hateful than this when i was still living in my village before biton made me his sibyl but i am sibyl no more the god himself said as much and your touch sealed it she shook her head in confusion the dark hair that had spilled over one shoulder flew out wildly gerin said i dont think holiness is something you can blow out like a lamp it doesnt so much matter that i touched youcertainly i didnt do it with lust in my heart or aiming to pollute you what matters is that the god touched you my touch is gone in an instant bitons lingers selatre thought about that and slowly nodded her finely molded features thoughtful watching her in the firelight gerin decided van had been right she was attractive enough to make fand jealous was she more attractive than the trokme woman their looks were so different the comparison didnt seem worthwhile but that it had even crossed his mind made him wonder if ricolf hadnt been wiser back at his keep than the fox had thought at the time he scowled angry at himself for so much as entertaining that notion selatre said whats wrong you look as if you just bit into something sour before he could come up with anything plausible van saved the day calling come over here by the fire both of you and bite into something thats going to be gamy and greasy like i said before but better all the same than a big empty curled up and purring in your belly the duck was just as van had predicted it would be but gerin fell to gratefully even so a full mouth gave him the excuse he needed for not answering selatres question and a full belly helped him almostif not quiteforget the thoughts which had prompted that question in the first place the wagon came out from behind the last stand of firs that blocked the view toward castle fox there it is gerin said pointing not a fortress to rival the ones the elabonian emperors built in the pass south of cassat but its held for many long years now the gods willing itll go on a bit longer selatre leaned forward in the rear of the wagon to see better though she was still careful not to brush against the fox or van why are most of the timbers of the palisade that ugly faded green she said van chuckled the lady has taste so she does gerin refused to take offense and answered the question in the spirit in which he hoped it had been asked it was a paint a wizard put on them to keep another wizard from setting them afire ah selatre said thin in the distancegerin did not allow trees and undergrowth to spring up anywhere near the keep if anyone set ambushes hed be that onea horn from the watchtower said the wagon had been seen he twitched the reins and rode forward with a curious mixture of anticipation and dread seeing his comrades again would be good and perhaps some of them had word of duren but the trouble he expected from fand cast a shadow over the homecoming we were free peasants in the village where i grew up we owed no lord service selatre said not much of what we heard about elabonian barons was good and i came to have a poor opinion of the breed you tempt me to think i may have been wrong gerin shrugged barons are men like any others some of us are good some bad some both mixed together like most people im bright enough for instance but i worry too much and im overly solitary my vassal drago the bear whom youll meet isnt what you call quick of wit and he hates anything that smacks of change but hes brave and loyal and has the knack of making his own people like him and wolfar of the axe whos dead now was vicious and treacherous if you ask me but hed never shrink from a fight as i say were a mixed bag you speak of yourself as if you were someone else selatre said i try sometimes to think of myself that way the fox answered it keeps me from making too much of myself in my own mind the fellow whos sure he cant possibly go wrong is usually the one whos likeliest to a couple of men came out of the gate and waved to the approaching wagon squat drago with slim rihwin beside him any luck lord drago called raising his voice to a shout what did the sibyl say rihwin asked also loudly were still the ripple of news furthest out from where the rock went into the pond van said so we are gerin nodded adding i like the picture your words call to mind behind them and in every other direction others would also be spreading word of what had happened at ikos soon the whole of the northlands would know but for now there was a dividing line between those who did and those who didnt and he and van were on it he raised his voice in turn to answer his vassals by your leave ill tell the tale in the great hall and not sooner that way ill have to retell it only once and theres a good deal to it is that duren in the wagon behind you rihwin asked dragos sight had begun to lengthen as he aged today that served him well no loon he said thats a man grown no i take it backa woman the fox didnt blame him for sounding surprised rihwins agile wits let him leap to a conclusion that wouldnt have occurred to drago youve caught up with elise he said loudly did she steal the boy away lord gerin that his wits were agile of course didnt necessarily mean he was right at that moment gerin wished hed kept quiet the rumor would be all over the keep all over the serf villages and would spread faster than the truth could follow it no its not elise he said even louder than rihwin had spoken this is the lady selatre who up till bare days ago was bitons sibyl at ikos warriors up on the palisade whod already begun to gossip about rihwins speculation abruptly fell silent then they started buzzing again more busily than before maybe rihwins wild guess wouldnt go everywhere after all gerin thought the truth was so much stranger that it might take precedence he drove the wagon over the drawbridge and into the keep then got down from it van slipped off from the other side they both stood back to let selatre descend with no risk of touching either of them gerin introduced his vassals to her one by one he wondered how good shed be at matching unfamiliar names to equally unfamiliar faces that often gave him trouble but she coped well enough and showed she knew who was who when she spoke to the men the fox was impressed widin simrins son asked the question they all had to be thinking uh lord gerin how did you come to have the holy sibyl riding with you you felt the earthquake a few days past gerin asked in turn heads bobbed up and down drago said aye we did lord like to scare the piss out of me it did we lost some pots too and spilled ale from a couple of broken jars he sighed in sorrow at the misfortune then he scratched his head has that aught to do with the lady here it has everything to do with the lady here gerin said van nodded the crimson horsehair plume on his helm drawing eyes to him the fox went on lets all go into the great hall i hope not all the ale spilled he waited until reassured on that before finishing good for ill need a mug or two to ease my throat as iand van and the lady selatretell you what happened and why shes here he waved toward the entrance to the castle drago and widin and rihwin and the rest hurried inside selatre waited till theyd gone through the door before she too went in even if shed consciously decided not to let getting touched every once in a while bother her she aimed to avoid it where she could gerin did not go into the great hall until even selatre was inside he told himself that was politeness and so it was but it was also anxiety he put off for a moment the likelihood of confronting fand he knew that was foolish putting off trouble even for a little while wasnt worth the effort and often made it worse when it finally came but knowing that and facing up to a screaming fight with fand were two different things at last bracing himself as if walking into a winter wind he walked into the great hall his stiff pose eased as his eyes adjusted to the gloom within fand had to be still upstairs took you long enough van rumbled though he no doubt had the same concern if youd stayed out there much longer the ale wouldve been drunk by the time you got around to joining us cant have that gerin went over to the jar and dipped a jack full he wet his throat then told what had happened on the way to ikos and after he and van had got there his vassal barons muttered angrily when he spoke of the peasants whod hunted him in the night he shook his head i was angry at the time too but it all fades away when you set it alongside what came later he spoke of the trip down to the sibyls cave and of the disturbing oracular response biton had delivered through selatres lips his listeners muttered again this time with the same dread hed felt when those doomfilled words washed over him selatre broke in i remember lord gerin and van coming into my underground chamber but nothing after that for the mantic trance had possessed me gerin went on with the rest of the story selatres continued and abnormal unconsciousness the meeting with aragis in the temple the carouse afterwards now that his hangover was gone van grinned in fond memory and the earthquake the next morning sometime while he was going through all that fand came down and sat beside drago the bear maybe the vassal barons bulk kept gerin from spotting her right away or maybe hed kept from looking toward the stairs on purpose but she leaned forward when he spoke of the monsters that had emerged from the ruins of bitons temple again he had his listeners complete and dismayed attention fand kept quiet while he spoke of the battle the creatures had had with the temple guards in the sacred precinct then he said wed gone back there van and i because our innkeeper said the sibyl still hadnt come to her senses after the quake we feared her cottage would burn like so many buildings in the town of ikos since wed been responsible for pitching her into the fit we thought we should make amends for it if we could as it happened her dwelling hadnt caught fire but the monsters would have made short work of her if we hadnt got there when we did fand stirred but still did not speak selatre said i woke up in their wagon some hours later with my world turned all topsyturvy actually hearing selatre seemed to draw fands notice to her the trokme woman leaned forward her chin on her hands intently studying the former sibyl then to gerins dismay she got to her feet and looked from him to van in a voice low but no less menacing because of that she said and which of you was it now who was after wanting to trade me for the first new bit o baggage you chanced upon like a wandering tinker mending a pot in exchange for a nights rest and a bit o bread in the morning now lass didnt you listen to the fox van usually had no trouble with women but now he sounded nervous which didnt help it wasnt her body we had designs on just saving her life likely tell fand snarled sure and youd have been just as eager to go back for her had she been old and toothless not young and toothsome sure and you would gerin had thought himself the most sarcastic soul in the northlands saying one thing and meaning another was a subtle art more often practiced south of the high kirs but wherever fand had picked it up she was dangerously good at it and her furious question made the fox ask himself if he would have headed back toward the fane to rescue selatres crone of a predecessor he had to admit he didnt know and that troubled him is this your wife lord gerin thinking im some sort of menace to her selatre asked i hope that is not so now she looked as if she doubted anew all the assurances shed come to trust on the road north from ikos my leman rather and vans the fox answered selatre raised an eyebrow at his domestic arrangements but he ignored that hed worry about it later fand as usual was immediate trouble to her he said ill thank you to keep a civil tongue in your head by the gods i did what i did for the reasons i said i did it and if you dont fancy that you can pack up and leave och youd like that now wouldnt you fand was lowvoiced no more her screech drove drago from the seat close by her well lord gerin the foxand you too you overthewed oafthis to vanyoull not be rid of me so easy as that indeed and you wont use me and cast me forth will you she picked up her drinking jack and threw it at gerin it was half full a trail of ale like a comets tail followed it as it flew the fox had been expecting it so he ducked in good timeyou needed battlehoned reflexes to live with fand van tried again now lass she snatched the dipper out of the jar of ale and flung it at him it clanged off the bronze of his cuirass he was vain about his gear he looked down in regret and anger at the ale that dripped to the floor i ought to heat your backside for that he said and took a step forward as if to do it on the spot aye come ahead thrash me fand fleered and stuck out the portion of her anatomy he had threatened then tomorrow or the day after or the day after that youll be all sweet and poke that cursed oneeyed snake o yours in my faceand ill bite down hard enough to leave you no moren a newborn wean has dyou think i wouldnt by the appalled look he wore van thought she would he turned to gerin for help in quelling this mutiny the fox didnt know what to say either he wondered if fand would storm out of the castle or if hed have to throw her out he didnt really want to do that for all her hellish temper he liked having her around and not just because he slept with her till duren was kidnapped shed watched over him as tenderly as if shed given birth to him her wits were sharp too as he sometimes found to his discomfort right now though he wouldnt have minded putting a hard hand to her behind if only hed thought that would make matters better unfortunately he thought it would make them worse if force wouldnt help and she wouldnt listen to reason what did that leave he wished he could come up with something then selatre got to her feet she dropped a curtsy to fand as if the trokme woman had been empress of elabon and said lady i did not come here intending to disrupt your household in any way on that i will take oath by any gods you choose i am virgin in respect of men and have no interest in changing my estate there as lord gerin and van of the strong arm both know any touch from an entire man would have left me religiously defiled beforebefore biton abandoned me her brief hesitation showed the pain she still felt at that i tell you once more i am not one like to steal either of your men from you where gerin and van had fanned fands fury selatre seemed to calm her och lass im not after blaming you she said by all twas said you had not even your wits about you when these two great loons snatched you away but what you intend and what will be oftentimes theyre not the same at all at all think you i intended to cast my lot with southron spalpeens im no southron van said with some dignity youre no trokme either fand said to which the outlander could only nod but fand wasnt screaming any more she just sounded sad maybe over the way her life had turned out maybeunlikely though that seemed to gerinregretting her show of temper and what am i selatre said she answered her own question i was the gods servant and proud and honored he had chosen me through whom to speak but now he has left me and so i must be nothing she hid her face in her hands and wept gerin was helpless with weeping women maybe that explained why he got on with fand as well as he didinstead of weeping she threw things he knew how to respond to that he hadnt known what to do when elise cried either and suddenly wondered if that had been one of the things that made her leave he looked to van who made an art of jollying women into good spirits but van looked baffled too he jollied women along mostly to get them into bed with him when faced with a virgin who wanted to stay such he was at a loss finally the fox went into the kitchens and came back with a bowl of water and a scrap of cloth he set them in front of selatre here wash your face he said she gulped and nodded van beamed which made gerin feel good he might not have done much but hed done something it was a start vi a chariot came pounding up the road toward fox keep the driver was whipping the horses on so hard that the car jounced into the air at every bump threatening to throw out him and his companion lord gerin lord gerin the archer cried the fox happened to be on the palisade he stared down in dismay at the rapidly approaching chariot he was afraid he knew what news the onrushing warriors bore but he had been back in fox keep only five days himself hed hoped he might have longer to prepare hopes and reality too often parted company though what word he called to the charioteer and his passenger they didnt hear him over the rattling of the car and the pound of the horses hooves or spy him on the wall the chariot roared into the courtyard of the keep the driver pulled back on the reins so sharply that both horses screamed in protest one tried to rear which might have overturned the chariot the lash persuaded the beast to keep all four feet on the ground at any other time gerin would have reproved the driver for using the horses so he believed treating animals mildly got the best service from them now as he hurried down from the walkway across the wall such trivial worries were far from his mind what word he repeated tomril digan what word tomril brokennose tossed the whip aside and jumped out of the chariot lord gerin im here to tell you i beg your pardon he said you didnt come close to killing your team for that the fox answered oh but we did lord prince digan sejans son said tomril and i we both thought you were babbling like a night ghost when you came up the elabon way warning folk of those halfman halfbeast things that were supposed to have gotten loose from under some old temple or other but now weve seen em lord gerin tomril broke in his eyes wide theyre ugly theyre mean theyve got a taste for blood now gerin interrupted and they must be up at the bottom of bevons barony by now or you wouldnt have seen them what news do you have from ricolfs holding about what youd expect tomril answered theyre loose there too the cursed things and ripping serf villages to bits oh a pestilence gerin said wearily if theyre in ricolfs holding and bevons theyll be here too how are the peasants supposed to grow crops if theyre liable to be killed in the fields or torn to pieces in their beds curse me if i know the answer to that one tomril said things ive seen things ive heard make me think these creatures are worse than the trokmoi and harder to get rid of too they dont care a fart about loot neither digan chimed in they just kill and feed and go awayand in the woods theyre clever beasts and not easy to hunt i hadnt thought of that but youre right gerin said how many trokmoi have we disposed of because they stayed around to plunder or loaded themselves down with stolen gewgaws till they couldnt even flee a good many lord tomril touched the hilt of his sword in fond reminiscence then he scuffed the ground with a hobnailed sandal wont be so with these monsters though theyve got teeth and claws and enough of a mans cleverness to be more dangerousn wolves ever dreamt of but they arent clever enoughi dont think so anywaysto steal the things we make maybe theyre too clever for that gerin said his warriors stared at him in incomprehension he didnt try to explain struggling against the black depression that threatened to leave him useless took all he had in him after hed ridden out the trokme invasion hed begun now and then to have hope that he might keep something of elabonian civilization alive north of the high kirs now even a god seemed to have abandoned the land leaving it open for these monsters from underground to course over it rihwin came up in time to hear the last part of the exchange between gerin and the two troopers he said lord gerin meseems these creatures however horrific their semblance should by virtue of their beastly nature be most vulnerable to magic nor are they likely to have sorcerers of their own to help them withstand the cantrips we loose against them the cantrips i loose against them you mean gerin said which made rihwin bite his lip in embarrassment and nod gerin went on a really potent mage might be able to do what you say whether i can is another question altogether i tell you frankly im afraid of spells of bane mostly because i know too well they can smite me instead of the ones at whom i aim them a man who recognizes his limits is wise rihwin said which made gerin snort for if hed ever met a man who had no sense of limit whatever that man was rihwin gerin paced up and down in the courtyard at last he stopped and made a gesture of repugnance i wont try those spells he said thats not just for fear of getting them wrong either even if i work them properly im liable to end up like balamung consumed by evil magic thats overmastered me rihwin studied him judiciously if any man could work spells of bane without their corrupting him i reckon you to be that man but whether any man can do such is i concede an open question sometimes open questions are best left unopened gerin said what he would do if faced by disaster complete and unalloyed he did not know he muttered a silent prayer to dyaus that he would not have to find out aloud he went on what we need to do first i think is summon the vassals fare south and see if we cant teach those creatures fear enough to make them learn to stay away from lands i hold as you say lord prince rihwin agreed cheerfully i look forward to sallying forth against them he mimed shooting a bow from the pitching platform of a chariot the fox did not look forward to sallying forth he felt harassed hed never wanted to be baron of fox keep and once he became baron willynilly hed never delighted in war for its own sake as so many men of the northlands did after the empire of elabon abandoned the northlands his main aim had been to maintain its legacy in the lands he ruled fighting all the time did nothing to further that aim but failing to fight meant dying so what was he to do rihwin said of course you also must needs take into account the possibility that the trokme clans north of the niffet will seize the chance to strike south on learning of your deployment toward the opposite side of your holding thank you so much bright ray of sunshine gerin said and i have to worry about schild stoutstaff and adiatunnus and where in the five hells my son has disappeared to and more other things than i have fingers and toes to keep track of lord gerin thats why the sithonians devised counting boards rihwin said with a sly smile gerin stooped picked up a clod of dirt and flung it at him rihwin ducked his smile got wider and even more impudent ah my fellow fox i see youve been taking lessons in deportment from your lady grinning and ducking wont save you now gerin exclaimed youd better run too he chased rihwin halfway round the keep both men laughing like boys gerin finally stopped youre made of foolishness do you know that maybe i am rihwin said but ifsobe thats true what does it make you daft gerin answered at once anyone whod want to run a holding let along the beginnings of a realm has to be daft he sobered quickly ill have to send out word to my vassal barons to gather here with as many armed men as they can bring that cant wait if it does well have other visitors than our warriors fand stood in the doorway to her chamber and shook her head no fox i dont care to have you in here this evening so back to your own bed you can go gerin scowled at her why not this is three times running youve told me no and i know youve said aye to van at least twice one reason the two friends had stayed friends and not quarreled over fand was that shed always treated them pretty evenhandedlytill now because i dont care to is why she said now tossing her head so her hair flew about in coppery ringlets and if thats not enough of an answer to suit you why to the corbies with you i ought to he began ought to what she broke in have me by force och you can do it the once belike youre bigger nor i am and stronger too but your backd never be safe after that nor had you better sleep but behind barred door for that id take vengeance if it cost the life of me will you shut up you idiot woman and let me get a word in edgewise he roared in a startlingly loud voiceloud and startling enough to make fand give back a pace i was trying to say before you started screeching at me that i ought to know what you think ive done wrong so i can figure out whether i really meant it or if i should try to make amends oh fand came as close to seeming subdued as she ever did after a moment she sighed its not that you dont mean well indeed and it isnt but havent you had enough to do with women to know that if you need to ask a question like that the answerll do you no good elise had said things like that not long before she left him he hadnt understood then and didnt altogether understand now i dont fancy guessing games he said slowly usually you tell me whatevers in your mindmore than i want to hear sometimes why not now och its late at night and id sooner sleep than have a row with you the now fand said go on to your own bed fox maybe tomorrow ill feel kinder toward youwho knows then because she was honest in her own fashion she added or maybe i wont evasion made gerin angry when he wanted to know something he kept digging till he found out tell me what youre thinking he growled if ive done something wrong ill find a way to make it right you do try that ill own youre just enough and to spare for a fact fand said this time though twill not be so easy for you im thinking she shut her mouth tight then and gave him a stubborn look that warned shed say no more more than her words the set of her face finally told gerin what she meant he clapped a hand to his forehead youre still sizzling because i brought selatre to the keep he exclaimed and wouldnt you be now if i was after coming back here with a bigthewed bigballed trokme man with a fine yellow mustache on him she said och puir fellow by the side o the road i found him starving and all sure and i didnt fetch him back to sleep with him even if he will be living in the castle from here on out she did a wicked parody of his explanation of how hed come to bring selatre to castle fox and topped it off by assuming an expression innocent and wanton at the same time gerin hoped he managed to disguise his startled laugh as a cough but wouldnt have bet money on it you have the tongue of a viper do you know that he said it pleased her which wasnt what hed had in mind he went on by the gods i havent set a hand on her since she got here i dont mean i havent tried to take her to bed i mean i literally have not touched her so i dont know why you keep wanting to have kittens about it foosh i know youve not touched her fand tossed her head in fine contempt but can you tell me so easy youve not wanted to i gerin lied with few qualms when he dealt with his neighbors only a fool he reckoned told the bald truth on all occasions but lying to his leman was a different business he ended up not answering fand at all when she saw he wasnt going to she nodded and quietly shut the door between them the bar on her side did not come down he could have gone in he stood in the hallway for a minute or so then muttered whats the bloody use he went back to his own chamber and lay down he was still awake when pale nothos rose in the east which meant midnight had come and gone eventually he slept van sang in the stables as raffo readied the chariot to go out on campaign gerin had always looked on war as an unpleasant part of the business of running a barony but now the idea of escaping from castle fox for a while suited him fine when he said as much van stopped singing and started to laugh whats so stinking funny the fox asked irritably youre that glad to get away from sweet fand are you van said laughing still this i tell you shes as happy to have you gone as you are to be going not just her eyes are green shes jealous enough to spit poison like some of the snakes they have in the jungles of the east i already saw that for myself thank you very much gerin said he wished van hadnt brought it up where raffo and a good many other men as well could listen but after a moment he realized that didnt matter the only people in his holding who hadnt heard about how well fand liked his coming back with selatre were deaf and their friends had probably drawn pictures in the dirt for them fixing the outlander with a baleful stare he ground out and how is it she hasnt stayed angry with you you had as much to do with getting selatre here as i did oh no doubt no doubt van admitted just then raffo climbed into the chariot van followed him setting his shield in the bracket on his side of the car gerin did the same on his side you were saying he prompted when van showed no sign of going on i was wasnt i well how do i put it van fiddled with his weapons to give him time to gather his thoughts raffo flicked the reins and got the horses going as they passed from the stable out into the courtyard the outlander said i guess the nub of it is she believes me when i tell her im not out to bed selatre you shes not so sure about i dont know what i have to do gerin said wearily ive told fand and ive told her not that simple captain and you likely know it as well as i do van said me im a wencher and not a lot more and fand she suits me well enough though the gods know id sooner she didnt have that redheaded temper of hers you and fand though but for bed damn me to the hottest one of your five hells if i can see where the two of you fit together she came to fox keep at the right time gerin answered oh i know that van said after elise up and left any woman would have done you for a while just to let you remember youre a man but id not expected this to last so long he laughed again i figured youd sicken of quarreling with her and leave her all to me not that i know whether i could stand that myself you have all of her now seems like without my having any say at all the fox answered less than delighted his friend had seen into him so clearly so i do and i still dont know whether i can stand it the outlander sighed what made it work so well the three of us i mean is that fand has more than enough venom for any one man but shes bearable when she has two to spread it on of course it helps that neither of us is the jealous sort no gerin let it go at that had he cared more for fand he thought he would have been more likely to be jealous too but he didnt care to say as much straight out he did add another thing that helps is that shes lickerish enough for the two of us together i think shed wear me out if i had to try to keep her happy by my lonesome youre getting old van said to which the fox mimed throwing a punch for his friend was no younger then van sighed again and went on one more thing to worry about he stopped seemed to listen to himself and guffawed by the gods ive been with you too long captain im even starting to sound like you believe me i like the idea even less than you do gerin answered and van pretended to wallop him up ahead at the reins raffo snickered the chariots rolled south down the elabon way in no particular order now bunched together now strung out in a long line sometimes the foxs warriors sang or swapped jokes sometimes they kept them to themselves gerin knew the empire of elabon had imposed stricter discipline on its soldiers when it was strong but he didnt know how the trick was done by all the evidence elabon didnt know anymore either even though he was still in his own holding he kept a wary eye on the woods and brush to either side of the elabon way if the monsters from ikos had been seen in bevons holding not that bevon held much of it they might be loose in palins lands tooand they might have come farther north than that serfs in the fields stared as the chariots bounced past them a few took no chances but dropped their hoes and stoneheaded mattocks and ran for the safety of the trees after the chaos the northlands had endured the past five years that did not surprise the fox but it left him sad here he and his comrades fared forth to protect the peasants and they seemed to feel they needed protecting from their overlords thanks to gerins forethoughtfulness the little army had several hens among the baggage they also had enough axes to cut plenty of firewood for a goodsized blaze between the offering and the fire the evening ghosts were hardly more than a distraction well set pairs of sentries out all night long in a triangle gerin said i wont have us assailed without warning van took charge of roasting the two chickens theyd sacrificed he was the logical man for the job not only was he as good a roadside cook as anyone else he was also no one to argue with when he passed out pieces of meat for there werent enough to go around those who went without chicken made do with hardbaked biscuits and smoked meat cheese and onions everyone drank ale gerin tossed a gnawed thighbone into the fire he chewed at a biscuit about as tough as his own teeth i wonder if this came from ros the fierces reign or just orens he said after he managed to get a mouthful down you have no cause to make complaint against oren the builder rihwin said for the image of him you fetched back from the fane at ikos leaves you perhaps the richest man in the northlands aye gold is good to have ill not deny gerin said thats not the way i expected to come by it but you hear no complaints from me some of the warriors rolled themselves in their blankets as soon as theyd finished eating others stayed up a while to talk or roll knucklebones by the light of the fire van snarled in angry dismay when he lost three throws in a row his luck usually ran better than that then he lost again and stood up from the game enough is enough he declared well if you wont gamble with us what about a tale widin simrins son said he had his own reasons for being willing to call off the game a nice little pile of silver gleamed in front of him everyone who heard the suggestion spoke up for it all the same especially the men from outlying keeps who seldom got the chance to hear van yarn the outlander coughed and plucked at his beard which tale shall i give you he asked you pick one for me how about the one about how they teach the monkeys to pick pepper gerin said you were going to start it a few days ago but we got interrupted and if ive not heard it my guess is that few others here have from the way the warriors exclaimed none of them knew the story so ive not told it in all the time ive been at your keep eh captain van said nice to know ive not yarned myself dry and thats a fact all right here goes the tale of the way they teach monkeys to pick pepper before he started the story he paused to swig ale and lubricate his throat that accomplished he said this is what i saw in mabalal which is a hot damp country a good ways east and south from kizzuwatna take the muggiest summer day youve ever known here imagine it ten times worse and youll start to know what the weather there is like now maybe its on account of the weather but a lot of the folk of mabalal are what youd have to call lazy some of em i swear would just as soon lie with their mouths open in the rain as get up and find themselves a cup to drink frombut thats no part of the tale if you want to know what pepper trees are like think of willowsthey look much like em right down to the clusters of fruit the trouble with em is they grow on the steepest hillsides and cliffs so people have a beastly time getting to em to take away the pepper probably why it costs so much by the time it gets here gerin said likely so captain now the folk of mabalal are lazy like i said if we had to hope for them to climb hillsides and cliffs to gather the pepper fruits itd cost more than it does i tell you true what they do instead is get the monkeys to work for em or maybe trick em into it would be a better way to put it whats a monkey asked a warrior from an isolated keep a man who never went more than a couple of hours walk from his holding unless on campaign a monkey is a beast about the size of a halfyear babe that looks like a furry ugly little man with a tail van answered patiently they live in trees and have thumbs on their feet as well as their hands theyre clever and mischievous almost like children and they cause a lot of trouble stealing things and ruining them the other thing about monkeys is they like to do what people doand the folk of mabalal who live with em the same way we do with dogs and cats know it there are whole bands of these monkeys mind you that live in the rough country where the pepper trees grow so when the mabalali want to get themselves some pepper what they do is this they go down to the foothills below the rough country and pick all the fruit off some of the trees there then they dump piles of the fruit in little clearings theyve made close by and they pretend to up and leave now all the while the monkeys have been watching them from the high ground the monkeys go and they pick the fruits from the pepper trees and then they come down and they drop them in the clearings just the same way theyd seen the men do it sometimes theyll steal the fruit the mabalali have left sometimes they wont either way the mabalali get the pepper and they get it without having to do the hard work themselves so you see sometimes being lazy isnt such a bad thing after all the warriors buzzed appreciatively as they would have at any tale well told for them it was a pleasant way to pass the time and a story to remember so they could tell it in turn gerin also liked it on those terms but it set him thinking in a different way too i wonder how many useful things have come from mens being too lazy to keep on doing things the same old hard way he mused give me a forinstance captain van said that made the fox scratch his head at last he said take the fellow who thought of the wagon wouldnt you bet he was sick of hauling things on his back ah i see what youre saying van said likely so and the fellow who first brewed ale what was he sick of rihwin asked with a grin he answered his own question seeing straight i suppose gerin and van both laughed at that but drago the bear drew in a sharp disapproving breath no man first brewed ale he said flatly twas the gift of the god baivers and any who dont want his anger had best remember it rihwin opened his mouth for what gerin was sure would be a reply taken straight from the philosophers of the city of elabon before that reply could emerge gerin forestalled it rihwin my fellow fox i trust you do recall the difficulties you had with mavrix god of wine not so long ago well yes i do rihwin said reluctantly i did not believe however that you of all people in the northlands would stifle the full and open discussion of ideas of all sorts i gerin took him by the arm here walk with me he said in a tone that brooked no argument when the two men were as far from the fire and the blood offering as the wailing of the ghosts would let them go gerin continued in a low voice for all your study one thing you never learned theres a time and a place for everything if you want to start arguments about the nature and powers of the gods dont do it when youre heading out on campaign i want my mens thoughts focused on two things working with one another and slaughtering any monsters they happen across does that make sense to you i suppose so rihwin said though he sounded sulky yet you would be hardpressed to deny that in theory gerin cut him off again this time with a sharp chopping gesture of his left hand theory is wonderful he said what we have here is factif the men quarrel among themselves they wont fight well you do anything more to make them fight worse than they would otherwise and ill leave you behind at the first keep we come to or at a peasant village failing that do you understand me oh indeed rihwin angrily tossed his head firelight glinted from the gold hoop in his left ear youre a hard man when you take the field lord prince gerin the fox he loaded gerins title with scorn war is too important a business to be slack with it gerin answered shrugging will you do as i say and not stir up disputes among the gods or shall i leave you those are your choices sirrah rihwin sighed let it be as you say youd do better though if you learned to ease men into doing your will rather than hammering them into it no doubt gerin sighed too rihwin had nothing wrong with his wits only a dearth of common sense and youd do better if you thought more before you started talking or doing things we all try to be the best men we can and we all fail in different ways which watch do you have tonight the middle one rihwins mobile features assumed an expression of distaste there you see gerin said if your head held as much sense as a cabbage youd be asleep already instead of standing here arguing with me go curl up in your blanket the power of your reasoning ravishes me yet again rihwin cried gerin snorted and made as if to kick him in the backside the transplanted southerner lay down and soon fell asleep gerin had the midwatch too but stayed awake a good deal longer when the foxs chariots rolled down into bevons holding all the local barons shut themselves up right in their keeps and prepared to stand siege you just want to bite out another piece of our land one of them called from his palisade when gerin came up to the wall thats not so gerin answered wondering if the white rag he bore would protect him from the lordlets archers as he had so many times before he spoke of the monsters that had erupted from the caves beneath bitons temple and as had happened too many times before he met only disbelief the petty baron laughed scornfully youre supposed to be clever fox id have thought you could come up with a better excuse than that to come down on your neighbors have it as you will the fox knew he sounded weary but couldnt help it youll find out soon enough whether im telling the truth when you learn i am maybe youll remember some of what ive said he turned and walked back to the chariot where van and raffo waited no one shot at him so he just rode on down at the southern border of bevons holding ricolfs men were no longer wary of the force gerin used to hold the elabon way open theyd seen the monsters for themselvesseen more of them than the fox had as a matter of fact he spent the first couple of hours after he arrived asking questions some of the creatures are smarter than others lord prince seems like one of ricolfs troopers said ive seen a couple carrying sword or axe and one even with a helm on its ugly head but othersll either charge or run off just like wild beasts interesting gerin plucked at his beard how many of them are there would you say and how much damage have they done how many too many thats sure the trooper said as for damage think how much fun wolves would be if they had more in the way of wits and hands to let them get into things doors and gates keep them out of gerin thought about it he didnt like the pictures that painted themselves in his mind elabonians were in the habit of calling trokmoi wolves because of their fierce raids but they had humanly understandable motives they were out for loot and captives as well as slaughter for its own sake beasts that hunted and killed without grasping let alone using the concepts of mercy and restraint were daunting in an altogether different way the fox thanked ricolfs man and went back to pass the word to his own warriors one things certain he said when hed given them the grim news these creatures wont act like a regular army of men they arent an army at all not really instead of trying to storm up the elabon way in a mass i look for them to spread through the woods by ones and twos and maybe packsno larger groups or bands or whatever you want to call them if thats so lord gerin we might as well not have brung these here chariots widin simrins son said for fighting youre right the fox answered letting his young vassal down easy but wed have been another two or three days on the road if wed footed it down here widin nodded abashed drago the bear said whatll you have us do with the cars then we cant go into the woods with em thats certain and you say the woods is where well find these things he shook his head in somber anticipation youre going to make foot soldiers out of us i know you are do you see that i have any choice gerin asked heres what im thinking well split up by chariot crews with teams of three crews sticking together in teams thatll give each team nine men which should be enough to hold off even a pack of the creatures at the same time well have eight or ten teams spreading out along the border between bevons and ricolfs holdings and that ought to give us a chance to keep a lot of the beasts from slipping farther north what about the ones that are already over the border van asked how are you going to deal with them bevons vassals or rather bevons sons vassals will slay some of them gerin said that should convince them the things are real and dangerous as for the others well just have to hope there arent too many fair enough van said to gerins relief the foxs great fearone he didnt want to speak aloud to his followerswas that like the trokmoi the monsters would permanently establish themselves in the northlands if men couldnt rid the woods of wolves how were they to be free of creatures cleverer and more vicious than wolves he divided his men into teams of nine and appointed a leader for each band he had contrary misgivings about naming drago and rihwin the one might miss things he ought to find while the other got in trouble by being too inventive but they were both better than anyone else in their bands so he spoke their names firmly and hoped for the best he ordered half the teams to head east from the elabon way the other half west well go out for three days hunt for a day and then come back he said anybody whos not back to the road in seven days time and hasnt been eaten to give him an excuse will answer to me eastbound and westbound forces headed out from the highway the fox and his chariot crew were in the latter at first each half of the little army tramped along as a single body the better to overawe any of the local nobles who might be tempted to fare forth against them men chattered and sang and after a while began to grumble about sore feet when morning had turned to afternoon and the sun sank toward the horizon gerin turned to the team headed by widin simrins son you men go back and forth through the woods hereabouts he said the rest of us will push on then leave another team behind then another and another so when were through well have men all along the border do you see aye lord widin answered that means at the end of our reach though so to speak we wont be able to search for as long as we will here closer to the elabon way true enough the fox said but i dont know what we can do about it travel takes time and theres no help for it he nodded approvingly to widin that was a much better point than the one hed raised before gerin hadnt worked the implications of his strategy through so logically himself when we get back to fox keep would you be interested in learning to read and write no lord prince widin replied at once got better things to do with my time i dohunting and wenching and keeping my vassals and serfs in line he sounded so sure of himself that gerin subsided with a sigh and did not push the question with widins team left behind the rest tramped on they took a game track through a stand of oaks and emerged on the far side at the edge of cleared fields in which peasants labored the peasants stared at them in horror as if they were so many monsters themselves then fled their cries of terror made gerin melancholy this holding has seen too much war he said lets push ahead without harming anything here let them know not every warrior is out to steal what little they have a wasted lesson if ever i heard one van said the next band through here so long as it isnt one of ours will treat them the way they expect us to gerin glared at him so fiercely that he hastened to add but well do it your way captainwhy not evening came before the fox reckoned the time ripe to detach another piece of his force along with the men he had with him he tossed knucklebones to see who would stand watch through the night he felt like cheering when he won the right to uninterrupted sleep no sooner had he cocooned himself in his blanket and wriggled around a little to make sure no pebbles poked his ribs than he knew nothing of the world around him a hideous cry recalled him to himself a wailing shriek part wolf part longtooth part madman he sat up and looked around wildly wondering for a moment where he was and what he was doing here his gaze went to the heavens tiwaz nearly full stood high in the south ruddy elleb a couple of days past fullness was in the southeast crescent math had set and nothos not yet risen that put the hour a little before midnight then all such mundane practical thoughts vanished from his head for the dreadful call again rang through the woods and across the fields some men started up from their bedrolls grabbing for bow or sword others shrank down as if to smother the cry with the thick wool of their blankets gerin could not find it in himself to blame them the scream made him want to hide too in a very small voice someone said is that the cry these monsters make dont know what else it could be van sounded amazingly cheerful noisy buggers arent they course frogs are noisy too and a frog isnt hardly anything but air and legs gerin admired his friends sangfroid he also admired the way the outlander had done his best to make the creatures from the caves seem less dangerous he knew they were a great deal more than air and legs the frightful cry rang out yet again how are we to sleep with that racket widin simrins son said you roll up in your blanket and you close your eyes gerin said not about to let van outdo him in coolness we have sentries aplenty you wont be eaten while you snore and if you are you can blame the fox van put in adding not that itll do you much good then off in the distance almost on the edge of hearing another monster shrieked to answer the first that sent ice walking up gerins back not from terror at the faraway cry but because it said the creatures that made those dreadful sounds were spreading over the northlands gerin wondered how many more were calling back and forth farther away than he could hear the one nearby kept quiet after that exhaustion and edgy nerves fought a battle over the fox exhaustion eventually won the next thing he knew the sun was prying his eyelids open he got up and stretched feeling elderly his mouth tasted like something scraped off the bottom of a chamber pot he walked over to a tree plucked off a twig frayed one end of it with the edge of his dagger and used it to scrub some of the vileness from his teeth some of his men did the same others didnt bother rihwin whod grown up south of the high kirs was so fastidious that even frayed twigs didnt completely satisfy him as he tossed one aside he said in the city of elabon they make bristle brushes for your mouth those are better by far than these clumsy makeshifts if you like you can teach the art to one of the peasants who makes big brushes for rubbing down horses gerin said we might be able to sell them through the northlandsnot many southern amenities to be had here these days my fellow fox i admire the wholeheartedness of your mercenary spirit rihwin said anyone who sneers at silver has never tried to live without it gerin looked around whered van go he walked into the woods a while ago widin said hes probably off behind a tree taking care of his morning business the outlander returned a few minutes later he said when youre done breaking your fast friends i want you to come with me i went looking for the spot where that thing made a racket last night and i think i found it several of the men were still gnawing on hard bread and sausage as they followed van he led them down a tiny track to a clearing perhaps a furlong from the camp the carcass of a doe lay there much of the hindquarters portion had been devoured a scavenging fox fled from the carcass when the men came out of the woods van said to gerin i hope your name animal hasnt ruined the tracks i saw id be liable to think ill of it if it has and i know you wouldnt like that he walked over to the doe grunted no looks like were all right come up a few at a time all of you and have a look at what the ground shows gerin was part of the first small group forward when he got close to the dead doe van pointed to a patch of bare soft dirt by the animal the footprints there were like none the fox had ever seen at first he thought they might be a mans then a bearsthey had claw marks in front of the ends of their toes but they didnt really resemble either they weresomething new so this is the spoor we have to look for is it he said grimly either that or someones magicking our eyes van answered and i dont think anybody is the fox didnt think so either he waited till all his men had seen the new footprints then said they have claws on their hands too now that we know what their tracks look like lets get moving and see if we cant hunt down a few the warriors were quiet as they trooped back to the campsite now they had real evidence that gerin and van hadnt made up the tale about the monsters theyd believed them already likely enough in an abstract way but hearing about something new and terrible wasnt the same as seeing proof it was really there a couple of hours after they started tramping west gerin detached another band of men from his force to scour the area where they were the rest slogged on grumbles about aching feet got louder around noon rihwin said lord gerin something which may be of import occurs to me and what is that gerin asked warily you never could tell with rihwin some of his notions were brilliant others crackbrained and knowing the one bunch from the other wasnt always easy now he said my thought lord prince is that these may in sooth be creatures of the night wherein we heard the two of them giving cry for does it not stand to reason that having lived an existence troglodytic lo these many years perhaps even ages their eyes accustomed as they must be to darkness perpetual will necessarily fail when facing the bright and beaming rays of the sun troglowhat van said incredulously no doubt speaking for a good many of the foxs warriors gerin was wellread and used to rihwins elaborate southern speech patterns so he at least understood what his fellow fox was talking about means living in caves he explained for those who hadnt followed to rihwin he said its a pretty piece of logic the only flaw is that its not so van and i saw the things fighting the temple guards in broad daylight the morning of the earthquake and heard one behind us coming out of ikos later that same day their eyes work perfectly well in sunlight oh a pox rihwin cried how dreadful to see such a lovely edifice of thought torn down by hard brute fact he sulked for the next couple of hours the fox detached another team late that afternoon and camped with his remaining two teams not long afterwards the night passed quietly much to his relief standing first watch was not so onerousbetter that than being torn from sleep by a horrible screech at any rate early the next morning he gave rihwins team their area to patrol good hunting he said clapping his ekenamesake on the shoulder i thank you lord gerin rihwin answered and then do you know there are times when i wonder how wise i was to cast aside my life of wealth and indolence in the southlands for an adventurous career with you there are times when i wonder about that too gerin said a lot of them as a matter of fact what youre saying now is that your heart wouldnt break if you didnt happen to run across any monsters something like that yes i feel the same way believe me gerin said but if we dont go after them theyll end up coming after us id sooner make the fight on my terms and as far from my keep as i can i understand the logic i assure you rihwin said the argument takes on a different color however when it moves from the realm of ideas to the point of affecting one personally logicians who cling to abstract concepts seldom run the risk of being devoured no matter how much they may deserve it gerin added which won him a glare he gave rihwin another encouraging swat for all the southerners talk gerin didnt worry about his courage his common sense was another matter or would have been if hed had any to speak of the fox led his own team westward alarmed at their advance a young stag bounded out of a thicket van pulled an arrow from his quiver nocked and let fly all in close to the same instant thats a hit he shouted and hurried forward to where the stag had been sure enough blood splashed the grass come on you lugs the outlander said to his companions with a trail like this to follow a blind mand be eating venison steaks tonight they ran the deer down about a quarter of an hour later it lay panting on the ground too weak to run any further vans arrow stood in its side just back of the heart it tried to struggle to its feet but could not its large brown eyes stared reproachfully at the warriors van stooped beside it with one swift motion he jerked up its head and cut its throat together van and gerin tackled the gory job of butchering the stag next stream we come to i wash gerin declared you may not need to wait for a stream captain the outlander answered pointing west the weather had been fine but clouds were beginning to roll in off the distant orynian ocean that could be rain so it could the fox glowered at the clouds as if he could hold them back by sheer force of will if it starts raining how are we supposed to track anything by the gods how are we even going to keep fires going to help hold the ghosts at arms length his rising bad temper even extended to van and why couldnt you have killed this deer closer to sunset so we could use its blood as an offering to the spirits van stood tall and glared down at him are you going to complain that the grass is green instead of blue too or will you help me get the meat off this beast as usual his comrades bluntness showed gerin where hed stepped over the line from gloomy to carping he nodded shamefacedly and fell to work raffo said i have a thought lord gerin he waited for the fox to grunt before he went on what say we post ourselves in hiding around the offal there and see if it doesnt lure one of the creatures were seeking the stink of blood might draw em were already farther west than any of the other teams gerin said musingly it would mean pushing on a ways further tomorrow but why not as you say the lure is good might as well be a grub on a fish hook aye well try itbut i still want to go and find water and i van agreed his arms were bloody to the elbows well be back as soon as we may gerin said set your ambush but remember to know what youre shooting at before you let fly he and van found a creek a couple of furlongs west of where the stag had fallen just as they came up to the bank a kingfisher dove into the water to emerge a moment later with a minnow in its bill something elsea frog or a turtle gerin didnt notice whichsplashed into the creek from a mossy rock and didnt come out again the stags blood had already started to dry scrubbing it off wasnt easy we need some of the soap they make from fat and ashes south of the high kirs gerin said scraping one arm more or less clean with the nails of his other hand maybe ill try cooking a batch myself when we get home to fox keep the stuffs too harsh for my liking van answered it takes off the top layer of your hide along with the dirt he looked at gerin you have a splash of blood by your nose fox no on the other side there you got it good gerin gave a theatrical shiver that waters cold he glanced westward again the dirty gray clouds were piled higher there and before too long more than my armsll get wet that does look like rain coming the serfs will be glad of it but i wish it would have held off till we were under a roof again weather wont listen any moren a woman will van said lets head back and see if raffos brainstorm came to anything wed have heard if it did gerin answered but he followed van back toward the rest of their team they could hold their ambush till it was time to set up camp for the night he decided turning to his friend he added it occurs to me nowtoo late of coursethat pile of guts might draw something besides monsters if a longtooth decides it wants a meal i hope they have sense enough to let it eat its fill youre right van said im just glad rihwins not with us he s a fine chap mind you but he hasnt the sense you need to cart guts to a bear so why should a longtooth be any different if you ask me gerin didnt have the chance to ask van anything a racket broke out ahead the shouts of men and the hideous shriek theyd heard in the night he jerked his sword out of its sheath van pulled the mace from the loop at his belt on which it hung and the two of them pounded toward the tumult as fast as their legs would carry them its us gerin yelled as he ran dont shootwere not monsters whether any of the men was coolheaded enough to note and heed his cry was an open question because he thought that way the arrow that hissed between him and van neither surprised nor infuriated him he had a moment to be glad it had missed them both then burst through the bushes into the little open space where the stag had died and been butchered several of his men had already emerged from cover too the thing went that way raffo exclaimed pointing south we all shot at it and hit it at least twice maybe three times what hed seen suddenly seemed to sink in his eyes went wide and staring lord gerin forgive me that i ever doubted your words i pray you the creature is all you said it was and more and worse besides yes yes gerin said impatiently enough jabberinglets catch it and kill it lead on raffo since you know the way looking imperfectly delighted with the privilege hed been granted raffo plunged into the woods the trail was easy to follow blood and tracks both before long gerin could hear the monster crashing through the undergrowth ahead the things have weaknesses after all van panted they arent woodswise like proper beasts and they arent what youd call fast either you dont know about that gerin answered how fast and careful would you be with two or three arrows in you van didnt answer from which gerin concluded hed made his point with a roar the monster sprang out from behind an elm tree four men shot arrows at it two of those missed excitement could ruin anybodys aim the creature screamed when the other two struck but despite them and despite the other shafts that pierced it it rushed at its pursuers its claws scraped against the bronze scales of gerins corselet he could feel the force behind them even if they did not wound as hed guessed the monster was stronger than a man he slashed with his sword the thing screamed again van clouted it with his mace the blow would have crushed the skull of any man it knocked the monster to the ground but it got up again blood streaming from the dreadful wound to the side of its head cursing in half a dozen languages van smote it again even harder than before this time it fell and did not rise again father dyaus above said a warrior named parol and called chickpea after a wart by his nose gerins heart pounded in his chest he felt as if hed fought against a trokme rather than hunted a beast the monsters strength even badly wounded accounted for some of that more though came from how much the thing resembled a man will you look at it raffo said in wondering tones take the ugliest scoundrel youve ever seenold wolfar for instanceand make him five times as ugly as he really was every which way i mean and youve just about got this thing here oh not quite everything parol said i wouldnt mind being hung so good and thats no lie that comment aside raffos remark was to the point gerin had noted how manlike the monsters were from the moment he set eyes on them then though he hadnt had the leisure to examine one closely hed been more concerned about getting away from ikos with his life and vans and the sibyls squat muscular hairythe thing did resemble wolfar he thought unkind to his old enemy though hed killed him five years earlier but wolfar except when he turned werebeast had not been armed with claws on hands and feet both and even as a werebeast his teeth had hardly matched the ones filling the monsters long formidable jaws above those jaws its features were also a vicious parody of mankinds a low nose with slit nostrils large eyes set deep under heavy ridges of bone thick hair almost fur rising to a crest on top of its head and nearly disguising how little forehead it had there it is gerin said dyaus above only knows how many of these things are spreading over the northlands are they all of the same sort as this one raffo asked some of em are likely to be females or bitches or woman monsters or whatever the right name is parol put in theyre ugly enough so itd only matter to another monster raffo made a gesture of distaste what i meant was is this one pretty much like the others youd get a different notion of what people were like from vans corpse and the one id like to make out of that weedy little jeweler who may have run off with duren otes gerin heard the growl in his own voice as he supplied the name how could he properly search for his son when catastrophe was overtaking all the northlands more and more he feared hed never again see duren alive but raffos question raised a serious point i havent had enough experience with them to answer that though ricolf s man said some seemed smarter than others he said one way or another well all find out before long the warriors trooped back to where they had slain the deer leaving the monsters body where it lay we may as well camp as raffo said van remarked no point in pushing further in the little daylight left when evening fell the ghosts were very quiet likely gorging on the creatures blood gerin said he looked up to the sky math should have been at first quarter with tiwaz and elleb rising in the early hours after sunset but he saw only clouds the wind was picking up well have trouble gauging watches tonight and it feels like rain to boot im not looking forward to tramping along through the mud van said we wont be able to do much in the way of looking for monsters either not with rain making it hard for us to see our hands when we stretch our arms out at full length aye youre right gerin said morosely i hadnt thought so far ahead yet the gobbet of venison on which he was gnawing suddenly lost a good deal of its flavor how was he supposed to set a perimeter to keep the monsters out of his holding if they could shamble past fifty paces away without getting noticed for that matter if other nobles in the northlands didnt fight them as hard as he would himself how was he supposed to keep the monsters out of his holding at all the most obvious answer to that was depressing maybe he couldnt he hadnt had much hope of besting balamung either but hed persisted and come through he had to believe he could do the same again he stood an early watch then rolled himself in his blanket and fell asleep at once in spite of his worries when he woke he looked around in confusionwhy was everything still dark then a raindrop landed on the end of his nose and another in his hair the rain started pattering down in earnest a few minutes later men swore sleepily and rigged makeshift tents from their blankets and saplings pressed into service as tent poles in spite of those the rest of the night was chilly wet and miserable day came with rain falling steadily from a leaden sky the fire had gone out some of the venison from the night before had been cooked along with hard bread it made a decent enough breakfast but not as good as it would have been hot and juicy from the flames the warriors donned their armor and squelched off westward gerin felt as if he were moving inside a circle perhaps a bowshot across the rain curtained away everything beyond that distance every so often he or one of his comrades would slip in the mud and get up covered with it little by little the rain would wash him clean once moreuntil he slipped again echoing what van had said the night before raffo grumbled how are we supposed to search in this well be lucky if we can keep track of ourselves let alone the cursed monsters gerin did not answer for he feared his driver was right with rain and clouds concealing sun and landmarks he wasnt even altogether sure he was still heading west have to wait to see which half of the sky gets dark first van said then well have a notion of how to head back toward the elabon way anyhow if not just where well strike it raffo said poor old rihwin he could be sitting under one of those red tile roofs south of the high kirs that he never gets tired of talking about with wenches to fetch him meat and grapes and wine and he was silly enough to trade all that for this life of luxury he shook himself like a wet dog to show what he meant just thinking of being dry made gerin wish he were somewhere other than tramping through the mud he said may the next puddle you step in be over your head as if to turn his words into a magicpowered curse he waggled his hands in mock passes hed almost stopped paying attention to the circle of relatively clear vision in which he moved one piece of damp dreary ground seemed much like the next looking where he put his feet so he wouldn t go into a puddle over his head himself struck him as more important than anything else then raffo gasped half in horror and half in amazement the sound was plenty to jerk gerins head up splashing through the wet grass and mud came a band of eight or ten monsters they spied gerins men at about the same moment as raffo saw them a bulky male evidently the leader of the band swept out his arm to point at the warriors he shouted something through the rain gerin could not tell whether it was real words or just an animal cry whatever it was the rest of the creatures got the idea with hoarse roars they charged the foxs men in such dreadful weather bows were useless gerin stooped to pick up a stone the size of a goose egg he flung it at the oncoming monsters then yelled out sword and at them a moment later his own blade slid from its scabbard a stone flew past his head one of the creatures at any rate had wit enough to think of it as a weapon then the fight was at close quarters the savagery and strength of the monsters well matched against the armor and bronze weapons gerins warriors carried with his long heavy spear better made for use afoot than from a chariot van had an advantage over his monstrous foes he could thrust at them long before they closed with him but when he sank the leafshaped point deep into the belly of one screaming creature another seized the spearshaft and wrenched it out of his hands he shouted in shock and dismay long used to being stronger than any man he faced having an opponent who could match him in might came as a jolt the monster dropped the spear it preferred its natural weapons to those made by art but when it sprang at van he stove in its head with an overhand blow from his mace he needed no second stroke the fight with the creature the day before had warned him to put all his power into the first one gerin got only tiny glimpses of his friends fighthe had troubles of his own the monster that faced him was female but no less unlovely and fierce on account of that he felt as if he were fighting a wolf bitch or female longtooth and knew none of the hesitation he might have felt against a woman warrior he slashed at the monster it skipped back it knew the sword was dangerous to it then the fox went after it slashed once more this time the monster ducked under the blade and rushed him he got his shield up just in time to keep it from tearing out his throat it was very strong when it tried to pull the shield off his arm he wondered if his right shoulder would come out of its socket the shield strap held but barely even in the pouring rain the monster stank with a reek halfway between the musky smell of a wild beast and a human body that had never been bathed something else was there too a musty smell perhaps the residue of long yearsof countless generationsof life underground the fox slashed again and scored a bleeding line across the creatures rib cage it squalled in fury and stopped trying to tear away his shield but it did not turn and flee as a wounded animal likely would have done instead it went back to the attack this time rushing at gerin and knocking him off his feet then springing on him as he lay in the mud again his shield saved him fending the monster away from his face and neck he hissed in pain as its claws raked down his arm but though he was untaloned himself his sandals had bronze hobnails to help him grip the ground he kicked at the monster and hurt it again he dropped his sword it was too unwieldy for this work had he not been able to get at his dagger or had he dropped it while yanking it from its sheath on his belt he would have died as it was he stabbed the monster again and again it shrieked first shrilly then with a bubbling undertone as bloody froth burst from its mouth and nose for once gerin wished he were not lefthanded his blows to the right side of the creatures body had pierced a lung but not its heart now though it wanted escape he stuck out a leg in a wrestlers trick and tripped it when it tried to flee it went down with a splash he half leaped half rolled onto its back stabbing again and again in an ecstasy of loathing fury and fear the monster was as tenacious of life as any wild beast that was certain hed put enough holes in it to make a sieve before it finally stopped trying to break free he didnt know whether it was dead he didnt careit was out of the fight for a good long while he snatched up his sword again scrambled to his feet and hurried to give aid to his comrades several of them were down as were most of the monsters raffo and parol chickpea together battled the big male that had led the pack it sprang on parol he screamed hoarsely gerin used the sword like a spear stabbing the monster from behind it wailed and tried to turn on him raffos blade met its thick neck with a meaty chunnk blood spurted head half severed the monster pitched forward onto its face and lay still when their leader fell the couple of creatures still on their feet gave up the fight and fled gerins warriors did not pursue them they had enough to do finishing the monsters on the ground and seeing to their own wounded one man was dead parols driver a likable young fellow called delamp narrags son several others had bites and slashes of greater or less severity binding them up in the rain wasn t easy youre bleeding fox van remarked gerin looked down at his clawed arm so i am i hope we come to a village before long so i can pour beer into those cuts and cover them over with lard if theyre anything like cat scratches theyre liable to fester youre right about that van looked over the little battlefield well we beat em back theyre not as tough as armored warriors thats something anyhow something aye now that he wasnt fighting for his life the fox noticed how much that arm hurt but id not want to be a peasant even one with a mattock or scythe and have one of those things spring at me from out of the woods if i were lucky and hit it a good lick it might run off but if i missed that first stroke id never get a chance to make a second one youre right about that too van said after a moments reflective pause he added one of the ones that got away fled north i saw it go i was trying not to think about it gerin said wearily thats one past us certain sure i wonder how many more there are that weve never seen even the one is too many and youre right about that van said if youre so bloody right all the time why are we in this mess gerin had no good answer for him vii rihwin walked mournfully through the courtyard a bandage plastered over his left ear and tied round his head to hold it in place cant you take that off yet gerin asked him weve been back here ten days now so you cant still be bleeding and the wound didnt fester or youd have taken sick long since oh i could if that were all there was to it rihwin answered the sad truth is though that im uglier without the bandage than with it gerin clapped a hand to his forehead youre vainer than a peacock is what you are if you hadnt worn that gold hoop in your ear the monster down in bevons holding never would have had the chance to hook a claw on it and tear it out and a torn ears not the worst thing in the world anyhow ive seen plenty of men with worse and thats a fact rihwins mobile features twisted into a dolorous frown but my earlobe has shriveled up and withered in the southlands surgeons had ways of repairing such wounds for those who could bear the pain many did as a ruined ear does ones appearance no good henceforward im liable to be styled rihwin oneear not rihwin the fox but who in this benighted country is familiar with such techniques not a soul unless im much mistaken i fear youre right gerin said your southern surgeons may have had practice at such work but we dont wear earrings here he paused a moment his curiosity awakening how do the southern surgeons go about their work with ears anyhow first they ply the patient well with wine and poppy juice to dull his senses as much as they can rihwin answered they also have his friends hold him mind youive done that duty a time or two then they cut loose a flap of flesh from behind the ruined ear open up what remains of the earlobe so its raw and bloody and sew the two together after they grow into onefor they will once they exchange bloodthe surgeon cuts off the base of the flap and behold one has a new ear perhaps not so fine as the original article but far better than the miserable nub i have left gerin eyed him speculatively do you know my fellow fox in my years up here on the frontier ive done my share of rough healers work drawing arrows stitching wounds setting bones what have you the men ive treated havent done any worse than anyone elses patients if you like i might try to rebuild your ear for you rihwin went into a sudden and hasty retreat holding his hands out before him as if to fend off gerin i thank you but no not only do you lack some of the essentials for where will you find wine and poppy juice here in the northlands but meaning no disrespect you have neither witnessed nor essayed the procedure in question but you described the procedure so clearly gerin said half to alarm rihwin half in real disappointment i feel as if i could give you something better than the stub you have now if i were to sketch in ink the shape of a proper earlobe here on the side of your neck rihwin retreated further no thank you he repeated now i grant that i cannot wear a bandage forever but if i were to let my hair grow long in half a year it would conceal the mutilation thus obviating the need for surgery i suppose you could do that gerin admitted why didnt you think of it a while ago instead of whining about how your looks were ruined forever i didnt have such incentive to devise an alternative until this moment rihwin answered with a sheepish grin compared to the prospect of being carved upon by an inept and inexperienced butcheragain meaning no disrespectgoing through life with but one earlobe suddenly seems much less unattractive rihwin was selfabsorbed but not stupid he fixed gerin with a suspicious stare and you sirrah manipulated me into coming up with that alternative i did gerin was the picture of innocence all i wanted was to try my hand at surgery i know rihwin said darkly i am certain the procedure would have been quite interestingfor you and for mehow much i should have enjoyed itis another matter altogether if you hadnt wanted something done about it you shouldnt have described how to do something about it in such loving detail gerin said believe me my fellow fox i shall not be guilty of repeating the error rihwin said i suppose you should have been as eager to follow through had i suggested you repair the ear by thaumaturgic means now theres an idea gerin exclaimed you know that really ought to be within my power such as it is it wouldnt involve much just a straightforward application of the law of similarity and you still have your right ear intact to serve as an exemplar what could be more similar to a mans left ear than his own right lets go over to that little shack of mine and rihwin fled selatre read in this year the fifth of his reign the emperor forenz the second of that nameshe paused to sound out a word she didnt run across as often as the usual opening formula of a chronicles annual entry she read that with confidenceincreased the tribute on the sithonian cities and the men of kortys gathered together and thought how best they might revel gerin blinked and leaned over to check the scroll in front of her thats rebel he murmured she looked at the passage again oh so it is she let out a small embarrassed laugh it does change the meaning doesnt it just a bit gerin started to reach and to touch her hand in added praise but thought better of it selatre made little fuss over accidental contact these days but she remained unhappy about anything that wasnt an accident he went on even with the slip youre doing marvelously well youve picked up your letters as fast as anyone ive ever taught letters are simple she said seeing how they fit together and make words is harder she looked around the room that served castle fox as a library and so many words there are to read id never imagined now gerin laughed bitterly when i look at them i see how few there are its a good collection for the northlandsfor all i know it may be the only collection in the northlandsbut its a chip of wood drifting on the sea of ignorance i studied down at the city of elabon i know whereof i speak as may be selatre said when biton abandoned me i thought i would be empty of knowledge of the feeling of knowledge passing through me forevermore this is a different sort from what the god gave directly but its worthy in its own way for that i thank you she hesitated for a moment then set her hand on top of his very lightly before she jerked it back gerin stared at her then a snarl of rage a noise like ripping canvas jerked his gaze to the doorway fand had chosen that moment to walk by the fury on her face was frightening gerin waited for her to scream at him but she stalked away instead that worried him more than her usual firestorm would have im sorry selatre said your leman does not favor me and ive gone and made matters worse not that much worse he answered things have been going mm imperfectly well for a while already she sighed and said i must confess i dont altogether understand if things between you and her have not gone well as you tell me why do you still seek her bedchamber he felt his face heat from anyone else that question would have got nothing more than a sharp none of your affair with selatre though he tried to be as honest as he could maybe that sprang from lingering awe and respect for the oracular role shed once had maybe just because by her nature and not bitons she called forth such honesty after a little thought he said because what goes on in the bedchamber as you say is one of the few good things we have left between us has been one of the good things i should say selatre caught the distinction has been but is no more do you mean i suppose i do the fox gnawed on the inside of his lower lip youve seen children balance a board or a branch on a rock and make a game out of going up and down up and down of course she answered ive played that game myself havent you he nodded then went on van and i have played it with fand these past couple of years but staying in balance the two of us with one woman isnt easy any more than keeping the board in balance on a stone is and i seem to be the one whos falling off he laughed ruefully but without much anger i shouldnt be surprised thats happening not when fand has a temper like boiling oil i ought to be surprised weve kept the balance as long as this you would have kept it longer if not for me selatre said she thinks youre out to have me take her place i know she does gerin said that isnt what i intended when i brought you here to castle fox she studied him for a moment he thought the fathomless wisdom of biton still looked out through her eyes then he realized the wisdom he saw was her own which made it no less intimidating do you intend that now she asked even if hed intended to evade she didnt make it easy though she hardly had her letters she used words with a precision the rhetoricians down in the city of elabon might have envied by biton or dyauswhichever youd rather selatrei swear i do not want you to take fands place in my life he answered steadily if you think i am in the habit of swearing false oaths you can best judge my likely fate in the world to come only a fool mocks the gods and whatever else you may be lord gerin you are no fool selatre said for that and for the truth youve shown me thus far i will believe you and for that i thank you the fox said shall we return to the chronicle selatre asked there with the words before us on the parchment we have less room for misunderstanding that is probably a good idea gerin listened to her read every sentence seemed to come with more confidence than the one before it now that shed grasped the principle she was showing she could apply it some men took years to reach the place where shed come in moonturns some men gave up in dismay and never got there at all he was proud of her and pleased with himself for having guessed so well where she would fit into the life of fox keep and the human fabric of the holding as a whole she and fand didnt fit van had foreseen that more clearly than he had himself and van and fand still seemed to be getting along as well as fand ever got on with anyone under the usual busy stir of his thoughts gerin remembered something else as wellselatre had reached out and taken his hand he didnt know how much that meant he didnt know if it meant anything of one thing he was sure he wanted to find out rain plashed down on castle fox filling puddles in the courtyard and turning the ditch around the palisade to the muddy beginning of a moat harvest lay far enough ahead for the peasants to look on the storm with relief rather than alarm in any other year that would have made gerin do the same now a cloudfilled sky and curtains of water kicking up myriad splashes everywhere only raised his hackles the wet weather reminded him too vividly of the storm that had rolled through the day his band of warriors fought the pack of monsters planting his feet with care on the slippery steps he mounted to the palisade and peered south he could see the peasant village near the castle the broad thatched roofs of the huts there would keep most of the rain away from the walls of wattle and daub but he knew serfs would be patching them with fresh mud after the downpour rolled away eastward beyond the village at the edge of visibility through the rain lay the woods gerin wished he could peer inside them see into each windfall and cave under each fallen tree he feared monsters sheltered in some of them he did not have the men he would have needed to form a cordon around his entire border but without such a cordon how was he supposed to hold off the creatures he was thinking so hard he did not notice anyone coming up to join him until footfalls jarred the timbers beside him van wore a conical hat of woven straw that kept the rain off his face wondering whats out there captain the outlander asked i know whats out there gerin answered glumly im wondering how close it is and how soon well have to worry about it right here but as a matter of fact when you asked i was wishing bronze were cheaper begging your pardon fox but i have to tell you i dont follow that one van said if bronze were cheaperif we had more copper and especially more tinwe could afford to make more weapons then the peasants could have em and that would give them a better chance of killing the monsters instead of getting eaten mm likely youre right vans features turned blunter and harder as he frowned in thought but even if you are id lay you five to one that a lot of your vassal barons wouldnt fall in love with the idea of giving their serfs swords and spears and helms and cuirasses for fear the arms would get turned on them instead of the monsters you mean gerin asked van nodded so did the fox not many of my vassals need to worry overmuch i think they know i dont put up with some of the things that go on in other holdings but if the idea ever spread through the northlands ill not deny a good many barons would have cause to fear their peasants would revolt i can think of half a dozen id rise against in an instant if someone put a sword in my hand oh aye more than that vans big head bobbed up and down again but heres a question for you fox suppose you put swords and spears in the hands of a lot of your serfs when the time comes to pay the dues they owe you arent they going to go after your collectors instead of handing over the grain and ale and such theyll be protecting themselves so why should they go on paying you to do it for them thatsa good question gerin said slowly they all turn into villagers like the ones who tried to waylay us is that what youre saying thats just what im saying van agreed gerin thought for a while do you know its very likely they would he said at last the way of life we have here looks as it does because bronze is so scarce and costly peasants cant afford to get their hands on arms and armor not enough bronze to go around things would be different if there were better worse damn me to the five hells if i know gerin answered but different theyd surely be like those footholders duin the bold came up with a few years ago before he died in the fight against balamung what with everything else thats gone on since i havent had the chance to explore what all theyre good for but its plain they make riding a horse and staying on its back a lot easier than that ever was before if you can really fight from horseback what point to chariots maybe you can fight from horseback van said youre a goodsized man aye but alongside me youre a stripling the horse that could bear my weight especially in armor he slapped his broad bronzecovered chesthasnt been foaled yet if its not the chariot im a foot soldier thats not the point gerin said chariots are like any of the rest of our weapons theyre scarce and hard to come by more men could be warriors if they just had to lay hold of a horse and some arms rather than a team and a car to go with it then youd best start showing them those footholders and what to do with em the outlander answered were going to need as many warriors as we can muster and that soon too i knowsooner than i can train them into being proper horsemen the more so as im nowhere near a proper horseman myself gerin sighed if only that monster of balamungs hadnt killed duin when he kicked out our little pepperpot would have had all of us riding whether we wanted to or not he rode ideas even harder than you do and thats a fact van said youre better at picking the ones to ride though i give you so much such generosity gerin said in tones far drier than the weather suppose i did teach a good many men barons and peasants both to ride and fight from horseback his voice trailed away actions had inevitable consequences on that philosophers and historians agreed the trick was to reason out what they might be before you acted instead of getting caught by surprise later his best guess was that large numbers of warriors on horseback would prove as revolutionary as large numbers of bronze weapons in the hands of the serfs if one lord in the northlands succeeded in forming a goodsized force of cavalry as opposed to chariotry the rest would have to imitate him or go under since a man wouldnt need as many resources to maintain a horse as he would for a team and chariot vassal barons holdings could shrink until after a couple of generations it might be hard to tell a poor baron from a prosperous peasant gerin had been teaching bright serfs their letters did he really want to arm them too was he ready to unleash more great change on a land that had seen too much too fast of late for the moment the decision was out of his hands the monsters were forcing the pace of change not he but if they were put down at last van cleared his throat bringing the foxs thoughts back to the here and now the outlander said captain what is it youve done to put fand in such a swivet last night she was going on about the sheeps eyes you were casting at selatre till i all but had to hit her over the head with an ale jar to make her leave off ive done nothing of the sort gerin said indignantly ive spent time with her aye but i have to if shes to learn her letters and be able to go through the books in the library and find out whats in them you hit the mark there at the starthaving selatre here hasn t set right with fand and she blames me not you that selatres here she said you were pawing selatre when she walked by the library the other day van said doubt in his voice not that id care to believe fand over you mind but she says she saw it with her own eyes she didnt gerin insisted you think selatre would stay here for a moment if i tried pawing her as a matter of fact she put her hand on mine not the other way round selatre touched you van said giving the fox a sharp stare honh the noise was not a word but carried a world of meaning nonetheless gerin wished his friend were not so tall it made trying to look down his nose at van likelier to give him a crick in the neck than to overawe the outlander he said fands hardly speaking to me anymore are you going to start in and speak for her not a chance van said ever since i got too big for my mother to tell me what to do ive lived just as i pleased and im a great believer in letting everyone else do the same thing but if you think ill pretend to be blind to what goes on around me you can think again on that too the fox rolled his eyes do you know why she touched me she was glad id taught her her letters they fill up some of the emptiness she feels now that biton speaks to her no more thats all that may be why she says she did it but the fact remainsshe did it she didnt have to do it and she hasnt done it with anybody else van says me id say that means its not all not even close to all thats gerin felt fury rising in him he seldom lost his temper but results were memorable when he did but before he exploded like a tightly stoppered pot left too long in the fire he paused to wonder why he was getting so angry so fast when he did the anger evaporated thatspossible he said in a small voice van studied him with approval youre honest with yourself that i will say for you and suppose its not just possible but so what will you do then you ask good questions thats a better question than i have an answer for right now one corner of gerins mouth quirked up in a wry smile suppose selatre was coming to care for him could he come to care for her in return after falling in love with elise and then watching that love crumble to ashes he wondered if he dared let himself become vulnerable to a woman again in some ways going into battle against the monsters was easier there at least he knew what he had to do to come through unhurt van said mind you fox i have nothing against the lass too quiet for my taste but im a roisterer born and youre not but i do want to know youre doing what youre doing with your eyes open i dont even know gerin said heavily i tell you this much though just as you find selatre too quiet a couple of years of life with fand have left my ears ringing and thats the truth ah its not so bad van said she shouts you shout back after the yellings done you futter a couple of times and alls right till the next goround weve done that more than once she and i gerin said too many times more than once as a matter of fact that sort of thing gets wearing in a hurry at least for me ah fox you pay fancy prices for pepper and cloves and the gods only know what all else to make your food taste interesting and you want the rest of your life dull as oatmeal porridge without even salt my food wont stick a knife in me if it doesnt like the way ive cooked it gerin retorted and i wouldnt mind the rest of my life turning dull for a while these past few years what with one thing and another its been too bloody lively to suit me van yawned an enormous sarcastic yawn nettled gerin said for that matter you great barrelbrained oaf ive never heard you speak fand so fair heres a warning if she throws me over shell aim her whole self straight at you are you ready for that i can handle her van said confidence throbbing in his voice gerin wondered if he was as smart as he thought he was a peasant brought the fox the news hed been dreading the fellow arrived in the back of a chariot along with notker the bald and his driver he looked stunned not only at traveling that way and faring so far from his home but also gerin thought for deeper reasons his own face might have borne that expression of disbelieving amazement just after the ground at ikos stopped shaking its happened the fox asked notker aye lord gerin his vassal returned this fellow here made it to my keep day before yesterday from his village next to the lands of capuel the flying frog i thought youd best listen to his story so i fetched him hither his lined face made him look even more worried than he sounded monsters gerin asked monsters aye and worse notker said gerin had not imagined there could be worse notker pointed to the serf hed brought to fox keep this here is mannor trout lordhes the best fisherman in his village which is how he got his ekename and likely why hes alive today he nudged mannor tell the lord prince the tale you told me the peasant brushed a lock of dark hair back from where it had flopped down onto his forehead aye lord notker he said in rustic accents his voice rang oddly flat as if he held all emotion back from it to keep from having to remember the terror hed known my village is southwest of here you know close to the border of your holding and i know gerin said impatiently i rode that way not long ago in search of my son duren i dont recall seeing you though you didnt nor i you though the talk of you going through lasted for days mannor said i was off fishing then too he drew himself up with pride or at least its memory i bring in enough from the streams that they dont begrudge me staying out of the fields they didnt i mean he shivered that passionless tone hed been using threatened to flee leaving him naked against whatever it shielded him from so you were at the stream the day i passed through your village and you were at the stream this other day the one youre going to tell me about gerin said wanting to move the tale along without making mannor face more than he could stand the serf nodded that lock of hair fell onto his forehead again this time he let it stay he said i was having a day to beat all days if you know what i mean lord prince every time i stuck a new worm or a grub on my hook id catch me a big tasty one i would werent much past noon when i had me bout as much as i felt like hauling back reckoned id eat some trade me some to other folk smoke me some for winter and salt down the rest weve a good lick close by we do all well and good gerin said so you were carrying your fish back to the villagethrough the woods is that right just like you say mannor agreed i get myself inside maybe two furlongs of the fields and hear the most horrible racket you ever put ear on in all your born days wolves howling longtooths caterwaulingput em all together and they aint a patch on this i drop my fish and run up to see what i can see monsters in the village gerins voice was as flat as the peasants monsters aye but thats not all mannor said there was monsters but there was trokmoi too and they was workin together to wreck and kill dyaus drop me into the hottest hell if i lie notker nodded his face now even grimmer hed already heard the tale gerin stared in horrified dismay hed imagined a great many catastrophes he was good at it but never in his blackest nightmares had he dreamt the creatures from the caves under bitons temple wouldor couldmake common cause with his human foes how do you mean working together he demanded of mannor were the trokmoi using the monsters for hunting dogs to drive people out for destruction adiatunnus was clever no way around that perhaps he or one of his men had figured out a way to tame the monsters but the serf shook his head some of the things they was just goin around bitin whatever they could get their teeth into like they was wolves or summat like that but some they was carryin swords and spears and even talkin some kind of growly talk with the red mustaches they were uglier than the woodsrunners but otherwise i didnt see much to choose between em can you confirm this gerin asked notker it wasnt so much that he disbelieved mannor as that he so much wanted to disbelieve him his vassal said no lord prince as soon as i heard the story i figured you had to give ear too but do you think its one hed make up the fox didnt but he wished notker hadnt made him realize he didnt almost unnoticed by both of them mannor went on two o the things they caught my little boy they was squabbling over him like dogs over a bone till a trokme he seen what was happening and he takes his axe and chops the body in half quietly hopelessly he began to weep here gerin said tasting the uselessness of words here he put an arm around the serfs shoulder mannors tears soaked hot through his tunic he held the man and held his own face even harder to keep from breaking down and blubbering along with him hearing what had happened to the serfs son reminded him all too vividly of all the things that might have happened to duren that he did not know whichif anyhad befallen the boy only let him exercise his ability to envision disasters what do we do with him lord gerin notker asked the fox waited until mannor had cried himself out then said first thing to do is get him good and drunk he pointed the serf toward the entrance to the long hall of the keep go on in there mannor tell them i said to give you all the ale you can drink he shoved mannor in the direction of the doorway the man went as if he had no will of his own left gerin turned back to notker we have to see if he can live with this now he has to see for himself too it wont be easy hell carry scars no less than if hed been wounded in war poor fellow you know about that lord prince notker said the fox nodded these days he had no family left his father and brother slain his wife run off and his son stolen as hed grown used to doing he resolutely shoved that grief and worry to the back of his mind more immediately urgent worries took precedence he said to notker the trokmoi and monsters didnt assail your keep no lord notker answered first i heard of them coming over the border from capuelsdyaus knows why we still call it that with nobody in charge there these past yearswas when mannor brought word the gods only know whats happened since mind you but youd reckon raiders and yon creatures could move faster than a griefcrazy serf if they had a mind to that you would gerin rubbed his chin in perplexity notker shared that perplexity not like what youd look for from the woodsrunners neither the trokmoi when they hit you they mostly hit you like a man going into a woman they want to get in as deep as they can as fast as they can true enough gerin made an abstracted clucking noise then suddenly held up one finger i have it i think adiatunnus is a sneaky beggar and smart toothough not half so smart as he thinks he is hes cobbled up some kind of deal with these creatures but he doesnt know how well its going to work so he thinks hell try it out small at first and if it does what he hopes why then hell strike harder the next time how does that sound to you dont know if its true notker said after some thought of his own makes decent sense though in a way it does the fox said but only in a waythats why i called adiatunnus halfsmart now im warned hell be gathering his forces collecting more monsters doing whatever he thinks he needs to do and do you know what i aim to do in the meanwhile whats that lord notker asked i aim to hit him first the chariot hit a bump gerins legs kept him smoothly upright without conscious thought on his part how am i supposed to administer my holding if im too busy fighting to pay heed to anything else he asked van had adjusted as automatically as the fox he glanced over and answered i dont know the answer to that one but let me give you one in return how are you supposed to administer your holding if the trokmoi and the monsters swarm out and take it away from you there you have me gerin said if i cant keep it it isnt truly mine but if i cant run it its hardly worth keeping schooling south of the high kirs had left him fond of forming such paradoxes van cut through this one with the ruthless economy he usually displayed if you still hold on to it you can always fix it later if its lost its gone for good youre right of course gerin said but the admission left him dissatisfied endless warfare would hurl his holding back into barbarism faster than anything else he could think of but as van had said everything else turned irrelevant if he didnt win each war along with his regathered host of vassals he rolled southwest down the same road hed taken to adiatunnus border after duren disappeared this time he wouldnt stop and exchange polite chitchat with the trokme chieftains border guards hed go after adiatunnusand his monstrous allieswith all the might he had notker the bald brought his chariot up alongside gerins he pointed ahead theres my keep off to one side at our pace well make the village before sunset so we will and then roll through it gerin said as soon as the sun had started to swing down toward the horizon from its high point in the sky hed ordered a couple of chariots out two furlongs ahead of the rest the trokmoi were often too impatient to set proper ambushes and he suspected the monsters adiatunnus had taken as allies would be even less skilled in the stratagems of war a puff of breeze from the west brought a whiff of something sickly sweet raffo turned and wrinkled his nose phew whats that stink dead meat van answered the fox nodded were coming up on the village mannor trout got out of or whats left of it mannor didnt lie thats certain the closer they got the worse the smell grew gerin coughed the stink of carrion always made fear and rage bubble up in him it called to mind the aftermath of too many fights too many horrors the serf village though was worse than hed expected hed been braced for sprawled bloated corpses and charred ruins and they were there hed looked for the livestock to be run off or slain and it was hed known the crows would rise in a black cloud and the foxes slink off into the woods when he disturbed them and they did but he hadnt reckoned on so many of the pathetic corpses looking as theyd been mostly devoured before the scavengers started on them his stomach did a slow flipflop he should have realized the monsters wouldnt be fussy about where they got their meat intellectually he had realized it the implications though had escaped him van said i had thought to round up a hen or two here to give to the ghosts come sundown and to cook up for us too but now im going to let that go the gods alone know what these hens have been pecking at since the trokmoi and their little friends went home gerins stomach lurched again reasoned like a philosopher he said anthropophagy even at one remove was worth fighting shy of a few minutes later a pig stuck its head out of the bushes no one shot at it it was even likelier than any surviving village chickens to have fed on the bodies of those who had raised it after making sure no life remained in the village gerin waved his arm the chariots rattled on toward the border with the holding of capuel the flying frog how much of that now lay in the hands of the trokmoi and the monsters was anyones guess few men said much about what theyd seen in the clearing but a new grim sense of purpose informed the force theyd collect the payment due and more just before sunset a cock pheasant made the mistake of coming out from the woods onto a meadow to feed its ringnecked head came up in alarm when it saw or perhaps heard the chariots on the road it began to run rapidly then leaped into the air its wings thuttering arrows hissed toward it one of them either cleverly aimed or luckier than the rest brought the bird tumbling back to earth well shot gerin called not only will it feed the ghosts itll feed some of us too aye a pheasants tasty no doubt of that van said me though id sooner hang it a while to let it get properly ripe before i cook it yes ive seen you do that at fox keep once or twice gerin said i dont care for my meat flyblown thank you very kindly besides weve no time for such fripperies tonight bringing it down at all strikes me as a good enough omen flyblowns not the point van replied bringing out the full flavor is but youre right about today we just pluck it and gut it and put it over the flames or bake it in clay fuel for the fire the fox agreed itll help us keep going and then well get into adiatunnus lands and set some fires of our own for all gerin knew the trokme guards at the border to adiatunnus holding might have been the same crew with whom hed spoken when he came seeking duren this time he didnt get a close look at them as soon as they saw his force of chariotry approaching they cried the southrons in their own language and fled they got in among the trees before any of his men could shoot them like the pheasant shall we stop and go after them lord prince raffo asked no the fox answered we storm ahead instead that way we get in amongst the woodsrunners faster than they have word were coming the first village his men reached was inhabited by elabonian serfs who had acquired new masters in the five years since the trokmoi swarmed south over the niffet when they realized the men in the chariots were of their own kind they came swarming out of their huts with cries of exultation the gods be praised they shouted youve come to deliver us from the trokmoi and from thethings with that seemingly innocuous word half their joy at seeing gerin and his followers seemed to evaporate boiled away in the memory of overpowering fear one of them said the trokmoi are bad enough stealing and raping and all but those things his voice guttered out like a candle if you want to go just pack whatever you can carry on your backs and run for my holding gerin said the peasants there will take you in the ground is thin of men these days with so much war and plunder theyll be glad to have you to help bring in a bigger crop dyaus bless you lord the serf said fervently then he hesitated but lord how shall we travel with these things loose in the woods and ready to swoop down on us take weapons fool van said anything you have is better than nothing would you rather be eaten trying to get away or stay here till the monsters come into your house and eat you in your own bed truth to tell lord the serf said taking no chances on the outlanders rank id sooner not be et at all then get out gerin said now weve no more time to waste gabbing with you the trokmoi and the monsters destroyed a peasant village in my land just over the border from what used to be capuels holding now theyre going to find out they cant do that without paying the price for it he slapped raffo on the shoulder the driver flicked the reins of the chariot the horses started forward the fox put himself in the lead now with dragos chariot right behind the bear would reliably follow him and wouldnt do anything foolish that counted for more than whatever brilliant stratagems rihwin might come up with for rihwin might just as easily do something to endanger the whole force the road opened onto another clearing this one recently hacked out of the woods in it stood three or four stout wooden houses bigger and sturdier than the round cottages in which most serfs dwelt those are trokme homes gerin said ive seen enough of them north of the niffet lets get rid of the trokmoi in em then van said one of those trokmoi came out from behind a house he stared in amazement that might have been comical under other circumstances at the elabonians encroaching on what hed come to think of as his land that lasted only a couple of heartbeats then he let out a shout of alarm and dashed for shelter inside gerin already had an arrow in the air it caught the woodsrunner in the small of the back he went down with a wail gerin caught vans eye try doing that with your precious spear he said another trokme came outside to see what the shouting was about gerin and drago both shot at himand both missed he ducked back into the house in a hurry slammed the door and dropped the bar with a thump gerin could hear across half a furlong fire arrows gerin yelled a couple of chariots had firepots in them half full of embers ready to be fanned to life others carried little bundles of straw soaked in pitch while some of his men got real fires going others tied the bundles to arrows just back of the heads still others used shields to protect them from the trokmoi who started shooting at them from the windows of the houses trailing smoke the fire arrows flew toward the woodsrunners shelters some fell short some went widetheir balance was all wrong but others stuck in wall timbers or the thatch of the roofs before long smoke rose up from a dozen different places the trokmoi inside yelled at one another some of the voices belonged to women one corner of gerins mouth twisted down but only for a moment the trokmoi hadnt cared about women or children when they struck his holding what did he owe them the fires on the roofs grew and spread the womens cries rose to shrill shrieks then suddenly stopped doors came open red and yellowmustached men charged out half a dozen in all some had helms on their heads two or three carried shields they threw themselves at gerins troopers with no thought for their own survival only the hope of taking some elabonians with them before they fell youll not have our wives and daughters for your sport one of them panted as he slashed at the fox were after slaying the lot of them vans spear caught the woodsrunner in the side the fellow wore no armor it bit deep van twisted the shaft as he yanked it out the trokme coughed bright blood and crumpled gerin looked around none of the other woodsrunners was still on his feet one of his own men swore as he bound up a slashed arm that seemed to be the only wound his warriors had takentheyd so outnumbered their foes that theyd dealt with them three and four and five to one and not all of them had been engaged by a long shot the houses kept on burning drago the bear said that smokes going to give us away its liable to gerin agreed though fire gets loose easily enough and its bloody hard to douse once it does adiatunnus and his lads will know something has gone wrong but not just whatuntil we show up and teach em lets get moving again before long they came to another peasant villageor rather what had been one now several monsters from under the temple at ikos stalked among the houses more of them tore at the carcasses of a couple of oxen in the middle of the village square they looked up muzzles and hands red with blood as gerins chariot came into sight two or three monsters ran straight for the chariot as any fierce beasts might have gerin shot one of them a lucky arrow right through the throat that made the others hesitate more thoughtful than any beasts would have been but it also gave the rest of the monsters the chance to snatch up weapons clubs spears and a couple of swords then they too rushed toward the fox their cries more like words than any he had heard from the creatures before he had a bad moment or two there there were a lot more monsters than he had men in the two lead chariots he was about to order raffo to wheel the horses around and retreat when reinforcements came rattling up some of the monsters kept on with the attack again as beasts might have done but others must have made the calculation hed been on the brink of a short time before they headed off into the woods to fight another day when the skirmish was done gerin pointed to the deserted huts in the village and said torch the place if those things were denning here we dont want to give them anyplace they can return to once we ve gone more smoke rose into the sky the fox knew that whoever saw it would figure out something unusual was going on in the northeastern part of the land adiatunnus had overrun his lips skinned back from his teeth he had reached the point where he was resigned to having a woodsrunner for a neighbor adiatunnus hadnt acted much differently from capuel the flying frog and the other elabonian barons hed displaced but if adiatunnus consorted with monsters that led gerin to another thought as raffo drove the chariot deeper into the trokmes territory the fox said to van i wonder how the monsters came to align themselves with adiatunnus most of the ones we saw in bevons holding wouldnt have had the wit to do such a thing if i had to guess captain id say theres smart ones and dumb ones same as with people the outlander answered say the smart ones are as smart as dumb people thatd make the dumb ones like wolves or longtooths or any other hunting beasts the smart onesd have the wit for something like banding together with the trokmoi and maybe even for bringing along some of their stupid friends he laughed makes em sound like half the folk we know doesnt it more than half gerin said van laughed again the fox went on i wish we didnt have to waste time with all these little fights i want to hit adiatunnus as hard and sudden a blow as i can but every skirmish we fight makes me slower to get to him and gives him more time to ready himself well we cant very well say to the woodsrunners we run intoor still less to these monsterssorry there friend we have more important things to do than slaughtering you right now can you hang about till were on our way back gerin snorted when you put it that way it was absurd all the same unease gnawed at him before hed set out on this punitive raid hed seen it clearly in his mind go into adiatunnus territory strike the trokmoiand with luck kill their chieftainand then fare home again reality was less clearcut as reality has a way of being before long his army rolled past the ruins of what had been a palisaded keep before the trokmoi came south over the niffet the woodsrunners hadnt bothered repairing the timbers of the outwall instead theyd built a dwelling of their own in the courtyard between the wall and the stone keep turning the place into a sort of fortified village a couple of trokmoi were up on what was left of the wall but they raised no alarm when gerins chariot came into sight are they all asleep he demanded indignantly he didnt like his enemies to act stupidly it made him wonder what sort of ruse they were plotting but van smacked one fist into the palm of his other hand me i know what it is captain they think were woodsrunners too by the gods youre right gerin waved toward the distant stronghold one of the trokmoi waved back the fox frowned i dont fancy going in after them they could have enough men to make that expensiveand it would cost us the speed and free movement the chariots give more fire arrows raffo said over his shoulder aye and maybe a muzzle for a mouthy driver too gerin answered but he swatted the young man on the back to leave no doubt that was a joke we want to make sure none of them gets away too so what well do is his chariot and dragos with it pulled off the road a little past the keep the trokmoi had altered that might have perplexed the men on the battered wall but not enough to make them cry out even when the first chariots of the foxs main force came into view they kept silent long enough to let the cars get well begun on forming a ring around the holding southrons the cry in the trokme language floated across weedy fields to gerins ears weve been cozened by southrons so they had and by the time they realized it they were too late to do anything about it the elabonian warriors shot arrows at any woodsrunner who appeared on the palisade some of them also shot fire arrows at the wooden palisade itself and over it at the roofs of the houses it sheltered the timbers of the palisade caught only slowly the same was not true for the dry straw thatching of those roofs well whatll they do now van said as several thick plumes of graywhite smoke rose from the courtyard curse me if i know gerin answered i dont know what id do in that spottry not to get into it in the first place i suppose but they dont have that choice not anymore some of the trokmoi took refuge in the stone keep in the center of the courtyardgerin saw bits of motion through its slit windows he wondered if that would save them the door and all the furnishings within were wood and liable to catch fire and even if they didnt so much smoke filled the air that anyone inside was liable to feel like a slab of bacon being cured the trokmoi had let the ditch around the palisade alone shrubs and bushes grew in great profusion in it that would have made matters easier for anyone who tried to lay siege to the castle but it helped those inside now some leaped off the wallnot just men but also women with their skirts flying up around them as they jumpedto land in those bushes and shelter there from fire and foe alike and the drawbridge thumped down a double handful of woodsrunners in bronze armor stormed forth to put up the best fight they could gerin admired their gallantry even as his men thundered toward them fighting afoot against chariotry was like trying to spoon up sand with a sieve the elabonians rattled by pouring arrows into their foes and the woodsrunners could do little but stand and suffer they had one moment of triumph an archer of theirs hit an oncoming horse in the neck the beast crashed to the ground dragging down its harnessmate and overturning the car the two horses pulled men tumbled over the ground like broken dolls the three or four trokmoi still standing raised a defiant cheer soon they were dead of the elabonians in the wrecked chariot one also lay dead his head twisted at an unnatural angle another writhed and groaned with a broken leg and other injuries besides the third parol chickpea was on his feet and hardly limping by all the gods im the luckiest man alive he cried gerin was not inclined to argue with him but said whether its so or not dont boast of it if you tempt the divine powers to take away what theyve given theyre too apt to yield to that temptation he did what he could for the warrior with the broken leg splinting it between two trimmed saplings the fellow had to be tied aboard a chariot after that though which ruined the cars efficiency and made him cry out at every bump and pothole in the roadand the road seemed nothing but bumps and potholes i should have brought a wagon to carry the wounded the fox said as they made camp that evening in the heart of the land adiatunnus had seized i didnt want anything to slow us down but here we are slowed down anyhow by all the fighting weve doneand we havent really come to grips with adiatunnus yet expecting a plan to run just as you make it asks a lot of the gods van said thats so gerin fretted despite the admission he always expected his plans to work perfectly if they failed that reflected unfavorably on him since he had formed them life being as it was few of them came to pass exactly as designed which left him plenty for which to reproach himself pale nothos nearly full was the only moon in the sky math was just past new and too close to the sun to be seen while tiwaz was a waning crescent and ruddy elleb halfway between full and third quarter it had been about there in its wanderings through the heavens when the fox and his men slew the first monster down in bevons holdings though rain clouds kept him from seeing it then thinking of that monster made him think of the monsters that had joined adiatunnus he did not expect the trokmoi themselves to sally forth against his men at night he still hoped though he didnt really believe adiatunnus hadnt yet learned of his attack even if the woodsrunners did know of it sending men out by night was not something to be undertaken lightly but the monsters were something else again hed already seen that the night ghosts held no terror for them they might well try to fall on his warriors when they had them at a disadvantage that made him double the watchstanders hed placed out away from the main campfires the men hed hauled from their blankets grumbled go back to sleep then he snapped if youd rather be well rested and dead than sleepy and alive how could i possibly presume to argue with you stung by sarcasm the newly drafted sentries went out to take their places sure enough monsters did prowl the woods and fields their yowls and screams woke the fox several times before midnight came hed grab for sword shield and helmet realize the creatures were not close by wriggle around till he was comfortable once more and go back to sleep then he heard screams that came not only from the monsters throats but also from those of his own men he snatched up his weapons and sprang to his feet the night was well along elleb had climbed halfway from the eastern horizon to the meridian but gerins eyes were not on the reddish moon its light that of nothos and the crimson glow of the embers showed two of his sentry parties locked in battle with the monsters and more of the creatures running toward the warriors slowly rousing themselves round the fire gerin shouted to distract a monster from an elabonian who still lay on the ground snoring the fox envied the mans ability to sleep through anything but wished he hadnt put it on display at that exact moment the monster swerved from the sleeping warrior and rushed at gerin moonlight glinted from its teeth its clawed hands were outstretched to rend and tear he was acutely aware of having only helm and shield cool night air blew through his linen shirt and wool trousers reminding him of what the monsters teeth and claws would do to flesh so nearly naked instead of slashing he thrust at the creature to keep the full length of arm and sword between it and him it spitted itself on the point of the bronze blade he twisted the sword in the wound then yanked it free the monster screamed again this time with the note of shocked surprise hed heard so often from wounded men as it staggered he thrust again this time taking it right in the throat blood fountained black in the light of the moons the monster stumbled fell and did not rise again the fox ran to the next closest fight he could find he stabbed a monster in the back it shrieked and whirled to face him whereupon the trooper it had been fighting gave it a sword stroke almost identical to the one gerin had used though the monsters were individually more than a match for unarmored men they had little notion of fighting save by and for themselves that let the elabonians slowly gain the upper hand on their attackers and like any beasts of prey the monsters were not enthusiastic about taking on foes who fought back hard they finally fled into the forest still screaming in fury and hate throw some wood on the fire gerin said lets see what needs doing here and do it as the flames leaped higher the warriors went around finishing off monsters too badly hurt to run or even crawl away several men were also down for good gerin rihwin and a couple of others who knew something of leechcraft did what they could for men who had been bitten or clawed lucky they didnt go for the horses van said holding out a gashed arm to be bound up that would have spilled the perfume into the soup wouldnt it gerin said as is well have some cars with two men in them rather than three but youre right it could have been worse it could that the outlander said every once in a while a trokme turn of phrase cropped up in his speech me im just as glad i wont be clumping along on foot when adiatunnus and his jolly lads come after us in their chariots thatll be tomorrow unless adiatunnus is blinder than i think youre right there too the fox said we could have run into them yesterday easy as not id hoped we would as a matter of fact all these little fights leave us weaker for the big one ahead van nodded but said weve hurt them worsen theyve done to us though i console myself with that thought gerin answered but drop me into the hottest hell if i know who can better afford the hurt adiatunnus or me he brought a lot of trokmoi south over the niffet with him the whoreson and these monsters only add to his strength well find out come the day van said more cheerfully than gerin could have managed for me though the only i thing i want to manage is some more sleep he set down spear and shield doffed his helm wrapped himself in his blanket and was snoring again while the fox still stared indignantly gerin could not put the desperate fight out of his mind so easily nor could most of his men some still groaned from their wounds while others sat around the fire and chatted in low voices about what theyd just been through the eastern sky turned gray then pink then gold tiwazs thin crescent almost vanished against the growing light of the background against which it shone the sun spilled its bright rays over the land the foxs men scratched shallow graves for their comrades the monsters had slain then covered them over with stones to try to keep the creatures or other scavengers from molesting their remains the corpses of the monsters now stiff in death they let lie where they had fallen drivers harnessed chariots lets get going gerin said what we do today tells how much this strike is worth the first peasant village through which they rolled was empty and deserted gerin thought nothing of that till his warriors had already passed the hamlet then he realized word of their coming had got ahead of them if the peasants knew invaders were loose in adiatunnus lands the trokmoi would know too well we didnt really think we could keep it a secret this long van answered when gerin said that aloud the outlander checked his shield and weapons to make sure he could get at them in an instant gerin told raffo to slow the pace when the driver obeyed and the chariots behind came up close enough he shouted the warning back to them then he thumped raffo on the shoulder his chariot rejoined dragos in the lead cattle sheep and a couple of horses grazed on a broad stretch of meadow they looked up in mild surpriseand the herders with them in dismaywhen elabonian chariots began rolling out the herdsmen fled for the woods but they were a long way away shall we go after em raffo asked by their red locks theyre woodsrunners no let em run gerin said they look like men who hardly have their breeches to call their own theyre no danger to us van pointed across the meadow more chariots these drawn by shaggy ponies and painted with bright spirals and jagged fylfots came rattling out of the woods there the men in them were paleskinned and lighthaired like the herders bronze shone ruddy in the morning sun you want folk dangerous to us fox i think youve found them van said before gerin could so much as nod drago the bear called from the other chariot what do we do now lord pull over to one side begin to form line of battle and clear the roadway so the cars behind us can deploy gerin answered raffo who knew his mind well already had the chariot in motion dragos driver conformed to his movements to van gerin murmured now we see how much adiatunnus has learned from a few years of fighting against elabonians aye if hes brought his own army in a great roaring mass trokme style hell swarm down on us before our friends get here the outlander said lets hope hes set out scouts the way we have and that theyre waiting for their main body too he chuckled the fighting trickll work against him this time not for much to gerins relief the trokmoi across the meadow didnt whip their horses into a wild charge instead they too sidled out onto the grass almost crab fashion as if wondering how many cars the fox had with him and how soon those cars would arrive gerin was wondering the same thing about the woodsrunners adiatunnus must have done a fine job of absorbing elabonian military doctrine for his supporters began coming out of the woods at about the same time as those of the fox the two lines of chariots stretched about to equal length on the meadow monsters stood between the cars of adiatunnus battle line gerin wondered whether that would do the trokme more good than harm the ponies that pulled the chariots seemed nervous of these fierce new allies adiatunnus cupped his hands and bellowed like a bull gerin knew that voice at the same moment gerin raised his arm and then brought it down to point toward the trokme line drivers on both sides whipped their teams forward chariot battles were generally fluid as quicksilver and this one proved no exception the herds in the broad field made teams swing wide to avoid them the pounding of the horses hooves the rattle and thump of the cars and warriors hoarse excited shouts panicked the sheep and cattle and made them run wild spreading more confusion still gerin plucked an arrow from his quiver nocked and let fly at adiatunnus if the chieftain fell that would make his followers easier meat shooting from the jouncing platform of a chariot carindeed standing in the car without hanging on to the rail to keep from being pitched out on your headwas anything but easy though endless practice let him do it without wondering how he managed he cursed when the trokme did not fall an arrow hissed by his own ear the woodsrunners were aiming at him too here and there men on both sides pitched out of chariots to sprawl in the thick green grass horses went down too and often made the cars they drew founder with them sometimes warriors would come up from those mishaps unhurt and go on to fight as foot soldiers a monster loped toward gerins chariot the creature was almost as fast as the horses and much more agile unlike some the fox had seen it carried no weapons even so it was clever enough to attack the beasts of burden rather than the men they hauled the horses could not fight back and if one of them went down the chariot was apt to overturn too the fox shot at the monster from only a few yards distance and turned the air sulfurous when his arrow went wide van was on the wrong side of the chariot to attack the creature and in any case could not reach it with his thrusting spear the horses squealed and shied away from the monster as it came up on them before gerin could draw another arrow raffo lashed the monster across its outstretched arms with his whip the thing screeched the driver hit it again craack this time across its muzzle just missing one eye the monster clapped a hand to the wound and fled along with three or four other chariots gerins overlapped the end of the trokme line come on well roll em up he shouted with fierce joy and led his men around the enemys flank the chaos they created was marvelous to beholdand would have been more marvelous still had the woodsrunners line not overlapped his on the other wing but it did and the whole battle spun round a mad wheel of destruction the fox found himself facetoface with adiatunnus the trokme had lost his helm somewhere in the fighting his bald pate glowed red from exertion and sun his eyes though were cold and shrewd well lord gerin he said with a mocking salute we lie athwart your way home now dont we you do that gerin answered in the trokme tongue but no more than we lie athwart yours fighting ebbed as the leaders parleyed adiatunnus scowled perhaps hed hoped to panic gerin but hed failed he looked over the field youve hurt us about as bad as the other way round he said are you fain to go on now or shall we say enough and have done gerin gauged the field too the trokme chief had the right of it the battle was drawn the woodsrunners had wrecked mannor trouts village but hed had his revenge there hed hurt adiatunnus lands worse fighting till only a handful of men still stood had scant appeal to him especially with the monsters on the loose enoughfor now he said reluctantly if you can hold thosethingsto a truce to let us separate that i can though ill thank you for not speaking ill of my friends and allies here adiatunnus said and for now indeedwell have at each other again i have no doubt och and when we do ill be after having more in the way of friends and allies but you foxwhat will you do gerin pondered that question as the rival forces warily passed through each other he was still pondering it when he crossed back over the border into his own holding and when he came home to fox keep ponder as he would though he found no answer that satisfied him viii my poor ear rihwin moaned for what had to be the five hundredth time gerin prided himself on being a patient man but when his patience snapped it snapped spectacularly by all the gods im sick to death of listening to your whining he growled and grabbed rihwin the southerner tried to twist free but gerin was the best wrestler in the northlands he twisted one of rihwins arms behind his back and started frogmarching him toward the shack where he worked his magics what are you doing rihwin yelped i am going to fix that ear of yours one way or the other the fox said rihwin hadnt struggled hard till then but he started to gerin twisted his arm up a little higher rihwin gasped as he felt his shoulder joint creak inside the shack gerin slammed him down onto the one rickety chair in front of the table where he labored at his sorcery hed managed to overawe rihwin which wasnt easy the southerner made no effort to bolt in a small voice he repeated what are you doing what i said id do use the law of similarity to build that ear of yours back to where its the same as the other one the spell should be simplicity itself what could possibly go wrong now rihwin did try to rise id really rather not find out given the choice between a halftrained wizardwhich you must admit is a charitable description of your talentsand keeping silent about my mutilation i opt without hesitation for silence gerin slammed him down again youve said that before over and over youve gone back on your word too over and over now dont be a donkeyjust sit there and ill set you right in no time unless you d rather i tried that operation you described no rihwin said hastily youre sure you know what youre doing he had the look of a man sitting down to gamble against a fellow notorious for using loaded dice i know what i have to do gerin answered which was not quite an affirmative he flipped through the vellum pages of a codex until he came to a cantrip which was a general application of the law of similarity then he paused a while in thought suddenly he smacked one fist into the other palm the very thing he exclaimed he turned to rihwin im going out to find something to tailor the spell to your very problem youd better be here when i get back what are you looking for rihwin still sounded suspicious gerin grinned triumphantly earwigs well father dyaus thats ingenious rihwin said perhaps i shall be here when you return with that gerin had to be content he went out and started turning over stones in the courtyard under one not very far from the stables he found several of the shiny dark brown insects they tried to crawl away but he grabbed them and carried them back to the shack even the little pincers on their posteriors will serve symbolically to represent the ring you wore in your ear why so they will all at once rihwin went from dubious to enthusiastic dont fribble away the time get on with it gerin got on with it but first spent more time studying the spell in the grimoire he knew his own inadequacy as a sorcerer and also knew he would never get the chance to make two serious blunders fitting a general spell to a specific application required certain adaptations of both verse and passes he muttered to himself planning in advance the rhymes hed use and the passes hed have to change the spell was intended to be simple which meant most of the passes used the right hand that hindered him more than it helped hed overcome the problem before though and expected to be able to do it again he felt confident as he launched into the chant his right hand was clumsy but seemed to be doing what he required of it he poured rose water over the earwigs hed imprisoned in a bronze bowl they didnt drown quite as fast as hed thought they would but surely that degree of exactitude wouldnt matter my ear feels strange rihwin remarked he brought his hand up to the ruined flap of flesh youve not changed it yet but the potential for change is manifestly there shut up gerin said fiercely though rihwin had given him good news the donkey had to know he didnt need to be distracted not when he was coming to the climactic moment of the spell his right hand twisted through the last pass he grunted in satisfaction at having done it correctly he cut a red wool thread with a bronze knife he never used for any other purpose and cried transform youve done it rihwin said exultantly i can feel the change gerin turned to see what his magic had wrought he suffered a sudden coughing fit and hoped his face would not betray him he had changed rihwins ear but not quite in the way hed intended it was indeed whole but not pink and round it was long and pointed and hairy he knew what had gone wrong hed called rihwin a donkey and then thought of him as a donkey when hed spoken up at the wrong time somehow the resentful thought had leaked into the conjuration and left his fellow fox with a donkeys ear a fly buzzing around the inside of the shack chose that moment to light on the newformed appendage as a donkeys ear will it twitched the fly flew away rihwin started violently and clapped a hand to his head the evidence alas was all too palpable what have you done to me you muddler muddled gerin kicked at the dirt floor of the shack feeling smaller and more useless than the earwigs hed drowned well what are you going to do about it you were going to give me an ear youyou moldy pigeon dropping not thisthis excrescence gerin had never heard an unwounded man scream through three consecutive sentences before in the abstract the feat was to be admired ill try my best to set it right gerin said i should be able to manage a simple reversal of the spell he reached for the grimoire you said the spell itself would be simple too rihwin reminded him he wasnt screaming any more but sarcasm sharp and sour as vinegar dripped from his tongue so i did gerin admitted look if all else fails ill buy you a hat that sent rihwins voice back into the upper registers gerin tried to ignore him though it wasnt easy in theory reversal spells were simple both the law of similarity and that of contagion applied and since hed just essayed the spell he wished to overturn the links were temporally strong on the other hand given the sorcerous ineptitude hed just demonstrated he made himself not think about that a magician needed to believe hed succeed a magician also needs talent part of him jeered the rest of him made that part shut up he plunged headlong into the first reversal spell he found the more time he spent thinking about it the more he d hesitate later if you fell out of a jouncing chariot you needed to get back in and ride again by luck most of the passes were for his left hand he went through them with care but not with confidencehe wondered when if ever hed have confidence in his magic once more rihwin sat in the chair arms folded glaring stonily at him normally having rihwin keep quiet while he cast a spell would have been a blessing as things were it just disconcerted gerin more he raced through the cantrip at a pace a practiced wizard would have hesitated to match one way or another hed know soon his fingers twisted through the last and hardest pass of the spell let all be as it was he yelled something happened rihwin said i felt it but he didnt raise his hand to discover exactly what it was maybe he was afraid he asked gerin did you deck me out with an octopus tentacle i havent even seen octopus tentacles since that sithonian eatery i used to frequent in the city of elabon gerin replied he stared at the place where the donkeys ear had sprouted from rihwins head thats not a responsive answer rihwin sighed theatrically very well since you wont tell me i shall just have to find out for myself slowly he brought his left hand up to his head his eyes grew as wide as gerins its my ear he whispered then even more amazed he added and its wholeisnt it it certainly looks that way gerin said does it feel so too by dyaus it does how ever did you manage that if i knew i would tell you gerin cudgeled his wits for an explanation at last he said the reversal spell must have undone your wound as well as my magicthats all i can think of rihwin felt of his ear theres the hole through which the hoop passed you must be right lord gerin like you i can think of no other explanation that fits now that his ear was restored he started to laugh my fellow fox you are the best bad magician i have ever known ill take that for a compliment suddenly gerin started to laugh too rihwins elastic features showed curiosity gerin explained if i could do on purpose what i did by accident think of the demand id be in from wenches who wanted to frolic and yet be wed as maidens rihwin leered aye and think of the fee you could charge too im surprised women dont already have a magic like that gerin said or maybe they do and just dont let on to us men it could be so rihwin agreed he felt his ear again as if not believing gerin had no matter how erratically accomplished exactly what hed said hed do now i have to wait until otes or another jeweler passes through so i can have a new hoop made to replace the one i lost if you get your ear torn again on account of that foolish southron conceit dont expect me to fix it for you gerin said if i come to you again to have my ear fixed i deserve to wear a donkeys in its place rihwin retorted gerin mimed taking an arrow in the ribs rihwin had won that exchange one of gerins warriors who held the elabon way open through bevons holding brought disquieting news back to fox keep lord prince its said bevon and two of his sons have made common cause with adiatunnusand with the monsters from ikos he said between swigs from a jack of ale said by whom gerin demanded not wanting to believe elabonians could fall so low as to align themselves with the creatures by bevander another of bevons sons the soldier answered he came to us calling down curses on past enmity and saying hed sooner cast his lot with you than with a bunch of things i wonder what he meant by that gerin said the monsters or his father and brothers the warrior whod brought word started then snorted as he was swallowing which made him choke and spray ale over the tabletop gerin plucked distractedly at his beard hed reckoned adiatunnus embrace of the monsters a hideous aberration if more and more lords proved willing to use the creatures to further their own ends they would gain a permanent place in the northlands he wondered which lord who favored them theyd first end up devouring what will you do lord gerin the soldier answered do about what captain van called from the stairway he and fand were coming down into the great hall hand in hand by the foolish grins on their faces gerin had no trouble imagining what theyd been doing up on the second floor fand smirked at him just in case he had had trouble she wanted to make him jealousher door stayed closed to him these days he knew a certain amount of annoyance at the way she flaunted what she was up to but jealousy stayed dormant he wondered what that was telling him to keep from having to think about it he turned to the trooper and said tell him what you just told me the trooper obeyed van scowled and rubbed at the scar that creased his nose fand poked him in the ribs indignant at being forgotten he let go of her hand and slipped his arm around her waist she molded herself against him but most of his attention was still on what hed just heard good question he said what will you do fox i dont know yet gerin answered i begin to think i need allies myself i wonder if the monsters have got to schilds lands yet if they have he may be more likely to remember hes my vassal and ricolf will fight on my side even if he isnt fond of me anymore the trokmoi south of the niffet will range themselves with adiatunnus sure and they will fand said gerin couldnt tell whether she was trying to be helpful or to goad him further he gave her the benefit of the doubt i wouldnt be surprised if youre right all the more reason for me to look for those who will help me struggle against them he puckered his lips as if at a sour taste he hated having to rely on any power but his own it left him too vulnerable by half but he was already vulnerable in a different way hagop son of hovan van began is hardly worth having on my side for he brings little force with him gerin interrupted i want to win this fight not have it drag on forever as he spoke one way to do that came to mind if grand duke aragis would make common cause with me now van fand and the trooper all stared at him he didnt suppose he could blame them ever since elabon abandoned the northlands and the trokmoi entered them he and aragis had been most successful at building from the ruins of empire hed taken for granted that they would clash one day and assumed aragis had done the samea notion their meeting at ikos had only reinforced but the monsters and the lords who would use them to augment their own power were a danger to aragis no less than to gerin at last van said you dont think small captain that much i give you the more gerin looked at the idea the more he liked it himself i see two problems he said one is making sure we stay allies with aragis and dont end up his vassals hell have the same concern about us no doubt it could make working together ticklish aye i can see that one van said with a sage nod this setup of vassalage you elabonians have makes you so sticky about rank and honor that its a wonder you ever get anything done whats the second gerin made a wry face simply getting a messenger from fox keep to the castle of the archer with all the monsters loose on the land between what i hold and what belongs to aragis i really should send a goodsized fighting force just to see to it that he hears my offer and i hear his answer but i cant afford to do that not now not with the monsters and the trokmoi and now bevon and his sons ganging together against me send rihwin van suggested ever since you got him that one ear back hes been talking both of mine off aboutwhat does he call ityour natural talent as a mage thats right remembering the near fiasco in the shack the fox said that only proves hes not as smart as he thinks he is he plucked at his beard again i need to ponder this a bit more before i go and do it its not something i can just set in motion before i try to look at the places it may lead rihwin would van said but then you already said what needs saying about him not that hes stupid mind but that he thinks he has your dyaus view of things and he doesnt i dont what rihwin asked coming into the great hall from the courtyard know your backside from a longtooth turd fand said gerin and van hadnt put it so pungently but it did a fair job of summing up their opinion rihwin looked down over his shoulder at the part of him cited thats what i thought i had there he said as if in relief trying to sit down on a longtooth turd strikes me as unaesthetic as what now fand said her elabonian was fluent but that was not a word used every day in a frontier castle of a former frontier province of the decaying empire of elabon messy and smelly gerin translated for her hes making a joke is he then why doesnt he up and do it fand said i take a certain amount of pleasure at being insulted by so fair a lady rihwin said bowing but only a certain amount he turned on his heel and strode out a pity you gave him back his missing ear fand said to gerin better you should have torn off the other one she bared her teeth and looked every bit as savage as she sounded the fox was sure she meant to be taken literally he said what good would that do rihwin didnt listen with two ears and didnt with one so why do you think he would with none fand stared at him then gurgled laughter its not just that y are lefthanded fox but sure and you think that way as well how am i to stay angry at you now when you go sneaking round my temper with such silliness as that gerin didnt answer as far as he was concerned he hadnt done anything to deserve fands anger his thoughts were another matter but if menand women toowere scourged for their thoughts every back in the northlandsno every back in the worldwould bear stripes van said will you send to aragis then captain i think so gerin answered but as i said ill weigh it a bit more before i make up my mind i grudge the strength id have to send to make sure my embassy got through fair enough i suppose the outlander said but dont go weighing overlong my gut warns me we havent much time to squander if van was worried the situation could not be good van generally saw fighting as sport gerin had already thought matters bleak seeing his friends concern he wondered if he hadnt been too optimistic rap rap knocking on fands door gerin realized he hadnt been so nervous approaching a woman since hed gone off into the woods with a serf girl at about the age of fourteen if she told him no again he vowed hed have nothing more to do with her the door opened fand eyed gerin with the same irresolution he felt at last with the hint of a smile she said youre not one to give up easy are you now if i were id either be dead or living in the southlands gerin answered may i come in sure and youd do better with more sweet talk not just throwing it out so like a sausage splash into the soup pot fand sounded a trifle irked she didnt close the door in his face though as she had so many times lately after a moment she stepped aside and motioned for him to join her she closed the door behind him barred it a tunic lay on the bed bone needle and thread halfway through a rip on one sleeve gerin turned the sleeve right side out so he could see how the repair would look thats fine work he said for which i thank you though sewing by lamplight is more trouble nor its worth im thinking fand rubbed her eyes to show him what she meant after an awkward pause she went on but you didna come here to be talking of shirts she sat down on the bed no i didnt gerin sat down beside her i came because i hoped we could end the quarrel between us because you wanted to futter me fand said she didnt sound angry though as she had so often when she sent him away she might have been talking about how the wheat was doing this year after a moment gerin nodded saying he didnt want her would have been a lie fands mouth quirked in a wry smile och youre no seducer are you now but have your way this once fox well see what we bring to it she pulled the tunic she was wearing up over her head then stood to slide off her brightly checked wool skirt seeing her naked made the breath catch in his throat as it always did she was a splendid woman and she knew it which only made the impression stronger gerin undressed in a hurry they got back down on the bed together they did their best to please each other the fox tried hard he could tell fand was doing the same thing he rolled off her quickly afterwards not wanting her to have to bear his weight any longer than she needed to i thank you she said and sat up gerin lay on one side he looked over to her and said its no good any more is it she sighed if youre after knowing the answer why dyou ask the question saying the words hearing them makes it seem real somehow he answered besides i might have been wrong he swung himself over to the side of the bed grabbed his breeches and put them back on as he fiddled with the waist string he added i wont trouble you that way again twas no trouble fand said twasnt much of anything at all if you take my meaning and isnt that a strange thing now the gods know i looked for the two of us to break but i thought twould be after a grand shindy wed both remember all our days but here we are justquits quits gerin echoed dully he leaned over and kissed her not on the mouth but on the cheek it was always lively while it lasted wasnt it if its come to the point where its not any more as well we give it up truth there fand sent him an anxious look youd not throw me out of fox keep because im your doxy no more would you he laughed and have van come after me with that mace of his not likely no youre welcome to bide here as long as you likeprovided you dont drive everyone around you utterly mad that may not be so easy for you he chuckled to show he didnt expect to be taken altogether seriously och when im the only one right and the whole world beside me wrong how can i not speak out plain but fand laughed too i ken what youll tell meyou wish id find a way well ill try indeed and i will what comes of it well have to see he nodded and got to his feet walking to the doorway felt strange hed never parted from a longtime lover before elise had parted from him and without a word of warning but that wasnt the same thing with his hand on the bar he turned back and said goodbye the word came out funereally somber maybe that crossed fands mind too for she said ive not died yknow nor yet headed back to the forests ill be down for porridge come the dawn same as always but she also seemed to feel the moment it wont be the same any more will it no but its likely better this way if we did go on long enough wed have ended up hating each other something of that had happened with him and elise though there it had been quiet and onesided till it burst out when she left if he stayed by the door talking he was liable to end up talking himself out of what hed resolved to do he swung up the bar fand came over to lower it after he left she smiled a farewell as he stepped out into the hallway closed the door after him from her chamber to his was only a few strides in the moment he needed to step between them selatre came down the hall probably on her way to the garderobe shed seen fands door close she looked from it to gerin and back again then kept walking without a word or another glance his face heated the kindest thing selatre could think of him was that hed just slaked his lust he wanted to run down the hall after her and explain that he and fand werent going to do that sort of thing any more but he didnt think shed listen whats the use he muttered and opened the door to his own chamber he closed it after himself threw off his clothes and flung himself down onto the bed the strawstuffed mattress shifted back and forth on the grid of rawhide straps that supported it the slow rolling motion made gerin feel as if he were on a chariot just setting out in a little while selatres soft footsteps came back up the hall as she returned to the chamber hed given her they didnt pause in front of fands doorway nor in front of his if anything they sped up silence returned outside the moons wheeled through their endless dance tiwaz full elleb lost in the bright skirts of the sun math waxing between first quarter and full nothos waning from full toward third quarter gerin got up and stared through his narrow window at the multiple shadows the moons cast nothos had climbed almost to his high point in the sky before the fox finally slept after a couple of days of thought gerin did appoint rihwin his envoy to aragis the archer he would sooner have fared south himself but dared not not with so many things poised to go wrong close to home tell him how things are here he said to rihwin the alliance i offer is equal neither of us to have any claim of superiority over the other if he doesnt care for that to the five hells with him and rihwin my fellow fox my friend my colleague ah now that youve sweetened it here comes the gibe rihwin said if you choose to take it as one aye gerin answered to me it was just going to be a remark your nature makes me make what i was going to say is this for dyaus sake dont get cute i rihwin was the picture of offended dignity what could you possibly mean what i said ive met aragis he has about as much laughter and merriment in him as a chamber pot does but hes anything but stupid stick to the matter at hand with him and youll do fine get away from itstart telling jokes drink too much ale anything of the sortand all youll earn from him is contempt i dont want that to rub off on me because youre going there as my agent is that clear if you dont care for the way i do things send drago the bear rihwin said sulkily hell do exactly as you sayhe hasnt the wit to do anything else thats why im sending you gerin answered but you need to understand whats riding on this and that i dont want any of your japes and scrapes as you fare south you may not be able to help it i know theyre in your blood do your best all the same rihwins features registered anger resignation and amusement all in the space of a couple of breaths at last he said very well lord prince i shall essay the role of a sobersided nitpicker in short i shall model my conduct on you in all regards as if that were not enough he added to make the impression complete i shall seek to carry off any nubile female relative the grand duke may happen to have he cocked his head to one side to see what impression that had on gerin the fox started to scowl started to curl his hands into fists but gave up and threw them in the air while he broke out laughing you sirrah are incorrigible he declared i certainly do hope so rihwin answered blithely now that we ve settled how im to comport myself on this embassy with how large a retinue am i to be entrusted four chariots and teams feels about right to me gerin said any more and youd look like an invasion any fewer and youre liable not to get through what say you to that my fellow fox it strikes me as about the right number rihwin said if youd said i was to go alone i wouldnt have gone had you put me in charge of a dozen chariots rather than a dozen men id have assumed youd gone daftmore daft than usual i should say for this ringing endorsement of my faculties i thank you gerin said now go ready yourself i want you to leave before sunset the matter grows too urgent to admit of much more delay if you and aragis together cant control what happens in the northlands who can rihwin asked adiatunnus perhaps gerin said rihwin looked startled then made a sour face and finally nodded he began a prostration such as he might have offered to the emperor of elabon had he actually got down on his belly gerin would have kicked him in the ribs without hesitation but he stopped with the obeisance half made and went off to get ready to travel gerin felt better now that hed made his decision he was doing something not waiting on adiatunnus and the monsters to do something to him that desire to see something no matter what happen had brought others down he knew as much but waiting to be ruined did not sit well with him either he walked back into the keep from the courtyard he didnt know how badly his raid had hurt adiatunnus but at the least it must have made the trokme thoughtful for the fox had had no reports of woodsrunners on his side of the border since not many monsters had gone after his peasants either to him that made the raid something worth doing too van and fand were sitting in the great hall jacks of ale in front of them van gnawed on a mutton shank left over from the night before when gerin came in fand pushed herself closer on the bench to the outlander as if to say the fox couldnt take her away from him but gerin was mostly relieved not to have to look forward to their next tiff if van wanted to stay with her he wouldnt stand in his friend s way he dipped up a jack of ale for himself and sat down across from the closeknit couple after a pull at the jack he told van what hed done the outlander considered it nodded gravely if your pride wont keep you from working in harness with aragis its probably the best move you could make if its between pride and survival i know which to choose gerin said fand sniffed wheres the spirit in that a serf would say as much gerin started to bristle then reminded himself he didnt have to let her outrage him have it however youd like he said i can only answer for myself he drained the jack set it down on the table in front of him and got to his feet a very good morning to you both now by your leave i have other things to attend to as he headed for the stairway he felt fands eyes on his back she didnt say anything though maybe she was also reminding herself that they didnt have to quarrel on the other hand he thought maybe she was just speechless that he hadnt risen to her bait upstairs he hurried down the hall toward the library hed been doing that ever since he came back from south of the high kirs when he was with his books he could remember the scholar hed wanted to become and forget the baron the gods had decided he would be had his footsteps grown quicker yet since he started teaching selatre her letters well what if they have he asked himself she was waiting for him when he got there she was not the sort to sit idle she had a spindle and some wool and was busy making thread she smiled and put down the spindle when he came through the door now for something my wits can work on not my hands she said sounding as if she looked forward to the switch more on the nature of the gods gerin said pulling a scroll from the pigeonhole where it rested ah good she said briskly my own life was so bound up with biton that i know less of the rest of the gods than i should especially seeing how my circumstances have changed she no longer sounded bitter only matteroffact the fox slipped the velvet cover from the scroll worked the handles until he reached the section he and selatre were going to read ah today we come to the god his voice changed here read it for yourself mavrix selatre said sounding out the name shed caught gerin s sudden shift of tone why does the sithonian god of winewhats the word i wantdisturb you raise my hackles you mean gerin shivered weve had dealings mavrix and i id guess the gods not happy with them and i know im not if it werent for mavrix rihwin would still be a mage if it werent but never mind all that now i can tell it another time just read me what our deathless author set down on parchment irony filled his voice the scroll was a thoroughly humdrum compilation of the deities worshiped by the various peoples of the elabonian empire he would gladly have replaced it with a more interesting volume on the same theme had he been lucky enough to stumble across one selatre was not yet at the point where she could appreciate fine points of style she fought her way through words and sentences seizing meaning as best she could mavrix the god of wine native to sithonia she read is also widely reverenced in elabon his votaries are even found north of the high kirs although all wine in that distant province is of necessity imported the scroll says it but i never knew of mavrixs cult up here gerin said still and all when rihwin invoked him in a minor magic he appearednot to do rihwins bidding but to punish him for associating with me and why did the god see fit to do that selatre asked before the fox could answer she held up a hand tell me another time as you said i resume the cult of mavrix is held in chief repute by those who have little happiness in their lives in the release they take from wine and from the orgiastic nature of his worship they find the pleasure otherwise lacking to them does orgiastic mean what i think it does every sort of excess gerin asked selatre nodded gerin said thats what it means all right go on youre doing very well thank you selatre started reading again the emperors of elabon sometimes persecuted those who took part in mavrixs rites when sithonia was a newly acquired province like much else sithonian however the gods cult has become an accepted part of elabonian life in recent years and the cry evoii is often heard all through the empire ive heard it gerin said if i never hear it again ill be just as glad mavrix is a powerful god but not one whom i care to worship i like order too well to be easy with the lawlessness the lord of the sweet grape fosters selatre clicked her tongue between her teeth the lord biton is also a patron of order and reason so i understand what you are saying and yetmay i read on seems you already have if you know what comes next in the scroll gerin said you read that with just your eyes alone didnt you not many can do that so soon quite a few have to say the words to themselves no matter how long theyve been reading you dont selatre said i tried to imitate you after a few seconds he said i cant think of the last time anyone paid me a compliment like that thank you he let out a wry chuckle not that youre likely to find the way most folks go by looking to me for a guide i think you have the better way selatre said which produced a longer silence especially since as gerin noted she didnt qualify the comment with here or any such thing she looked down at the scroll again and read some more mavrix is also the god who chiefly inspires poets and other artists and is the patron of the drama his love for beauty is well known she looked up from the scroll those are worthy attributes for a god i think oh indeed gerins voice was dry our chronicler here though is a ratherhmm how should i put ita reticent man shall we say among other ways the gods love for beauty manifests itself as a passion for pretty boys he wondered how selatre would take that and whether shed even understand what he was talking about both the sithonians and their gods were fonder of pederasty than the northlands peasants among whom shed spent her life until biton chose her for his own but she must have figured out what he meant for she laughed heartily then sobering she said is that written down in one of your other books if not it may be lost do you know im not sure gerin answered youve just made me sure of one thing though not that i wasnt already i couldnt have found anyone better to oversee this library now you compliment me she said in turn i want to thank you once more for bringing me here to tend your books its not the life i had but its far more than i had any reason to hope for this time she didnt just set her hand on his she clasped it nor did she pull away when he returned the pressure he started to lean forward to kiss her then hesitated not from lack of desire but out of a scrupulous sense of fairness he said if youre drawn to me think on why if its only because im the one who brought you out of ikos and helped show you how to live in the wider world think on whether thats reason enough she laughed at him she couldnt have surprised him more if shed burst into flame i am a woman grown lord gerin and you are not my father as was her way she sobered fast what you are with the lady fand is something else again especially in light of what i saw the other night that sobered gerin in turn slowly he said the thing is dead aye you saw me leave her chamber he sighed aye wed been to bedwhat point denying it when its so we wont do that againno sense to it not when it was as it was if she and van get along i wish them nothing but joy if they dont i probably ought to wish him a hide as hard and thick as his corselet so you should she smiled again but not for long and is it because what you and fand knew is dead that you now show an interest in me maybe in part he answered which surprised her he quickly added but only in small part id say morefar moreis that you are as you are believe me or not as you will one of his eyebrows rose a sort of punctuation by expression besides you were the one who took my hand i wouldnt have presumed to do such a thing not with you being who you are i noticed that selatre said youd promised as much when you took me away from ikos but who knows what a mans promises are worth till theyre tested when i saw you meant what you said i she didn t go on but looked down at the scroll in front of her unlike fands her skin did not usually show much color but she flushed now you decided you wanted to take the first step gerin said selatre kept her eyes on the scroll but almost imperceptibly she nodded gerin plucked at his beard what hed known with fand had gone beyond the pleasure of the bedchamber but not far beyond there was a core of himself hed never yielded hed done that only once with elise and after what came of that he was waryno frightened he told himselfof risking it again but if he involved himself with selatre he would have to risk it he could feel as much already do you want to spend the rest of your days alone inside he wondered it was easier it was safer it was in the end empty are you sure he asked saying the words was almost as hard as going into battle selatre nodded a little less hesitantly with something of the feeling of a man diving into deep water gerin leaned toward her he wondered if she would know how to kiss shed said shed been consecrated to biton ever since her courses failed to start when she reached womanhood but her lips met his firmly her mouth opened and her tongue played with his it was in fact quite as satisfactory a kiss as hed ever had when at last they broke apart he said where did you learn that in my village of course she looked puzzled for a moment then burst out laughing again oh i seeyou expected me to be not just a maiden but ignorant as well no some of the young men there couldnt have cared less that the god had set his mark on me i knew i couldnt yield my body to them but that doesnt mean i led an altogether empty life oh he said in a small voice i hadnt thought of that when you said biton had chosen you i suppose i thought youd lived solitary from that time on no selatre said again it wasnt like that not until the god called to himself the sibyl that was and chose me in her placethough only for a brief time her face clouded for a moment then cleared but i must say you were right if that time is ended i have to live the rest of my life as best i can this time she leaned toward him the kiss went on and on his arms closed around her she stiffened when he cupped her breast with one hand he took the hand away if youre not ready just let me know he said he still wasnt sure how fast he wanted to charge ahead with her had he been a few years younger lust would have overridden thought but those days were past him even if van still sometimes thought more with his crotch than with his head selatre said having come this far i think its time to finish the job of returning me to the world ive heard it can hurt the first time but if you know hurt may be coming its easier to bear i hope i wont hurt you or not badly gerin said when i was down in the city of elabon another student there had a scroll on the proper way to deflower a maiden as gently as possible what it said made good sense though i confess ive never needed to use it till now they write books about that selatre said her eyes wide if you had one of those in your library here gerin think how many more people you could win to reading youre right i expect he said remembering the illustrations with which the scribe had enlivened the scroll then he noticed selatre had called him by his name alone without the honorific shed always used before it startled him for a moment then he laughed at himself if they were about to be intimate didnt she have the right to address him intimately he was never sure afterwards which of them got up first from the table in the library they walked side by side down the hall toward his bedchamber with any other woman he would have slipped his arm around her waist with selatre he still held back in spite of what they were going to the bedroom to do if she wanted to touch him before then she could they were three or four strides from the door when the lookout in the watchtower winded his horn gerin stopped dead grinding his teeth he said oh a pestilence not now by all the gods he couldnt read selatres face was that wry amusement there or maybe relief if they didnt seize the chance now would she change her mind later what was he supposed to do if she did pretend nothing had happened or then the lookout shouted lord gerin rihwin the fox is heading back toward fox keep what gerin exclaimed his worries about selatre forgotten i only sent him out two days ago he cant even have got out of the land i hold let alone to aragis and back has he lost his wits has he lost his nerve selatre said youd better go and see what thats about other things can wait for their own time yes he said abstractedly that sounded promising even if she hadnt promised anything he barely noticed he was already trotting for the stairs selatre followed more slowly gerins trot went to a run as soon as he got down to the great hall he dashed out into the courtyard sprinted for the gate someone called from up on the palisade i see rihwin and the chariot crews that went out with him lord prince but hes got more crews with him than just those not men i recognize neither the drawbridge was already creaking down over the ditch around the palisade panting a little gerin waited impatiently for it to drop far enough to let him see out at last it did sure enough there was rihwins chariot in the lead but he was bringing back twice as many crews as hed set out with no sooner had the drawbridge thumped into place than gerin walked across it the quicker he found out what madness rihwin was perpetrating now the quicker he could start figuring out how to deal with itif it could be dealt with he was getting tired of having to clean up rihwins messes especially when they were as exquisitely mistimed as this one seeing gerin rihwin waved hail lord prince he called the business of going to aragis holding just got easier gerin waited till rihwin got close enough so he wouldnt have to scream then demanded what on earth are you talking about youjackanapes how can you be gone two days and come back claiming success and who are these ruffians youve brought along with you he hadnt had much hope of cowing the irrepressible rihwin but he hadnt expected him to break out in guffaws either your pardon lord prince rihwin said when he could speak though he didnt sound a bit sorry he went on allow me to present acquaintances made on the elabon way fabors faburs son and marlanz rawmeat envoys sent by the grand duke aragis the archer to discuss terms of alliance with you lord prince two of the strangers said together after they bowed one of them added in a voice almost as deep as vans im marlanz he was young broadshouldered and burly with the look of a man for whom fighting was a favorite sport fabors was older and gerin guessed likely to be smarter although sometimes men who looked like nothing but bluff warriors were a lot smarter than they seemed well gerin said that was better than standing there with his mouth open but not much he tried again but only well emerged once more on a third effort he managed coherent speech well lords i would be lying if i said i wasnt glad to see you you are most welcome come into my keep you and all your comrades drink of my ale eat of my meat you shall be my guestfriends here lord prince you are gracious fabors faburs son said marlanz rawmeat nodded vigorously fabors went on should you ride south know that my keep shall be as your own for as long as you care to use it and mine marlanz agreed come come gerin said and stood aside so the chariotsboth those that had started out with rihwin and those that had come north with aragis vassalscould cross over the drawbridge and into castle fox stable boys hurried out to take charge of the horses and chariots they gaped bigeyed at the newcomers gerins warriors crowded round him lest the men whod accompanied marlanz and fabors had treachery in mind marlanz stared at van ive heard tales of you sir he said and knowing how taletellers lie thought to measure myself against you i see im liable to have put myself too high if you can fight as well as you talk sir youll do well enough for yourself i expect van answered marlanz bowed van bowed back gerin was reminded of two big dogs sniffing at each other come lords he said again as he crossed the threshold into the great hall he called to the servants ale for my guestfriends aye and carve some steaks from that cow we slew last night too and set em over the fire just singe mine light as you can marlanz put in i cant abide beef cooked all gray and tough as shoe leather the slab of meat the servants slapped down in front of marlanz on a round of flatbread was so red and juicy that the fox expected it to bellow in pain when he stuck a knife in it but he attacked it with every sign of relish gerin had no trouble figuring out how hed come by his ekename selatre had been standing back by the stairway gerin waved her forward patted the bench beside him fabors faburs son raised an eyebrow have you at last wed again lord prince he asked word of this had not reached the archers nest good name for a keep gerin remarked unsurprised that aragis kept close track of what he didhe made it his business to learn all he could of aragis too to answer the question the archers man had put he went on lord fabors lord marlanz allow me to present you to the lady selatre who was sibyl at ikos until the earthquake overthrew bitons shrine there and loosed the monsters long trapped under it marlanz had started to bristle at being introduced to a woman rather than the other way round but composed himself at once when he learned who selatre was sibyl he murmured respectfully bowing in his seat sibyl no more she said simply selatre and who selatre is remains in large part to be discovered her eyes slid to gerin the arrival of the envoys had interrupted part of that discovery that arrival had also touched off enough commotion to bring fand down to find out what was going on her eyes narrowed when she saw selatre beside the fox she came over and sat down next to van gerin introduced her to aragis vassals as the outlanders companion van nodded at that though he didnt seem quite certain he was pleased fabors faburs son looked thoughtful but held his peacehere was more news that had not reached the archers nest after the sharing of food and drink had made them his guestfriends gerin said to fabors and marlanz well lords i know why youve comeon the same mission for which i sent rihwin south i daresay youll have discussed it with him as you came here what conclusions have you reached lord prince our overlord the grand duke aragis sent us north with virtually the same terms for an alliance in mind as you gave to rihwin the foxa fine fellow i might add fabors said the archer favors an equal alliance between himself and you for as long as that remains agreeable to both parties overall command to depend on whether the fighting is north or south of ikos theres a nice touch gerin said approvingly id simply assumed wed share the lead well lords as you say i think well get along nicely since the earthquake ive heard little from south of ikos tell me how aragis lands fare if you would be so kind marlanz gulped down the ale in his jack before answering imagine wolves in a hard winter coming out of the woods to kill sheep and shepherds too then imagine that ten times worse and youll have some idea of the state were in these cursed creatures have more wit than wolves and they have hands too so nothing is safe from them the serfs are afraid to go out into the fields but staying huddled in their huts does em no good either im sure you know how that goes lord prince only too well gerin answered grimly his vassals in the great hall nodded the fox went on have the more clever monsters joined together with any of aragis neighbors to make his life even more delightful no lord prince marlanz and fabors chorused fabors added when your vassal the lord rihwin told us of their dealings with adiatunnusmay he roast in the hottest hell foreverwe both cried out in horror that we did marlanz rawmeat agreed it speaks well of your strength here that youve held off such a dreadful combination where we faced only the monsters yet aragis saw the need to send us forth before you put your vassal on the road to look for his aid dont put too much into it gerin said it may just mean im more stubborn and less trusting of my neighbors than the grand duke meaning no offense to you lord prince i find that hard to picture fabors faburs son said marlanz nodded vigorously i think you may have insulted your own lord rather than me but have it as you will gerin said since matters are as they are i am going to propose that aragis first send such chariotry as he can north to aid my forces against adiatunnus the monsters and a few worthless faithless elabonians who have joined with them if he can do that how soon can he do it and how many chariots can he spare from his own concerns lord prince i think he can do it and i think he can send the cars not long after we return with word the deal has been struck fabors answered how many he can send he shall have to judge for himself hes spread his chariots and crews widely through the keeps of the lands he holds and told his peasants to send up fire signals if their villages are attacked thus aid can reach them as soon as may be thats not the worst ploy in the world for keeping the serfs safe rihwin said why didnt you try something like it my fellow fox its like covering your belly after somebody hits you then moving one hand to your face when he hits you there gerin answered or if youll let me change my figure of speech id rather dig an arrowhead out of the wound than slap a bandage on it with the point still in there youre a man of sense lord prince marlanz rawmeat said the grand duke himself has been thinking hard about changing the way hes fighting the cursed creaturessays its like being nibbled to death by fleas between his men and yours we ought to have a force strong enough to really do something not just try to hit back when things get done to us thats my hope gerin agreed thats why i sought alliance with him as marlanz had said even though aragis was threatened only by monsters hed felt the need for help before gerin who also had the trokmoi to worry about hitting back as hard as he could had let the fox keep his foes off balance together well smash them marlanz said slamming his fist down onto the table so that drinking jacks jumped fabors faburs son nodded but did not speak when it came to negotiating terms for the alliance he seemed to have authority marlanz spoke with more weight on matters strictly military are we in accord lords gerin asked both of aragis envoys nodded the fox said then shall we take oaths to bind us to our enterprise i will take them with you as aragis representatives i know he will expect them of me as he and i have not always been on the best of terms since elabon pulled out of the northlands and you will expect them no less of him youre saying fabors remarked he expected as much and authorized us to swear on his behalf binding him to the pact in the eyes of the gods and you are correct he does desire your oath as well cooperation first trust can come later gerin said and whether he authorized it or not the laws of similarity and contagion bind you to him and him to the pact i am mage enough to work through them at need i hope we shall have no need by which gods would aragis have us swear none out of the ordinary lord prince fabors answered dyaus the king of heaven of course and biton for foresightthat his sibyl is here will only lend the oath more forceand because were fighting not least to keep our serfs safe baivers and mavrix as well a prickle of alarm ran through the fox would not baivers suffice on his own mavrix and i have not got on well in the past so lord rihwin told us fabors said by the way his eyes slid toward rihwin the tale had been juicy too but he took a deep breath and resumed nonetheless my suzerain was particular about wanting the lord of the sweet grape included in the oath baivers said he has power only over ale and barley while mavrix along with being the god of wine is also associated with fertility in general and hence a protector of farmers that unfortunately made too much theological sense for gerin to come up with a glib way around it he remembered that he and selatre had been reading about mavrix when they acknowledged their attraction for each other lust was also part of the sithonian gods domain maybe that had been an omen gerin might not want anything to do with mavrix but if the converse didnt hold true how was he supposed to oppose the gods will he sighedhe saw no way let it be as the grand duke wishes he said i have but one reservation if he fails to send at least thirty chariots and crews and if they fail to reach here within thirty days i shall no longer reckon myself bound by the terms of the oath fabors and marlanz put their heads together and talked quietly with each other for a couple of minutes at last fabors nodded it shall be as you say gerin and aragis envoys clasped hands and swore the oath binding themselves and through marlanz and fabors aragis to the terms upon which theyd agreed then the fox called to the kitchen crew slaughter us another cow well burn the fatwrapped thighbones on dyaus altar that their savor may climb to heaven and make him look kindly on our cause and well eat the rest ourselves van boomed remember ill want my portion barely cooked marlanz added hastily gerin walked upstairs to his bedchamber carrying a lamp he set each foot down in turn with deliberate care he was a little drunk and very full he opened the door set the lamp on a chest of drawers and started to take off his tunic as soon as hed undressed he would blow out the lamp someone knocked on the door he almost got trapped in the tunics sleeves as he pulled it back down fabors faburs son had been spinning a long involved explanation of why aragis insisted on having mavrix in the oathso long and involved in fact that gerin wondered if the real reason was that the archer knew of his trouble with the godand hadnt wanted to stop even when the fox yawned his way out of the great hall if fabors was out there now wanting to natter away some more gerin aimed to teach him never to do anything so foolish again he threw the door wide but the load hed planned to dump on fabors head turned into a coughing fit for fabors wasnt standing out there selatre was listening to him splutter she asked are you all right in tones of real concern when he managed a nod she said well then shall we go on from where we were uh interrupted this afternoon are you sure he asked she nodded in turn he went on i didn t come to your chamber tonight because he came to a ragged stop not sure how to go on for fear id lost my nerve you mean selatre said thats just it gerin said gratefully i wondered why you stayed away selatre said the only two things i could think of were that on the one hand and that you didnt really want me on the other i thought id better find out which it was if you dont know the answer to that gerin ran dry again after a moment he resumed if you dont know the answer to that ill just have to show you he took a step to one side to let selatre come into the bedchamber he shut the door behind her barred it then glanced over to the flickering lamp on the chest of drawers shall i blow that out however youd rather she answered after her usual grave consideration it certainly would have been light had we come here earlier in the day though so it would he agreed well then feeling foolish at echoing what shed said a few moments before he stepped forward took her in his arms and kissed her as hed discovered in the library her knowledge of that portion of the game was enjoyably more than theoretical when their lips parted at last she murmured did you learn that in the book you were telling me of if you did id like to read it erno he answered and as i said i dont have a copy here in fox keep thats too bad selatre said quite seriously you really should write down what you remember of itand what youve learned other places as well she brought her mouth toward his again after some long pleasurable time he led her over to the bed he was sure she couldnt be altogether ignorant of what went on between men and womenafter all shed grown up in a peasant hut which if it was like all the other peasant huts hed known would have boasted one room and in that room one bed for the whole family but knowing how things happened and having them happen to her might be two different matters especially when not long before she hadnt been able to stand a man touching her at all let alone in her most secret places she hesitated with her hands at the neck of her tunic do you want me to blow out the lamp after all he asked selatre shook her head perhaps as much at herself as toward gerin almost defiantly she pulled the tunic up over her head then kicked off her sandals and got out of her long wool skirt and the linen drawers she wore beneath it gerin had known she was well made but hadnt realized how well if he stared too much he might fluster her the only way to keep from staring was to undress himself he did that quickly and lay down on the bed selatre hesitated again before joining him there the soft straw of the mattress rustled as her weight came down on it forgive me she said i amnervous no reason you shouldnt be and every reason you should he said first times come only once she nodded what did your book say were supposed to do next not any one thing in particular he answered if i remember aright it says im supposed to kiss you and caress you for a long time to make you easy in your mind and to help make your body ready for what well do after that he smiled at her id want to do that anyhow he embraced her drew her to him she started to pull back when their bare bodies metthat was touching of a different sort from what shed known before but she checked herself managed a smile in return when he kissed her she kissed him back that tickles she said as his tongue slid down the smooth soft skin of her neck then it found the tip of her right breast ah she murmured a syllable all breath and no voice after some time he let his mouth stray lower the sound she made was half surprise half pleasure hed forgotten about the book he enjoyed what he was doing for its own sake oh my she said a little while later id expected one surprise but two is that something you brought back with you from south of the high kirs as a matter of fact no he answered but then who could guess what would be done in a peasant village outside of ikos well wherever you learned it its she didnt go on in words but the pause and the delighted expression on her face said enough after a moment she added could i do the same for you you could but probably not for very long right now gerin said lets try something else instead he sat up on the bed here why dont you get onto my lap she straddled him which he hadnt expected quite yet she did know the theory of what they were going to do he took himself in hand she lowered herself onto him slowly and cautiously it doesnt hurt she said and then a heartbeat later wait there yes gerin said do you want to stop no rush here she shook her head all right then he said and took hold of her buttocks easing her down until he was fleshed to the rootthat was what the racily illustrated scroll in the city of elabon had recommended and it seemed to work well is it all right he asked it didnt hurt as much as i thought it would she said nodding you were gentle thank you he kissed her and ran his hands over her body when he was sure shed meant what she said he began to move inside her slowly a little at a time not hurrying at all his left hand slid down between her legs to add to her pleasureor perhaps to create it as few women were likely to find full joy from coupling itself their first time his own pleasure built slowly he let that happen rather than straining to quicken it when at last it reached its peak it was all the more intense because of the long unhurried climb to get there he closed his eyes and squeezed selatre hard against him there was a little blood when she slid off him but not much he wondered what shed thought not looking at him she said more than half to herself im so sorry for all the sibyls who died without ever knowing this he set a hand on her bare shoulder instead of pulling away she snuggled against him he said i made two alliances today this is the better one oh yes she said oh yes ix aragis envoys rode out at dawn two days later gerin cordially loathed getting up with the sun but made a point of seeing them off he glanced up into the sky and pointed to golden math which three days past full was sliding toward the western horizon lords she makes her turn in nineandtwenty days he said to marlanz and fabors by the next time she reaches that phase i hope to have the grand dukes chariots fighting alongside mine we shall do everything in our power to make it so fabors fabur s son said aye that should give us time for travel and for gathering the men and cars marlanz rawmeat added i hope the archer orders me north again fighting the monsters and the trokmoi at the same time would be worth the candle i think gerin had seen a good many men trokmoi and elabonians both to say nothing of van who loved war for its own sake he recognized that but it baffled him every time he ran into it he said id sooner not be fighting at all but sometimes you have no choice marlanz sent him a curious look your hands not cold in war lord prince you may not care for it but you do it well he probably had as much trouble understanding the fox as gerin did with himmaybe more if he didnt make a practice of trying to see into the minds of people different from him explaining seemed an unprofitable use of time to gerin who contented himself with answering if you dont do what needs doing before long you wont have the chance to do anything at all marlanz weighed thatas gerin had guessed on first meeting him he was smarter than he lookedand finally nodded the drawbridge thumped down aragis ambassadors and the warriors who had come north to protect them rolled across it and off toward the elabon way the gate crew hauled the bridge back up visitors to fox keep were few in these days of disordered commerce and who could say what lurked in the not too distant woods for legitimate travelers the bridge would come down again meanwhile castle fox was fortress first van came out of the keep rubbing sleep from his eyes so theyre on their way south are they he said through a yawn we can use all the help we can find and thats a fact i know gerin answered i didnt like the way adiatunnus mocked me at the fight in that clearing well see how he laughs when he finds aragis chariots ranged beside mine aye thatll be a good thing no doubt about it van yawned again i want some bread and ale maybe theyll make my wits start working the urfa nomads in the deserts south of elabon brew some sort of bitter drink thats supposed to keep a man awake if hes tired and wake him up if hes all fuzzy the way you are gerin said he sighed time was when urfa came up to ikos to talk with the sibyl we might have bought some of the berries from them now the oracle at ikos is no more and even if it were still there the urfa couldnt come up through elabon to get to it the oracle at ikos is no more van repeated as he and the fox walked back toward the great hall he glanced over to gerin the lady selatres still very much here though so she is gerin said he and selatre hadnt tried to keep their becoming lovers a secretnot that they could have even if they did try castle fox had too many pairs of eyes too many wagging tongues for that if he could gerin would have looked down his nose at van the outlander being considerably taller he looked up it instead so what so nothing captain van said hastily may you and she have joy of it he paused then went on in a lowvoiced mumble and may the gods grant that i keep up with fand and dont decide to throttle her there is that gerin observed fand hadnt said anything to him one thing that had been plain to both of them was that whatever theyd had was dead but when she looked from him to selatre i told you so gleamed in her green eyes she had told him so too which only made the look on her face more irksome on the other hand fand enjoyed getting people angry at her so he refused to give her the satisfaction of showing his annoyance van cut a chunk from the loaf of bread on one of the tables the morning was cool gerin decided hed rather dip up a bowl of barley porridge from the pot that sat above the fire on the hearth at the far end of the hall he took a horn spoon then set that and the bowl on the table while he got himself a jack of ale hed just poured a little libation to baivers when selatre came downstairs here join us he said marlanz and fabors have headed south to take aragis word of the agreement i thought it must be so when you made yourself wake so early she answered cutting herself a piece of bread as van had done im sorry he said i didnt mean to wake you he felt guilty he hadnt slept the night through with a woman in his own bed for a long time and probably hadnt been as quiet as he might have been for that matter he hadnt slept with anyone in his own bed since duren disappeared and that was more than sixty days ago now he realized with a small shock reckoning up everything that had happened since its all right she said the sun was up so i would have been awake soon anyhow thats how it always was in my village and thats how it was at ikos too she somehow managed not to make gerin feel bad for preferring to sleep later when he could after shed poured ale for herself she sat down right beside him fand came into the great hall a little later when she saw gerin and selatre together she didnt bother with breakfast she just walked over to van and plopped herself down in his lap hed been reaching for his ale instead his arms went around her what do you think youre doing he spluttered her arms went around his neck what do you think im doing now she purred into his ear van could resist anything except temptation he did try so early in the morning he said incredulously fand leaned closer still whispered something gerin couldnt quite catch into the outlanders ear whatever it was it seemed to have the desired effect van snorted like a stallion and then still holding fand stood up and carried her upstairs gerin and selatre stared after them a moment later a doorpresumably the one to fands chamberslammed shut when gerin and selatre looked from the stairway to each other they both started to laugh oh my gerin said she has a hook in him like a man fishing for salmon did she always act like that selatre asked in a small voice she sounded half bemused half awed the fox shook his head when she was with us both she didntusuallytry to use one of us to make the other jealous he chuckled drop me into one of the hells if shes not trying to make me jealous now that were apart he took selatres hand shell have no luck there im glad selatre squeezed him not long ago he thought shed have been mortally offended if i touched her at all then he realized with the front of his mind that that change had of course started some days after duren disappeared somehow he felt hed known selatre longer rihwin the fox came into the great hall for breakfast he nodded to gerin and selatre as he ambled over to the pot of porridge though hed formally courted elise hed never made any permanent attachments since returning to the northlands with gerin and van contenting himself with tumbling the occasional servant woman or peasant girl catching gerins eye rihwin tugged at his left ear and brayed like a donkey hed done that a couple of times before and succeeded in embarrassing gerin this time gerin was ready for him he said you do that very well you must have had a good deal of ass in you even before i worked that magic to restore your ear rihwin staggered as if pierced by an arrow that made some of the hot porridge slop out of his bowl and onto the hand that was holding it now wounded literally as well as metaphorically he sprang into the air with a yelp see what you made me do he shouted at gerin im sorry but i cant take the blame for that one gerin said you were a showoff long before you met me and youve got yourself in trouble for it a good many times before too as was his way rihwin calmed as quickly as hed heated id be more inclined to resent that if it werent true he got himself a jack of ale then bowed to gerin and said may i sit by you and your lady your supreme awesomeness sit sit gerin said valiantly resisting the urge to throw something at him in a way rihwin was like fand he could be infuriating but he was never dull fortunately though he lacked fands flammable temper he threw himself bonelessly down onto the bench next to gerin for all his seeming insouciance he had a keen sense of what made others comfortable selatre still didnt care to be touched even by accident by anyone save gerin he took a swig from his jack of ale then leaned forward so he could look past gerin to selatre as you are sibyl no more lady let me prophesy for you now many years of happiness i suppose that also means happiness for this lout herehe nodded at gerinbut well just have to put up with what we cant help one fine day i will throttle you gerin muttered rihwin dipped his head as at some extravagant compliment gerin threw his hands in the air selatre said i thank you for the wish and may a god prove to have spoken through you i dont think foolishness has a god unless it be mavrix in his aspect as king of the drunkards gerin said hed meant that for a joke but it brought him up short once hed said it all he wanted was to ignore mavrix and hope the god would do the same with him but suddenly that didnt seem easy he got up and poured himself another jack of ale he wasnt thirsty any more nor did he want to get drunk to start the day maybe though by showing his loyalty to baivers he could persuade mavrix to leave him alone but even as he quaffed the apotropaic ale he had his doubts neither the trokmoi nor the monsters were so considerate as to wait for aragis men to arrive and help drive them away gerins raid into adiatunnus holding did make the woodsrunner thoughtful but didnt stop him and as for the creatures who could say whether the ones that attacked gerins villagers were aligned with adiatunnus or not either way the work they did was dreadful herders began to disappear along with their flocks the monsters slew more livestock than they could eat wolves or longtooths seldom behaved so but men often did as the reports came in to castle fox gerin grew ever grimmer he did what he could to help his serfs cope with the new menace skulking through the woods he ordered herdsmen to go forth in pairs and always to be armed either with bows or with hunting spears he gave permission for all his smiths to make spearheads and arrowheads in large numbers with more and more serfs at least somewhat armed theyd have a better chance of holding off the monsters when no chariotriding nobles could come to their aid some of his more conservative vassals grumbled at that drago the bear said whos going to take all those spears away when the monsters are gone lord gerin theyll use em on each other aye and on us nobles too if we dont watch em carefuland we cant watch em careful all the time having been through a similar argument not long before with van the fox only nodded tiredly youre right he said which made dragos eyes widen then he went on but if we go under because we didnt arm the serfs we wont have to worry about what we do later now will we drago chewed on that for a whileliterally for gerin watched his jaws work beneath his unkempt mat of graying brown beardthen walked off without making any direct reply under his breath though he was muttering phrases like newfangled foolishness and idiotic shenanigans the fox refused to let that worry him stones changed more readily than drago but the bear did as he was ordered getting spears and arrows into the hands of the serfs wasnt enough and gerin knew it they might kill an occasional monster and would be cheered no end by so doing but they werent fighting men if gerin wanted any crops brought in come fall he and the rest of the nobles would have to ride forth and do what they could to hold the monsters away from the villages leaving selatre was a wrench that in itself surprised him getting away from fand had often seemed a relief he took his sorrow on departing as a good sign with luck it meant he and selatre had more to join them together than the pleasures of the bedchamber fine as those were in the end they werent enough you needed other bricks as well if you wanted to build something that would last when hed brought elise up to fox keep hed thought theyd made something that would last forever one thing he hadnt yet known was that you needed to keep what youd built in good repair if you didn t it would fall down on your head hed have to bear that in mind this time such thoughts vanished from his head as the road jogged and castle fox vanished behind a stand of trees the monsters have been especially bad in the southwest he said grabbing for the rail as the chariot hit a pothole thats no surprise raffo said over his shoulder they swarm into adiatunnus lands and then out against us no doubt youre right the fox answered wherefores dont much matter though whatever the whys of it we have to hurt the creatures badly enough to be sure the serfs can bring in the harvest falls not that far away he waved to the fields past which they were riding the grain there was starting to go from green to gold van dug a finger in his ear am i hearing you right fox you of all people saying wherefores dont matter either youve come down with a fever orwait i have it it must be love gerin set a hand on the shaft of the war axe on his side of the chariot car id brain you did i think you had any brains in there to let out aye well to the crows with you too van said both men laughed as the chariots clattered by peasants in the villages and out in the fields waved and cheered theyd never been especially hostile to the nobles who ruled them gerin was a mild and just overlord but theyd rarely seemed so glad to see armored men in chariots either worthwhile reminding them we do more than take their crops and futter their women gerin thought toward afternoon one of the serfs did more than wave and cheer he ran up to gerins chariot the lead in a sixcar force shouting help us lord three of the creatures slaughtered our sheep then ran back into the woods he pointed to show the direction theyd taken adding remon hit one with an arrow i think but it kept running maybe well have a blood trail to follow fox van said give us a better chance to hunt down the cursed things the peasants eyes went wide youre lord gerin he said and bowed when the fox nodded that sort of thing had happened to gerin before not all serfs knew what he looked like for years could pass between his visits to any one village aye im gerin he answered and alighted from the chariot van stepped down after him they waved the rest of the cars to a stop gerin pointed in the same direction the peasant had three monsters just went in there the villagers managed to wound one so we may have blood to follow fox what do you say the drivers stay with the cars van put in if therere three of the things around there may be more and that ll let folk properly armed fight for the serfs if monsters pop out of the woods aye let it be as you say gerin answered which drew howls of anger from raffo and the other drivers he glared them into submission wondering as he did so at the urge that made men eager to risk their lives fighting and irate when they lost that chance even with an honorable excuse van pulled his mace from his belt and trotted into the woods saying come on you lugs the more time we waste here the farther the cursed creatures can run along with the rest of the fighting crews gerin pounded after the outlander sweat quickly burst out on his forehead running in armor was hard workdoubly so for van whose fancy cuirass was a good deal heavier than the one the fox wore but the outlander moved as easily as if hed been in a thin linen shirt here hold up gerin called at the edge of the woods he was panting a little but hadnt ordered the halt on account of that lets see if we can find spilled blood thatll give us the way the monsters took less than a minute later widin simrins son exclaimed over here lord gerin the fox and the rest of the warriors hurried to him sure enough blood splashed the grass where he stood more painted the dark green leaves of a holly bush gerin and his men plunged into the woods along with the blood the monster was losing they also had footprints in the soft earth to follow they crashed through the brush shouting at the top of their lungs hoping to frighten the monster and its fellows into breaking whatever cover theyd found there drago shouted he used his sword to point gerin caught a glimpse of a hairy body between a couple of saplings parol chickpea fast with his bow loosed an arrow at the monster it bellowed whether in pain or simply in rage the fox could not tell along with his companions he dashed toward the place where it had disappeared the men spread out widely not wanting to give it any chance to get away it sprang out from behind the pale trunk of a birch tree almost in vans face the outlander shouted in surprise but kept the presence of mind to get his shield up and protect his bare face and arms from the monsters claws and teeth he smote the creature with his mace blood spurted as the viciously spiked head struck home the monster snarled and wailed but did not run gerin sprinted to come to the aid of his friend the monster wailed without snarling when his sword slash drew a red line across its rib cage half turning to meet him it left itself open to van who hit it in the side of its head with all his massive strength the creature crumpled a stupid one van said panting the ones with the wit to wield weapons are truly dangerous even the ones without are bad enough gerin looked down at the twitching corpse i dont see an arrow in this one either so the one the peasant hit must still be around here somewhere i hadnt thought on that but youre right the outlander said lets get on with the searching then he slammed the head of his mace into the ground a couple of times to clean the monsters blood from the bronze spikes then pushed on through the woods not far ahead two cries rang out one from the throat of a monster the other a deeper coughing roar that froze the fox in his tracks for a moment as it was meant to do longtooth his lips shaped the word but no sound passed them the monsters scream rose to a highpitched squall then died away the longtooth roared again this time in triumph gerin rounded up his companions by eye ever so cautiously they approached the place from which the roars had sounded twelve men were enough to drive off a longtooth at need though doing so was always a risky business gerin pushed aside the smallleaved branch of a willow sapling to peer out into a small clearing at the far edge of the open space the longtooth crouched over the monsters body thats the one the peasant shot van breathed into gerins ear the fox nodded part of an arrow shaft still protruded from the creatures left buttock he wondered whether it had deliberately broken off the rest or the shaft had snapped as it ran through the woods the question was irrelevant now the longtooth had seen to that the great twin fangs that gave it its name were red with the monsters blood it had torn open the creatures throat longtooths fortunately were solitary huntershad they traveled in packs they would have been an even worse plague than the monsters this one a big male was almost the size of a bear with massive shoulders and great taloned forepaws almost as formidable as its fangs it growled warningly at gerin and the other warriors the long orangebrown hair on its neck and shouldersnot quite a lions mane but closebristled up to make it look even larger and more threatening its little stumpy tail the only absurd part of a thoroughly formidable creature twitched to show its anger at being interrupted over a meal lets kill it parol chickpea whispered hoarsely up till then gerin had thought parols sobriquet came from the large round wen by his nose the comment though made him wonder if a chickpea was what parol used to do his thinking he said no its done us a favor well just go on our way and see if we can find the last monster parol grumbled at that but went along when everyone else moved away from the clearing gerin was sure the longtooth would be contentedly feeding for some time all the same he didnt go very far from his followers nor they from one another the price of being wrong about what the great hunting cat was doing was too high to pay perhaps because the warriors stayed tightly bunched together they didnt flush out the last monster after another hours search gerin said i fear its got away the gods willing though it wont be back in these parts anytime soonand if it is it may run across that longtooth that would be good drago rumbled so it would gerin said a longtooth is more than a match for one of those things or two or even four but if a pack of them set out to drive a longtooth from its prey i think they could do it best thing to happen there is that they kill each other off drago said gerin nodded at that somehow though things seldom worked themselves out so conveniently at least not where he was concerned the warriors made their way back toward the peasant village when they came out of the woods not only the serfs but also their drivers raised a cheer the cheer got louder after gerin yelled two of the creatures dead and did not subside when he admitted the third had escaped he gave remon a silver buckle for wounding one of the monsters the serf a young wellmade man puffed out his chest stood very straight and did his best to act like one of the warriors whod accompanied the fox gerin thought that at best unconvincing but it seemed good enough to impress the young women of the village to remon their opinion doubtless mattered more than his suns going down van observed gerin glanced westward the outlander was right gerin suspected his friend had an ulterior motive for the remarkseveral of the young women had also noticed himbut decided not to make an issue of it all right well pass the night here he said the villagers brought out their best ale for the nobles in their midst and roasted a couple of sheep the monsters had killed the rest gerin was sure would be smoked or sundried or made into sausages nothing went to waste hed seen oaks in the woods nearby no doubt the hides however torn would be tanned and used for winter coats or capes remon disappeared from the celebration with one of the pretty girls whod exclaimed at his prowess with a bow there was prowess and then there was prowess gerin thought several of his comrades also found themselves companions for the evening as van headed off toward one of the huts with a young woman he turned back to gerin and said you sleeping alone tonight fox yes i think so gerin answered another cup of ale and then i ll roll up in my blanket all very well to be a onewoman man around the keep captain the outlander said but youre not around the keep now i dont tell you how to live your life and ill thank you for granting me the same privilege gerin said pointedly oh i do captain i do but if i think youre a silly loon you may be sure ill tell you so van turned back to the girl come along my sweet i know what to do with my time by the gods she went not only willingly but eagerly the fox shook his head van had a gift that was certain van also reveled in variety gerin snorted if i need a different woman so soon after i found one then i didnt find the right one he muttered to himself whats that lord gerin drago stared owlishly hed put his nose into the ale pot a great many times hed sleep like a log tonight and likely bawl like a hurt ox tomorrow with a head pounding fit to burst gerin was just as well pleased the bear hadnt caught what hed said he did his best to keep his private life private in the tight little world of fox keep that best often wasnt good enough but he kept making the effort and selatre unlike fand did not strike him as one to relish trumpeting her affairsin any sense of the wordto the world at large he glanced up into the sky only elleb shone there a day before full swift tiwaz had just slipped past new while nothos was approaching it and golden math almost at her third quarter would rise a little before midnight math was the moon that mattered now if she returned to the waning gibbous shape shed had when fabors and marlanz set out for aragis lands before the archers chariots came northif she did that then all of gerins carefully laid plans would go awry in that case ill have to try something else he said again to dragos puzzlementand to his own for he had no idea what that something might be the sweep through the southern part of his holding netted the fox several slain monsters more to the point it showed the serfsand the monsters if they paid attention to such thingsthat he and his vassals would defend the villages in every way they could parol chickpea was the only real casualty of the sweep one of the monsters bit a goodsized chunk out of his right buttock gerin heated a bronze hoe blade over a fire back at the peasant village from which theyd set out and used it to cauterize the wound parol bawled louder at that than he had when he was bitten but the wound healed well then he had to endure being called parol onecheek all the way back to castle fox two days after hed returned to the keep gerin was up on the palisade when a chariot came streaking up from the south he started worrying the instant he spied it no one bringing good news would be in such a hurry in any case it was too early to expect aragis men he hurried down from the palisade while the gate crew was letting down the drawbridge whats toward utreiz he asked when the chariot came into the courtyard utreiz embrons son was one of the leaders of the force holding the elabon way open through bevons holding a slim dark fellow a better than decent swordsman and a long way from foolisha rather lesser version of gerin as a matter of fact he scowled as he got down from the car saying its not good news lord prince i didnt think it would be gerin answered tell it to me anyhow aye lord utreiz spat in the dirt bevon and two of his stinking sonsbevonis and bevioncame out in force against us with monsters coursing alongside their chariots for the time being the roads cut oh a plague gerin cried the outburst spent his wits began to work bevanders with us though thatll help have our men gone south to pull ricolf the red into the fight having the elabon way blocked hurts him no less than us lord my guess is they have but it would be only a guess utreiz answered i came north thinking this something you had to know as soon as might be you did right gerin said so bevion and bevonis are the two who went with bevon to suck up to adiatunnus and the monsters eh and bevander is on our side as i said what about bevons fourth son you mean phredd the fat utreiz spat again the gods only know what hes doinghe hasnt the slightest clue himself he could be trying to train longtooths to draw chariots for all i know hes not in the fight that much i can tell you too bad gerin said i was hoping hed come in on bevons side hed hurt him worse by that than by joining us believe me the gods know youre right about that lord but so far hes sitting out utreiz said can you send us men to help force the road open again a few maybe gerin said unhappily im stretched too thin as it is i wish some of the lordlets on the land that used to be palin the eagles would do their share no merchants will ever get to their keeps if the highway stays closed ive sent men to several of them utreiz answered stout man gerin thumped him on the back there arent enough people who see what needs doing and then go ahead and do it without making a fuss and without asking anyones leave utreiz shuffled his feet like a schoolboy whod forgotten his lessons and looked anywhere but at the fox praise plainly made him uncomfortableanother way in which he resembled his overlord id best head back now he said and climbed into the chariot that had brought him north you send those men as soon as may be lord we could use em he spoke to the driver who got the horses going and rattled away he hadnt even stopped for a jack of ale send those men as soon as may be gerin echoed wondering where he was supposed to find men to send if he could have conjured warriors out of the air he would have used them against adiatunnus but he realized he would have to reduce the sweeps against the monsters for the time being no matter how little he relished the prospect he would lose a disastrous amount of prestige if aragis had to force the road open glumly he tramped into the great hall selatre was in there eating some sundried plums she smiled a greeting and waved him over to her side here open she said and popped a prune into his mouth it was sweet but not sweet enough by itself to sweeten his mood he said thank you even so selatre appreciated formal politeness he studied hershe looked a trifle on the haggard side but wryly amused at the same time the combination tweaked his curiosity youve got something to tell me he said i can see it in your eyes he wondered if he was about to become a father again yes i do she said and her tone made him all but sure of it then she went on just another proof im sibyl no more my courses started this morning i needed a moment i confess to figure out what was happening to me her mouth twisted one part of full womanhood id willingly have missed mm yes i can understand that he said judiciously he knew a certain measure of relief that he didnt have to worry about fatherhood at such an inconvenient time and a different measure of relief that selatre still seemed in a reasonably good humor at such times fand could often make a longtooth flinch but then fands temper was certain to be uncertain i didnt know this would happen when i came into your bed but it makes sense that it has selatre said bitons law was that no woman who had known man could be his sibyl now that were lovershe admired the matteroffact way she brought that outno wonder ive lost what marked me as a possible sibyl in the first place gerin nodded that does make sense and its reasoned as nicely as any schoolmaster down in the city of elabon might have donenot that theyre in the habit of reasoning about such things selatre stuck out her tongue at him what about the fellow who had that endlessly entertaining book he wasnt a schoolmaster gerin said with a snort just an endlessly lecherous student now that i think back on it a lot of us were like that he waited for selatre to make some sort of sharp reply to that but she didnt for once her ignorance of men in general worked to his advantage the lookout in the watchtower let go with a long discordant blast from his horn chariots approaching out of the west a pair of em he bawled out of the west gerin said i wonder who that is he got to his feet better go find out he headed out toward the courtyard selatre followed its schild stoutstaff lord parol chickpea called from atop the palisade shall we let him in schild is it the fox said had he had ears like a real foxs they would have pricked forward with interest aye by all means let him come in ill be fascinated to see what he wants of me whys that lord prince parol asked with a hoarse guffaw on account of he only remembers hes your vassal when he wants something off you that does have something to do with it yes gerin answered dryly the drawbridge lowered once morea busy day the fox thought a couple of minutes later schild and his companions rolled into the courtyard lord prince schild called nodding to gerin he was a big burly fellow on the swarthy side a few years older than the fox and had the air of one who trusted his own judgment and strength above any others that alone made him less than the best of vassals but gerin understood it for it was part of his own character as well what brings you here he asked schild jumped down from his chariot surprisingly graceful for such a bulky man he strode over to gerin and fell to his knees in front of him holding out his hands before him with their palms pressed together your servant lord prince he said his eyes on the ground gerin took schilds hands in his acknowledging the other mans vassalage and his own obligations as overlord rise lord schild he said formally as soon as schild was back on his feet the fox went on in more conversational tones you must need something from me or youd not choose to remember im your master youre right lord gerin i do schild didnt even bother correcting the fox those horrible things they say came up from under the ground are a hideous plague in my holding my own vassals and i cant keep the serfs safe try as we will i have prideyou know that ive buried it to beg aid of you so now youd be glad to see chariots cross from my holding to yours eh gerin waited for schild to nod then drove home the dart you wouldnt even let my men onto your land to seek my stolen son earlier this yearbut you didnt need me then of course thats true i made a mistake and i may end up paying for it too schild answered steadily he won gerins reluctant admiration for that whether you liked him or not you had to admit he held very little nonsense now he let loose a rueful laugh i have more to tell you about that than i did then too do you gerins voice went silky with danger as if of itself his hand slipped to the hilt of his sword schild was no mean fighting man but he gave back a step from the expression on the foxs face you had best tell it and quickly aye lord prince you have to understand i didnt know it at the time when your man came asking schild licked his lips that minstreltassilo was his name not sohe came through my holding you know that much already i daresay he didnt stop at my keep though he guested with a couple of my vassals before he passed out the other side of my lands lord gerin i learned not long ago he had a boy with him if id known that then what would you have done lord schild gerin asked his quiet fiercer than a scream what would you have done sent duren back to me or would you have kept him for a while to see what advantage you might wring from him damn me to the five hells if i know fox schild answered formal politeness forgotten but i didnt have the chance to find out which is likely just as well now i know and now im here and now ive told you if i ever find out you lied to me about this gerin let that drop he had a score to settle with schild even if schild hadnt liedbut not now other things had to come first not here schild said i know what my life would be worth if i tried he spoke with as much assurance as if hed looked at rapidly approaching clouds and announced it looks like rain gerin had always done his best to give his neighbors the idea hed be a dangerous man to cross seeing hed succeeded should have been more gratifying than it was he said duren came into your holding then and was alive and well when he went out again so far as i know fox thats the way of it schild answered selatre came up to gerin set a hand on his arm the prophecy biton spoke through me said your sons fate would be mild im glad we begin to see the truth of that now schilds eyes widened when he realized who selatre had to be and then again when he realized what her touching gerin was likely to mean the fox noted that without doing anything about it his thought swooped down on selatres words like a stooping hawk biton said durens fate might well be mild he answered with a sort of pained precision he wished he could abandon not that it would be we still have to see she looked at him as if schildas if everyone but the two of themhad receded to some remote distance she asked quietly youre afraid to hope sometimes arent you yes he answered as if speaking to her ears alone expect much and youre too often disappointed expect little and what you get often looks good selatre made an exasperated noise before she could carry the argument further though schild broke in well fox what can i expect from you that hauled gerin back to the world of chariots and monsters and redmustached barbarians not the world in which he would have chosen to spend his time but the one in which the gods had seen fit to place him he started calculating and did not care for the answers he came up with hed been stretched too thin before hed had to commit men to reopening the elabon way he was thinner now fixing schild with a glare he growled why couldnt you have forgotten you were my vassal a while longer because i need your aid lord prince schild answered more humbly than the fox had ever heard him speak he suspected a great deal of that humility was donned for the occasion but that didnt mean he could ignore it very well lord schild i shall defend you with such forces as i can spare he said i shall not do so though until you furnish me this years feudal dues in metal and grain and ale for your holding you havent paid those dues lately i hope you remember what they are by the sour look schild gave him he remembered only too well i knew you were a cheeseparer fox he ground out so i started the wagons rolling as soon as i left my keep they should be here in a day or two with the years dues to try to make up for its being my first tribute in a while i even put in a couple of flagons of wine i found in my cellars dont tell rihwin that gerin exclaimed the way youre using me now i hope theyve gone to vinegar schild said scowling still if you want aid from your overlord youd best give him service with more than your lips gerin answered unperturbed at schilds anger he went on speaking of which though you swore me fealty after i slew wolfar of the axe youve given me precious little ive demanded precious little till now either schild retorted that may be so but the aid i send you is liable to cost me more than this years dues alone gerin said my other vassalsmy true vassalspay what they owe whether they call on me for aid or not for they dont know when theyll need me collecting all im due now would break you so i shant try but what i take from you each year will go up hereafterand if you dont render it youll see my chariots in ways you wont like so well as riding to your rescue schilds expression was bright with hatred i wish wolfar had wrung your neck instead of the other way round gerins blade hissed free youre welcome to try to amend the result if you like for a moment he thought schild would draw too this once the clean simplicity of combat looked good to him if he slew schild the others land would pass to him and if he didnt he wouldnt have to worry about alliances and feudal dues any more but schild took a step back gerin did not think it was from fear few barons shrank from a fight on account of thatand the ones who did commonly had enough sense that they didnt go provoking their neighbors the foxs reluctant vassal said even if i slay you and get out of this keep alive i cant fill your shoes fighting the creatures worse luck gerin clapped a hand to his forehead in genuine amazement he sheathed his sword an argument from policy by the gods for that i ll gouge you less than i would have otherwisehaving a neighbor who can think will pay off for itself one way or another i have to think youre right about that schild answered ive got one and its costing me plenty that crack was almost enough of itself to make gerin like him the fox said come into the great hall drink some ale with me and well try to figure out what we can do for you hed turned and taken a couple of steps before he remembered schild had been less than forthcoming about his son he kept walking but resolved not to like or trust his neighbor no matter what sort of cracks schild made schild poured ale down his throat he watched gerin warily too coming to the fox for aid could not have been easy for him how many cars will you send he demanded and how soon will you send them were hurting badly and thats the truth if id thought wed have anything to eat this winter he let that hang no asking for help hadnt been easy gerin didnt answer right away hed been weighing the question even before schild asked it i want to say eight but i suppose i can spare ten he said at last what why you tightfisted schild cursed with an inventiveness and a volume that had men running in from the courtyard and coming down from upstairs to see what on earth had gone wrong now van said you dont have a moat captain but shall i chuck him in the ditch for you no gerin answered hes pitching a fit because he doesnt know all the facts yet for instance he continued with a certain amount of spite i havent told him the chariots and crew i do send will have to be back here in fifteen days time they can sweep his holding but they cant stay there and fight all the way up till harvest time that does it schild sprang to his feet im for my own lands again but the gods and to the five hells with you fox and a murrain on your ten stinking cars and your fifteen stinking days we ll manage somehow and after we do sit down and shut up every once in a while gerin could strike a tone that produced obedience without thought he wished he could manage it at willit was useful this time it worked schilds knees folded and he sat back onto the bench gerin went on i cant send more than ten cars because im sending others south to open the elabon way bevon and two of his worthless sons have struck at it and driven my garrisons back and ill want the chariots home soon because aragis the archer and i have made alliance hes bringing his forces north so we can strike at adiatunnus and the monsters together i want my force of chariotry at full strength for that now do you understand lord schild i understand youre the biggest bastard ever spawned in the northlands lord gerin schild answered but the fire had gone out of his voice he got up again carried his jack to the pitcher of ale poured it full and drained it dry only after hed wiped his mouth and mustache on the sleeve of his tunic did he give his attention back to the fox you set me up for that tantrum you son of a whore you just wanted to see how loud you could make me yell if it werent so id deny it gerin said in case youre interested you yell louder than i thought you could truth that van put in i thought one of those monsters was loose in the keep when i heard you roar schild looked from one of them to the other to the five hells with both of you now when will you send out your chariotry as soon as i can gerin answered ill send messengers today to my vassals who have keeps on the western side of my holding as youll have noticed i havent enough men here myself to make up ten cars or anything close to that number i would have if i didnt need to order crews south against bevon he spread his hands im afraid thats what you get lord schild for taking so long to make up your mind youre really in trouble my men ought to be crossing your frontier about the time your tribute comes in to fox keep aye id worked that out for myself thanks schild said you re not an easy overlord to serve under lord prince i console myself by thinking youre fair in what you do ill take that gerin said the fox lay beside selatre watching the lamp gutter toward extinction its red dying flame cast flickering shadows on the wall of the bedchamber he let one hand run idly down the smooth length of her torso hed felt sated after he made love with fand he felt happy now it had been so long since hed felt really happy after hed made love that the difference struck him like a blow he wondered how hed failed to notice when that happy feeling started to slip away while elise shared his bed partly he suspected his own stupidity was to blame and partly hed supposed it was simply part of their growing used to each other that was probably stupid too now that he thought about it when shed bedded the horseleech after she ran off had she felt happy afterwards gerin rather hoped so selatre snuggled against him which drove thoughts of elise if not altogether out of his head then at least back into the dark corners where they belonged these days she laughed a little as she said the time when i thought no man could touch me seems faraway now i was foolish no you werent gerin shook his head you were doing what was right for you then on the other hand id be lying if i said i wasnt glad youd changed your mind he bent his head so he could kiss the sweet hollow place where her neck met her shoulder your beard tickles she said and then as if she werent changing the subject at all what im glad of is that my courses are finally spent i could have done without that part of becoming a womani think ive said as much before eight or ten times gerin agreed she poked him in the ribs he jerked for someone who hadnt been allowed to touch a man for a long time she learned fast maybe shed grown up with little brothers back in her peasant village gerin had been a little brother he knew what pests they could make of themselves selatre said one of the reasons i didnt care for my courses is that they kept me from having you ive grown greedy so fast you see they dont have to keep men and women apart gerin observed no selatre sounded surprised her mouth twisted it would be messy it can be gerin agreed youre apt to be dry then too buthe smiled a lopsided smilethere are compensations i didnt want to seem as if i were forcing myself on you this first time youre finding out about so many new things so fast i thought i shouldnt burden you with one more the gods willing we have plenty of time i think i am very lucky here selatre snuggled closer still i may have said that before tooeight or ten times she gave him a look that said what are you going to make of that he knew what he wanted to make of it and was hoping he could rise to the occasion once more when someone came running up the hall toward the bedchamber he scowled it was too late at night for anyone to bother him without excellent reason then the fellow outside shouted lord gerin there are monsters loose in besants village oh a pox gerin cried and sprang out of bed im coming he scrambled into tunic and trousers buckled on his sandals and grabbed his sword belt and unbarred the door selatre barely had time to throw a blanket over her nakedness gerin hurried downstairs where his armor with that of his vassals hung from pegs on the side walls of the great hall he got into his corselet jammed his bronze pot of a helm onto his head and put his shield on his right arm tonight hed make do without his greaves he snatched up his bow and a full quiver of arrows van had already armed himself come on captain he said impatiently ive missed good fighting to wait for you you must have been down here to have got into your gear so fast gerin said aye so i was drinking ale rolling the dice with a few of the ladsyou know how it goes when the drawbridge thumped down i figured somebodyd gone and pissed in the porridge pot and sure enough in came this screaming serf babbling of monsters i sent one of the cooks upstairs for you while those of us who were down here got weapons and went out to fight with that he trotted for the door himself the fox at his heels at the gate one of the men there handed gerin a blazing torch against the ghosts lord prince he bawled gerin was grateful for his quick thinking but felt overburdened as he pounded toward besant bigbellys village even with the torch the night spirits assailed him as soon as he got outside the keep dark of night was their time their element they sent a chilling blast of hate and resentment down on a mortal who presumed to enter it without better apotropaic than fire alone he set his teeth and ran on beside him van muttered oaths or perhaps prayers in a language he did not recognize when those had no effect the outlander shouted be still you cursed soulsuckers if any living man could awe the ghosts van would have been the one to do it but no living man could fortunately besants village lay only a couple of furlongs from fox keep before the spirits could find all the chinks in the armor of gerins soul and slip cold mental fingers in to drive him mad he was among the wattleanddaub huts of the serfs theyd given the ghosts the usual gift of sunset blood and so were not haunted through the night but things fiercer than phantoms assailed them now a man lay sprawled in the street his blood darkened the dirt on which hed fallen his linen tunic was rucked up monsters had been feeding on his legs and hindquarters before the warriors came to drive them off gerin threw down his bow in the dim light shooting was useless maths crescent almost brushed the horizon and even pale nothos fatter crescent higher in the western sky made distances seem to shift and waver as if in a dream his sword snaked free this would have to be closequarters work screams from inside a hut with its door flung open told of a monster inside peering over the edge of his shield gerin ran in the darkness was all but absolute but his ears told him of the struggle there roaring the monster turned from the serf it had been attacking to meet him he thrust at it with his sword he couldnt have done more than pink it for its cries redoubled crash something wet splashed in the foxs face the monster was staggering thoughthe serf with great presence of mind had hit it over the head with a water jar the fox stepped close stabbed again and again and again the monster stumbled recovered fell dyaus bless you lord prince the serf and his wife cried in the same breath and you for the help you gave he answered as he turned and rushed back out into the street no time now for polite conversation fighting the monsters was not like fighting human foes that had both advantages and disadvantages as gerin had noted before the creatures fought as individuals not as part of a larger group in the confused brawling in the darkness though his own men were hardly more organized and the creatures neither cared anything for loot nor felt any shame at running away if they found themselves in danger they could escape by no other means full of notions about glory and honor and courage trokmoi would have held their ground and let themselves be killed where they stood gerin caught the reek from a monsters bodya thicker meatier smell than came from a man no matter how long unwashedand threw up his shield before the creature just another shadow in the night closed with him he almost dropped the shield in surprise when a sword slammed against it the monster gave him the first unmistakable words hed heard from one of their throats die man they were in the trokme tongue and snarled rather than spoken but he had no trouble understanding them die yourself he answered in the same language the monster had no shield no armor and no skill at swordplay to speak of but it was very quick and very strong when it beat aside his thrust the blow almost knocked the sword from his hand he wondered if it could see better in the night than he could after it and its ancestors had spent so many generations in a troglodytic life that seemed likely and though it was very awkward with its sword something let it thwart his strokes again and again here captain im coming van shouted his heavy footfalls got closer fast the monster though did not wait to be attacked by two at once it turned and scampered away toward the woods faster than an armored man could hope to follow the fighting died away not long after that with the rest of the creatures either down or fled some of gerins troopers had been clawed or bitten but none of them was badly hurt besant bigbelly sought out the fox the serfs in his village hadnt been so lucky as lamentations and moans of pain rose into the night the headman said weve three dead lord prince and several more men and women both who wont be able to work for some while dyaus and the other gods only know how were to bring in enough crops to meet your dues come fall he wrung his hands in anxiety it was gerin thought with a flash of contempt utterly characteristic of him to worry about the dues first and people only afterwards dont worry about it he said if i see the people here are making an honest effort i wont hold them to blame for falling a bit short of what they might have done otherwise youre kind lord prince besant cried seizing gerins hand and pressing it to his lips the fox snatched it back he suspected the headman would use his generosity as an excuse to try to slack off before the harvest or cheat him afterwards but he figured he had a decent chance of getting the better of besant at that game lord prince a hesitant touch on his arm it was the serf in whose house hed fought i want to thank you lord prince werent for you reckon that hideous thing wouldve et arabel or me or maybe the both of us pruanz is right the woman beside the peasant said thank you cant have my villagers eaten gerin said gravely they never work as well afterwards rihwin would have smiled at the joke or at least recognized that it was one it flew past pruanz and arabel a clean miss words theyre cheap pruanz said want to give you something better show we really mean what we say pruanz is right arabel said you come back with me to the house ill make you feel as good as i know how even in darkness he saw her twitch her hips at him lord prince shes lively pruanz said youll like what she does gerin looked from one of them to the other they meant it he sighed hed taken his pleasure with peasant women a good many times but he didnt feel like it now not with selatre waiting for him back at the keep as gently as he could he said i dont want to take your wife from you pruanz i was just doing as a liege lord should and i have a lady of my own pruanz didnt answer but arabel did indignantly well i like that what does she have that i dont she rubbed herself against the fox by the feel of her she did indeed possess all female prerequisites he was embarrassed enough to wish hed left her and her husband in the hut to be devoured he managed to free his arm from arabel and said to pruanz the best way for the two of you to show youre glad youre alive is to bed each other arabel let out a loud scornful sniff well maybe i should leave you to your fancy lady lord prince though i dont suppose she gets much use out of you neither arabel pruanz hissed thats no way to talk to him what saved us and who saved him smashing a jug over that horrible things head she retorted i expect that means you saved me too she all but dragged her husband back toward their hut gerin suspected his suggestion was about to be fulfilled even if hed given it to the wrong one of the pair he gathered up his troopers they didnt have torches for the walk back to fox keep but the ghosts were fairly quiet why not he thought as he neared the drawbridgethe night spirits were no doubt battening on the new gift of blood theyd just received from the dead peasants and monsters some of the warriors went off to bed right away others paused in the great hall for a jack of aleor several jacks of alebefore they slept after gerin had put his armor and the bow hed recovered back on their pegs van planted an elbow in his ribs hard enough to make him stagger fox thats twice now lately youve turned it down when you had the chance to take some he said you must be getting old oh you heard that did you gerin looked up his nose at his taller friend who stood there chuckling if you want to get much older youd be wise to tend to your own affairs and leave mineor the lack of themto me affairs forsooth van drained his drinking jack poured it full drained it again then he headed for the stairs a fixed expression on his face for his sake gerin hoped fand was in or could be cajoled into the mood if she wasnt or couldnt shed throw things thats the closest theyve come to here drago the bear said yawning i dont like it not even a little bit by his matteroffact tone he might have been talking of a hot sticky summers day i dont like it either gerin answered im stretched far too wideseems thats all i say lately men and cars off in schilds holding more of them down in the south fighting bevon and his bastard boys they were born in wedlock far as i know said drago who could sometimes get the letter and miss the spirit theyre bastards all the same gerin said lining up with the trokmoi is bad enough but anyone who lines up with the monsters deserves whatever happens to him i intend to happen to bevon and bevonis and bevion but while im dealing with them i cant be dealing with adiatunnus and his monster friends and if my men cant push bevon off the elabon way and if aragis troopers fail too what then i cant see anythingexcept us losing the war i mean never happen drago said and fell asleep at the table his head in his hands gerin wished he had his vassals confidenceand naivete he knew only too well how easy losing the war would be his nimble imagination usually an asset betrayed him with images of blood and defeat and treachery so many ways things could go wrong what he had trouble coming up with was ways they could go right he emptied his own drinking jack and went upstairs himself he opened the door to his bedchamber as quietly as he could expecting selatre to be asleep but he found the lamp lit and her sitting up in bed waiting for him she wasnt spending the time idly either shed gone down the hall to the library and fetched back a codex to read until he returned she put it down and said biton and the other gods be praised that youre all right every time you go out to fight now not a scratch he said turning to bar the door we hurt the monsters worse than they hurt the village so thatswell not all right but better than it might have been he didnt want to talk about the skirmish all he wanted to do was forget it what do you have there she flipped back to the first leaf of parchment on the motions of the moons by one volatin of elabon it was the first volume i saw in the library the reason being that you left it out on the table there instead of returning it to its proper niche she fixed him with the severe look of a librarian whose sense of order had been transgressed im sorry he said rather to his surprise he found himself meaning it so youre trying volatin are you what do you make of him not much im afraid she admitted endless numbers and curious signs you didnt teach me and other obscurities and oddments what do they all mean they mean that if id looked through his book five years ago id have known the werenight was coming for he showed it beyond doubt in those columns of numbers but i just thought of the book as a curiosity id brought back from the city of elabon and so it sat idle and useless on my shelf he scowled in selfreproach what could you have done about the werenight had you known of it selatre asked given that i was traveling when it happened probably nothing he said but its made me pay close attention to the phases of the moons ever since tenno elevendays from now math will be full the day after that elleb and nothos and the day after that tiwaz its not quite a dreadful werenight like the one we had beforefrom what volatin says those come less than once in a thousand years but men with a were streak in them will come closer to changing then than on any other night for a long time to come its one more thing to worry about selatre finished for him he stared at her in surprise and delight well well he said i didnt know you spoke my language im learning she said x three days after the monsters attacked besants village the lookout in the watchtower blew a long blast on his horn and shouted a chariot approaches from the south a few minutes later he added with some excitement its utreiz embrons son by the gods gerin was in the stables fitting a new spoke to a chariot wheel he dropped the knife with which he was making a final trim of the spoke raffo who was helping him said well well know one way or the other that we will gerin answered and hurried out into the courtyard men were also bustling out from the keep itself everyone in castle foxeveryone in gerins domainhad a vital stake in learning whether the elabon way had been reopened van caught the foxs eye and said wishing you luck captain ill take all i can get thanks gerin said the drawbridge seemed to be crawling down gerins hands folded into fists his nails bit into his palms at last with a thump the drawbridge met the ground on the far side of the ditch around the palisade utreizs chariot thumped over it even before the warrior spoke a great weight lifted from gerins heart for he his driver and the other warrior in the car were all wreathed in smiles dyaus and all the gods be praised we smashed em utreiz cried he tried to go on but a great cheer from everyone in the courtyard drowned the rest of his words rihwin the fox leaped up into the car and planted a kiss on the startled utreizs cheek he had no designs on the other mans body that was just a southern way of showing joy at good news in the rougher northlands though it was best used with caution get off me utreiz said and several other rougher things the hubbub mercifully muffled when the din died away a little gerin said tell us all that befell maybehe glanced around pointedlywell be able to hear you now aye lord prince utreiz turned as if to push rihwin out of the chariot but rihwin had already jumped down looking foolish utreiz resumed in one way it was just as you said ricolf the red and his men came up from the south to join us and bevander against bevon and his other two sons since they held the road we had to sneak through the woods to the west to set up a common attack on the same day we set out right at dawn caught em by surprise worse than they did when they hit us and grabbed that stretch of road bevonis is dead we caught bevion he offered me everything in the world not to let bevander have him bevon curse him got away and holed up in his keep he had to shout the last part cheering had erupted again through it gerin said well done the road is open we have our men back from schilds holding whats this lord utreiz asked and gerin realized he hadnt heard about schilds cry for help he explained quickly finishing youd have been just as glad if the men id sent to schild had stayed out a few days more seeing as rihwin was one of them but all we have to do now is await aragis troopers and hope they come he added to himself this splendid news calls for an equally splendid celebration rihwin shouted which raised more cheers from the warriors gathered in the courtyard around utreiz even gerin clapped his hands not wanting to be thought a wet blanket if his men felt like roistering where no fight impended that was all right with him but then rihwin went on what say we break out the wine with which schild was generous enough to buy our aid some of the troopers clapped again othersnotably van and dragolooked to gerin instead no he said in a voice abrupt as an avalanche but my fellow fox rihwin protested gerin cut him off with a sharp chopping gesture no i said and no i meant havent you had enough misfortunes with wine and with mavrix my fellow fox he freighted rihwins ekename with enough irony to sink it rihwin flushed but persisted i hadnt intended to summon the lord of the sweet grape lord prince nor had i intended to do aught more with his vintage than sip it and not to excess no gerin said for the third time what you intend and what turns out have a way of being two different things and i trust that gift of wine from schild about as far as id trust so many jars full of vipers what you think the whoresons out to poison us van rumbled if thats so he didnt go on not with words but pulled his mace free and whacked the shaft against the palm of his left hand but gerin shook his head and said no yet again van looked puzzled rihwin looked as dubious as he had just before gerin gave him an asss ear in place of his own gerin went on what i mean is i fear that mavrix seeks a foothold in my lands he explained how the sithonian god of wine and fertility and creativity had repeatedly cropped up of late finishing given whats passed between the god and meand between the god and rihwinthese past few years the less presence he has here the happier and safer ill feel i didnt dare refuse the wine of schild for that would have offered mavrix insult direct but i shant invite his presence by broaching those jars either i had not considered the matter in that light rihwin admitted after rather more thought than usual so far as men can you may well have wisdom there lord prince but one thing you must always bear in mind the lord of the sweet grape is stronger than you are if it be his will that he establish himself in your holding establish himself he shall whether you will or not i am painfully aware of that gerin said sighing but what i can do to prevent it i will im on good terms with baivers drink all the ale you please rihwin and ill say not a word the wine jars stay closed sense lord prince utreiz embrons son said van nodded after a moment so did drago after a longer moment so did rihwin good gerin said all the same he quietly resolved to take the wine jars from the cellarwhere they resided with the aleand find a more secret place for them rihwins intentions were surely good but his actions lived up to them no more than anyone elsesless than those of a few people who crossed the foxs mind the warriors trooped into the great hall still loudly congratulating utreiz its not as if i won the fight all by my lonesome he protested much as gerin might have in the same circumstances nobody paid any attention to him hed taken part in the victory and brought news of it and that was plenty seeing the invasion servants hurried downstairs and into the kitchens they quickly returned with ale no wine the fox checked each amphora to be sure of what it held meat from the night before and bread to put it on some of the warriors called for bowls of the pease porridge that simmered in a big pot above the hearth the troopers made enough racket to bring people down from upstairs to see what was going on van caught fand in his arms planted a loud smacking kiss on her mouth and then sat down again pulling her into his lap he grabbed for his jack of ale here sweetling drink he cried almost spilling it down her chin weve beaten bevon and his boys proper that we have is it so she said aye ill drink to that and right gladly too she took the jack from his hand drained it dry gerin wondered if she would have been so ready to toast a triumph over adiatunnushe after all was of her own folk not just an elabonian on the wrong side the fox shook his head shed never been disloyal to him that way when van kissed her again she responded as if she meant to drag him upstairs in a momentor possibly not bother with dragging him upstairs but then she got off his lap to claim a drinking jack of her own and fill it full of ale selatre came down into the great hall in the middle of that she too got a jack of ale gerin stood to greet her but hesitated to do so much as take her hand she remained leery of publicly showing affection unlike many she didnt assume her own standards applied to everyone she watched fand and van with much more amusement than disapproval she sat down on the bench by the fox i take it the news is good she said then she saw utreiz now i know the news is good and what sort of news it is weve beaten bevon and his sons and taken back the full length of the elabon way not so gerin nodded thats just what weve done he gave her an admiring look you dont miss much do you next time i have to ride out in a sweep against the monsters i think ill leave you in charge back here for the first time since theyd become loversmaybe for the first time since shed come to fox keepselatre got angry at him dont mock me with things you know i cant have she snapped she waved to the crowd of noisy drinking warriors the only use they have for women is to tumble them or maybe to have them fetch up another jar of ale from the cellar as if theyd pay heed to me she glared taken aback at her vehemence the fox said slowly im sorry i dont suppose i meant that altogether seriously but i didnt mean to mock you with it either he plucked at his beard as he thought if you wanted to badly enough you could probably bring it off all youd need to do is remind them that youd once been sibyl and give them the feeling your eye for what needed doing was better than theirs even now but that would be a lie selatre said gerin shook his head no just a push in the right direction theres a magic to getting people to do what you want that doesnt show up in any grimoire it uses what a person has done and who he is to show that heor sheis apt to do well or to come up with the right answer or whatever you like the next time too thats what i was talking about here you could do it whether youd want to or not is another question some of me is tempted she said in a small voice the rest though the bigger half wants no part of it im not fond of having people tell me what to do so i dont think i have any business giving orders to anyone else either good for you gerin said i never intended to be a baron much less somebody who calls himself a prince i just aimed at being a scholar studying what i wanted when i wanted to do it selfmockery filled his laugh what you aim at in life and what you end up with are often two very different things that made him think of the jars of wine schild had sent him they still sat down in the cellar sealed and innocuous and hed move them somewhere safer yet as soon as he got round to it but with mavrix immanent in that wine who could say how much his own aims mattered the moons coursed through the sky tiwaz swiftly nothos so slowly that his phase seemed to change but little from day to day elleb and math in between gerin paid them close heed for two reasons to gauge the time when the four moons would come full in the space of three days and to see how many days aragis the archer had left to fulfill the promise his envoys had made golden math was two days past first quarter when word came to fox keep that the monsters had attacked a village near the southern boundary of gerins holding cursing under his breathwhy wouldnt things ever hold still long enough for him to catch his breathhe readied a force of chariotry and set out to sweep the countryside he had no great hope of sweeping it clean but refused to sit idly by and let the creatures hold the initiative the sweep actually went better than hed expected his warriors caught three monsters feeding on a cow theyd dragged down in the middle of a meadow close by the road with joyous whoops they sent their chariots jouncing over the grass to cut the monsters off from the safety of the woods the creatures were slow to flee too staying at the carcass for a last couple of mouthfuls of meat before they tried to get away thanks to that the foxs men were able to bring them all down with no loss to themselves one of the monsters still tried to crawl toward the woods despite having taken enough arrows to give it the aspect of a hedgehog van got down from the car he shared with gerin and smashed in its head with his mace then he and some of the other men began the gory business of reclaiming shafts from the bodies of the creatures raffo turned to gerin and said heres another way keeping the trees well back from the side of the road did you a good turn lord prince if youd let them grow up close as other barons do those stinking things might have made good their escape thats true gerin said after a while you sometimes get to wonder whether somethings more trouble than its worth but when you see the work youve spent pay for itself it reminds you that you might have known what you were doing all along the war party reached the ravaged village a little before sunset the serfs there had fought back as well as they could theyd lost a man two women and some livestock but theyd also managed to kill a monster gerin sent his troopers out on a short foray into the forest surrounding the village ordering them to be back in the open before night took them that was one command he was sure theyd obeyno one wanted to meet the ghosts away from blood and fire a deadfall of branches and sticks caught the foxs eye theres a likely place he said pointing van and raffo both nodded aye youre right van added and probed the brush with his spear with a scream a monster burst out and hurled itself at him he held it off with his shield though its charge forced him back two steps among them he and gerin and raffo made short work of the creature female gerin noted aye so it was mean enough all the same van said sounding embarrassed at having to give ground he sighed theyre all mean enough and to spare inside the deadfall something yowledtwo somethings by the sound gerin stared in dismay at van it had cubs he said as if accusing his friend aye the outlander answered and then after a moment no reason we should be surprised i suppose the creatures must have been having cubs for the gods only know how long down in their caves theyll have kept right on doing it now that theyre aboveground this one will have been pregnant before she got aboveground come to that so she will gerin said the outlander was right of course but that didnt take away the startlement the fox dug into the deadfall scattering brush in all directions after a moment van and raffo pitched in to help they soon uncovered the monster cubs gerin stared at them in dismay they looked like nothing so much as ugly hairy babies what are you going to do with them raffo asked gulping a little oddly that made gerin feel a little easier the driver didnt have the stomach just to kill them either van did get rid of them he said you know what they turn into i dont know what to do the fox answered slowly aye i know what they turn into but im still not sure how smart the monsters are if they learn im slaying their cubs out of hand and understand that itll just make them worse foes of mine than they are already honh van said a noise of deep discontent how could they be i dont know and i dont want to find out well what will you do van asked scornfully take em home and make pets of em why not we have fand back at fox keep gerin murmured actually the idea tempted him tweaking his curiosity if you raised a monster among men what would you get a monster a pet as van had said something not too far removed from an ugly hairy man or for that matter an ugly hairy woman if hed had fewer things to worry about if hed had more leisure if he hadnt been certain all his vassals would scream even louder than van had he might have tried the experiment as it was i know what well do whats that lord raffo asked nothing gerin said nothing at all we killed the female in battlewell and good we wontwe canttake the cubs back to castle fox youre right about that van but i wont just slaughter them either ill leave them here maybe beasts will get them or maybe if the monsters do have something in the way of family feeling theyll take them and raise them up ill leave that in the hands of the gods he hadnt asked whether van or raffo approved now he looked to see if they did raffo nodded van still seemed unhappy but finally said you have a way of looking for the middle road fox i suppose you found it here lets go back when they returned to the village they found the other chariot crews had also had good luck theyd killed two monsters the only serious injury theyd taken being to parol chickpea whod just recovered from his bitten buttock now he was grayfaced and had a bloody rag wrapped around his left handhed lost two fingers from it how did that happen gerin asked his shield should have protected him there hes righthanded so he doesnt have that hand out in the open the way i do just bad luck drago the bear answered the monster he was fighting gave a good yank at his shield and it broke away from the handgrip and lashing then the thing sprang at him and he stuck out his arm to keep from getting its teeth in his neck instead i hope he heals hes lost a lot of blood gerin made unhappy clucking noises aye hes a good fighter and a long way from the worst of men he kicked at the dirt feeling useless would that the gods had never let this plague of monsters loose on us every warrior every serf even we lose is one we cant replace thats all true lord but the creatures are here and we have to fend em off as best we can drago said gerin wished he could muster that same stolid acceptance for things he couldnt help the warriors started back toward the main road at dawn the next day they left parol chickpea behind hed taken a fever and was in no condition to spend a day in the chariot well do the best we can for him lord prince the village headman promised with that gerin had to be content the serfs herbs and potions were as likely to help parol as any of the fancier doctoring techniques that came from south of the high kirs unfortunately they were also as likely not to help when the dirt track the chariots were following ran into the elabon way van pointed south and said more cars heading up toward us captain the fox hadnt looked southward he was intent on getting back to the keep but his eyes followed vans pointing finger his left eyebrow rose quite a few cars he said in surprise i hope bevon hasnt rallied and driven my men off the highway again he let out a long sigh wed better go find out he tapped raffo on the shoulder the driver swung his chariot south the rest of the cars in the war party followed before long gerin realized he didnt recognize any of the approaching chariots he also realized his band was badly outnumbered if bevon somehow had managed to pull off one victory he might be on the point of another then van pointed again there in the second car fox isnt that tall skinny fellow aragis the archer father dyaus gerin said softly he squinted your eyes are sharper than mine then he let out a whoop loud enough to make raffo start aye it is aragisand see all the friends hes brought with him a great whacking lot of them thats for certain van said the more teams and chariots gerin saw the more thoughtful he grew he started to regret that whoop of glee measured all together his own forces comfortably outnumbered aragis army but his forces were scattered over several holdings and doing several different things which left him in a decidedly uncomfortable position here if aragis should decide to take advantage of his superior numbers here on the spot affairs in the northlands would suddenly look very different although gerin would be in no position to appreciate the difference a bold front had served him well many times in the past he tapped raffo on the shoulder again lets go down and give the grand duke proper greeting aye lord prince raffo sounded a little doubtful but steered the car toward the approaching host the rest of the chariots in gerins war party followed he heard some of his men muttering among themselves at the course he took but no one challenged him he had a reputation for being right the next few minutes would show how well he deserved it he waved toward the oncoming chariots someone waved back marlanz rawmeat a moment later fabors faburs son waved too then aragis also raised his hand to greet the fox well met gerin called when hed drawn a little closer to aragis force youre in good time and here with more cars even than id looked for well met indeed we were just out driving the monsters back from one of my villages and slew several and left two to an unsure fate he added to himself aragis didnt need to know about that he would surely have killed the cubs without a second thought good for you lord prince aragis called back and not only have i brought my men and my horses and my cars i have a present for youtwo presents as a matter of fact have you now grand duke the fox hoped he sounded fulsome rather than worried an unscrupulous man which aragis had a reputation of being might reckon a volley of arrows and a hard charge as presents but aragis didnt order an attack he reached down into the car and held up a large tightly tied leather sack heres one of them then he reached down again and lifted something else something heavier his lips pulled back from his teeth partly from the effort and partly in a real smile and heres the other from his arms duren squealed father gerin prided himself on seldom being at a loss his pride suffered now but he couldnt have cared less duren he whispered aragis couldnt possibly have heard that but nodded nonetheless his driver reined in he set duren down on the stone surface of the road the boy ran to gerins chariot the fox jumped out of his car even though raffo hadnt stopped it he staggered a little when he landed and then again when duren ran into him full tilt he picked up his son and squeezed him so tight against his own corseleted chest that he felt the air go out of the boy father why are you crying duren demanded indignantly arent you glad to see me thats why im crying gerin answered because im glad to see you i dont understand duren said never mind gerin told him aragis chariot had come up behind duren the fox turned to the hawkfaced grand duke and said you know i was afraid youd taken the boy or rather kept him after someone elseit would have been tassilo wouldnt ittook him i never thought to get him back through you to say im in your debt just shows how little words can mean youve yet to open your other gift aragis said he handed gerin the leather sack without more explanation when the fox undid the knot in the rawhide lashing that held it closed a foul stench escaped he nodded from the weight and heft of the sack hed expected it would hold a head he looked inside nodded again and closed it aye thats tassilo i packed him in salt for some days after immtook him apart aragis said i wanted you to be able to recognize him to be sure he was dead gerin picked up the sack and threw it into the grass by the side of the road it bounced a couple of times and lay still you gave him too easy an end you ask me van told aragis i thought on that aragis admitted still though while he kidnapped the boy he didnt do anything worse while he had him that may have been because he wanted to keep his value as hostage high but whatever the reason its so i let his end be easy on account of it hes dead thats all that matters gerin said no not all he squeezed duren breathless again then asked aragis when did he come to you as the gods would have it the day after i sent my vassals to you seeking common cause aragis said so any of the men here with me will attest his driver and the other warrior in the car with him nodded almost in unison i see gerin said slowly he wondered if the grand duke was telling the truth had he perhaps had duren earlier and contemplated using him against the fox aragis was not a man to cross no doubt his own vassals would support him duren wouldnt know not exactly fouryearolds had very strange notions of time gerin decided to let it lie for now how fare you here aragis asked your own men down further south were full of stories of hard fighting to hold the road open thats true but we won the fight gerin said doubly glad aragis hadnt had to try forcing his way through bevons menand quadruply glad aragis hadnt tried and failed the fox went on weve had a few other small things happening too and with that airy understatement explained his sweeps through his one holding and the one schild had so urgently requested youve had a busy time of it aragis said a statement so selfevidently true that gerin didnt even bother nodding the grand duke added i was taking the omens before i set out and the birds flight warned me id best leave early rather than late so here you see me now try as i would i couldnt make sense of why but i accepted the reading all the same i think you did well gerin said and told him of the near werenight due in a few days aragis eyes narrowed is that a fact he said then shook his head no im not doubting you fox just that with so many things closer to home to keep track of i never thought to worry about the moons sometimes the things you most need to worry about arent the obvious ones gerin said for some reason that made him think not of the untouchably distant moons but of elise whod given no signsno signs hed noticed anyhowof discontent until one day she was simply gone aragis said i have a hard enough time worrying about the things that are obvious the rest i leave to the gods and clever fellows like you his voice rang sardonic but only slightly he didnt worry about the long run or the wide picture as much as gerin did in the short term and over the limited space of the northlands his methods worked well enough lets head up to the keep gerin said well wait out the moons there if that suits you and then do our best to smash adiatunnus if his lands arent a sanctuary for the monsters well stand a better chance of controlling them i wonder if well ever be able to do that aragis said gloomily the damned trokmes lands are nowhere near mine but the stinking creatures plague me as bad as they do you maybe worse after we finish up here ill want you and yours to ride south and help me clear my hinterlands of em thats why we made the pact gerin agreed though as you say i dont know if well ever be able to clear them completely now sometimes that strikes me as more a job for gods than for men if prayer were the answer every monster in the northlands would have died a hundred times by now aragis said isnt that the sad and sorry truth gerin said but i wasnt thinking so much of prayer the gods hear prayer for a double handful of thousands of different things every day no wonder most of them arent grantedgrant one and a god rejects another in the granting whats crossed my mind once or twice lately though is evocation aragis stared at him so did his own men he didnt blame any of them the last time hed been at all involved in evoking was five years before when rihwin summoned mavrix to turn sour wine back into sweet rihwin hadnt intended to evoke mavrix then only to invoke him when you let a god fully enter the material world you ran a tremendous risk summoning the god was relatively easy controlling him once summoned was anything but you have a reputation for not thinking small aragis said at last and i see its well earned dyaus above its not something i want to do gerin exclaimed why do you think i so want this alliance to succeed if we can beat the trokmoi and the monsters on our own we wont have to think about calling on the gods but if it comes down to a choice between losing the fight and trying one last great stroke to win it which would you take damn me to the five hells if i know aragis shook his head as if gerin had made him look at something he would sooner not have contemplated as you say lord prince let us hope the choice does not come down to that shall we ride on to your keep now and ready ourselves for the fighting ahead i suggested as much a while ago but weve been standing around here talking instead gerin said he picked duren up and started to set him in his own chariot wait papa i have to piddle duren said he started toward the bushes off to the side of the road gerin and van both went with him the one with drawn sword the other with heavy spear at the ready wild beasts and worse dwelt in the woods these days when duren was done van grabbed him by the feet and carried him back to the chariot upside down he squealed laughter all the way hearing that laughter lifted years from gerins heart he nodded to aragis who nodded back it was good to know there were depths to which some men in the northlands would not sink having duren in the car with him bouncing up and down made the trip back to castle fox one of the more enjoyable journeys gerin had ever taken even having his son ask are we almost there yet with great regularity didnt couldnt come close to taking the edge off his happiness not today when they got back to fox keep late that afternoon the castle was shut up tight against them gerin would have been furious to find it any other way the lookout would have seen a great many chariots far more than had set out the previous morning and had better have assumed they were hostile the fox rode up close enough for the warriors on the palisade to recognize him and called were all friends herearagis the archer has brought his men north and look as aragis had before him he held duren high the men on the wall cheered themselves hoarse the drawbridge came down quickly heavy bronze chain rattling over the winch van asked quietly where are we going to put all of aragis men the keep wont hold the lot of em and besides i wont want all of them inside at once until i have more of my own troopers here to balance the scale gerin finished for him i dont see how i can keep from feasting em tonight but after that now he let his voice trail away look sharp van said heres aragis coming up the grand duke said lord prince we are allies but not yet certain of each other although youve been too polite to speak much of that weve brought canvas and such if it please you most of my men will sleep outside the keep you need have no fear well set a watch against monsters and such as we did on the road north gerin dipped his head i thank you youve just made my life easier i thought that might be so aragis smile was pleasant enough but something hard remained under the surface i might have made other plans did i not need your aid in the south as much as you need mine heremaybe more indeed gerin said i understand what youre saying your grandson will rule mine maybe or mine yours but if we fight now we both go under well be wise to bear that in mind all through this campaign my grandson will have his own worries aragis said i cant untangle mine right now let alone his but as you say fox remembering we need each other is the best way to keep from going to war too soon it was probably the only way that would hold aragis in check gerin thought the archer by all evidence was ruthlessly effective in pursuing his own interests reminding him that gerin was part of those interests seemed eminently practical nodding the fox said shall we go into the keep together youll guest with me of course apart from my men you mean aye of course aragis answered one thing his nature made easy gerin didnt have to waste time with politesounding explanations aragis saw through to the essence of things and accepted them for what they were some of the men on the palisade came down to greet the fox and his companions others held their posts bows ready hearing the commotion servants came out from the great hall to see what was happening so did fand and selatre seeing fand duren jumped out of the chariot and ran to her she scooped him up in an embrace said to gerin och you got him back good on you there first thing thats gone right in a while the fox said then he glanced toward selatre and corrected himself no the second thing duren wiggled out of fands arms he pointed at selatre who is that lady ive never seen her before he looked thoughtful which made him look amazingly like a miniature beardless version of gerin is that my mama come back he asked hope lighting his face brighter than the sun hed barely been toddling when elise left fox keep no its not gerin said gently and the sparkle died in durens eyes his father went on but do you know who it is thats the lady who used to be the sibyl down at ikos the one the god spoke through her name is selatre she lives at fox keep now my vassals spoke to me of this aragis said without giving any hint of how he felt about it duren studied selatre then asked the childs natural question why gerin had always tried to be as straightforward with his son as he could that wasnt easy now but he did his best because the earthquakedo you remember the earthquake duren nodded eyes wide gerin continued the earthquake knocked down bitons temple at ikos and it let loose the monsters from underground there van and i were afraid the monsters would kill selatre and eat her the way they do so we rescued her and brought her to castle fox with us when we came back oh duren said all right after a moment he asked why were you and van at ikos to ask the god to tell us through the sibyl where you were gerin answered oh duren said again but i was with tassilo by his tone that was as much a fact of nature as trees leaves being green but we didnt know you were with tassilo the fox reminded him and even if we had known it we didnt know where tassilo was why not duren asked at which point gerin threw his hands in the air he said lets bring up some of the good ale from the cellar slay an ox and some sheep and rejoice that we have enough bold warriors here now to take on the trokmoi and the monsters or so i hope at any rate he thought if we dont were in even more trouble than i reckoned on before nothing finer than a good sheeps head all cooked up proper with plenty of ale to wash it down drago the bear declared baron though he was he had a peasants taste in food the fox looked to the sky with sunset near all the moons were up tiwaz at first quarter near the meridian then elleb halfway between first quarter and full and then close together and low in the east math and nothos gerin shook his head five years earlier hed paid attention to the motions of the moons mostly to let him gauge the time by night seeing them crawl together now sent a shiver of dread through him this stretch surely would not approach the horrors of the werenight but how bad would it be no way to know not yet he said the blood of the beasts slaughtered for our supper will hold the ghosts at bay if you like grand duke well do some of the butchering outside the keep that your mens encampment may also gain the boon of blood a good thought aragis said do it he was so direct he even used words like soldiers sending forth no more than he needed to carry out his plans might we not broach even one of the jars of wine we have from schild to help us rejoice in this alliance rihwin asked no gerin and van said in the same breath gerin pretended not to see the curious look aragis sent him for quashing the question so quickly he was heartily glad hed taken those jars out of the cellar and hidden them deep under straw in the stables to rihwin he went on ale suffices for the rest of us so it will have to do for you too rihwins pout made him look positively bilious but he finally gave a glum nod duren kept running around the courtyard and in and out of the great hall as if making sure things hadnt changed while he was gone every once in a while his voice would rise in excitement i remember that hed been gone a quarter of a year no small chunk of a fouryearolds life selatre came over to gerin and said hes a promising boy thank you ive always thought so the fox answered i just praise dyaus and all the gods that he doesnt seem to have suffered badly in tassilos cursed hands the minstrel must have reckoned hed need him hale and not too unhappy as a hostage that sparked a thought in him he called his son over and asked how was it that you went away with tassilo when he took you away from here he promised hed teach me his songs and show me how to play the lute duren answered he did too but my hands are too small to play a big one he said he would make me a little one but he never did do that and then to the foxs surprise duren started chanting what tassilo had called the song of gerin at his visit to fox keep he did it better than hed ever sung before he was kidnapped in that at least the minstrel had kept his promise it wasnt remotely enough one of the cooks came out and said lords the feast begins the warriors streamed into the great hall even with chairs and benches brought down from upstairs it was still packed tight fatwrapped thighbones smoked on dyaus altar by the hearth when a servant brought gerin a jack of ale he poured a libation to baivers and the rest of the ale down his throat a serving woman picked her way down the narrow space between benches pulling rounds of flatbread from a platter piled high and setting one in front of each feaster in turn she would have gone faster had more than a few men not tried to pull her down onto their laps or to grab at her as she went past one of them wound up with flatbread draped over his face instead of on the table before him im so sorry noble sir she said very much as if she meant it a cook with a sheeps head on a spit carried it to the fire and carefully started singeing off the wool oh that will be fine when its finished drago said he thumped his thick middle have to remember to save some room for it servants with meat more quickly cookedsteaks and chops and roasted slices of hearts and kidneys and liverscame by and set the sizzling gobbets on top of the flatbreads the feasters attacked them with belt knives and fingers they threw gnawed bones down into the dry rushes that covered the floor dogs growled and snarled at one another as they scrambled for scraps aragis the archer raised his drinking jack in salute to gerin who sat across the table from him youre a generous host lord prince he said we do what we can grand duke the fox replied once in a while for celebration is all well and good if we ate like this every day wed all starve serfs and nobles together long before midwinter rolled around i understand that full well aragis said between war and hunger and disease we live on the edge of a cliff but by the gods its fine sometimes to step back from the edge and make life into what it was meant to be plenty of food plenty of drinkyou brew a fine aleand no worries not for today he raised his jack again then drained it a servant with a pitcher made haste to refill it selatre turned to gerin under the noise of the crowd she said surely theres more to life than a full belly i think so too he said nodding so does aragis no doubt or hed be content to stay in his castle and stuff himself if you ask me hed sooner drink power than ale but then trying to be just he added if you dont have a full belly not much else matters years the harvest fails you find out about that he paused thoughtfully what civilization is i suppose is the things you find to worry about after your bellys full i like that selatre said now she nodded well said van sat at gerins right hand with duren between them hed been talking with fand and missed gerins words selatres brisk statement of approval caught his notice whats well said fox he asked gerin repeated himself van thought it overperhaps a bit more intensely than he might have at other times for hed emptied his drinking jack again and againand finally nodded something to that he waved a big arm in a gesture that almost knocked a plate out of a servants hands you elabonians youve a great many things past farming i give you so much that i do fand rounded on him and what o my own folk she demanded sure and youre not with the southrons who call us woodsrunners and barbarous savages and all are you now now now lass i said nothing of the sort i didnt speak of the trokmoi at all just of the folk of my friend here van answered mildly enough gerin breathed a silent sigh of relief hed seen trouble riding fands question as sure as rain rode a squall line then to his dismay the outlander instead of leaving well enough alone went on though now that you ask me i will say that since i traveled the forests of the trokmoi from north to south id far sooner live here than there more good things to life here taken all in all would you now in the space of three words fands voice rose to a screech that made heads whip around well have some fine elabonian ale then she picked up her drinking jack and poured it over vans head then got up from the bench and started to stalk off snorting and cursing and blinking because the stinging stuff ran down into his eyes van reached out a meaty hand and hauled her back she squawked and swung at him he blocked the blow with his other arm slammed her down into her seat hard enough to make her teeth come together with a loud click here see how you like it he said and drenched her with his jack of ale she cursed him in elabonian and the forest tongue loudly and ingeniously he just sat there grinning which fanned the fires of her wrath go on both of you and dry yourselves off gerin said uncomfortably aware a common role for a wouldbe peacemaker was taking arrows from both sides van may say what he thinks id like to see anyone stop me the outlander put in shut up will you gerin hissed at him before continuing and you lady may agree or not as you judge best but if you drench someone you shouldnt be surprised or even angry to get drenched in return he waited for her to flare back at him but every once in a while logic reached her this proved one of those times aye summat to that she said tossing her head so little drops of ale flew from her coppery hair she looked warily at van quits for now aye for now this time the outlander got up first fand followed him gerin wondered if theyd look for a towel or the nearest bedchamber he laughed a little even if fand wasnt his woman any more he still got involved in her quarrels after a while duren said why arent van and fand coming back i think theyre probably making up their quarrel gerin answered smiling seldom dull around this place is it aragis said he was smiling too more than half in bemusement my keep is more mm sedate by which you mean anyone who doesnt think like you had best not let you know it gerin thought but how the archer ran his holding was his business duren curled up in the space fand and van had vacated and went to sleep gerin ruffled his hair and said somebody finds it dull anyhow he stared down at the little boy still hardly daring to believe he had him back again then raised his jack to aragis in salute returning duren made up for a multitude of the grand dukes sins presently van and fand did return fand looked rumpled the outlander looked smug they both looked surprised when they found duren stretched out where theyd been sitting dont worry gerin said you can have your places back ill take him up to bed he scooped up his son who wiggled and muttered but did not wake selatre drained her drinking jack set it down and brought a hand up to her mouth to cover a yawn im for my own bed she announced ill walk up with you if thats all right your company is better than just all right as you know very well gerin said he lifted duren up as high as he could to keep the boys dangling legs from catching any of the feasters in the head and made his way toward the stairs selatre followed duren sighed again when gerin put him down in the bed they both used duren muttered something but gerin couldnt make out what it was he has the look of you selatre said the fox nodded as he straightened up he has my coloring certainly i suppose his features are mostly mine too gently he pulled off his sleeping sons shoes and tossed them by the side of the bed after what happened i hate to leave him alone even for an instant i dont blame you selatre said but if hes not safe here in your bedchamber where can he be safe the way the world wags now maybe nowhere gerin said bleakly none of us is really safe these days he took a couple of steps over to selatre put his arms around her and kissed her we just have to do the best we can thats all she nodded do you think you could leave him alone long enough to come with me to my little chamber he paused in some surprise before he answered she hadnt invited him to her chamber before after hed given it to her hed stayed out of it not wanting to infringe on the privacy he knew she craved on the other hand the two of them would need privacy from duren now shed grown up with everyone sleeping and doing everything else in one big bed but he hadnt he slipped an arm around her waist i think ill take that chance afterwards though he quickly dressed and returned to his own room wanting to make sure duren was safe was only part of that selatres chamber lay on the south side of the hall and its window faced south light from the moons streamed into the chamber and cast multiple shifting shadows with what lay ahead gerin wanted to think about the moons as little as he could golden math came full first that night passed well enough tiwaz was two days before full ruddy elleb and nothos both one day before all three of them had risen earlier than math and so their rays did much to diminish the one full moons effect from the werenight of five years before gerin knew which of his men were vulnerable to taking beasts shape the two he worried most about were widin simrins sonwhod been just a boy at the time of the werenightand parol chickpea he wondered how parol was down in the serf village widin he locked away in the cellar with the ale the youngster came through that first night unchanged he fretted more over aragis men than over his own for they were an unknown quantity to him he asked the archer which of his men had the were taint but aragis was vague lord prince thats hard for me to answer for my vassals were most of em at their own keeps the night of the werenight the trokmoi hadnt reached my lands yet so we were still at ease afterwards i had more urgent things to worry about than finding out which of my warriors had donned beast shape i just didnt see the need gerin looked down his nose at the grand duke which means were vulnerable now he said in reproof as mild as he could make it no aragis wasnt forethoughtful enough when something had gone he assumed its like would return no more as the next evening approached the one on which elleb and pale nothos would be full and swiftmoving tiwaz and math but one day to either side of it he sent all of aragis men save the archer himself marlanz rawmeat and fabors faburs son out to the tented encampment theyd made if trouble broke out he wanted it well away from the keep to his relief the only comment aragis made was a sensible precaution lord prince the fox sent widin simrins son to his shelter and mewed him up saying if you dont change tonight you probably wont tomorrow but better safewell enclose you then too widin just nodded he knew necessity when he saw it tiwaz came up over the eastern horizon first a day before full and not far from round then as the sun set elleb and nothos rose side by side gerin watched them from the palisade no cries of alarm rent the air the instant the two full moons appeared for which he gave hearty thanks golden math soon followed because she moved through her phases more slowly than tiwaz her bright disk was even closer to a perfect circle than his when all four moons were in the sky and no screams of horror had come from within the keep or from the tents where aragis men sheltered the fox decided he could safely descend and eat supper he d been sensible enough to have plenty of ale brought up before he closed widin in the cellar so washing down his meat would not be a problem aragis who was already gnawing on beef ribs basted with a spicy sauce greeted him with a wave and something not far from a sneer all quiet as the tomb here lord prince seems to me you fretted over nothing gerin shrugged better to be ready for trouble and not have it than to have it and not be ready as happened at the werenight of the four full moons cant quarrel hard with that i suppose aragis admitted he took another big bite from the rib he was holding grease ran down his chin your cooks do a fine job indeed i give you that without any argument glad something here makes you happy gerin answered he waved to one of the kitchen servants for some ribs of his own only thing that bothers me about sitting here some days eating your good food is that we could have been out campaigning already striking at the trokmoi and the monsters aragis said theyll be there grand duke never fear gerin said the servant plopped a round of flatbread on the table in front of him then set atop it several steaming ribs he tried to pick one up scorched his fingers and stuck them in his mouth aragis hid a chuckle behind a swig of ale i thought you were the patient sort lord prince fabors faburs son said slyly a gibe enough to the point to make gerins ears heat i dont know why everyone is praising the food to the skies marlanz rawmeat grumbled theyve cooked it to death and that after i told them and told them i like it with the juice still in it gerin stared over toward the gobbet of meat marlanz was attacking it might have been lightly singed on the outside but juice and blood from it soaked the flatbread on which it lay if marlanz wanted it cooked less he should have torn it off a cow as the beast ran by before he could say as much gerin looked from the dripping chunk of meat to marlanz himself his beard seemed thicker and bushier than it had moments before his teeth extraordinarily long and white and sharp his eyes gave back the torchlight with red glints of their own meat he snarled rrraw meat the backs of his hands grew hairier by the heartbeat your pardon fabors faburs son said his voice rising to a frightened squeak as he slid down the bench away from his friend aragis eyes were wide and staring van started to draw his sword then slammed it back into its sheath gerin understood that hed stopped his own hand halfway to the hilt of his blade unless struck with silver werebeasts knit as fast as they were cut hed seen that to his horror and dismay during the werenight rrrraw meat marlanz said again and growled deep in his throat his voice was hardly a voice at allmore like an angry howl give him what he wants gerin called quickly to the frightenedlooking cooks raw meat and lots of it the men used that as an excuse to flee the great hall gerin hoped one of them at least would be brave enough to come back with meat if not marlanz was going to try getting it from the warriors and women with whom hed sat down to supper a cook staggering under the weight of the haunch he carried on a platter came slowly out of the kitchens he did not bring the meat out to marlanz but set it down between the hearth and dyaus altar and then retreated much faster than hed advanced gerin found himself unable to complain that the fellow had come back at all was enough the fox rose and edged past marlanz whose tongue lolled from jaws that had stretched remarkably to accommodate the improved cutlery they now contained good wolf gerin said in a friendly way as if he were talking to one of the keeps dogs he looked around for those dogs and did not see themtheyd all run outside as marlanz began to change they wanted no part of him gerin didnt either but he had less choice grunting he picked up the platter and carried it over to marlanz he bowed over it as if he were an innkeeper serving up an elaborate repast at some splendid hostelry in the city of elabon indeed his concern for his clients satisfaction was even more pressing than such an innkeepers none of their guests was likely to devour them if displeased with his proffered supper marlanz looked from the dripping haunch to gerin and back again he bent low over the meat and sniffed it as if to make certain no flame had ever touched it then not bothering with the knife that lay on the table by the platter he began to feed that was the only word that seemed appropriate to gerinmarlanz tore off bite after bite with his teeth worked his jaws briefly and gulped down the barely chewed chunks meat vanished from the bone at an astonishing rate gerin hurried back to the kitchens that haunch may not be enough he warned what else have you a cook pointed theres but half a pigs carcass lord prince that we were going to never mind what you were going to do with it gerin snapped some of the doctors down in the city of elabon reckoned eating raw pork unhealthy that as far as the fox was concerned was marlanzs lookout he grabbed the split carcass by the legs and lugged it out into the great hall as he came up to marlanz he realized that the offal from the carcass would have served just as well in the nobles present condition he did not however have the temerity to haul the meat back from the kitchens instead he set it on the table in front of marlanz who began destroying it with the same wolfish singlemindedness hed shown on the chunk of beef he cant eat all that van said as gerin cautiously sat back down you have my leave to tell him as much gerin said go right ahead van sat where he was he was as bold as any man ever born but a long way from a fool fand set a hand on his arm as if to congratulate him for his good sense that surprised gerin who would have expected her to urge the outlander into any fight that came along id have tried fighting him lord prince aragis said his eyes shifting back and forth from gerin to marlanz your way is better though youre sorry to lose so much meat no doubt but youd be sorrier losing men hurt or killed against a werebeast that cant be slainand one whos a good vassal when in his proper shape that last weighed heaviest on my mind gerin said for which i am in your debt aragis said and marlanz will be when he comes back to himself marlanz wasnt quite in full beast shape as he would have been during the werenight of five years before he seemed rather a man heavily overlain with wolf that made gerin wonder if he possessed the full invulnerability werebeasts had enjoyed then some experiments hed found were more interesting to think about than to try and as aragis had said marlanz was a good fellowand certainly looked to be a good warriorwhen fully human the fox wondered if he was going to have to get more meat still to set before marlanz as a werebeast he ate like a wolf little by little though marlanz slowed he glared around at the unchanged men and women watching him then picked up what was left of the pig carcass with mouth and pawlike hands and carried it over to a dark corner of the great hall there he set it down while he heaped up rushes beside it into a sort of nest he lay down in that nest turned himself around a couple of times to accommodate its shape to his and fell asleep i hope he sleeps well gerin said sincerely come sunrise tomorrow hell be a man again selatre giggled and wondering mightily too how he happened to end up on the floor beside halfno less than that nowa dead pig maybe well call him marlanz porkribs rihwin said blithely fabors faburs son sent him a serious look van of the strong arm might possibly do that and have it taken in good part for anyone less imposing such chaffing is liable to be unwise i think youre likely to be right gerin said he too gave rihwin a severe look sometimes rihwin paid attention to such signals sometimes he didnt gerin hoped this was one of the times he did because he might end up very sorry if he got marlanz angry at him i hope that will be our only excitement for the night selatre said even van an incurable adventurer nodded the horrors of the werenight must have burned themselves into his memory for good gerin said ill check and see how widin is doing he went down to the door of the cellar rapped on it and asked are you all right in there widin aye and still in my own shape too his young vassal answered may i come out now i dont see why not gerin answered marlanz rawmeats long since gone were if the fit hasnt hit you by now i dont expect it will tonight he unbarred the door and released widin what sort of beast is he widin asked wolf like most northern werecreatures the fox said actually hes about half wolf and half man right now hes gone to sleep in the rushes guarding some meat like a hound come upstairs to the great hall and you can see him for yourself he led widin upstairs widin gave the sleeping marlanz a wide berth and did not turn his back on him even for a moment that struck the fox as eminently practical a trooper whod drawn palisade duty came to the entrance to the great hall and said lord prince a warrior of aragis wants us to let down the gate so he can have speech with you is he in his own proper shape with no beasts with him gerin asked after a moments thought aye lord he is the sentry answered the moons are so bright nothing could hide neither well let him in then gerin decided he walked out to the gate and told that to the men who worked the drawbridge adding but well raise the bridge again as soon as hes across it into the courtyard here that would mean more work for the men but he did not want to leave the keep open and vulnerable to whatever lurked under two full moons and the other two nearly full down rattled the drawbridge as soon as aragis warrior had crossed it the gate crew hauled it back up again the fellow came over to gerin and sketched a salute lord prince im rennewart forkbeard one of aragis vassals as your man said he was middleaged solidlooking and wore his beard in the oldfashioned style his ekename described whats toward in your camp out there gerin asked youve had a man take beast shape is that it to his surprise rennewart shook his head no its not that oh a couple of the lads are hairier than they have any business being but theyre all still their own selves if you know what i mean we arent worried about em no the thing of it is just a little bit ago we had a man walk into camp naked as the day he was born and a deal bigger hes not one of ours we were wondering if he came from the keep here some kind of way or maybe from your peasant village not far off why do you need to ask me gerin said why not just ask him lord prince the thing of it is he wont talkwont say a word i mean rennewart answered wont or maybe canti dont know which we figured youd know him if anybody did yes i suppose i would gerin said puzzled his holding had a couple of deafmutes but they lived in distant villages and had no reason to show up at fox keep in the middle of the night especially naked he plucked at his beard his curiosity was tickled all right rennewart ill come out and look at him the walk from keep to camp was short enough that the ghosts did not much afflict him before he came to the area protected by the sacrifices aragis men had made most of them were awake either on watch or aroused by word of the strange newcomer we brought him into my tent lord prince rennewart said leading gerin to it and holding the flap wide here he is gerin drew his sword before he went in wary of a trap but the inside of the tent was brightly lit by several lamps and held only some blankets and as promised one naked man sprawling on them ive never set eyes on him before gerin said positively id know him were he from my lands the fellow was almost vans size and just as wellthewed as the enormous outlander he was swarthy and hairy with a beard that came up almost to his dark eyes and a hairline that started just above them who are you the fox asked where are you from the naked man listened with every sign of attentionmute he might be but he wasnt deafbut didnt answer gerin tried again this time in the trokme language the fellow stirred on the blankets but again gave no answer and no real sign he understood we tried that too lord prince with no better luck than you just had rennewart forkbeard said go fetch my companion van of the strong arm gerin said he knows more different languages than any other man ive met rennewart hurried away and soon returned with the outlander listening to the drawbridge go down and up gerin spared a moments sympathy for the gate crew van stared at the naked man with interest like the fox he started off with elabonian and the trokme tongue and failed with both then he used the guttural language of the gradi who lived north of the trokmoi and after that brought no response he spoke in the hissing tongue used by the nomads of the shanda plains those at least gerin recognized van tried what must have been a dozen languages in all maybe more the shifting sounds of his words interested the naked man but not enough to make him say anything past a couple of grunts after a while van spread his hands i give up captain he said returning to elabonian come to think of it i have one other tongue gerin said and addressed the naked stranger in sithonian a language he read more fluently than he spoke it he might as well have saved his breath he can hear rennewart said we saw that aye and hes not altogether mute anyhow the fox agreed but he paused a suspicion growing in him then said maybe what he needs is a jack of ale could you bring him one please rennewart sent him a firstrate dubious look but brought the jack as asked he handed it to gerin saying here you want him to have this you give it to him gerin took the couple of steps that brought him over to the naked man he held out the leather jack smiling invitingly the stranger took it gaped at it but did not raise it to his lips quietly van said its like he never saw one before im beginning to think thats just what its like gerin answered he took back the jack drank from it to show what it was for and returned it to the naked man the fellow drank then clumsily so ale trickled through his beard and dripped on the ground he spent a moment thinking over the taste then smacked his lips and gulped down the rest of the ale he held out the jack to gerin with a hopeful expression gerin pulled him to his feet here come along with me he said and eked out his words with gestures the naked man followed him willingly enough so did van and rennewart both looking curious the naked man jumped when the drawbridge thudded down but went across it with the fox the feasters in the great hall stared at the newcomer gerin hoped van didnt notice fands admiring glance he gave the fellow another jack of ale then took a pitcherful with him as he led the naked man down to the cellar from which hed but lately released widin lured by the prospect of more ale the stranger again accompanied him without protest gerin set the pitcher on the ground as the stranger made for it the fox hurried out of the cellar shut the door behind him and dropped the bar then he went back up to the great hall poured a jack of ale for himself and gulped it down in one long draught all right captain what was that all about van demanded when he thumped the jack down on the table you know something i can see it in your face gerin shook his head come morning ill know something now i just suspect suspect what several people answered in the same breath i suspect i just locked a werebeast in the cellar gerin answered again several people spoke at once aragis loudest and most to the point but that was no beasthe was a man and quite a man he was too fand murmured which drew her a sharp look from van when men go were they take beast shape the fox said filling his drinking jack again if a beast goes were though what would it become a man unless all logic lies and look at this fellownot just at how hairy he was either he had no idea how to be a man he wore no clothes he couldnt speak he didnt know what a cup was for till i showed him as i say well know for certain come morning when we open the cellar door after moonset and see whoor whatis down there aragis shook his head still doubtful but selatre said i like the notion it might even explain how the monsters came to be suppose a female beast turned woman long years ago and a farmer or hunter found her and had his way with her and got her with child come morning shed be an animal once more but who knows what litter she would have borne it could be so gerin said nodding or men as werebeasts might have mixed their blood with females of their beast kind either way youre rightthe get might be horrific its a better guess at how the monsters began than any thats crossed my mind he raised his jack in salute to her cleverness if you conceive by me youll know what youll have lass van said to fand more trouble than id know what to do with i expect she retorted how dyou put a vipers tongue in such a pretty mouth he asked and she looked smug the ale ran out not long after that and no one seemed enthusiastic about going down to the cellar for more not with the stranger down there no one seemed enthusiastic about staying in the great hall either even if marlanz had plenty of raw meat by his side as he slept the kitchen helpers went to their quarters and barred the door everyone else went upstairs gerin made sure the sun was well upwhich meant full elleb and nothos would be well downbefore he went downstairs the next morning even then he went not only armed but ready to beat a hasty retreat he found marlanz rawmeat back in fully human form and just sitting up in the rushes looking mightily confused at how hed got there and even more confused at the pile of wellgnawed pig bones beside him how strong do you brew your ale lord prince he asked funny thoughit must have been a mighty carouse but my head doesnt hurt it wasnt aleit was the moons gerin answered and explained what had happened the night before marlanz stared then slowly nodded and got to his feet im told the same fit came over me only stronger at the great werenight five years gone by i remember nothing of that night either van came downstairs then also armed he grunted in relief to see marlanz without visible traces of lycanthropy then said shall we go down to the cellar and see what your weremans become that required more explanations for marlanz when they were through aragis vassal pulled out his own sword and said lets slay the appalling creature if we can get it out of the keep without fighting ill be just as happy to do that gerin answered marlanz stared then realized he meant what he said you are the lord here he said in tones that implied he was willing to obey even if he wouldnt have gone about things thus himself take a shield off the wall and carry some of those bones of yours in it gerin told him maybe theyll make the thing in the cellar as happy as they made youand you didnt quite get all the meat off them marlanzs stare turned reproachful but he did as he was asked van said what if its still a man down there well find him something else for breakfast gerin replied which had the virtue of making both his companions shut up they went down to the cellar together gerin unbarred the door and pushed it open father dyaus above marlanz said softlya mediumsized black bear sprawled on the dirt floor the beast looked up at them in absurd surprise it did not growl nor did the hair on its back rise it didnt jump up and flee into the dark recesses of the cellar either whats wrong with it van demanded as if he assumed gerin would know and for a wonder gerin did its still got ale coursing through it from last night that was a goodsized pitcher and who knows when in manshape it might have finished he paused then chuckled im glad its a friendly drunk luring the bear upstairs with bones proved easy though it wobbled as it walked i still say we ought to kill it marlanz grumbled as the gate crew let down the drawbridge and the bear staggered off toward the forest we didnt try killing you last night gerin reminded him lucky for you that you didnt marlanz said drawing himself up with prickly pride gerin agreed with him but wasnt about to admit it xi the next night only tiwaz was full with elleb and nothos a day past and math two this time gerin sent marlanz rawmeat down to the cellar and locked widin simrins son in the shack where he worked on his magics to his great relief neither marlanz nor widin changed shape so he released them both when all four moons had risen into the sky the bear that walked like a man did not return to the camp of aragis warriors either in mans form or its own gerin had wondered if a taste for ale would draw it back just as well its staying away said drago a bear himself when gerin remarked on that we dont need a thirsty bear when we have a thirsty fox he sent rihwin the fox a sly look rihwin ostentatiously ignored him late the next afternoon parol chickpea came into fox keep riding in the back of a peasants oxcart by the gods im glad to see you gerin exclaimed when i left you behind there i feared youd never come out of that village again i feared it myself lord but i went were night before last and here look at this parol thrust the hand from which hed lost a couple of fingers under gerins nose i see what you mean gerin said the wound instead of being festering and full of pus looked as if hed had it for years the rapid healing werebeasts enjoyed hadnt been able to restore his missing digits but had done the next best thing somehow the fox doubted it would ever become a popular part of medicine all the same the bite on my arse is better too parol said confidentially but i dont suppose you want to see that as a matter of fact youre right gerin said i wasnt interested in your hairy bum before you had a chunk bitten out of it and im not interested in it now except to see if it makes you sit at a tilt it doesnt by dyaus parol was the picture of indignation till he noticed the smirk gerin was trying to hide he laughed sheepishly ah youre having a joke on me so i am gerin felt embarrassed jokes at the expense of parol were too easy to be much fun to make amends he told the warrior something about which hed just made up his own mind now that weve passed through the little werenight well start the move against adiatunnus and the monsters come sunrise tomorrow parol beamed ah thats very fine lord i owe those horrible creatures something special for all theyve done to me and i aim to give it to them stout fellow gerin said parol was not the best fighting man he had lacking both rihwins grace and cleverness on the one hand and drago the bears indomitable strength on the other but he was not in the habit of backing away from trouble and that covered a multitude of sins the tents in which aragis men had passed the nights since they reached fox keep came down the warriors stored most of them inside the keep bringing along only a few in which they could crowd together in case of rain gerin was less worried about aragis men coming into fox keep than he had been when they first arrived not only had the grand duke shown he didnt intend treachery but enough of gerins troopers had come into the area to put up a solid fight if aragis suddenly changed his mind the force that rolled southwest against adiatunnus and the monsters had more of gerins men in it than aragis leaving fox keep stirred mixed feelings in gerin hope that this fight unlike the ones that had gone before would yield decisive results sorrow at leaving selatre behind and a separate mixture over duren sorrow at leaving him too but also joy that he was there to be left aragis brought his chariot up alongside the foxs you have a good holding here he said plenty of timber streams where you need them welltended fieldsyou must get a lot of work out of your peasants gerin didnt care for the way aragis said that it brought to his mind a picture of nobles standing over serfs with whips to make them sow and weed and harvest maybe such things happened on aragis landhe had a reputation for ruthlessness the fox said they work for themselves as much as they can i dont take a certain proportion of what they raise whether thats a lot or a little i take a fixed amount and they keep whatever they produce above that all very well in good years aragis answered but what of the bad ones when they dont bring in enough to get by after youve gathered your fixed amount then we dicker of course gerin said if my serfs all starve giving me this years dues im not likely to get much out of them next year aragis thought that over then saw the joke and laughed i dont dicker with peasants he said i tell them how its going to be and thats how it is as you say starving them is wasteful but i always remember i come first i believe that grand duke gerin said so innocently that aragis again paused for a moment before sending him a sharp look smiling inside gerin went on i havent had a peasant revolt since i took over this holding and weve been through some lean years especially the one right after the werenight how have you fared there not well aragis admitted but his tone made that seem unimportant when the peasants rise up we knock them down they can t stand against us and they know it theyve no weapons to speak of and no experience fighting either but if theyre going to fight the monsters theyll need more weapons than they have and if they spend a good deal of time fighting the monsters theyll get some experience at that too gerin said aragis gave him a look that said he hadnt thought so far ahead and wished the fox hadnt either after a long silence he answered you must be of the view that solving one problem always breeds another oh not always gerin said blithely sometimes it breeds two or three aragis opened his mouth closed it opened it again and finally shook his head without speaking he tapped his driver on the shoulder gerin was not surprised when the grand dukes chariot dropped back behind his own van laughed a little and said here you went to all the trouble of making an ally of the archer and now you do your best to drive him away i didnt mean to gerin said he sounded so much like duren after hed dropped a pot and broken it that he started to laugh at himself when the dirt road went through the woods it narrowed so that the chariots had to string themselves out single file it was wider in the cleared lands between the forests the cars bunched up again there the peasants working the fields paused to stare as the chariots rolled by some of them cheered and waved gerin wondered what aragis thought of that from all hed said and from all the fox had heard he ruled his serfs by force he was a hard and able man so hed got away with it thus far but was his heir likely to match him only time would answer that gerin noted that a fair number of peasants cultivated their wheat and barley and beans and peas and turnips and squashes with full quivers on their backs as one of them moved down a row he bent picked up his bow carried it along with him and then set it down again herdsmen also carried bows and spears in place of their staves what they could do against the monsters they were doing but an unarmored man even with a spear in his hands was not a good bet against the speed and cleverness the creatures showed the fox saw only one monster that first day of the ride southwest the thing came out of the woods a couple of furlongs ahead of his chariot it stared at the great host of chariotry rattling its way then turned and swiftly vanished back between the beeches from which it had emerged shall we hunt it captain van asked gerin shook his head wed be wasting our time if we can beat adiatunnus well take their refuge away from the creatures thatll do us far more good over the long haul than picking them off one and two at a time sometimes you think so straight you cook all the juice out of life van said but let it go at that as sunset neared gerin bought a sheep from a village through which he passed that provoked fresh bemusement from aragis who like a large majority of lords was accustomed to taking what he needed from his serfs regardless of whether it was properly part of his feudal dues the grand duke also seemed surprised when the fox told some of his warriors to cut firewood rather than taking it from the serfs or putting them to work but he did not question gerin about it and indeed after a few minutes ordered his own men to help those of his ally with all four moons now past full the early hours of the night were unusually dark although the evening was warm and sultry gerin ordered the fires kept burning brightly the last thing i want is for the monsters to take us unawares he said after which he got no arguments the dancing flames kept more men sitting around them and talking than would have happened on most nights after a while drago the bear turned to van and said what about a tale for us to make the time pass by to several of aragis men sitting close to him he added youve never heard a yarnspinner to match him i promise you aye give us a tale then one of those troopers said eagerly and in a moment many moreand many of gerins men as welltook up the cry van got to his feet with a show of shyness gerin knew to be assumed the outlander said i hate to tell a tale now friends for after dragos spoken of me so how can i help but disappoint you never have yet one of gerins men called give us a tale of far placesyou mustve seen more of em than any man alive a tale of far places van said all right ill give you another story of mabalal the hot country where they teach the monkeys to gather pepper for emsome of you will remember my tale about that but this is a different yarn you might call it the tale of the mountain snake even though its really about the snakes head as youll see now they have all manner of snakes in mabalal the plains snake if youll believe it is so big that he even hunts elephants now and again the only time the natives go after him is when hes fighting one of those huge beasts whats an elephant somebody asked gerin knew about elephants but had his doubts about serpents big enough to hunt themalthough he d never managed to catch his friend in a lie about his travels after van explained the warrior whod asked the question was loudly dubious about the elephants snaky trunk though gerin knew that was a genuine part of its anatomy well never mind the outlander said this storys not about elephants or plains snakes anyhow like i said its about mountain snakes mountain snakes now arent as big as their cousins of the plain but theyre impressive beasts too they have a fringe of golden scales under their chins that looks like a beard and a crest of pointed red scales down the back of their necks almost like a horses mane when theyre burrowing in the mountains the sound their scales make reminds you of bronze blades clashing against each other are they venomous gerin asked unlike most if not all of his companions he was in part interested in vans stories for their naturalor perhaps unnaturalhistory i should say they are van answered but thats not why the men of mabalal hunt themin fact itd be a good reason to leave em alone the snakes sometimes grow these multicolored stones in their heads the way oysters grow pearls but these stones are supposed to make you invisible thats what they say in mabalal anyhow there was this wizard there a chap named marabananda who wanted a snakestone and needed an axeman to help him get it he hired me mostly on account of im biggern any three mabalali you could find marabananda wove gold letters into a scarlet cloth and cast a spell of sleep over them then he carried the cloth out to one of the mountain snakes nests the snake heard him comingor smelled him or did whatever snakes doand stuck its head out to see what was going on he held the cloth in front of it and as soon as the mountain snake looked it was caughtsnakes cant blink you know so it couldnt get free of the spell even for a moment down came my axe off flew the head the snakes body back in its burrow jerked and twisted so much that the ground shook just like the earthquake that knocked down the temple at ikos and marabananda he got out his knives and cut into the headand damn me to the five hells if he didnt pull out one of those shiny glowing snakestones i was telling you about im rich he yells capering around like a madman im rich i can walk into the kings treasure house and carry away all the gold and silver and jewels i please and no one will see me im rich uh lord wizard sir says i youre holding the stone now and i can still see you well marabananda says this is on account of im just a dirty foreigner and too unenlightened for wizardry to touch but the mabalali he says theyre more spiritually sensitive and so the magic will work on them he wouldnt listen to me when i tried to tell him different but i did talk him into not trying till dead of night in case he was wrong around midnight off he went he would have had me come with him but id already shown the magic didnt work on me he got to the treasure and van paused for dramatic effect what happened half a dozen people demanded in the same breath the outlander bellowed laughter poor damned fool the first guard who spied him going in where he didnt belong struck off his head same as i did with the mountain snake i guess it goes to show the snakestone not only didnt make old marabananda invisible to the guard it let the guard see something even the wizard couldnt whats that gerin got the question in before anyone else could why that he was a blockhead of course van replied when he didnt come back from his little trip after a bit i figured it had gone sour for him and i got out of there before the royal guardsmen came around with a pile of questions i couldnt answer i dont know what happened to the mountain snakes head after that just like life stories dont always have neat tidy endings by the way the warriors clapped their hands and came up to chatter with van they liked the story fine neat tidy ending or no aragis told him if ever you find life dull at fox keep you can stay at my holding for as long as you like on the strength of your tales alone when van laughed and shook his head the grand duke persisted or if you decide you cant stomach staying with your trokmetempered ladylove another moment the same holds good ah archer now you really tempt me van said but he was still laughing im for my blankets gerin said any man with a dram of sense will do likewise we may be fighting tomorrow and we will be fighting the day after off in the distance a longtooth roared some of the horses tethered to stakes and to lowhanging branches snorted nervously that sound was meant to instill fear it had made gerin afraid many times in the past now though he found it oddly reassuring it was part of the night hed known all his life the monsters higher more savage screeches he found far more terrifying morning came all too soon as it has a way of doing the sun shining in gerins face made him sit up and try to knuckle sleep from his eyes where all four moons had been absent at sunset now they hung like pale lamps in the western sky soon they would draw apart again and gerin would be able to stop worrying about their phases for a whilealthough he promised himself hed check their predicted motions in the book of tables from time to time drivers gulped hasty breakfasts of hardbaked biscuits smoked meat and crumbly white cheese then hurried to harness their horses to their chariots the warriors who rode with them generally older men of higher rank finished their breakfasts while the drivers worked the food was no better but time could be a luxury too as soon as the chariots rolled out of gerins land into the debatable ground south and west of his holding the troopers saw more and more monsters the monsters saw them too their hideous howls split the air the fox wondered if they were warning their fellowsand adiatunnus men in the debatable lands between gerins holding and the territory adiatunnus had taken for himself when the trokmoi swarmed over the niffet brush and shrubs and saplings grew close to the road the barons whod owned that land before had been less careful of it than the fox had with his now most of them were dead or fled gerin claimed much of their holdings but the woodsrunners made his possession too uncertain for him to send woodsmen onto it the first arrows came from the cover of the roadside scrub a little past noon one hummed past his head close enough to make him start he snatched up his shield and moved up in the car so he could hope to protect himself and raffo both keep going he told the driver and waved the rest of the chariots on as well what van said indignantly arent you going to stop and hunt down those cowardly sneaks who shoot without showing their faces no gerin answered his voice flat the unadorned word made van gape and splutter as hed thought it would when the outlander fell silent the fox explained i am not going to slow down in any way shape form color or size not for monsters not for trokmoi thats what adiatunnus wants me to do so hell have more time to ready himself against us i dont aim to give it to him its not manly ignoring an enemy whos shooting at you van grumbled i dont care gerin said which set van spluttering again despite their years of friendship gerin went on i am not fighting this war to be manly im not even fighting it for loot though anything i take from the trokmoi helps me and hurts them the only reason im fighting it is because ill have to do it later and on worse terms if i dont do it now fighting it now means moving as fast as we can we werent quite quick enough the last time we struck at adiatunnus this time the gods willing we will be van studied him some time in silence at last the outlander said me ive heard you call aragis the archer ruthless a time or three if he wanted to hang the same name on you i think itd fit and what does that have to do with unstoppering the jar of ale gerin asked i do what i have to do the best way i can see to do it youd better pass up the little fight if you intend to win the big one put that way it sounds good enough van admitted he still looked unhappy like a man forced to go against his better judgment when somebody shoots at me though i just want to jump down from the car chase him till i catch him and leave him as pickings for the crows and the foxesno offense to youand the flies thats what the trokmoi want us to do gerin answered patiently when you fight a war youre better off not doing what your foe has in mind for you youll have your way here with me or without me van said but then relented enough to add so you know captain you have it with mei suppose with that gerin had to be content by the time his army drew out of range of the archers theyd had two horses and one man wounded by luck none of them badly a small enough price to pay for avoiding delay he thought relieved it was not worse he kept the chariots rolling almost up to the moment of sunset before stopping and sacrificing some of the hens hed brought from fox keep adiatunnus may know were coming he said but with luck he doesnt know well be in his lands so soon we should start hitting him early tomorrow weve made fine time coming down from my keep when the sun set the night was very dark for none of the moons would rise for more than two hours that stretch of evening blackness would just grow over the next several days too till swiftmoving tiwaz sped round to the other side of the sun and began to illuminate the night once more it worried gerin because of the ghosts his men could do little in the night but hed already seen that that did not hold for the monsters he took such precautions as he could posting sentry squadrons all around the main area where his men and aragis rested the archers troopers were inclined to complain about having their sleep interrupted gerin stared them down saying when my warriors come south to your lands well be under the grand dukes commands and he ll make the arrangements he thinks best now the worries are mine and ill meet them in my own way he did not look to aragis for support this too was his worry had the archer chosen to argue with him hed been ready to lose his temper in as spectacularly dramatic a way as he could when he was through dealing with the grand dukes men though aragis got up and said the prince of the north is righthe leads here anyone who doesnt fancy that will answer to him here and then to me after we go south out went the sentries without another word gerin bundled himself in his bedroll and soon fell asleep what seemed like moments later shouts of alarm rang out from the sentries and mixed with them the monsters screams the fox had his helm on his head his shield on his arm and his sword in his hand and was on his feet and running toward the fighting before he fully understood where he was as soon as the situation did sink in gerin realized whoever led the monsterswhether that was adiatunnus or some of the more clever creaturesknew how best to use them instead of attacking the troopers who were armed and at least partly armored and could fight back the monsters turned their fury on the long lines of tethered horses there dreadful din and chaos reigned the horses screamed and kicked and bucked under the savage teeth and claws of their attackers some of them tore loose the lines by which they were tethered and ran off into the night every one that got away would have to be recaptured laterif gerin and his men could manage that at the same time though every horse that fled drew monsters away from the main point of the assault which left the fox unsure how to feel about the flight he had little time for feeling anyhownothing to do but slash and hack and keep his shield up to hold fangs away from flesh and pray that in the darkness and confusion he didnt hurt any of his own men or aragis the fearmaddened horses were as appalled to have men close by them as monsters someone not far from gerin went down with a muffled groan as a hoof caught him in the midsection he stabbed a monster that was scrambling up onto a horses backand leaving long bleeding claw tracks in the beasts flanks the monster howled and sprang at him he slashed it it screamed in pain and fled the hot coppery smell of its blood and the horses filled his nose pale nothos was the first moon over the eastern horizon by the time he rose the warriors had managed to drive the monsters back into the wood from which theyd come put more wood on the fire and start another one over here gerin shouted we have a lot of work to do yet tonight his army was still at it when tiwaz elleb and math rose in a tight cluster a couple of hours after nothos appeared the men went out by squads to bring back the horses that had bolted but that was the smaller part of what they needed to do treating the animals woundsand their panicwas a far bigger job the drivers men who dealt most intimately with their teams did the greater part of the work the rest of the troopers lent what help they could i mislike everything about this gerin said gloomily who knows what the beasts will do when they next face the monsters or even smell them id not yet thought past this night aragis said did we bring enough spare animals to make up for the ones we lost and those hurt too badly to pull a car i think so the fox answered hed been trying to run his own mental count but confusion didnt make it easy he looked at the hairy corpses scattered over the grass we hurt the monsters badly here i dont think theyll try anything like that again the question is was the once enough well know come morning aragis yawned i dont know if well have any wits left by then though im dead for sleep and im for my blanket and i gerin said with a matching yawn one more thing for adiatunnus to pay forand he shall when the sun rose gerin stumbled over to a nearby stream and splashed cold water on his face to give himself a brittle semblance of alertness then he examined the horses the monsters had attacked they looked worse by daylight than they had in the night with blood dried on their coats and matted in their manes with gashes the drivers had missed by the light of moons and fires with mud slapped on the wounds the men had seen he wondered how they would fare when they had to draw the chariots but had no choice he waved for the drivers to harness them because the animals were sore and nervous that took longer than it might have but once they were hitched to the chariots they pulled them willingly enough van drew a clay flute from a pouch on his belt and began a mournful wailing tune that sounded as if it had come off the plains of shanda he assumed an expression of injured dignity when gerin asked him to put the flute away for fear of frightening the horses the border post adiatunnus had set up in imitation of elabonian practice was empty and deserted he must have got wind that gerin was moving against him we move straight on the fox commanded no stopping for loot anywhere until we run up against adiatunnus main force and smash it we havent accomplished a thing but when the army came to a peasant village aragis ordered his chariots out of the road to trample the wheat and barley growing in the fields around it after a moments hesitation gerin waved for his warriors to join the archers i hate to hurt the serfs he said but if i strike a blow at the trokmoi thereby how can i keep from doing it you cant so dont fret yourself van answered you go to war to win you said as much yourself otherwise youre a fool the peasants themselves had vanished along with most of their livestock the army took a few chickens and a halfgrown pig set fire to the serfs huts and rolled on perhaps the next village they came to had planted earlier than the first the wheat and rye growing around it had already turned golden that meant the crops were nearing ripeness it also meant they would burn the warriors tossed torches into the fields near the road watched flames lick across them the serfs would have a hungry winter gerin vowed to himself to work enough destruction in adiatunnus holding to make their trokme masters starve too every now and then a redmustached barbarian would peer out of the woods at the invaders gerin ignored those watchers every man afoot was one he wouldnt have to face in a chariot i want to reach adiatunnus before the sun sets he said grimly spending a night in his lands with the monsters prowling about sets my teeth on edge ah but captain does he want you to reach him van said you ask me thats a different question altogether if he can get the monsters to come out and soften us up again you think he wont do it no i dont think that gerin said but he pays a price if he hangs back too the deeper we penetrate into his lands the more harm we do him and the hungrier his warriors and serfs will be come winter its a nice calculation he has to make can he afford what we will do to him for the sake of what the monsters might do to us tonight you think hell weigh the odds sothis much on this side that much on the other van shook his head vehemently thats what youd do certain sure but adiatunnus hell be watching the sky as soon as he sees so much smoke there that his fighters start screaming at him louder than he can stand hell yell for them to jump into their chariots and come at you whether thats today or tomorrow morning we wont know till we see the woodsrunners drawn up in a meadow athwart our path or better yet till we catch them trying to get across our path the fox said with a ferocious smile but youre likely right if you try to judge what the other fellow would do by what youd do yourself youll be wrong a lot of the time the army moved past the small keep gerin had burned out in his earlier raid the castle at the keeps heart had burned the roof was fallen in and soot covered the outer stonework no one moved on the walls gerin grinned again hed struck adiatunnus a blow there to his surprise the trokme chieftain did not sally forth against him while the sun remained in the sky hed pushed close to the keep adiatunnus had taken for his own and to the woodsrunners village that had grown up around it by the time failing light at last made him halt behind him all the way back to the border of adiatunnus lands lay as broad a swath of devastation as the fox could cut gerins eyes were red with the smoke hed raised his lungs stung every time he breathed when he encamped he treated the horses as if they were pure gold come to life he placed them and the chariots in the center of the camp with the warriors in a ring around them and sentries out beyond the main force that meant spreading his men thinner than he would have liked but he saw no other choice without chariotry what good were the warriors the trokmoi would ride circles around them rihwin the fox said the first of the moons will not rise tonight until even longer after sunset than was so yestereven i know gerin said dolefully and the other three moving more swiftly in their rounds than nothos will have gone farther still and will rise later still he pronounced the words with a certain amount of gloomy relish every now and then he drew perverse enjoyment from imagining just how bad things could be few men sought their blankets right after they ate no one put weapons out of arms reach after one attack on the horses another looked too likely to take lightly twilight still lingered in the western sky when in the black shadows of the woods a monster screamed warriors who had tried to sleep snatched up swords and shields and peered about wildly waiting for a sentry or perhaps a horse to cry out in agony another monster shrieked and another and another soon what sounded like thousands of the creatures were crying out together in a chorus that sent icy fingers of dread running up gerins back damn me to the five hells if i see any way to sleep through this he said to van not when im already on edge looking ahead to battle tomorrow ah its not so bad captain the outlander said when gerin stared at him in some surprise he explained i dont care how loud they scream at us last night we taught em something they hadnt known before else theyd be running out of the woods at us with slobber dripping off their fangs now with all the moons downd be the best time for em to try me i think they dont dare theyre just trying to make us afraid gerin considered all at once the hellish cries seemed less terrifying than they had you may well be right he said and managed a laugh they arent doing a bad job of it either are they its nothing but a great pile of noise van refused to admit fear to anyone most likely including himself we wont stop staying ready for a fight whether you turn out right or wrong gerin said thats the best way i know to make sure we dont have one the hideous chorus kept up all night long and got louder as the moons rose one by one by then though most of the troopers had concluded the monsters were screaming to intimidate rather than as harbinger to an attack those not on sentry did manage to drop off and their snores rose to rival the creatures shrieks gerin didnt remember when he dozed off but he woke with a start at sunrise having expected to pass the whole night awake most of the men were in the same state complaining of how little theyd slept but grateful theyd slept at all the horses seemed surprisingly fresh an attack like the one of the night before might have panicked them but theyd resigned themselves to the monsters screams faster than the warriors who guarded them will we fight today aragis asked rather blurrily his mouth was so full of smoked sausage that he looked like nothing so much as a cow chewing its cud we will gerin said with grim certainty if we dont we penetrate to the heart of adiatunnus holding before noon and torch the big trokme village thats grown up around the keep hes taken for his own he wont let that happen his own warriors would turn on him if he did there youre right aragis said after a heroic swallow a leader who wont defend whats his doesnt deserve to keep it my men will be ready gerin had the feeling the archer primed his vassals for battle by making them more afraid of him than of any imaginable foe but in his own savage way the grand duke got results not half an hour after the chariots rolled out of camp they passed the meadow where gerins forces and adiatunnus had dueled fewer than fifty days before some of the ruts the chariot wheels had cut were still visible grass had grown tall over others gerin had wondered if the trokme chieftain would pick the same spot to defend his lands as he had in the last fight when adiatunnus didnt the foxs anxiety grew fearing an ambush when the road went through the next stand of woods he dismounted several teams of fighting men and sent them in among the trees to flush out any lurking woodsrunners that slowed the rest of the army and the searchers found no one past that patch of forest a broad stretch of clear land opened up meadows and fields that led to adiatunnus keep the trokme village and the meaner huts of the elabonian peasants who still grew most of the holdings food mustered in front of them was a great swarm of chariotry adiatunnus awaiting the attack the fox was luckyhe spotted the trokmoi before they spied his car in the shadow of the woods he ordered raffo to a quick halt then waved the chariots of his force up as tight together as they could go without fouling one another well need to be in line before the woodsrunners can sweep down on us he said the gods be praised they dont look all that ready to fight either my men will form to the left when we burst out into the open aragis to the right i expect well all be mixed together before the day is donethats just a way of keeping us straight when we start may fortune roll with us may it be so several troopers said together gerin thumped raffo on the shoulder the driver flicked the reins and sent the horses forward onto the meadow a great shout rose from the trokmoi when they caught sight of the chariot they swarmed forward in a great irregular wave hardly bothering to shake out into line of battle in their eagerness to close with their enemies look at em come van said hefting his spear if we can get ourselves ready to receive em well beat em to bits even with the monsters running between their cars there they dont care much for tactics do they gerin said well i ve known that a great many years now the trouble with them is they have so much pluck that thats too often what decides things he nocked an arrow and waited for the trokmoi and the monsters to come within range behind him ever more chariots rumbled out of the woods to form line of battle each one drew fresh cries of rage from the woodsrunners gerin saw he had more cars than the woodsrunners did whether theyd all be able to deploy before the fight opened was another question when the trokmoi closed to within a furlong gerin waved his arm and shouted forward at the top of his lungs chariots depended on mobility if you tried to stand to receive a charge youd be ridden down raffo cracked the whip above the horses backs the beasts bounded ahead a chariot wheel hit a rock the car jounced into the air landed with a jarring thump gerin grabbed the rail for a moment his knees flexed to take the shock of returning to earth hed pulled all the way to the left to be on the wing of his own force that also meant he was far away from the track that led toward adiatunnus keep the horses galloped through ripening rye trampling down a great swath of grain under their hooves the foxs lips skinned back from his teeth in a predatory grin every stride the horses took meant more hunger for his foes an arrow hissed past his head adiatunnus hunger was distant something that would come with winter had that arrow flown a couple of palms breadth straighter gerin would never have worried about it or anything else again planning for the future was all very well but you had to remember the present too gerin loosed the shaft hed nocked snatched another from his quiver and set it to his bowstring he shot once more the trokmoi were packed so closely the arrow would almost surely do them some harm he shot again and again half emptying his quiver as fast as he could the rest of the shafts he thriftily saved against more specific targets and urgent need his men had followed him on that wide sweep to the left encircling the trokmoi on that wing had aragis taken the same course on the right the woodsrunners would have been in dire straits but gerins deployment order had left the archer with fewer chariots there and he commanded that wing with a blunter philosophy of battle than the fox employed instead of seeking to surround the enemy he pitched straight into them some of his men kept shooting at the trokmoi while others laid about them at close quarters with sword and axe and mace a monster ran at the chariot in which gerin rode it came at the horses rather than the men and from the right side where van with his spear had less reach than the fox with his bow but the creature reckoned without raffo the drivers long lash flicked out the monster howled and clutched at its face raffo steered the car right past it van thrust his spear into the monsters vitals yanked it free with a killing twist the monster crumpled to the ground and lay kicking a trokme driver whipped his team straight for the fox his car bore two archers both of whom let fly at almost the same time one arrow glanced from the side of vans helmet the other flew between the outlander and gerin gerin shot at one of the archers his shaft also failed to go just where hed intended it but it caught the trokme driver in the throat the reins fell from his fingers he slumped forward over the front rail of the car the team ran wild both of the archers grabbed for the reins they were past before gerin saw whether either one managed to seize them well aimed fox van cried it didnt do what i wanted it to do gerin answered uncomfortable with praise he used bitter honesty to turn it aside like a man trying to avert an omen he didnt care for honh van said it did what it needed to do which is what matters that left gerin no room for argument his hopes built as the battle ground on the trokmoi were ferocious but not all the ferocity in the world could make up for a bad positionand this time hed brought more men into the fight than adiatunnus had the monsters helped even the odds but not enough he spied the trokme chieftain not far away well you robber you asked what id do next he shouted now you see adiatunnus shook a fist at him to the corbies with you you blackhearted omadhaun youll pay for this he reached for his quiver but found he was out of arrows gerin jeered at him he pulled out a carefully husbanded shaft set it to his bow and let fly adiatunnus realized he had no time to grab for his shield so he threw up his arms the arrow caught him in the meaty part of his right upper arm about halfway between elbow and shoulder he let out a howl any monster would have envied the wound wasnt fatal probably wasnt even crippling but he would fight no more today van swatted gerin on the back almost hard enough to pitch him out of the chariot onto his head well aimed the outlander boomed again and again the fox did what he could to downplay praise if that had been well aimed it would have killed him he grumbled the trokmoi tried to slam through aragis men had they succeeded theyd have regained their freedom of movement but aragis chariots were grouped more tightly than gerins and the woodsrunners could not force a breakout when they failed they began falling back toward the cover of their village well roast em like mutton aragis fierce exultant cry rang over the battlefield though the trokmoi still fought back with fierce counterchargesthey were beaten but far from broken gerin waved several chariots with him trying to get between the trokmoi and the haven they sought bad luck dogged the effort an arrow made one of the elabonian drivers drop the reins and the horses freed from control chose to run in just the wrong direction a pair of monsters sprang into another chariot the mad fight that ensued there kept the car from going as hed hoped it would he never did find out why a third car failed to follow but it did that left him with not enough the trokmoi did not have to slow down much to get around the handful of chariots with which he tried to block their path and then he was the one in danger of being cut off and surrounded cursing he shouted to raffo we cant go back so wed best go on forward like an apple seed squeezed out from between thumb and forefinger the fox and his followers fought their way free from the far side of the fleeing trokme force now he was on the right wing of the attack and most of his vassals on the left hed foretold that things would get mixed up in the fight being of an uncommonly orderly turn of mind though he hadnt expected the mixing to include himself he still had arrows left and shot them at the retreating trokmoi some of the woodsrunners had their cars pounding down the narrow lanes between their homes uhoh van said are you sure we want to go after em in there fox whenever van urged caution he had to be taken seriously looks like a good way to get chewed to bits doesnt it gerin said after hed taken a long look at the situation doesnt it just van agreed well get a good many of em and do the rest real harm if we set the place afire but going in there after the woodsrunners you ask me thats putting your prong on the block for the chopper had gerin been undecided before the wince from that figure of speech would have been plenty to make up his mind he waved his arms and shouted for his men to hold up and ply the trokme village with fire arrows a good many trokmoi though were thundering into the village between him and his vassals so only a few of those vassals heard and while he was supposed to be in command of aragis men as well they ignored him when he tried to keep them from pursuing the trokmoi now what lord prince raffo asked as the chariots streamed past gerin looked at van the outlanders broad shoulders lifted in a shrug the fox scowled the only thing he could do that would let him keep his prestige among the elabonian warriors was also the thing hed just dismissed as stupid go on he shouted to raffo if thats where the fight is thats where we have to go aye lord prince raffo said and cracked the whip over the horses backs it was as bad as van had predicted as bad as gerin had thought it would be foundered chariots blocked several of the village lanes robbing the foxs force of mobility the essence of chariotry some of the trokmoi fought afoot side by side with the monsters other men ran into the houses and shot arrows at the elabonians from windows and doors ducking back into cover after theyd shot and quite as fierce as the men were the trokme women it was like fighting dozens of berserk fands they screamed and shouted under their pale freckled skins their faces turned crimson with fury and the veins stood out like cords on their necks and foreheads some threw stones others used bows and swords like their men they werent merely unnerving they were deadly dangerous back curse it back and out gerin shouted again and again well throw everything away if we get stuck in this kind of fighting out and back little by little his men and aragis began to heed him but pulling out of the battle was harder than getting into it had been turning a chariot around in the crowded bloody alleyways of the village was anything but easy too often it was next to impossible gerin wondered if going forward would have cost less than the withdrawal did a lot of the chariots had lost the firepots with which theyd begun the days fighting still before long fire arrows sent trails of smoke through the air as they arced toward the thatched roofs of the trokme cottages the weather had been dry before long the straw on the roofs was blazing more chariots rampaged through the fields outside the village wrecking the crops that still stood after the battle had gone through them through thickening smoke gerin saw trokmoi fleeing into adiatunnus keep do you aim to lay siege to em aragis the archer asked the grand dukes helmet was dented maybe by a stone the edge of the helm had cut him above one eye when he healed hed have a scar like gerins we cant take the keep by storm however much i wish we could gerin answered we dont have the numbers we dont have the ladders and theyd be fighting for their lives we cant starve them out either adiatunnus will have more in his storerooms and cellars than we can draw from the countryside we can send in fire arrows and hope to start a big blaze but thats just a matter of luck aye but we should try it aragis said nonetheless he showed relief that gerin did not intend to linger in adiatunnus country the fox understood that youll want to campaign against the monsters in your own lands as soon as may be wont you as a matter of fact thats just whats in my mind aragis said harvest wont wait forever and id like the woods cleared of those creatures before then if that can be done id not care to harm your campaign by pulling back from here too soon but but i will if you dont pull back on your own hook soon enough to suit me aragis didnt say itgerin gave him credit for being a good ally a better one than the fox had expectedbut he thought it very loudly if it suits you well spend the rest of the afternoon lobbing fire arrows into the keep in the hope of sending it all up in smoke and thenthen well withdraw gerin said well ravage more of adiatunnus lands as we go by your leave well stop at fox keep for a few days to let me set up the defenses of my own holding while im in the south and then ill meet my end of the bargain couldnt ask for fairer than that aragis said though his eyes argued that any departure later than yesterday or perhaps the day before was too late but again he held his peace he recognized necessity and recognized that against it any man struggled in vain the charioteers rode rings around adiatunnus keep howling and shouting louder than the trokmoi on the walls as they sent more fire arrows smoking through the air up on the walls of the keep with the woodsrunners were several monsters gerin hoped they and the trokmoi would quarrel in the tight quarters but had no way to make that happen two or three times thin columns of black smoke rose from within the keep whenever they did gerins men and aragis too cheered themselves hoarse but each time the smoke thinned paled died at last as the sun sank ever lower in the west the fox called off the attack he and his followers drew off toward the northeast back in the direction from which they had come wounded horses and men and monsters still thrashed and groaned and screamed on the battlefield now and again an elabonian chariot would halt so its crew could cut the throat of a horse or a monster or a trokme or so the troopers could haul an injured comrade into their car and do for him what they could once they stopped to camp some of the injured cried out louder in the jouncing chariots than they had lying on the ground their moans made gerin grind his teeth but all he could do was keep on one thing van said as they entered the woods from which theyd emerged to fight we wont have to offer much in the way of sacrifice to the ghosts tonight thats so gerin agreed we gave them blood aplenty today theyll buzz round the bodies the whole night long like so many great carrion flies round a carcassgloating i suppose that all those brave men joined their cold and gloomy world the chariots came out of the woods bare minutes before sunset gerin led them out into the middle of a broad meadow we stop here he declared van i leave it to you to get the first fire going he told off parties to go back to the forest and chop down enough wood to keep the fires blazing all through the night nothos would rise with a third of the night already passed and the other three moons later still that accomplished the fox turned his hand to giving the wounded what help he could as always in the aftermath of battle he was reminded how pitifully little that was he splashed ale on cuts to help keep them from going bad set and splinted broken bones sewed up a few gaping gashes with thread of wool or sinew bandaged men who had ignored their hurts in the heat of action none of what he did brought much immediate relief from pain although some of it he made himself remember would do good in the long run more horses were hurt too he helped the drivers doctor them when he was done with the men the men at least had some idea why theyd been hurt the horses big brown eyes were full of uncomprehended suffering he didnt know whod ordered it but the men had made the same sort of circle of fires theyd built the night before he chose warriors whod slept through the previous night undisturbed for sentry duty and made himself one of them he was tired down to the marrow of his bones but so was everyone else did we win van asked as he replaced the fox for midwatch did we do all you wanted done aye we won gerin said yawning did we do enough yawning again he shook his head and made for his bedroll wait captain van called him back the outlander pointed to the woods from which monsters were coming forth sentries shouts roused the camp swearing men snatched at weapons and armor gerin found his sword in his hand it wasnt magic he just didnt remember drawing the weapon the monsters approached to the edge of bowshot but no closer there arent that many of them gerin remarked as the creatures began a chorus of their dreadful shrieks shriek they did but they made no move to attack after a while the fox said i think theyre trying to put us in fear nothing else but a plague on em says i no matter how they scream im going to get some sleep he raised his voice all save the sentries rest while you can well have warning enough if they truly aim to come after us he rolled himself up in his blanket the monsters hideous outcry kept him awake a little longer than he would have been otherwise but not much not even mavrix the god of wine appearing before him would have kept him awake for long he thought as sleep swallowed him he woke wondering why hed worried about mavrix but shook his head at the pointlessness of that sleepy minds did strange things and there was no more to say about it the monsters were gone that didnt surprise him with sunrise the elabonians could have started shooting at them with good hopes of scoring hits not all the warriors had been able to sleep some of them shambled about as if barely alive how theyd be after another day in the chariot was something about which the fox tried not to think no help for it after breaking their fast on hard bread and sausage and ale they rolled northeast back toward the foxs holding knowing no large force lay directly ahead of them they spread out widely over the countryside doing as much damage to adiatunnus lands and villages and crops as they could with fire and their horses hooves and the wheels of their chariots a victory but not a perfect one gerin had hoped to smash adiatunnus utterly hed hurt the trokme chieftain literally and metaphorically but not enough to seize much of his territory with any assurance of keeping it maybe the monsters had learned not to attack large bands of armed and armored men but they hadnt been exterminatedand adiatunnus lands still gave them haven not enough gerin said under his breath van glanced over to him but did not venture to reply some of gerins vassals peeled off from the main force as they reentered his territory off to their own castles and to protect their own villages most though stayed on the road to fox keep before long theyd be riding south to help aragis and fulfill gerins part of the bargain hed wondered if the serfs would ask him whether hed rid their villages of the monsters for good and dreaded having to tell them no then the army passed through a village the creatures had attacked while he was deep in adiatunnus territory that made him feel worse hed hurt the trokmoi and the monsters but hed been mad to think he could root them out with a single victory he also wondered how much he and his men would accomplish down in the holding of aragis the archer he feared it would be less than aragis hoped but kept that fear to himself whatever the grand dukes misgivings hed come north the fox saw no way to keep from reciprocating not if he wanted to keep his good name the return to castle fox was subdued the victory the army had won did not outweigh the men who would not come back the complete triumph that had eluded the elabonians seeing selatre again squeezing her to him was wonderful but she quickly sensed that past having come home alive and unhurt gerin had little to celebrate that made her shrink back into herself so that she seemed to stand aloof from the chaos in the stables although she was in the middle of it van and fand got into a screaming fight over what business the outlander had had going off to fight the trokmoi he clapped a hand to his forehead and bellowed you tell me not to tangle with them when the only reason youre here is that you stabbed the last woodsrunner daft enough to take you into his bed aye i did that and i had the right of it too for he was of my own folk for all that he was an evilnatured spalpeen to boot she said but you now youre the foxs friend but youre after being my lover so you see van shook his headhe didnt see gerin didnt see either if being fands lover turned van into some sort of honorary trokme by her own argument that gave him a special right to go to war against the woodsrunners fand was seldom long on logic the gods seemed to have given her extra helpings of all the passions instead duren hopped around saying may i go fight too next time father may i please youre raising a warrior there aragis said approvingly so i am gerin answered he wasnt altogether pleased aye any holding on the frontierany holding in the northlandsneeded a warrior at its head but he hoped he would also be able to raise a civilized man lest barbarism seize all the land between the niffet and the kirs and hold it for centuries to come the castle cooks dished out mutton and pork and bread and ale the warriors ate and sought their bedrolls gerin stayed down in the great hall hashing over the fight till duren fell asleep beside him then as he had a few nights before he carried his son upstairs to his bedchamber when he went back out into the hall he found selatre waiting there she said if you were so worn youd gone to bed with your son id have walked back to my room but since youre not he caught her to him thank you for being here when things dont look as good as they might even as he spoke the words he realized he was doing his best to put a good face on the campaign from which hed just returned things looked bloody awful selatre ignored all that she said dont be foolish if you hadnt been there for me id be dead come on she led him back to her chamber he took her with something approaching desperation he hoped she read it as passion but she wasnt one to be easily deceived that she stayed by him when he needed her most was a greater gift than any other she could have given him afterwards he fell into a deep and dreamless sleep when he jerked awake nothos light streamed through the window but not yet golden maths past midnight then but not far past beside him selatre was also sitting bolt upright something is amiss she said her voice sent chills through him for the first time in many days she sounded like the sibyl at ikos not the woman hed come to love but no matter how she sounded she was right i heard it too gerin said he stopped confused heard it felt it alls quiet now but he got out of bed and started to dress so did she i dont know what it was i thought for a moment biton touched me she shook her head i was wrong but it was more than a dream i know that and if it woke you too wed better find out what it was gerin held his sword in his left hand how much good the blade would do against whatever had roused him and selatre he had no idea but it couldnt hurt all seemed quiet in fox keep as he and selatre tiptoed down the hall to the stairs vans snores pierced the door to fands chamber gerin smiled for a moment at that but his lips could not hold their upward curve a few warriors had fallen asleep in the great hall maybe too drunk to seek their proper beds gerin and selatre walked by he looked this way and that shook his head in the same confusion selatre had shown whatever was wrong it lay outside the castle proper he didnt know how he knew but he did outside sentries paced their rounds up on the palisade the courtyard seemed as still as the keep gerin began to wonder if worry and nerves hadnt played tricks on selatre and him at the same time then he heard footfallsslow erratic footfallscoming up from the stables toward the entrance to the great hall stay here he whispered to selatre but when he trotted round to the side of the keep to see whoor whatapproached she followed she was not so close to him as to cramp him if he had to fight so he bit down his annoyance and kept quiet he rounded the corner and stopped dead with a strangled snort of laughter no wonder the footfalls had been as they were here came rihwin gloriously drunk gerin wondered how rihwin managed to keep up his footfalls without falling himself his face bore a look of intense concentration as if putting one foot in front of the other took everything he had in him it probably did gerin turned to selatre in mingled amusement and disgust we might as well go back to bed if this poor sots the worst menace we can find no we stay she said again sounding like the sibyl she had been more is here than we yet know can you not feel it and gerin could a prickling of the hairs at the nape of his neck a tightening of his belly his mouth suddenly dry as dust hed felt like this in the instant when the ground began to shake at ikos when his body gave alarm but his mind hadnt yet realized why the ground wasnt shaking now though he wouldnt have bet rihwin could have told whether that was so nevertheless the feeling of awe and dread built inside gerin till he wanted to run or scream or smash something just to get relief he did none of those things forcing himself to stillness he waited for rihwins staggering progress to bring his fellow fox to him rihwin was so intent on walking he didnt notice gerin till he almost ran into him lord prprince he said thickly and gave such a melodramatic start that he nearly tumbled over backwards mercy lord prince he gasped and then hiccuped now gerin drew back a pace his nose wrinkling feh he said your breath stinks like a vineyard in pressing season mercy rihwin repeated he swayed as he stared owlishly at his overlord standing in one place seemed about as hard for him as walking his face was slack with drink but alarm glittered in his eyes then gerin looked through him instead of at him really hearing for the first time what he himself had said youve been at the wine schild brought us havent you my fellow fox he asked softly hed let his sword trail to the ground now it came up again as if to let the wine out of rihwin mercy rihwin squeaked for the third time i found it buried in the hay when we brought ourhichorses to the stables i broached but two jars merhiccy that is it selatres voice was firm and certain that is what we felt the power of mavrix loosed in this holding gerin wanted to scream at rihwin even in his fury though he remembered the hour remembered the warriors and women and cooks and servants asleep inside castle fox but although he hissed instead of shrieking his fury came through unabated you stupid piggish dolt thanks to your greed thanks to the wine youre going to piss away over the course of the next day youve made mavrix notice us and given him a channel through which he can enter this landand he hates me what shall i do to you for that how could adiatunnus serve me worse than you just did tears ran down rihwins cheeks they glistened in nothos pale light lord prince youre right he mumbled i dont know what came over me i shawsawthe jars there in the straw and it as as conshuconsuming fire blazed all through me i had to drink or die even sozzled he spoke with elaborate southern phrasings thats the fanciest way to call yourself a noaccount worthless drunkard i ever heard gerin said in disgust selatre set a hand on his arm she still used that gesture seldom enough to command attention when she did wait she said there may be more truth in what he says than you hear perhaps mavrix inflamed his soul as he put it to open the way for the god to make his presence felt in the northlands once more it could be so lord prince rihwin exclaimed eagerly though the lord of the sweet grape expunged all sorcerous ability from my spirit he left intact my knowledge not that you havent tried to drown it in aleand now wine gerin snarled still anything but appeased i deserve that rihwins voice was full of drunken earnestness but it is as your gracious lady said were mavrix to seek entry to your holding i am just the sort of inshtinshinstrument he would employ he smiled in triumph at finally forcing out the difficult word all right it could be so gerin said grudgingly shall i thank you for it great dyaus above im still trying to figure out whether we can survive it as i said as you know the god loves me not nor you either rihwin hung his head that is true the god has his purposes and we have ours selatre said he will accomplish his come what may we cant say the same worse luck what we have to seek is a way in which the gods purposes are met and ours as well and having found it coax him into accepting it gerin looked at her gratefully put that way it might almost be done but in the back of his mind he heard or thought he heard the god laughing laughing xii redeyed and yawning gerin told the tale over breakfast the next morning to those who had been lucky enough not to sense the coming of mavrix in the night beside him sat selatre also yawning he was glad to have her there for without her confirmation he doubted whether aragis or van to say nothing of the rest would have believed him but at the same time he worried for she sounded once more like biton s sibyl not like his woman he shook his head bemused having lost elise to a horseleech would he lose selatre to a god aragis snapped him out of his reverie the grand duke might not have been much for the long view but he had a supremely practical grasp of the moment all right lord prince mavrix is here among us whether we like it or not he said what do we do about it can we turn it to our own purposes igerin glanced at selatrewe that is think we may have found a way one reason he was redeyed was that he and selatre had spent the last part of the night talking over that very question he sighed he didnt like the answer theyd come up with we are going to evoke the god to bring him fully into the world here and bargain with him are you daft fox van burst out mavrix he hates you bring him fully here and you just make it easier for him to squash you flat this is the course of which you spoke when we met in the southern marches of your holding a desperate one if you ask me aragis said but past that he did not try to dissuade gerin mavrix was not angry at him and if the sithonian god of wine did destroy the fox in some lingering interesting and creative way no one would be better positioned to take advantage of it than the grand duke gerin tried to answer both men at once mavrix will come whether we want that or not if we try to stand against it hell find more reasons to be angry if we aid his path we may satisfy him and still accomplish what we want if not we still may be able to control him he looked at selatre again she nodded voice hesitant at first she said at the same time as lord gerin evokes mavrix ii shall try to bring into the world biton my former patron my formerbridegroom even with her swarthiness her cheeks darkened in embarrassment but she went on biton the farseeing is a god of order of forethought the opposite of most things mavrix stands for and biton is old in the northlands old his power is rooted here not newcome like mavrixs it may be that he can keep the lord of the sweet grape from the excesses that can accompany his rite but lass van said gently after what befell at ikos will the god hearken to your evoking selatre bit her lip shed asked the same question just as morning twilight began to paint the eastern horizon with gray i don t know she answered the only way to find out is to make the attempt what if biton wont come when you call him aragis said what then then were left with mavrixundiluted gerin said after a moment seeking the right way to put it wed be no worse off than if we didnt try to evoke biton at all no better off either his mind jeered but he resolutely ignored his own gloomy side aragis stuck out his chin i insist that you dont seek to bring the gods into the world until you fulfill your half of our agreement if they wreak havoc on you ill also suffer on that account but if we can persuade them to do as wed like we might be able to rid the land of monsters without any more fighting gerin said have you thought on that grand duke not just driving the creatures back into the woods so theyre a lesser nuisance but actually being rid of them for good and all we cant make that happen were mere mortals but the gods can do it if they will a risk aye but if things go as we design besides which thanks to rihwin mavrix is already loose in the land remember van said he can make mischief any time he chooses sometimes the best way to keep someone from moving on you is to move first your own self rihwin aragis eyed gerin with your name for being clever lord prince i cant believe you sent that sot to me as ambassador where is he anyhow still drunk asleep in his bed i suppose gerin answered as for the other theres something in what you say but less than you think hes brave and clever enough when hes sober if short sometimes on common sense but every now and then thingshappenwith him he spread his hands as if to say rihwins vagaries baffled him too aragis hawk face was not made for indecision scowling he said all right fox i dont see how i can stop you short of war here but this i tell you now it had better work that i already know gerin answered for my sake for your sake for the northlands sake it had better workwhich is no guarantee it will all right aragis said heavily as if with his warning he washed his hands of whatever might result from the evocation when do you begin your wizards work at noon gerin said which made the grand duke gape noon is bitons hour selatre added the time when the sun sees farthest mavrix is strongest by night when his impassioned votaries cry evoii whatever chance his lesser strength by day gives us we ll gladly take besides gerin said by noon rihwin will be upor ill drag him out of bed one well need him in this business too the gods help you aragis said a sentiment with a multitude of possible meanings even by noon rihwin the fox was not a happy man his face was pasty and his eyes tracked with red by the way he kept blinking in the sunshine he found it much too bright to suit him i dont see why youre making me carry the jars of wine to your shack he grumbled petulantly because if it hadnt been for you we wouldnt have to be trying this gerin answered his voice hard as stone since the fault is yours you can bloody well play the beast of burden he brayed like a donkey rihwin flinched selatre had laid an assortment of growing things on a makeshift stone altar in the shack flowers fir cones ducks eggs we wont want to summon mavrix solely as god of wine but also as the god of increase generally she said that may make him more restrainedor of course it may not among the flowers she set the scroll that held a book of the sithonian national epic by the great poet lekapenos mavrix also inspires the creation of beauty as weve noted as youve noted you mean gerin said most of this was your idea youre the one whos studied mavrix of late till that wine came into the holding i was happy pretending he didnt exist he turned to rihwin set that last jar down over therecarefully dont crack it rihwin winced when you shout like that you make my head feel as if its about to fall off after a reflective pause he added i rather wish it would remember that the next time you try to drown yourself in a wine jar or even one full of ale gerin said without much sympathy he drew his dagger cut through the pitch that sealed the stopper of one of the wine jars and then worked in his knife blade and levered out the stopper the sweet bouquet of wine wafted from the jar gerin sighed with relief hed worried that the wine jar or even both surviving jars might have gone to vinegar had they been bad he didnt know what he would have done drawing some of rihwins winesoaked blood didnt seem like the worst idea in the world gerin dipped up two cups of wine one for himself the other for rihwin dont drink yet he growled as he handed rihwin his he looked over to selatre and went on i still think we might be wiser to call on biton first then his presence will also serve to check mavrix but she shook her head as she had ever since they began planning the evocation biton has little reason now to hear any summons from me but if i call on him with mavrix already here simple jealousy may help to lure him whatever the lord of the sweet grape seeks the farseeing one is likely to want to thwart you served the god you know him best gerin said yielding yet again he and after a moment rihwin with him approached the altar and poured a small libation being careful not to mar the scroll of lekapenos thank you for your bounty of the sweet grape lord mavrix gerin declaimed in halting sithonian and sipped from his cup of wine rihwin also drank his eyes widened he suddenly seemed several years younger or at least less worn thank you for the sweet grape lord mavrix he said and then to gerin in more ordinary tones nothing like letting a small snake bite you to ease the venom of a big one rihwin your trouble is that you dont know how to keep any snakes small gerin said just to irk rihwin he waved the southerner to silence not giving him a chance for a sharp retort be still i am going to summon the god he walked over to the altar raised his hands high and said i summon you to my aid lord mavrix i who have drunk your wine i who have met you in days past i who am but a mere mortal imploring your assistance i who am weak he humbled himself without shame measured against the might of a god any mortal was weak the litany went on and on gerin began to wonder if mavrix would let himself be evoked the sithonian god of wine had some of the deviousness of the principal folk that worshiped him he might appreciate the irony of forcing gerin to summon him and then refusing to appear if that happened the fox intended to drink as much wine as he could hold and then ride south with aragis but just when he became certain mavrix had indeed set him up to fail the god appeared in the crowded little shack somehow without making it more crowdedgods had their ways mavrixs features were regular exceedingly handsome and more than a little effeminate the god wore sandals and a fawnskin robe and had a leopardskin tunic draped over his shoulders in his right hand he carried a green leafy wand tipped with ivory a faint odor of grapes and of something else harsher rankerperhaps old bloodrose from him his eyes were not like a mans eyes they were two black pits that reflected nothing when gerin looked into them he felt himself falling through infinite space down and down and down he needed a great effort of will to pull his senses back from those twin pits and say in a shaken voice i thank you for granting me your presence this day lord mavrix he knew hed just made a hash of the sithonian grammar which was likely only to win the gods contempt but it couldnt be helped not now mavrix looked atand throughhim he felt himself pierced by the gods gaze almost as if by a sword in a voice in perfect keeping with his appearance mavrix said pleased are you pleased the vengeance i owe you you should be quaking like an aspen leaf in a gale i moved schild stupidstaff to give you wine in hope it would let me come here and take that revenge and you are pleased selatre started her petition to biton then gerin heard her speak of her own unworthiness to summon the god who had abandoned her and then forgot about her if he didnt give mavrix all his attention he would be ruined past any hope of bitons redemption gesturing toward the altar and the various gifts it contained gerin said if you so badly wanted your revenge lord mavrix these would have brought you here did you truly need the gift of wine aye for two reasons the god replied first now that you have summoned me into the world at this place i can act here more fully than i could otherwise and second while first fruits and such are mine wine is mine if you take my meaning when i am called by wine i am more truly myself than if evoked in any other way by which you mean you can be vicious without regretting the consequences blaming them instead on the strength of the wine rihwin said you silence worm mavrix said and although rihwins lips continued to move no more sound came from them it was an effect gerin had often wished he could achieve to gerin the lord of the sweet grape said quite conversationally youd think hed learn his lesson wouldnt you and yet having fallen foul of me once he persists in risking my wrath yet again as do you i might add and you are less a fribbler than he why is this gerin did not directly answer that instead he pointed to the book of lekapenos he had set on the stone you are not god of wine only lord mavrix you are also patron of beauty and cleverness is this not so he was remembering more sithonian than hed thought he had in him mavrix drew himself up to his full height which was much more than a mans yet somehow did not break through the ceiling of the shack no one would deny it little man but you did not answer my question and not answering a god is yet another capital crime to set against you he gestured with his wand it looked innocuous but in his hands it was a weapon more fell than any spear or sword in the grip of the boldest fiercest fighter gerins mouth went dry he knew the power of that wand forcing his voice to steadiness he replied lord mavrix i had to answer in a roundabout way truly i know your role in inspiring the folk of sithonia to the peak of artistic endeavor they once enjoyed the reason i summoned you lord is that ugliness now blights the northlands if you look about here if you see it i pray you to banish it for aesthetic reasons if no others seldom have i seen a fish wriggle on a hook as you do the god said petulantly very well i shall look his eyes lighted for a moment gerin saw in them shifting scenes of the monsters depredations then they became deep pools of blackness once more he sneered at gerin ugly they are but what of it you savages in these cold grapeless lands treat each other as vilely as the monsters use you why should i care what they do before gerin could answer selatre let out a gasp of startlement and delight and biton manifested himself in the shack again it somehow accommodated him without growing and at the same time without seeming crowded gerin had wondered how the farseeing god would appear whether as the handsome youth of the pediment reliefs on his overthrown shrine or the more primitive image that was mostly eyes and jutting phallus to him biton seemed now the one thing now the other depending on which was uppermost in his own mind at any given moment selatre gasped thank you farseeing one for hearing the prayer of your former servant who reveres you still loyalty is rare enough to deserve notice biton answered in a voice that held the same slight rustic accent as selatres the more so when it is retained even after it can no longer be returned mavrix stared at biton with undisguised loathing his features shifted with divine celerity to suit his mood turning to gerin he sneered if you think summoning this boring backwoods bumpkin of a deity will somehow save you i urge you to disabuse yourself of the notion thats not why i called on him gerin answered he bowed to biton and said farseeing one the sibyl begged your presence here for the same reason i evoked mavrix lord of the sweet grape to beg you to help rid the land of the monsters now infesting it as they sprang from the caverns beneath your fallen fane i dared hope you might consider them in some small measure your responsibility lord i beg you to look about selatre added and see the destruction and disorder these monsters spread wherever they go as mavrix had biton looked sometimes gerin saw his head revolve on his neck in a manner impossible for mere flesh and blood while at other instants what he perceived was a basalt stele spinning in either case though biton unquestionably had eyesor at least an eyein the back of his head when his image settled he said this is most distressing it seems the sort of chaos this foreign mountebank might favor with an arm or with that phallus he pointed at mavrix i mavrix twisted in indignation so that his leopardskin cape swirled gracefully about him gerin could not imagine him doing anything ungraceful but hed seen in previous encounters with mavrix that the god had a temper mavrixs smooth voice turned into an angry screech mountebank is it id think these monsters more your stylebarbarous creatures they fit only for a barbarous land and after all they haunted the caverns under your shrine if you despise them so why didnt you get rid of them i suppose you lacked the power he sneered dismissively biton suddenly seemed wholly human to gerin perhaps the stone pillar that was his other guise could not properly express his wrath they are not my creatures he bellowed in a voice that reverberated through gerins head like the deep tolling of a great bronze bell my temple blocked them from coming forth and inflicting themselves on the upper world in the caverns they were part of nature not a blight upon it but when i saw the shrine would fall farseeing one indeed mavrix interrupted sneering still if it took you so long to notice that you arent much of a god at least my senses arent blinded by drunkenness adultery and incest biton retorted primly half the time you dont even know what you see the rest of the time you dont care both gods started screaming gerin clapped his hands to his head but it did no good he was hearing mavrix and biton with his mind not his ears and they kept on dinning just as loud as before father dyaus protect us rihwin mouthed silently dont invite him too gerin exclaimed arent two squabbling gods enough to satisfy you he wanted to run but he didnt think that would do any good either if biton and mavrix went at it with everything they had the whole of the northlands might not be big enough to hold a safe haven hed hoped evoking both of them at once would help keep them under control instead it seemed to be inflaming them i thought this scheme mad from the outset rihwin moved his lips exaggeratedly and eked out his words with gestures so gerin could not mistake what he meant you are sorcerer enough to evoke the gods but not enough to make them do your bidding once here better you should never have tried he clapped a hand to his forehead at that moment gerin would have been hardpressed to argue with him mavrix thrust his ivorytipped wand at biton faster than thought the farseeing god was stone again and knocked the wand aside with his phallus mavrix howled in pain biton anthropomorphic once more laughed in his face mavrix stuck out a tongue longer and pinker than a human could have had some philosophers called the gods men writ large gerin was reminded of nothing so much as small squabbling boys writ largebut these small boys had superhuman strength and power i should have listened to aragis and waited gerin groaned you should have listened to someone rihwin mouthed with mavrix distracted he was faintly audible youre always so splendid at deducing what everyone else should do but when anyone makes a suggestion to you do you heed it ha in case his fellow fox hadnt caught that he repeated himself ha that held enough truth to sting gerin had always relied on his own judgment because hed found none consistently better more often than not his judgment had served him well but when he made a mistake he did not commonly content himself with a small one oh shut up he growled nonetheless as if youve proved yourself worth listening to over the years rihwin gave back a gesture much used by street urchins in the city of elabon next to the way the gods were behaving the argument between the two men seemed downright sedate mavrix used the same gesture rihwin had and stuck out his tongue again to boot still in human guise biton lifted his robe and waggled the phallus whose stone version had parried the fertility gods wand mavrix laughed scornfully ive seen mice with more than that for one thing youre a liar for another who cares what youve seen biton retorted id sooner look at things of consequence than the private parts of mice id sooner look at things of consequence than your private parts the lord of the sweet grape said with another nasty laugh he went on some seeker after consequences you are too if you couldnt even tell your own chief temple was about to be overthrown what is the blink of an eye against the great sweep of time biton said the temple at ikos stands for centuries yet to come am i to be condemned for failing to notice the brief interval in which it is downfallen under less harrowing circumstances gerin might have found that interesting or even hopeful if bitons temple at ikos was to be rebuilt that argued some sort of civilization would survive in the northlands his own survival however seemed too problematic at the moment for him to take the long view he usually favored now that you mention it yes mavrix answered perhaps your true image should have a patch over that third eyeand one of the other two as well id almost welcome such biton snapped if it meant i did not have to see all the hideous things your monsters are working and shall work in this land theyre not my monsters mavrix screeched are you deaf as well as blind theyre not my monsters not not theyre hideous and ugly and revolting and what they do is enough to make anyone with a dram of feeling puke right onto his shoes thus what mavrix spewed forth had a bouquet richer than that of any wine gerin had ever knownanother area where gods enjoyed an advantage over men not long before mavrix hadnt cared what the monsters were doing inand tothe northlands gerin though hadnt blamed the god for them now that biton had blamed him he resented that more than he enjoyed making gerin squirm and if gerin could bend mavrixs course even a little lord mavrix if you despise the monsters so you could easily show lord biton they have nothing to do with you by driving them out of the northlands he said be quiet little man mavrix said absently and gerin was quiet as rihwin had been before him he had no choice in the matter he exchanged a look of despair and alarm with selatre it had been worth a try but not all tried succeeded biton said ah lord of the sweet vomitus so you do claim the creatures for your own i do not mavrix screamed in a voice that should have knocked fox keep flat here i shall prove it to you he sucked in a theatrically deep breath puffed out his cheeks and turned purpler than any man could gerin thought of a divine frog with skin the color of wine after that tremendous effort the god exhaled hard enough to make gerin stagger there theyre gone look all over the northlands unseeing one and you shall find not a single one of the disgusting creatures coming from you drunken fool any assertion requires proof biton growled as it had before his head began to spin independently of his bodyor alternatively the stone pillar that was his body turned round and round suddenly he stopped and stared contemptuously at mavrix youre as slovenly a workman as i might have guessed look there something glinted for a moment in mavrixs fathomless eyes well so i missed a couple of them what of it he gestured now they are here no more do you see they are not mine biton continued his surveillance his whirling head abruptly halted once more and again you must in truth be the god of drunkenness for youre sloppy as a drunkard look over yonder now gerin wondered what sense biton used to find the monsters how he indicated to mavrix where over yonder was and how mavrix turned his own senses in that direction whatever it was he also wondered just how mavrix was getting rid of the monsters and where they were going were he a god he supposed he would know as a man he had to go on wondering all right those are gone too mavrix stuck out his froggy tongue at biton again now do you see any more lord with the eye in the back of your bum biton spun and searched a moment later he said triumphantly aye i do you sozzled neerdowell what of those mavrix must have stretched his senses in the direction the farseeing god gave him for he said and they are vanished too and so am i even with these few drops of wine to ease the path for me here the northlands are a place id sooner leave than come to he fixed his black black eyes on gerin clever manyou were right there are things uglier than you and your kind who would have thought it with that he vanished gerin found he could speak again being a politic man the first thing he said was i thank you lord of the sweet grape and bless you as well then he turned to biton farseeing one may i ask a question of you when the god did not say no he went on did mavrix truly rid the northlands of the creatures that dwelt so long under your temple he waited nervously lest mavrix hear him and return in wrath at having his power questioned but the lord of the sweet grape evidently had been only too glad to leave the northlands for good biton started to nod then searched once more when he stopped he looked annoyed that winesoaked sponge of a sithonian god is too inept to deserve his divinity he said the fox took that to mean a monster or a handful of monsters still survived somewhere in the northlands he wondered if mavrix had left behind the cubs hed sparedand if he would ever find out in his humblest tones he went on lord biton would you be generous enough to complete what the lord of the sweet grape began to his dismay biton shook his head i do not see myself doing that the farseeing one said it is a task for men if they so choose no my duty now is to restore ikos to what it was before the earth trembled beneath my shrine everything there shall be as it waseverything the temple shall stand again without the agency of man and the sibyl shall be restored to her rightful place there to serve as my instrument on earth he gazed fondly at selatre she looked from the god to gerin and back again her voice trembling she said but lord biton i no longer qualify to serve you in that way in your last prophetic verse you yourself called me an oracle defiled since that day i have known the embraces of a manshe glanced nervously toward gerin once moreand my courses have begun i am no longer a fit tool for your work everything shall be as it waseverything biton repeated if i can rebuild my fane from tumbled stones do you think i have not the power to restore your maidenhead to make you a fit vessel for my voice selatre looked down at the ground i am certain you have that power lord biton she murmured gerin wished desperately for some way to attack biton but could imagine none unlike mavrix the farseeing god could not be duped into losing his temper not by a man he was far less vulnerable to earthly concerns than the earthy lord of the sweet grape the fox stared over at selatre of course she would choose to go back to the god how could she not she had been consecrated to him since she became a woman had served him as sibyl since her predecessor died sibyl was all shed wanted to be shed resented being rescued from her residence by the temple after the earthquake she hadnt been able to abide even the touch of a man for a long time after she was rescued true shed come to love him and he her but what was that brief brightness when measured against the course for which her life had been designed now that she had the chance to return to that course how could he blame her if she chose to take it truth was he couldnt having her go back to ikos would tear him worse inside than hed been torn when elise left him no matter what hed felt about elise shed no longer cared for him else shed not have gone but he knew selatre loved him still as hed come to love her only being certain she would be happier back at ikos let him bear up under the thought of losing her even with that certainty it was hard hard biton turned his farseeing eyes on selatre you say nothing are you not honored are you not pleased that all shall be restored even as i speak to you the shrine at ikos returns to its proper state it awaits your coming of course i am honored lord biton she answered very softly whether i am pleased lord have you the power to see what might be as well as what shall be for a moment biton seemed a stone pillar to gerin and altogether unfathomable then he resumed his human appearance even for me a god this is difficult he replied his voice troubled so many paths branch off from the true one and then from one another that losing oneself grows quickly easier the farther ahead one seeks to see why do you ask because i would have you look down the path i would choose for myself selatre said you are a god if you wish your will to be done done it shall be how can i who shall live for a little and then die oppose it but she did not go on even thinking of declining an honor a god would confer on her took something special in the way of courage it also filled gerin with hope as wild and desperate as his despair had been a moment before bitons head began its boneless spin this time it did not just revolve but also grew misty so gerin could see the far wall of the shack through it the farseeing god searched for what seemed a very long time now and again he would almost disappear altogether gerin started when biton fully returned you may live your life as you will the god told selatre my sibyl is my bride not my slave i shall mark another one who will be willing to serve me i shall not tell you what may spring from your choice but i say this as with any other make the best of it and a word of warningfor mortals there is no such thing as living happily ever after i know that lord biton thank you i will try to make the best of it selatre started to prostrate herself to the god but biton disappeared before her knees could touch the ground she and gerin and rihwin stared at one another dazed i think we may have won gerin said in a voice that sounded disbelieving even to him then he remembered something more important to say than that he turned to selatre thank you ill try never to make you sorry for choosing me over over for one of the few times in his life words failed him shed known what she was giving up at last huskily he managed i love you ive noticed that she said and smiled at his startled expression its why i chose to stay with you after all you love me while for biton id just beoh not a tool not quite maybe something more like a favorite pet its not enough not now that ive known better her own voice went soft and i love you which did mm enter into my thinking she smiled again this time with a touch of mischief rihwin said we have two jars of the blood of the sweet grape here waitingindeed all but cryingto be drunk in celebration of our triumph how right you are my fellow fox gerin picked up the jar theyd opened to summon mavrixand poured it out over rihwins head the redpurple wine splashed him and selatre too but it drenched rihwin which was what hed had in mind the southerner spluttered and squawked and flapped his armswhich just splattered the wine more widelyand rubbed at his eyes gerin didnt doubt they stung fiercelyand didnt regret what hed done either a waste a criminal waste rihwin said sucking at his mustache so as to swallow every precious drop he could had it not been for my winebibbing we would not have seen the northlands freed from the vicious and horrible curse of the monsters had it not been for your winebibbing gerin said grimly we wouldnt have had to put our fate in the hands of two gods one of whom was already angry at me and the other ready to get angry because id taken his voice on earth as my woman aye it turned out well thats not why i gave you the one jar of wine as i didit was for forcing us to take such a dreadful chance he picked up the other unopened jar because we succeeded this one is yours to do with as you will rihwin bowed dripping still you are a lord among lords my fellow fox what i am is bloody tired of having to worry every moment of every day gerin said the gods willinga phrase that took on new and urgent meaning after the evocationill have maybe three days of peace now before the next thing whatever it is goes horribly wrong come on lets tell aragis and the rest what weve done here today along with van and fand and drago and marlanz and faburs aragis the archer stood at what gerin thought of as a safe distance from the shack the word was a misnomer of course had the gods truly released their wrath nowhere in the northlands would have been far enough from fox keep to escapeas the monsters had discovered everyone pointed and exclaimed when they came forth fands voice pierced through the rest did the sot spill the wine and wreck your magic now not a bit of it gerin answered we summoned the gods and the monsters are no more that raised the hubbub quite a bit higher than it had been van said but how can it be captain you only just went in there what are you witstruck gerin demanded we were in the shack an hour at least more likely two he looked to selatre and rihwin for confirmation they both nodded without a word aragis pointed up into the sky gerins eyes followed the track of the grand dukes finger toward the sun he had to look away blinking but not before his jaw dropped in astonishment by the suns place in the sky a couple of minutes might have passed but no more i dont understand it he said but i was telling the truth too i suppose the bigger truth is when you treat with gods you can t expect the world they know to be the ordinary one we usually live in aragis said i think you had better tell me in detail all that came to pass in there i warn you i am not satisfied with what you have said so far it strikes me as likely to be a ploy to keep from having to honor your share of our terms of alliance are you saying the monsters are simply gone thus he snapped his fingers lets go into the great hall and broach some ale and ill tell you everything i remember gerin said rihwin held out the jar of wine gerin had given him no lets share this he said as mavrix is part of the tale so should he also be part of the explanation that made sense but hearing it from rihwin surprised gerin for his fellow fox to share wine he could have kept for himself was not far from a revolution in human nature and confirmed that something extraordinary had indeed happened inside the hut divided among so manyand with a libation to the lord of the sweet grapethe one jar of wine did not go far but gerin savored every sweet drop when hed evoked mavrix hed hardly tasted what hed drunk aided by selatre and the winesoaked rihwin he explained everything that had passed in the hut when he was done van said some of the yarns ive told are wild but i hand it to you captain that beats em all thank youi think gerin could rely on his friend to believe him aragis the archer was something else again gerin eyed the grand duke with some concern wondering how he would react aragis jaw worked as if he were chewing over the tale gerin had told at last he said it fits together well enough i give you so much but how am i to know whether its the truth or just a clever tale to get me out of your hair send a team down to ikos selatre suggested if they find no monsters on the way and discover bitons shrine restored youll know we have not lied its not a long journey four days five at the most will get your men to the temple and back then you wont have to guessyou will know aragis jaw went up and down again after a moment he dipped his head to selatre my lady that is a fine thought we would not have left here much before my men could return from ikos in any case ill do as you say though ill send more than one team south on the off chance youre mistaken he was too courteous to suggest straight out that she was lying but left the implication in place once his mind was made up he was not a man to waste time four chariots fared south toward ikos that afternoon gerin gladly gave them supplies for the journey he was confident about what theyd find there he went to sleep that night wondering where the last of the monsters the ones mavrix had missed still lurked in the northlands were they the cubs hed spared solve that riddle and youd deserve undying praise the world being what it was you probably wouldnt get it but youd deserve it two days later the lookout in the watchtower blew a long blast on his horn and shouted lord prince chariots approach out of the southwest gerin frowned it was too soon for aragis men to be coming back and the southwest the sentrys voice cracked in excitement as he added lord prince theyre trokmoi the fox cupped his hands and called up to the sentry how many chariots are we invaded that would be a mad thing for adiatunnus to try but just because a thing was mad didnt mean it couldnt happen no invasion lord prince the sentry answered much to his relief theres just a handful of them and theyre showing the striped shield of truce to the gate crew and the men on the palisade gerin called well let one crew into the courtyard the rest can wait outside if they try to follow theyll never go home again the trokmoi uttered not a word of protest when gerins troopers passed them those conditions at the foxs nod the gate crew let down the drawbridge then grabbed for bows and spears a single chariot rattled and rumbled over the bridge into fox keep gerin recognized one of the woodsrunners in it i greet you diviciacus son of dumnorix he said and im after greeting you as well lord gerin though i met some of your men closer than i cared for these few days past the trokme answered a long ugly cut furrowed his left arm and showed what he meant he got down from the car and bowed low to gerin lord prince in the name of adiatunnus my chieftain im come here to do you honor adiatunnus bids me tell you hell be your loyal vassal for as long as youre pleased to have him so forbye therere tribute wains waiting to come hither so soon as your lordship is kind enough to tell me you accept his fealty indeed and there are gerin stared at van they both stared at aragis all three men seemed bewildered gerin knew he was he turned back to diviciacus what accounts for adiatunnus change of mind he asked carefully a few days past as you said we were all doing our best to kill one another och but that was then and this is now diviciacus answered he sounded bewildered too as if hed expected the fox to know exactly what he was talking about when he saw gerin didnt he went on himself was chewing things over with one of the monstersone o the smart ones ykenthe other day when lo all of a sudden the creature turns to smoke before the very eyes of him and then its gone all the others gone with it too not a one left far as we can tell will you say thats none o your doing lord prince the fox didnt say anything for a moment now aragis bowed to him almost as low as diviciacus had lord prince i think in your own way you have met the terms of the alliance to which we agreed which is to say i doubt the monsters now threaten my holding thank you grand duke gerin said vaguely hed known what mavrix had said hed done of course but knowing in the abstract and being confronted with actual results were two different things pulling himself together he told diviciacus aye the god worked that at my urging in fact the gods had worked that because theyd been quarreling with each other but some things the trokme didnt need to know and so and so lord prince diviciacus answered adiatunnus has the thought in him that hed have to be a raving madman to set himself against your honor you being such a fine wizard and all diviciacus he tells me not even balamung could have magicked the creatures so and im after thinking hes right if he canna stand against you hell stand wi you says he so hell stand with me will he gerin said i mean him no disrespect but hes shown hes not to be trusted that chieftain of yours when he says hell stand with me hes more likely to mean he ll stand behind me that being the best place from which to slide a dagger between my ribs diviciacus sighed himself feared youd say as much there being bad blood betwixt the two of you and all he gave me leave to say this if you didna trust him hell give you his eldest son a boy of twelve to live with you here at this keep as hostage for his good behavior the ladll leave with the load of tribute i spoke of earlier will he gerin pondered that adiatunnus could hardly offer more to show his sincerity the fox added did your chieftain give you leave to take the oath of homage and fealty in his place he did that lord prince and i know the way you southrons do it too diviciacus went to one knee before gerin and held out his hands palms together gerin set his hands to either side of the trokmes diviciacus said adiatunnus my chieftain owns himself to be your vassal gerin the fox prince of the north and gives you the whole of his faith against all men who might live or die i gerin prince of the north accept the homage of adiatunnus through you diviciacus son of dumnorix and pledge in my turn always to use him justly in token of which i raise you up now the fox did just that and kissed diviciacus on his bristly cheek the trokme beamed by taranis teutates and esus i swear my chieftain adiatunnus fealty to you lord prince any oath less than the strongest one the trokmoi used would have made gerin suspicious of the chieftain with it he bowed in return satisfied by dyaus the father of all biton the farseeing one and mavrix lord of the sweet grape i accept his oath and swear in turn to reward his loyalty with my own diviciacus eyed him keenly adiatunnus had not dispatched a fool as his ambassador you elabonians are always after swearing by dyaus but the other two arent usually the gods you name in your frickfullest aiths theyd be the ones who did your bidding for you im thinking thats my affair gerin said the trokme was right and wrong at the same time gerin had indeed summoned mavrix and biton but the gods did their own bidding no one elses if you were clever enoughand lucky enoughyou might make them see that what you wanted was also in their interest that once the fox had been clever and lucky enough he never wanted to gamble on such bad odds again aragis chariot crews returned with word of ikos miraculously restored and not a sign of monsters anywhere and seemed miffed when everyone took their report as a matter of course the day after they got back to fox keep aragis and his whole host set out for his holding in the south perhaps well find ourselves on the same side again one day aragis said may it be so gerin agreed he didnt quite care for the grand dukes tone had he been in aragis sandals he would have worried about himself too with adiatunnus as his vassal his power and prestige in the northlands would soar maybe to the point where aragis would go looking for allies now hoping to knock him down before he got too powerful to be knocked down in aragis sandals gerin would have tried that to forestall it he said i almost wish i didnt have the trokme as my ally hed be easier to watch as an enemy than as someone who claimed to be my friend there is that aragis rubbed his chin well well see how you do with him with that ambiguous farewell the archer turned and went back among his own men gerin knew he would bear watching too no less than adiatunnus this once his interests and the foxs had coincided next time who could say gerin sighed if he spent all the time he should watching his neighbors where would he find time for anything else not long after aragis and his warriors left for the grand dukes lands duren came up to gerin and asked papa are you angry at fand angry at fand the fox frowned he often thought fand counted any day where she didnt make someone angry at her a day wasted but he didnt say that to his son duren liked fand and shed never been anything but gentle with him no im not angry at her why did you think i was because you never go to her chamber anymore its always van oh gerin scratched his head how was he supposed to explain that to his son duren awaited a reply with the intense seriousness only a fouryearold can show slowly gerin said fand has decided she likes van better than she likes me you remember how she and i would quarrel sometimes dont you duren nodded but she quarrels with van too thats true the fox said but itsusuallya happy sort of quarreling she doesnt treat you any differently now that shes just with van instead of with him and me does she no duren said thats good gerin meant it he would have quarreled with fand and in no happy way had the boy said yes he went on now that fand is with van selatre is my special friend do you like her too he waited anxiously for durens answer oh yes duren said shes nice to me she doesnt treat me like a baby the way some people do just because im not big yet and do you know what else his voice dropped to the conspiratorial whisper reserved for secrets she taught me what some of the letters sound like did she gerin said ill bet i know which ones too how can you know that duren demanded in the tone children use when as frequently they assume their parents cant possibly know anything were they the ones that spell your name gerin asked duren stared at him every once in a whilenot often enougha parent will redeem himself by proving he does know what hes talking about after all how did you know the boy said his eyes enormous did you use magic now that his father had got away with summoning two gods he assumed gerin was a mighty mage the fox who knew how lucky hed been wished that were so but made a point of bearing firmly in mind that it wasnt he said no i didnt need any magic for that the letters of a persons name are almost always the ones he learns first because those are the ones that are most important to him do you know what else no what duren breathed he liked secrets too and was good at keeping them for a boy of his years when selatre came to fox keepthat was just a few days after tassilo stole youshe didnt know her letters either gerin said i taught them to her myself so she should know how to teach you because she just learned really duren said then he looked doubtful but she reads so well i can only read the letters in my name and find them in other words sometimes but i dont know what the other words say its all right its nothing to worry about gerin assured him youre still very little to know any letters at all even most grown people dont you know selatre learned hers quickly partly because shes smartjust like youand partly because shes a woman grown and so when she reads something she understands what its talking about you cant always do that because a lot of things that are in the words on the parchment havent happened to you yet do you understand no durens face clouded over i want to be able to do it now gerin picked him up tossed him in the air and caught him as he came down duren squealed gerin spun him around and around and around he squealed again when gerin set him down he took a couple of staggering steps and fell on his bottom gerin was dizzy too but tried not to show it he said could you throw me up in the air and spin me around and around like that dont be silly papa duren tried to get up but seemed to have as much trouble walking as rihwin had the night he broached the wine why not gerin persisted why cant you do that youre too big thats right and youre too little when youre bigger youll be able to do things like that and youll be able to read easier too duren considered that then said spin me again gerin happily obeyed and enjoyed listening to the happy sounds his son made this time duren didnt even try to stand up when gerin put him on the ground he lay there staring up at the sky gerin would have bet he saw it going round and round finally he made it back to his feet again he demanded no the fox said if you do too much of that you can make yourself sick really gerin watched his son think that over the process was very visible duren obviously decided that was an interesting idea and one worth exploring further he spun away laughing out loud gerin laughed too but only for a moment duren could afford to live for the presentindeed at his age he could hardly do anything else gerin did not enjoy that luxury his son was the only good thing he had left from his shattered marriage with elise and he loved the boy without reservation but what would happen to duren when he wed selatre and had children by her minstrels sang songs about stepmothers but how would he blame selatre for wanting her own blood to advance who would end up whose vassal and after how much hatred and strife with such unpleasant thoughts in his mind he was almost embarrassed when selatre came out of the great hall and walked over to him why so grimfaced she asked the monsters arewherever mavrix sent them theyre not here anyway ikos is risen again i suppose with a new sibyl adiatunnus is lying low at least for now you should be happy oh i am he said but not for any of those reasons she frowned looking for the meaning behind his words when she found it she looked down at the ground for a moment sometimes a compliment could make her as nervous as being touched once had then she said if you are so happy why havent you told your face about it he clicked his tongue between his teeth i was trying to look into the future and i dont have a god to guide my sight biton didnt guide me selatre said he just spoke through me and i had no memory of what he would say what did you see that troubled you so gerin wondered if he should have kept his mouth shut but no selatre prized truth partly from her own nature and perhaps partly also because so much raw truth had washed through her as the gods conduit so hesitantly he explained yes those are troubling thoughts she said when he was done much will depend on what sort of man duren becomes and on any other children who may appear she glanced over to him her head cocked to one side so you aim to wed me do you this is the first ive heard of it he coughed and sputtered his ears got hot i did intend to ask you formally he said hearing how lame his voice sounded only made his ears hotter but yes it has been in my mind and it justslipped out now what say you to that oh i say yes without a doubt selatre answered he hugged her glad past words that he hadnt been too clumsy for her to bear but she still had thatmeasuringlook on her face she said as long as you are looking into the future what makes you bold enough to think i wont want to run off with a horseleech someday as elise did oof he said the air rushing out of him she couldnt have deflated him any more thoroughly if shed kicked him in the belly and we men like to think were the cool and calculating sex but he saw she wanted a serious answer and did his best to give her one i ve learned some things since i wed her or i hope i have anyhow i know better than to take a wife for granted just because weve given each other pledges marriage is like hmm the palisade around this keep if i dont keep checking to make sure the timber stays sound itll fall to pieces one day thats most important the other thing is you suit me better than she did in a lot of different ways i don t think the two of us will rub each other raw and if we start to i hope im wise enough now to try to make sure that doesnt get too bad and i hope you are too he waited to see what shed say to that once more to his vast relief she nodded those are good reasons she said if youd given me something like because i think youre lovelier than the stars in the sky then id have worried i do gerin said think youre lovelier than the stars in the sky i mean selatre glanced away im glad you do she answered quietly but while thats a fine reason to want to bed someone it really isnt reason enough to wed one fine day youd likely see someone else you think is lovelier than the stars in the skyand then what point in having married the one and only good thing about growing older that ive found is that i dont think with my crotch as much as i used to he said as much eh selatre stuck out her tongue at him i will put up with a certain amount of that i suppose depending on whom you re thinking about he slipped an arm around her waist drew her to him not very long before even trying that would have got him killed by the temple guards at ikos even more recently shed have pulled away in horror still thinking a mans touch a defilement now she molded herself to him as if to prove he hadnt been thinking entirely with his crotch he said duren tells me youre starting to teach him his letters do you mind her voice was anxious i didnt think i had to tell you youve always been one to want people to be able to read and hes a good boy your son i like him if he has an early start on his letters theyll come easier for him learning them once i was all grown up i sometimes thought my head would burst did you gerin said if you did you hid it very well and you learned them very well toobetter than most of the people ive taught when they were younger no i dont mind youre rightim glad he has a start on them and im glad you like him maybe he gave that some slight extra emphasis or maybe selatre was getting better at fathoming the way his mind worked she said aye i can see how you might be she made a face i dont intend to act like a wicked stepmother in a tale i promise you that she paused for a moment her expression thoughtful i wonder what the stepmothers in those tales intended is anyone ever wicked in her own eyes do you know gerin said slowly theres a question that would keep the sages down in the city of elabon arguing for days when i first opened my mouth i would have said of course some people seem wicked even to themselves but when i try to see through their eyes i wonder balamung the trokme wizard set the northlands on their ear a few years ago but he thought he was taking just revenge for slights hed got and wolfar of the axe he broke off and scowled remembering wolfar made him remember elise too wolfar was out for his own gain and didnt see one bloody thing wrong with that you may be right they probably saw you as wicked for trying to stop them selatre said so they did gerin said which didnt mean i didnt judge them wicked or that they didnt need stopping and you stopped them selatre said nodding did i rightly hear that you slew wolfar in the library she gave him a different sort of sidelong look this time as if to say that was not the proper use to which to put a chamber dedicated to preserving books if i hadnt killed him there he certainly would have killed me gerin answered that he didnt wasnt for lack of trying his neck throbbed at the memory wolfar had come within an eyelash of strangling him but he had strangled wolfar and in so doing won what passed for schilds loyalty selatre said if you hadnt slain him then i probably wouldnt be alive todaythe monsters would have caught me the day of the earthquake her laugh came shaky strange to think your own being depends on something that had happened years ago to someone you didnt know then aye that is a curious thought gerin agreed some trokmeor maybe more than one of the woodsrunners ive never known for certaintwisted my life out of the path id planned for it when hetheykilled my father and my brother and left me baron of fox keep if you dwell on the mighthavebeens its like wandering through a maze mighthavebeens strain even the powers of the gods selatre said remember how biton had to strain to see what might come from my going back to ikos and my staying here with you im not likely to forget it gerin said with feeling i thought id lost you forever biton was kindly perhaps in memory of how id served him before selatre answered but even if he hadnt been how could you hope to set your will against a gods i couldnt gerin said and let it go at that the gods will had not been his principal concern selatres had with a lifetime devoted to biton and bare days to him she was only too likely to have chosen to return to what shed always known that she hadnt left made him grateful every time he looked at her most seriously he said i ll do my best to make sure youre never sorry about your choice you neednt worry about that selatre said the farseeing one will have made his own selection by now with the temple at ikos restored he would not leave it without a sibyl im here because i wanted to be and not because i have no other choice open to me again gerin kept part of his thoughts to himself there was always another choice the one elise had taken what he had to do nowwhat he had to do foreverwas to make sure selatre was too content at fox keep ever to want to leave it he hugged her again but didnt think as he had a little while before of taking her up to his chamber and barring the door simple affection had its place too maybe after all he could say some of what hed thought if we work at it it will turn out all right are you making prophecies now selatre asked perhaps i should have worried about whether biton would take you back to ikos and set you on the throne of pearl thank you no gerin said im right where i belong not doing what id hoped to be doing maybe but doing something that needs doingand im just happy you think you belong here too that i do selatre agreed and now if youre not going to drag me upstairs ill go up by myself and wade through that scroll on kizzuwatnan hepatomancy i was trying to make sense of the other day that one doesnt make much sense to me either gerin said my guess is that it either didnt make much sense to the sithonian who wrote it in the first place or to the elabonian who put it into our language ive tried foretelling a few times from livers of cows or sheep weve slaughtered but what i divined had nothing to do with what ended up happening somethings been lost somewhere i think maybe it will come clear if i keep studying it selatre said and headed back into the great hall gerin smiled as he watched her go though she didnt put it the way he had she also believed in working at something till you got it right even without hepatomancy he knew a good omen when he saw one the way shed teased him about dragging her upstairs he took for a good omen too with elise anything involving the bedchamber had been a deadly serious business with fand hed never known whether he was in for a grand time or a fight making love with someone neither earnest nor inflammatory was new to him but he liked it drifting after selatre he walked into the great hall himself van sat at one of the tables there a roast chickenmostly bones nowin front of him a pitcher of ale within easy reach he nodded to the fox and said grab yourself a jack captain and help me get to the bottom of this i dont mind if i do gerin sat down across from the outlander who poured him a full jack van raised his own and said to the prince of the northmaybe one day to the king of the north he poured the ale down his throat then stared sharply at gerin youd better drink to that so i should gerin said and obediently drank he smacked his lips partly tasting the ale partly vans words king of the north if im lucky my grandson may wear that title van plucked at his beard i dont know fox alls topsyturvy here and youre a young man yet if you live you may do it gerin shifted uncomfortably on the bench as if hed got a splinter in his backside i dont know that i want to do it a title like that itd be an open invitation to all the other lords in the northlands to gang together and pull me down i dont know van repeated me i dont think aragis would lift a finger against you for fear youd call down the gods and turn him into a lump of cheese or some such same with adiatunnus and without them whod raise a proper fight theyre wary of me now aye gerin said but thatll fade by the time the first snow falls i cant make myself king before then im too weak and taking the title when i havent the strength to back it up he shook his head aragis wants to be king i think hed fight for prides sake if i went and put on a crown have it your wayyou generally do van said from where i sit looks like you could bring it off he poured the last of the ale into his jack drained it got up and headed for the stairs hed left one of the wings on the roast fowl uneaten gerin pulled it off the carcass gnawed on it thoughtfully he shook his head after a little while still convinced he was right all the same he sent a resentful look toward the stairway van had kindled his ambition and hed known just what he was doing too not yet gerin said his lands had suffered too much from the monsters and from the fights with adiatunnus he wanted time to wed selatre and to enjoy life with her though the calculating part of his mind said being married to the former sibyl of an ikos now miraculously restored would also foster his prestige among his neighbors no not yet but who could say the time might come maps the end
