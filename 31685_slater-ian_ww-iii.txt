ian slater ww iii that russian withdrawal began last week when thirtyone soviet tanks were loaded onto flatbed cars in hungary among those watching the pullout was ilona staller a member of the italian parliament and a pornomovie star staller kept her clothes on when she posed with soviet officers and released a white dove of peace ominously perhaps the bird was crushed in the treads of a soviet tank time may prologue the man with the eye patch was the presidents pilot once while making love to a beautiful young woman he had left the patch on kidding around pretending to be a pirate of old but after in the hush following the storm she had asked him to take it off the patch frightened her she told him an augury of the perpetual hush that would follow a nuclear explosion the bombs airburst brighter than a million suns blinding all aboard the doomsday plane except the man with the protected eyekilling all below leaving the president in charge of what seeing her distress the pilot had quickly removed it trembling with fear she asked him to hold her and he did it would be more than a year before he would see her again before he had met her he had never heard of her two brothers or anyone else in the brentwood family for that matterbut then people all over the world had never heard of the family and there was no reason they should have that is until like the brentwoods in america and major tae in south korea everybody suddenly found themselves swept into the maelstrom when whether anyone liked it or not ordinary human beings would be called upon to do extraordinary things chapter one korea august high above seouls yonsei campus the moon was white the color of mourning mija tae felt her heart race from the fear of parting the moon fleeing a cloven sky one moment its light turning the ginkgo leaves silver the next swallowing them in darkness as it was the evening before the annual independence day celebrations fireworks could be seen now and then bursting above the old olympic stadium south across the river and tonight the television news had told them there was an added reason for celebration in europe the americans and russians had announced further arms and troop reductions the prospects for peace commentators proclaimed had never been better turning away from her lover though still in his embrace mija told him we cannot meet again he was stunned what are you saying why if my father knew what you are doing she said you know he would forbid me seeing you he doesnt know its his job to know these things sooner or later he will find out how asked junghyun hes at panmunjom were here each time he comes home on leave it is more difficult what is more difficult to deceive him said mija sadly i love him very much if he knew thats unreasonable said junghyun not to him answered mija he fears the north for him you would be a traitor then youre not coming on the march it was more accusation than question i didnt say that but cant you see how he but you junghyun pressed pushing her away looking down at her beauty the nape of her neck revealed in fleeting moonlight you see dont you that north and south should be united that we should be together he wants that too she said ah junghyun said turning from her he is a chinmipapro american he doesnt hate the americans she said looking up at him if thats what you mean he says if it wasnt for them we would all be slaves and you believe that junghyun said dismissively im she shook her head and came closer to him her arms around his waist he could smell her perfume feel her softly weeping against him i dont know she said her voice trembling i dont know what to think father says the north is looking to make war before the south becomes too strong he says that is why its so dangerous now rubbish snapped junghyun the north will never attack us they only want peace he pushed her roughly away now his hands in fists of frustration you think id be in the movement for reunification if i thought the north wanted war no she said well he said there you are the moon was lost in cloud slowly he drew her back to him he could feel her heart beating stroking the sensuous curve of her neck he pulled her still closer she could feel his arousal i love you he said softly you must not worry so your father is wrong therell be no war chapter two whats that asked the elderly woman in one of northwests boeing s starboard window seats the flight attendant on her first trip from seattle to shanghai lowered her head to look out into the wild blue yonder as she banally called it the man from texas sitting next to the elderly woman didnt care what the attendant called it so long as she kept bending over him for a better view he was married but his wife said she didnt mind where he got his appetite so long as he did his eating at home a seabird probably said the attendant fresh out of training school in atlanta at thirty thousand feet said the elderly woman i dont think so dear it would need an oxygen mask oh the attendant replied then its probably another plane same altitude as us the elderly woman rejoined the attendant peered out again the man from texas loving it if only the plane were empty and they were alone i think youd better find out said the woman a trifle schoolmarmish in her tone would you mind ill ask the senior flight attendant hell probably you ask the pilot dear as the attendant forced an accommodating smile and stood up the texan studiously watched her walk away she had to squeeze past the drink trolley the elderly woman was anxiously looking out the window the texan james delcorte smiled at her i wouldnt worry about it maam probably just a jet fighter she turned looking sharply at him thats what im afraid of well theres no need he said reassuringly were in the corridor if its a jet its a south korean or american were on our side of the lane besides theres a radio beacon plum in the middle to guide civil aircraft it could go out hardly think thats well it did during the eightyeight olympics course she continued thatd be before your time im not that old he replied goodnaturedly he was looking out the window now you see its gone behind a cloud she said remember double oh seven the man was nonplussed james bond james nothing the woman said irritably korean airlines double oh seven shot down by the russians in eightythree you cant trust any of em especially pyongyang the texan moved uncomfortably in his seat pyon it sounded familiar to him some communist leader north korea she explained oh you a businessman he was glad of the change of subject yes and you on vacation of sorts daughterinlaw lives in shanghai works for la roche chemicals husband owns it la roche the texan sat up in his seat if it was the la roche the old lady could be as irritable as she wanted la roche was one of the worlds biggest chemicalcosmetic conglomeratesfortunes top ten j t la roche he asked yes said the woman hes a fool oh all think theyll make a fortune in china a billion people a billion customers thats the way jay looks at it she shook her head wont get anywhere in china i told him theyll have to get their distribution system organized first lord you ever fly china air no answered the texan well dont said mrs la roche love em but lord are they disorganized thats their problem ysee sounds like you know a lot about them she turned toward him henry my late husband and i lived in hong kong before the communists took it over moved back to the states when the british left thats where jay met the brentwood girl shed been doing some courses in college to be a nurse gave that up and went back to china with jay she has a brother out here in the navy another one in the atlantic dont think itll work the texan wasnt sure what wouldnt work the navy for the brentwood brothers or her sons marriage to the brentwood girl lovely girl continued mrs la roche but oh my cant sit still neurotic as all get out low selfesteem she was glancing out at the clouds again course jay loves that ego she turned to the texan you remember that donald trump sure compared to jays ego trumps mother teresa good boy jay but too big for his britches dont know where he got it from too much money wants to own the world jay does well smiled the texan holding his hand up for another double hes well on the way you got family yes mam my son walter with the air force uhhuh wheres he stationed germany you been there mrs la roche didnt answer still peering suspiciously at the cumulus towering thousands of feet above them its ice white turning creamy in the fading light no use fretting i suppose she said its a dangerous world wherever you go she paused and sat back id worry if i had young uns though she turned to the texan especially now everyones getting jittery lanas folks thats my daughterinlaw want her and jay to go back to the states nice people navy man too uhhuh said the texan uninterestedly why was it that people told you things on planes theyd never dare bore you with anywhere else a captive audience or maybe they thought theyd never see you again which was true he was getting impatient for the double scotch i told them she kept on use your brains it was gorbachev this gorbachev that lord worst thing couldve happened whys that queried the texan the trolley edging closer raises expectations said mrs la roche biggest bully in europe for sixty years suddenly smiles and we go ape and everyone in the eastern bloc starts agitating for independence you just knew there was going to be trouble think about it i told henry think about it you really want the poles and hungarians to start trouble drag us into it yugoslavs are just as bad coming apart at the seams that country is gorbachev encouraged them too everybodyll have more freedom pretty soon someones going to try taking a bit more than theyre allowed ukranians georgians armenians tuvans buryats you name it least with those bullies andropov brezhnev we knew where we stood east was east and west was west stay off the grass she glanced up at the trolley attendant ill have a brandy dear as she took the drink neat and sat back the texan saw a glint of silver coming out from the boiling mass of cumulonimbus as they came in over the east china sea the serpentine curve of the huangpu was a river of burning gold the texan held back to let the rush of eager tourists go before him as he passed the young attendant whom mrs la roche had first spoken to he thanked her for the flight and asked whether shed found out anything about the other plane yes she said the captain saw it whose was it south korean the chief steward put in hurriedly hmm they fly that close it was said more as a comment than a question but the steward got right onto it actually theyre always much further away than you think air distances are very deceptive the texan saw mrs la roche walking down the concourse past the glass display cases of china dolls foreign cigarettes and batteryoperated panda bears that moved if you clapped in the waiting crowd beyond customs the texan could also see a beautiful brunette in a black and white silk dress a sloppylooking chauffeur in gray beside her she was looking eagerly around as a bored member of the peoples liberation army stared at her from the customs exit when she saw mrs la roche she waved excitedly and pointed her out to the chauffeur and the texan knew it must be lana la roche damn he thought wishing hed gone out with the old lady after all and wrangled an introduction you never knew where these things could lead he tried to hurry nothing to declare at customs but by the time he passed through the swarming mass of people engulfed him bodies so close together that all he could think of was escape surrounded wall to wall by chinese he found the push of bodies frightening the noise deafening and he began to panic he was so far from home the crowd so huge so oppressive unstoppable like a world going mad and for a terrifying moment he feared he might never get out might never see his son or america again at the moon behind them coming from the east toward the rhinelands eifel mountains and picked up on one of the nadge nato air defense ground environment radars the four east german fighters russianmade sukhoi flagons came straight for the american patrol of four fb falcons out of hahn each falcons avgas receptacle open ready for the refueling exercise with a kc tanker usaf col walter delcorte leader of the patrol from the tenth us tactical fighter squadron at hahn ordered the wing to close refueling vents and drop to five thousand breaking off west well away from the trace the tenmeterwide border strip that despite what had happened to the wall still ran for five hundred kilometers between the two germanys along natos central front the falcons broke as ordered the moonbathed quilt of german farms sliding away beneath them at over nine hundred miles an hour as they sought to avoid any confrontation from the warsaw pact fighters four minutes later the sukhois came in again nose to nose break west again delcorte instructed the other three falcons they did so bogeys have jinked again reported delcortes wing man seeing that the four sukhois armed with an underfuselage cannon pack of twentythreemillimeter weapons and airtoair anab missiles were coming in to try it on again okay thats enough said delcorte reporting to hahn base flagons have jinked again for second time coming for us now seventeen miles closing mach even though the twentyonemeterong sukhois were capable of sixteen hundred miles an hour at over ten thousand feet their present subsonic speed was still very fast for such a low altitude and all the pilots knew that with the seventeenton fs able to match them life or death could be a matter of milliseconds get under them ordered delcorte four thousand with this the fs slid into radar advantage their electronic lookup of the sukhois uncluttered by ground fuzz which would however interfere with the sukhois radar lookdown images of the american falcons ten seconds later all four american rios radar intercept officers armed their airtoair sidewinder and sparrow missiles hahn ground control nadge and a nato rotodome early warning hawkeye aircraft out of geilenkirchen all had tracks of the sukhois as well as intercepts of east germanys dresden control ordering the sukhois to confront the fs again comaafce commander allied air forces central europe at börfink in natos command bunker hq ordered two more evasive actions bogeys jinking again came delcortes voice twentythree miles bogey jinked on me reported another plane noses on at twentytwo miles angels four this meant the american fs were still at four thousand feet again börfink ordered evasive action and again the f falcons reported the sukhois had jinked again at börfink gave delcorte weaponsfree independent decision authority master arm on delcorte ordered his voice but not the faint growl of the activated missile on tape at börfink master arm on came his rios confirmation am centering the t bogeys jinked fourteen miles centering dot fox one fox one the twelvefootlong sparrow missile was off streaking at over two thousand miles per hour seen on the early warning hawkeyes radar ten miles came in another american pilot fox one fox one another pilots voice cut in tally three tally three afterburners indicating he could now actually see the crimson eyes of three sukhoi sus afterburners six miles select fox two five miles four miles lock im up lock im up shoot fox two fox two now the shoosh of the shorter lighter airtoair sidewinder missile could be heard on the tape together with the burst of one of the fs twentymillimeter port side cannons adding to the general confusion of sound overriding voices good kill good kill at börfink the tapeconnected oscilloscope hiccuped twice there was a jolting sound one of the falcons hit a scratch of static on the tape pilot and rio ejecting and then in low stratus above the invisible spread of germanys southern palatinate the thunder of another two explosions two of the sukhois disintegrating at fifteen hundred feet east germany said nothing further arms reduction talks were under way in geneva in the west newspapers picked up the story released from natos headquarters in brussels two more fs had gone down during lowlevel practice runs over southern germany the f one story reported was fast taking over the starfighter in germany as the widow maker there were more complaints from both the green party and even some conservative christian democrats that the noise level of the lowflying jets was intolerable from the villages and towns along the border a petition was presented to nato headquarters in brussels and to the tenth us tactical fighter squadron complaining that the noise of the jets was in excess of decibels like a train roaring through your bedroom one farmer said angrily and never mind the effects on the children and the farm animals the latter were so jittery that farmers had long claimed it was adversely affecting the output of milch cows and increasingly devaluating already depressed real estate values along the border both claims were true nato hq said it would seriously consider the protests and reevaluate the lowlevel attack program but did neither since nato had lost fighters of them twocrew fs in all dead few pilots and radar intercept officers managed to bail out at such low altitudes but nato kept up the dangerous lowlevel flights the reason was brutally simple along the fivehundredkilometer border of natos central front there were nato aircraft against over warsaw pact aircraft and a further russian fighters and fighterbombers between moscow and the german border in the event of war natos only hope against a soviet surge would be to have better planes but even then they could be overwhelmed the problem of lost pilots as in the battle of britain becoming the crucial factor natos hope resided in developing better pilot and ground crews than the other sides in the event of war the natosovietwarsaw pact sortie rate had to be two to one against the sovietwarsaw pact air forces if the west was to stand a chance in lowlevel combat in the battle of razorsharp wits and splitsecond radar blips in dogfights with gforces so great that they literally drained you of four to seven pounds of fluid a sortie the concentration needed was enormous that afternoon colonel delcorte was instructing a new batch of pilots from the states cautioning them that at such low altitudes the slightest mistake on the touchsensitive joystick the slightest reverie with speeds approaching mach under two thousand feet would bring the ground slamming up to kill them any questions delcorte had asked a hand shot up yes said delcorte you said five hundred feet sir yes ah whens the next flight home it was a joke of course despite such probing incidents as the one this morning deep down no one in the air force nor anyone else for that matter least of all lana la roche expected a war since gorbachev everything had been looking good chapter three among her friends lana brentwood had always been described as a perfectionist with energy to burn a good student who always went the extra distance for the straight as and to please and a good listener often seeing things in others that they thought were hidden and yet having the ability to convey to whomever she was speaking to a sense that for that moment she wanted to hear only from that person it helped to fend off or hold at bay her secret and enormous dread of failure it made no difference that she had done well at school won a scholarship to harvards medical school she wanted to do everything at once and everything wouldnt have it and one day it all tumbled in on her in one exam an avalanche triggered by one question in her prerequisite arts course man was born free yet everywhere he is in chains comment it wasnt that she felt she couldnt answer it but here were so many reasons rousseau was right so many that he was wrong like a shopper who feeling suddenly overwhelmed by the sheer number of choices in the end walks out and buys nothing lana broke out in the perspiration of quiet terror made some panicky notes with which to start the answer erased them wrote them down again finally she began to tremble and asked if she could go to the washroom worse than her fear that everybody was looking at her was her realization that no one was all too busy heads bent answering the question she never went back to the room and following a sixmonth stint as a student nurse from which she again dropped out the rush of failure after came like a series of storm waves battering down an exhausted swimmer as she tried desperately for the safety of the shore never making it her father john brentwood a sixtyfiveyearold exnaval captain once retired with high honors from the navy and now on the brink of retirement from his postnaval new york port authority job was a man who had led what he called a nononsense life one of duty discipline and duty he was for lana however extraordinarily kind when he sat down with her putting his arm about her comforting her telling her that there was more to life than exams and that perhaps she should think about something else where the pressure wasnt so great thank you daddy but that isnt what you told ray or robert when they had troubles you said when the going gets tough yes yes he answered but with men lanny its different theyre expected oh daddy she said angrily storming from the room he made to follow after her but couldnt get up from her bed as quickly as he used to now i didnt mean youre not equal honey he called out yes you do she said from the kitchen snatching a tissue hating herself because for her it was different than for the boys they hadnt broken down besides these days women were supposed to be as tough all im saying lanny continued her father is that you dont have to beat your brains out you can well do something else for a while lana now that the floodgates were open that her uptight high school girl most likely to succeed image had been shattered steered the discussion selfdestructively back to her exam failure indulging in a whining catechism of other petty andor imagined failures about how she really hadnt done anything with her life about how she was finished before shed even started shed never even had time for boyfriends no serious lasting relationship john brentwood looked over at his wife catherine in an age when condoms were as easy to get as gum and an aging geraldo rivera was wrestling on tv with near naked women in mudpits they were thankful there had been no serious relationships but they understood well enough what it was she was telling them that she wasnt even experienced as a woman still john brentwood turned it over to his wife to deal with to tell lana there would come a time when she was more settled when she knew better what she wanted that thered be plenty of time for men and that kind of thing take a year off her father said in his wifes silence it was announced with the surprise of a captain with a wounded frigate suddenly recognizing the virtue of a retreat return to port he said halfjokingly get your surface vessel out of range of the sub eh lanny oh john said catherine brentwood were not in the persian gulf last thing she needs is to return to port as you put it catherine i was only trying to i know sweetie but what lana needs is something to do something concrete take herself out of herself thats what you used to tell the boys you still tell david the same thing not that he takes any notice well john brentwood began but stopped himself lana was flushed in that difficult mood for selfpity and vengeance and for asking where was god anyway there you go again lana told her mother her eyes liquidbright the boys again the boys are different the boys are special we dont mean that said the exrear admiral lamely sons were so much easier to deal with i never meant that you dont think i can handle it alone snapped lana well she hesitated lips quivering i can youll see what they saw was lana dropping out of college altogether going back to her old love of horseback riding spending hours at the stables i hope said john brentwood despairing of his daughters future while leafing through the evening newspaper reading of more trouble in yugoslavia serbs against croatsthat lanny doesnt turn into one of those horsey women and what asked catherine her hand steady with crochet needle is a horsey woman you know replied john turning on the remote control tv look at that montreux convention distinctly guarantees us right of passage through the dardanelles and bosporus there was an inset map behind the tv announcer showing the narrow straits at istanbul that lead into the black sea and the coast of bulgaria and the ussr a bulgarian destroyer had bumped the announcer said a us destroyer off odessa on the boundary line of the twelvemile territorial zone those bulgarian bastards said john brentwood peering over his bifocals ivan snaps his fingers and they play the monkey ah he waved his hand disgustedly at the tv we wont do anything diplomatic notes now if that had happened in reagans day it might just have been an accident his wife commented catherine began john brentwood exasperatedly a naval vessel doesnt accidentally bump another naval ship for chrissake you did once damn it woman he tore the newspaper away from his lap i did not how many times have i told you that that sonofabitch sub was snooping on us trying to get a good noise signature for their goddamned mines and i surprised him cut engines and the bastard couldnt turn quick enough he bumped me goddamn it dont swear well whatever all they said was it was a bulgarian ship were getting on fine with the russians now now yes i wouldnt trust those sons of what were you saying about lana what oh yes well i just dont want her turning into one of those horsey women thats all i know lots of men who like horses and they dont bait me catherine you know perfectly well what i mean one of those women who wont go anywhere near anything unless it farts and eats hay jay la roche doesnt do either far as i know jay who that perfume guy yes you remember you met him at the equestrian ball the night you were so grumpy you and that admiral busy jawing about the presidents cuts in defense i think hes rather glamorous and hes well connected shes been seeing him i mean seeing him a lot quite a lot brentwood grunted he was glamorous in a way do his little girl good to get out and around away from those damned horses on the other hand there was something about la roche he didnt like haughty that was it millionaires club haughtiness or was it because the cosmetics magnate didnt like career service officers he certainly gave that impression despite the ultrapoliteness lot of those people around thought being in the service meant you wanted to kill everybody young david at college in washington state had noted the same thing some liberal artsyfartsy types baiting him about mucho macho and with the new palsywalsy public relations between moscow and washington and the defense cuts it made it even more fashionable to put down those in uniform christ they were still on about vietnam and that was an age ago lanny say anything to you about him he asked catherine no but i can tell she spends a lot of time getting dressed good god thats no criterion half the women i know take most of the day getting dressed oh and how many have you known she teased quite a few i expect he ignored it watching the tv shaking his head disgustedly you see thats the sort of thing i mean this supreme court business women in future being ready for combat take em half an hour to get their war paint on catherine was hooking the crochet needle in an end stitch youre a dinosaur she said simply but i love you all the same what happened to that pilot she was going out with from andrews nice young fella shirer i thought you warned her off servicemen if i remember correctly too many billets strain on the marriage maybe but i prefer a pilot to a perfume maker now john said catherine putting down her crocheting thats unfair and you know it what if i told you la roche industries makes a lot of munitions for defense they do ive no idea by god you can be irritating wouldnt make a skerrick of difference anyway even if he was making rockets i dont like his snooty manner hes wellbred officers from annapolis are wellbred too but they dont act like that you leave him alone lana needs all the selfconfidence and affection she can get right now said so yourself i wont interfere i wont interfere he said holding up his hands all i want is for my little girl to be happy good but she isnt so little and sometimes you just have to let go let them make up their own minds remember what you always said about children theyre on loan to us theyre not ours best we can do is point them in the right direction and pray all right but what happened to that pilot a fling i think it wasnt long after her breakdown wasnt a breakdown it was just whatever you want to call it he was someone she liked at the time thats all john brentwood lowered the sound on the tv you dont think she there was a long pause you know do you with him i dont know and i dont intend to pry on the tv the announcer was reporting more trouble in el salvador or was it nicaragua more killing during elections shots of bloodsplattered hostages murdered in beirut in the crazy war that brentwood had never understood and was plain weary of hearing about there was also growing support for the president predictions of more defense cuts about to be announced even more popular than pollsters had previously thought and a lot of combat training money being diverted to less expensive electronic closedhelmet simulators and reporters were predicting a major reduction in the number of stealth bombers from two hundred to one hundred possibly fewer brentwood was shaking his head a snappy young female annapolis graduate was telling a reporter how she thought that the possibility that someday the supreme court would go all the way and allow women in front line combat role was just terrific sure said brentwood and what happens when you get pregnant excuse me sir could i please leave the war for six months he turned to catherine honestly i dont know what the worlds coming to there was a brief mention that there was a shooting somewhere on the korean dmz shouldve let macarthur over the yalu said brentwood getting up from his recliner snapping the tv off he saw under the streetlights a long car a limousine pulling up outside his house he stared at it in disbelief through the blinds then he saw the chauffeur opening the rear door and lana getting out her dark shiny hair in sharp contrast with the long white gown and white wrap imitation fur she wouldnt have real fur look at this he said but when he turned around he saw catherine had left and heard her getting ready for bed when he entered their bedroom newspaper clutched in one hand the other whipping off his bifocals catherine was changing into her nightdress its pink he announced in horror what is said catherine taking the comb out of her hair oh you mean the limousine cute isnt it cute like a new orleans whorehouse oh dont be such an old stodge its cute just a gimmick for his cosmetic company shocking pink brentwood stood there looking at her sometimes catherine i just dont understand you she wouldnt be baited and kept brushing her hair now theres this thing in korea what thing another row thats not my fault rays out there somewhere with the seventh fleet remember theres trouble everywhere john she said i worry about it too at times but we cant do anything about it so thats that she slid off her slippers and drew up the covers patting the bed invitingly beside her come on now stop fretting i swear you worry more out of the navy than in it besides she reached for the lamps dimmer switch the experts say that despite all the little wars that always seem to be going on theres now a greater chance of peace between the superpowers than ever before experts said brentwood dismissively experts told us nuclear arms would put a stop to war forever everyone would be too scared to let one off theyre right so far only trouble is now everybodys so scared to push the button we need more conventional arms than ever so what does the president do talk about cuts i dont know its crazy they heard lana come in and then go out again whats she up to he asked go to sleep honestly youre like an old woman ah you see discrimination ill take you to the supreme court an hour later lana woke them up to show them the engagement ring catherine said the diamond was the biggest shed ever seen john held his temper just wanted her to know he said and he broke for a moment before going on just wanted her to know that hed loved her from the first moment hed held her as a baby and always would no matter what happened as long as she was happy she threw her arms about them both thank you daddy she said and they were all in tears in her bed lana dreamed her dreams of the exciting life that lay ahead while in her parents bedroom john brentwood struggled to control his temper as catherine hushed him ordering him imploring him to keep his voice down but goddamn it he said in a hoarse whisper he never even asked me goddamn it i dont even know the man i know i know said catherine ever philosophical trying to calm him im sure he intends to but i agree it wasnt very thoughtful but whats done is done the main thing is shes happy besides thats the whole idea of an engagement a trial period for what john brentwood asked darkly to give her time to think there was long silence between them its a beautiful ring said catherine goddamned things big as a missile well im sure it wont kill anyone that had been eighteen months before and since then lana had jetsetted about the world on the society pages from the new york times to englands country lifeit seemed that jay t la roche had an interest in horses after all at least in buying and selling them and had acquired some of the best stables in europe his ownership of stables however was not confined to horses it also extended to a mistress in paris and others flown in upon request a shattering discovery that lana had made only when being mistaken for his umpteenth secretary she had been given a telephone message to give to herr la roche that fraulein bader was vollig gesund perfectly clean perfectly clean lana discovered through a private detective whose assurances that she was doing the correct thing only made her feel dirty herself meant that jays onenight stands were carefully screened by one of a bevy of doctors retained solely by la roche to insure that whoever he was bedding aboard his lear jet at twenty thousand feet was free of aids andor associated viruses believing he still loved her lana had tried to tough it out hoping he would settle down she even performed for him in ways disgusting to her but which he insisted upon he kept upping the ante during the foreplay an extended ploy which though she didnt realize it at the time was a vicious psychological game he couldnt lose if she refused to debase herself further he told her he could claim sexual incompatibility a label he made it clear he was personally unconcerned about but one that he could easily use with his army of lawyers to smear her in every scandal sheet and tabloid he owned and even in some of those he didnt it was a label a potential smear campaign that for her familys sake lana dared not risk the very idea of having such things revealed in public was unthinkable to her so that suing for divorce was simply not an option not long after mrs la roche had left shanghai lana told him she was leaving while mrs la roche had been there her son had reined in his more outrageous sexual habits such as having everything from young schoolchildren to perfectly clean whores flown in from tokyo and hong kong for lana things deteriorated when mrs la roche returned to the states jay seemed bent on a catchup orgy of sexual indulgence the likes of which she had never even imagined and which she now understood was one of the reasons why he favored shanghai and hong kong the communist police were in his pocket and the beijing government needed his hard foreign currency as much as any of his other customers so confident was he that no challenge she could make would stand up in court unless she was prepared to debase herself in the witness box as well that he became increasingly contemptuous of her protestations her fear only drove him to further cruelties he had all the money all the power he told her he would sue for libel if she said a word and ruin her family as well in the process the end of the marriage came late one night when he had returned home high on a mixture of cocaine and booze taking her into the bathroom and insisting she do what she could not do and the beating began in the morning still drunk but knowing hed gone too far that if she was seen in public like this his business might suffer probing questions asked he had his best cosmetician brought in the one who had worked on a lot of film stars in his virtually taxfree hong kong studios where his tax loophole umbrella of production companies churned out films for the chinese market all about upstanding communist heroes of the revolution overcoming corruption the cosmetician spent six hours on lana so that by the time the darkwindowed mercedes took her to shanghai airport her transit through customs and past a sleepy pla guard merely a formality guaranteed by jays power mrs lana la roche with sunglasses and high scarf to hide the rope burn was looking none the worse for wear he had said hed send her enough that she could live well on condition that she keep her mouth shut she said she didnt want his money all right hed told her then you wont get it but and then hed lifted her chin with his lilywhite perfumed hand remember this lana you say a word one word ill have mommy and daddy admiral in the national enquirer ill make it look like you left me but i wouldnt eat your shit he dropped her head bon voyage i love you it was even more disgusting than what hed made her do yet hateful as he was she somehow knew that the moment he had said it he had actually meant it she stayed by herself in the manhattan apartment to give herself enough time for the bruises to disappear but knowing she was going to need a lot more time before she made any contact with her parents with anyone she knew unable to sleep she went to see a doctor who prescribed sleeping pills it was the darkest period of her life and more than once she had the vial of seconal in hand staring at the person in the mirror she no longer recognized even so a faint voice from where she did not know always stayed her hand chapter four panmunjom on major taes calendar hanging on his quonset hut office wall beneath the old blackandwhite of him as a young rok lieutenant in the

but also south koreas astonishing progress in the league of industrial nations turning his gaze from his sector of the twoandahalfmilewide demilitarized zone that snaked for miles west to east the small slim immaculately uniformed rok intelligence officer for panmunjom pushed the play button on his vcr to watch a rerun of the days meeting the th between the north koreans and the un delegation since the ceasefire way back in flipping open his notepad he prepared to take direct quotes from the north korean delegation part of his daily report to rokus hq in seoul the meeting had started badly the tension from the longforgotten war in which fiftyfour thousand americans and three million koreans had died as palpable as the muggy summer heat that hung low and sullenly smelling of dung in the valley around panmunjom as the first frames flickered on the tv screen the north korean delegation was already in the process of accusing the un commission of the ninetyeight thousand one hundred and fiftythird violation of the dmz apparently a childs kite its string broken had been found by the north koreans on their side of the dmz twentyfive miles east of panmunjom near what on the americans map was called pork chop hill the aides to the head of the north korean delegation major general kim were charging that a microcamera had been found mounted under the kite to take pictures of militarily sensitive areas in the democratic peoples republic of korea that is ridiculous replied the un head of the commission us army gen george c cahill who sat in the middle on the south side of the long emeraldbaizecovered truce table his arms folded right forefinger hooked about the stem of a briar pipe unlike the red and blue circle of the souths flag its halves joining a symbol of harmonious duality between opposites the um and the yang male and female night and day fire and water everything in the negotiating room stood in hostile opposition to one another the uniforms alone were strikingly different the nkas north korean armys general kim and his fourman contingent sitting rigidly on the northern side of the table were in stiff highnecked white summer uniforms with red and yellow collar tabs kim was unblinking his only discernible movement a short studied ejection of a sobrainie cigarette butt from a white bone holder before lighting another acrid bluish smoke rising and curling back off the ceiling opposite him on the southern side the un uniforms were of a mix the american general cahill a tall thickset man appeared more relaxed smoking his pipe sitting back in opennecked and shortsleeved summer khaki his south korean compatriot on his right more formallooking wore the roks light blue air force uniform with tie while to cahills immediate left a british brigadier sat resignedly in dark green summer drill the greenbaizecovered table between the two sides was itself marked by division an inchwide white ribbon running its full length the line continuing as a meticulously painted strip up each wall even the beverages were different the north koreans stony expressions during the long strained silence broken only when they sipped steaming glasses of hot green tea the un delegation taking icecold water from a silver decanter carefully placed the same distance away from the ribbon as the north koreans tea directly opposite the norths redstarred flag stood the goldfringed blue of the un standard again both equidistant from the ribbon the strained silence continued and major tae could see a number of visiting us officers outside the viewing windows of the hut growing restless pacing on the white cement strip cameras dangling forlornly it was then that general kim breaking the silence leaned forward crisp white uniform creasing against the edge of the green baize his malevolent smile tae noted a rare departure from his usual carefully practiced stare all americans are taught to lie coming from outside the hut there was the sound of armed soldiers north and south heels clacking on the concrete as the guard changed the nka officer to kims left was tacking up blackandwhite photographs on a map stand purportedly showing the violated area on their side of the dmz as the north korean general continued his accusation on the southern side said kim you have allowed all vegetation to grow wild to camouflage your flagrant acts of aggression against the democratic peoples i unequivocally reject these charges cut in cahill as do my fellow members of the united nations commission he indicated them with a wave of his pipe we are not charging the united nations with violation of the territory of the democratic peoples republic of korea kim spat back we are charging the united states of america for its imperialistic warmongering the united states cahill replied his tone controlled unflustered has no intention of now it happened kim leaned forward again smiling be careful he cautioned cahill stabbing the air with his cigarette his eyes like dark glass or all you americans will end up like the kennedys shot down like dogs in the street this was a favorite phrase of kims to taes relief cahill who had only been on the job for two months refused to take the bait calmly asking instead what evidence the nka had for their accusation about the kite i will show you replied kim confidently with this he rose immediately there was a loud scraping of chairs as he was followed by the entire north korean delegation a second later the three chinese pla peoples liberation army officers who had been sitting in the rear as observers also rose the yellow shoulder boards of their new ranked uniforms catching the light wearily cahill and his colleagues followed suit it was part of the ritual both sides heading outside to the enclosure of hard mustardcolored earth within the joint security area where they were to examine the evidence in the background a voice one of the visiting us officers was asking why do we have to take that shit that rotten insult about president kennedy and for tae it was the most frequently asked question by americans who had bothered to come to panmunjom and he didnt even mention it in his report before the video jerkily followed the two delegations out of the room kims parting shot was you americans do not realize the effect of your defeat in vietnam now everyone in the world knows you can be beaten privately tae conceded that kim had a point the danger as tae saw it was that the united states had tried so diligently to forget the war it was apt to forget its lessons as well what had santayana said those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it most of the vietnam vets were now dead or too old to pass on to anyone who even bothered to listen in america the knowhow of fighting a war in asia for the next two minutes tae advanced the video as there was not much to see the north korean and un delegations standing for over half an hour in the broiling sun the north koreans apparently didnt mind or if they did werent showing it taking what general cahill later described as a typically petty satisfaction in keeping the un team sweating and waiting in the stifling flyinfested heat kim was the only man cahill had ever seen who could tolerate swarms of flies crawling all over his face across his lips in and out of his nostrils and eyes without once allowing himself to blink have you got something to show me or not said cahill if not my colleagues and i propose an adjournment until some signal that tae didnt see must have been given by kim because the evidence or rather a batteredlooking carpshaped kite a dirty orange color about four feet in length four to five inches across was carried solemnly into the cordonedoff compound by two nka soldiers two lines of north and south korean guards grimly facing each other wheres this camera cahill demanded sharply it is being analyzed said kim it is made in japan may we see it i said it is being analyzed the film which we have now developed shows it was a blatant act of imperialist aggression upon the sovereign territory of the democratic peoples republic of korea by us aggressors and cahill turned to his aide a captain jordan from the joint usrok command jordan rolled his eyes skyward ignoring kim cahill took a handkerchief from his pocket and proceeded to wipe beads of sweat from his forehead asking jordan havent i heard this somewhere before word for word general on pyongyang radio all this week when kim had finished his diatribe cahill poked the carps ugly gaping face with the toe of his boot this kim stepped forward menacingly as did his entire delegation do not touch the evidence he shouted suddenly the entire compound was electric both lines of border guards stiffening at the ready hands on holsters each man fixing his opposite number cahill smiled having forced kim to react evidence snorted cahill its a childs kite yes shouted kims aide shifting his gaze from cahill to the rok officer general lee and made in the us lackey state of south korea a childs kite repeated cahill contemptuously blown over to your side by the wind why its not big enough to hold a camera and besides we have the spy machine kim shouted pointing his finger you cannot deny spy machine youve got nothing said cahill turning on his heel leading the un delegation out of the compound we have the evidence kim shouted after him we have the film showing that showing said cahill still walking away the photos youre busy taking today so you can fabricate a case you be careful kim shouted after him be careful you americans you will end up like the kennedys you you be careful said cahill but in a voice he knew neither kim nor the north korean delegation could hear go back to pyongyang you running dog turd cahill turned to his aide christ im getting too old for this nonsense jordan id like to shoot that son of a bitch me too put in the south korean general the video over tae dragged the days sigint signal intelligence and ir interrogation reports toward him there were several blackbird american infrared sr reconnaissance photos taken from eightyfive thousand feet no change in the nkas unit dispositions except for another surfacetoair missile site being built in the taebaek mountains that ran like a spine down koreas east coast tae made himself a cup of coffee and for a moment sat admiring the desk photo of his children mija eighteen was resplendent in a watermelonpink chima the traditional flowing highwaisted skirt with matching chogari or short jacket dyoung eight stood proudly in the loose white pajamalike uniform of taekwondo the ancient korean hand and foot combat sport of selfdefense it was their future he was most worried about he opened the interrogation folder another nka infiltrator caught south of munsan near the west coast as usual hed refused to talk the report stated the prisoner had fallen down stairs even so he had still not revealed the specific target of his mission they never did and so he was put on the train for the prison camp on koje island in the southeast tae hoped that these days koje was more secure than during the korean war when the american guards had been so accommodating in assuring prisoners rights under the geneva charter that the nka had actually managed to kidnap an american general and stage a massive breakout even so tae wasnt naive enough to think the present rok guards hadnt been infiltrated by sleepers nka agents already in place in the event of hostilities for every nka agent they caught tae suspected there were at least four or five who managed to slip across the dmz undetected only one thing of interest had emerged from taes quieter more democratic interrogation of infiltrators captured in his zone that week and it wasnt until after three sessions involving the usual cursory examination of the prisoners possessions that hed even noticed it and decided to add a note to his daily report to seoul he had observed that the chopsticks the nka infiltrators had on them when captured no korean would travel without them were seven inches long instead of the standard nine tae typed his sitrep situation report quickly for he knew that as soon as the general had finished inspecting nighttime readiness of the local usrok fortifications he and his aide jordan would leave for the more civilized environs of seoul hq chapter five shortly after pm heading back to seoul jordan decided to take a chance hed been thinking about it ever since the farce in the joint security enclosure ah general he began hesitantly yes ah ive got a buddy a pilot stationed down south at osan they say hes a real genius with aerial reconnaissance cameratospeed ratios all that sort of hitech stuff so i was just wondering sir say we got a really small nikon and one of those big kites like the ones they have in some of the temples for chrissake said cahill well began jordan defensively it was just a thought we cant see what theyre up to at night they could be tunneling again our infrared overflights didnt detect any of those we found last year we found them didnt we challenged cahill yes sir but more by good luck an infiltrator spilled the beans but normally they never reveal weve got seismic probes replied the general ground sensors yes sir but the problem is the moment the nka go on maneuvers we cant distinguish a tunnel being dug from any number of other noises heavy trucks roadworking equipment all we get is tremor graphs youre worrying too much said cahill wintermaybe when the ground is hard enough for their armor but not now in the monsoons rice paddies all flooded everythingd bog down they were now completing the uturn near the bridge of no return on their left a us army truck sat fully gassed motor running twentyfour hours a day ready to back up and block the bridge to their right stood the yshaped tree that had been trimmed for a clearer view across the dmz and where thirtyone nka regulars had come across in to club and hack two americans to death anyway continued cahill were constantly patrolling the dmz weve got minefields right up to the wire fighter commands on a moments notice attack choppers are ready isnt like it was in fifty dick moment kim or any other gook puts his cottonpickin finger over that ribbon ill chop the goddamned thing off whats our g say no unusual movement there you are but jordan pressed there is this report from major tae the rok intelligence officer up here yes yes said cahill impatiently i glanced at it before we left goddamned chopsticks arent as long as they used to be timber in koreas in short supply always has been so he figures all the wood saved goes into building more chiges aframe backpacks infantry buildup yes sir we know their infantry like the vietcong used to carries everything on their backs so do ours dick said cahill thats why we call em grunts youd grunt too with eighty pounds weighing you down but the general knew what jordan meant yes yes i know he said irritably red armys two legs better than americans four wheels right the car had passed the munsan checkpoint suddenly its brakes squealed the car skidding sideways in an earsplitting screech headlight beams roiling with talcfine dust as custom decreed the driver was allowing an old man in traditional white pajamas to cross the road the mans tall widebrimmed stovepipe hat a symbol of his status of country gentleman i hate those stupid hats said cahill venting his fright at the car almost hitting the old man ever see anything so goddamned ridiculous in all your life whats it good for damned horsehair wont keep out water wont keep off the sun jordan made vague noises of assent but was more interested in getting the general to think about taes hunch than elders hats cahill anticipated him lookit if an attack comes to have any hope any hope at all its got to be hard and fast right yes sir yes and all those backpacks of yours are going to be worth squat all unless armor clears the way right yes sir any sign of armor visual or ground sensor no sir no because its too damn wet moment a tank goes off a road its in rice paddy sinks in the mud he paused how about the canaries they okay far as i know sir cahill was referring to the tunnels the nka had dug beneath the dmz during the seventies which were later found and cemented shut except for a small wedgeshaped peephole in each cement bung a few yards away from each bung there was an rok machinegun post manned around the clock and right by each peephole a canary in a cage as in the mines the birds death would be an early warning in the event of gas attack tell you what said cahill ill issue a bulletin on kbs tv and radio announcing that despite tomorrows independence day celebrations south korean defense forces remain vigilant to any incursion of the north general said jordan happily feigning shock thats using the airwaves for willful propaganda damn right cahill smiled its true too well run a few tanks through town tonight keep you and tae happy and its a darned sight cheaper than a general alert cahill smiled general accounting officell probably give me a medal in addition to my kbm kbm was seoul hqs acronym for kim bullshit medal awarded for patience and restraint above and beyond the call of duty jordan laughed but the worrier in him remained as persistent as an allergy one can do nothing about so you think we should forget about the chopsticks forget the chopsticks theres nothing to it said the general chopsticks arent going to start a war the general was right chopsticks had nothing to do with it the fuse that led to world war iii would be lit by a misunderstanding over red ants chapter six traditionally a korean delicacy when slightly sautéed the ants were sold downtown in glass jars by vendors scattered throughout the myriad alleys and side streets of seouls brightly lit and bustling myongdong district here amid the spicy odors of kimchi pickled cabbage and the cooking of marinated meat throngs of workers from late night shifts were hurrying home before the midnight curfew past the variegated plastic canopies of the pushcart stalls their owners hawking everything from soju octopus and pin daeduk porkandvegetablegarnished mung bean pancakes to the favored tangerines and oranges from the southern island of cheju the crowds shadows flitted through islands of fiercely burning carbide lamps that illuminated the vendors faces as if they were polished china their voices rising bartering becoming frantic in the race against the clock above the alleys in the polluted and unusually cool summer air neons flashed with accompanying urgency in the collective frenzy before the blackout drill which tonight would precede the usual midnightto am curfew the blackouts wailing of air raid sirens yet another reminder as if any of the twelve million inhabitants of the city needed reminding that they were only twenty miles from the border between north and south and two and a half minutes from north koreas bombers and within range of the nkas longrange artillery only the night before one of the south korean patrols continually on duty in the hills ringing seoul had clashed with six north korean infiltrators they had been intercepted while crossing the dmz after a short fierce firefight not unusual along the dmz five of the infiltrators had been shot one dying shortly after south koreas cioc counterinfiltration operations command was reasonably sure the six were from the nkas th guerrilla unit it was this unit from which thirtyone north korean commandos had penetrated the southern side of the dmz on a bitterly cold january night during the infamous mission of armed with ak submachine guns and grenades with express orders to assassinate president park of south korea on the second day of the mission four woodcutters saw them notified local authorities and the hunt was on even so the guerrilla unit reached pugak mountain on seouls northern outskirts and charged the blue house official home of the president twentyeight of the thirtyone north koreans were killed in the ferocious gun battle that followed rifle and machinegun fire and bursting grenades echoing like strings of firecrackers in the hilly amphitheater around the city causing several small brush fires two of the guerrillas managed to escape but one surname kim given names shin jo no relation to the present general kim was caught trading his life against the certain fate of being shot as an infiltrator kim passed over to chungang chongbobu south koreas central intelligence agency all the details of north korean president kim il sungs plan to assassinate president park including the fact that at each of th units eight guerrilla bases in the north there were three hundred volunteers this meant that since over two thousand north korean agents were being prepared at any one time for further infiltration agitation and sabotage against the americans and the south that every day at least one agent was crossing the dmz it wasnt that the north korean agent in the myongdong area this evening before independence day had been badly trained on the contrary he had received high commendation from his base commander in kaesong not only did he know the military dispositions weapons and insignia of all south korean and american units especially those along the eighteen and a half miles of the milelong dmz guarded by elements of the us second infantry division but in addition before being sent south he had been carefully instructed in those local habits and customs that can so often trip up an agent he was made well aware for example of the new words and phrases creeping into the language he was told to remember that even though south korean men like their north korean counterparts expected total obedience from their womenfolk in the south one should no longer use the word sikmo calling a maid a maid but kajongbuhomemaker or home manager in much the same way his nka instructor told him as garbage collectors in america insisted on being called sanitation engineers and the agent knew about the red ants savored by most koreans especially by those from the south the insects were collected from their favorite habitat in the hills around pusan and trucked to seoul on the mile highway that ran almost the entire length of south korea once in seoul the ants like so much other produce were auctioned off to the highest bidders among the street vendors who in turn sold them to shoppers off the fashionable myongdong what better way for an agent to indulge his weakness for the delicacy that he could ill afford in the north and at the same time reinforce his cover as a genuine south korean approaching the pushcart he realized he had only fortyfive minutes to get back to his safe cheap yogwan or inn two miles from the city center before the start of the midnight curfew and air raid drill still he would have ample time if he used the subway the misunderstanding that was about to occur was largely due to the fact that the agent having only just slipped across the han river near kumchon fifteen miles northwest of seoul the previous night had been so busy avoiding rok patrols and settling into the yogwan that he hadnt yet had a chance to sit down and read a newspaper this meant hed missed the twoparagraph story in most of the dailies except the korea times which didnt publish on a monday about the brush fires in the hills around pusan fires that had killed off large numbers of ant colonies reduced supply meant higher prices unaware of the sharp increase in price the agent gave the vendor a tenthousandwon bill about ten dollars for an eightounce jar the vendor waited politely the glass of red ants the customer asked for now costing twice the usual amount his customer waited expecting the jar of ants and at least two thousand won in change then he realized he hadnt given the vendor enough olmayohow much eemantwenty thousand the customer dug deep into his jeans pockets joking weakly that it would wipe out his subway fare the vendor though annoyed did not show it and got a good look at the man remembering the posters as common as theater billboards throughout the city if you see a stranger who does not know the exact price of things or spends a lot of money and hasnt got a job or calls you tongmu which means comrade or friendgrab him he is a spy well he mightnt be thought the vendor then again the vendor had lost both parents when the nka had invaded in sorry apologized the customer i havent got enough thats all right replied the vendor already starting to pack up his stall with the speed and deftness of long experience ill still have some of these left tomorrow or another consignment will come in thanks said the man taking his leave the vendor turned off the carbide lamp quickly asked a colleague to watch his cart and followed the wouldbe customer out onto sejongros sixteenlanewide avenue where he saw the man walking north drawing level with the huge statue of admiral yi the admiral in ancient armor left arm akimbo right hand gripping his enormous battle sword had also been vigilant in his time the vendor recalled alert to foreign invaders defeating the great japanese invasion fleet of the vendor however while full of the spirit of admiral yi couldnt see the yellow light of a police station let alone a policeman where were they when you needed one always sniffing around when they wanted free samples from the cart the only official in sight her smart blue us navystyle cap barely visible amid the hyundais and the noisy red and white buses roaring past was an immaculately dressed and beautiful woman traffic director her white gloves moving with the suppleness of doves in flight but the vendor knew by the time he weaved his way through the river of oncoming vehicles and reached her the man might disappear seeing a taxi sign above the crowd the vendor dashed out to flag it down but it was brown only for military personnel so he had to wait a second until he saw a green cab approaching barging ahead of others in line he jumped into the backseat glimpsing the yellowuniformed woman driver as a blur quickly instructing her to have her dispatcher alert the nearest police cruiser to meet up with them to the vendors alarm he heard the flag drop and the meter ticking what are you doing that for he asked this is a public duty so she shrugged someone has to pay he was astonished but she was very young and he knew that the horrors of the korean war so vivid in his childhood memory must be nothing more than dead history to her generation for an anxious moment he thought theyd lost the stranger as they turned right into yulgog street heading east near changdok palace and the zoo but the young woman told the vendor to relax she still had the man in view and was going to pass him just in case he suspected he was being followed how could he know asked the vendor with so many people about if hes an infiltrator hell have been trained in such things after a few more minutes amid the usual honking and insults to various ancestors a beatenup offwhite sinji sedan drew alongside the green cab two kcia agents the one driving telling the cabbie theyd take over the other asking the vendor to point out the stranger in the crowd suddenly the man disappeared into an alley off the sejong a hundred yards behind them without hesitation the vendor told the cabbie to stop got out and headed back toward the alley the agents swearing pulling sharply into a noparking zone and following suit it was now fifteen minutes to blackout five minutes later at the end of the alley as the air raid sirens began their wailing the two kcia agents caught up with the vendor who was now gasping out of breath were in luck said the younger of the two how dyou mean asked chin sung his older colleague a shorter man in his midfifties he never got on the subway after all hes gone through donhwamun gate so its either changdok palace or the secret garden a strong wind hit them full force in the alley kicking up dust and litter forcing the shorter older agent to lower his head the grit bothering his contacts in luck chin growled sardonically the garden alone covers seventyeight acres candy wrappers and fallen ginkgo leaves their small polished green fans turning black under a dim pole light swirled scratchily about the mens feet for a moment the older agent felt nostalgic for the olympics of then the city fathers had made sure there was no garbage to be seen anywhere on the city streets like the cleaner cities of germany where chin had once been stationed attached to the rok embassy in bonn and trade legation in west berlin well its just about curfew said the younger agent optimistically he isnt going anywhere has to stay in there or risk being picked up the moment he leaves and if he tries scaling the walls weve got him chin grunted looking through the gate across at the pavilions of changdok palace the home of the surviving royal family and toward the lighted wingtipped roof of the pavilion by the pandoji the koreashaped pond pathways radiating from it through maples the wind moving through the trees like rushing water chin took a small walkietalkie from the inside of his coat all units were going to lose him over the wall whoever he is if we dont surround the whole area immediately a voice crackled from somewhere on the other side of the gardens were cordoning it off now you want us to send in the dogs chin shook his head in disgust no i want to keep him in there trap him not panic him retracting the walkietalkie aerial chin turned to the vendor you sure he acted suspiciously could have been a young buck hurrying to the gardens to meet his girlfriend keep her warm during the curfew yes said the vendor im sure im telling you it was nunchi he meant eyemeasurebeyond mere sight a sixth sense and he didnt know the price of the ants continued the vendor everyones been reading about the fires down all right cut in chin gruffly where do you live in chamshil it was the area of dozens of huge lookalike cement highrises clustered several miles south across the han river near the olympic village well get a car for you chin told him pulling out the walkietalkies aerial again will you let me know what happens asked the vendor yes certainly said chin giving the vendor his card and signing a pass through chit for the blackout drill and curfew thanks for the tip said the younger agent soon another unmarked car quietly appeared at the far end of the alley theres your ride said chin as the vendor walked away five minutes before the onset of curfew and blackout the younger agent tried to find out what his older colleagues plan was without wanting to appear stupid he must know hes being followed not necessarily answered chin unfamiliar with the subway maybe mistimed it rather than get caught in the curfew probably decided to hole up for a while stay out of sight till the morning gardens as good a place as any and theres a lot of pavilions in case it rains which he said looking skyward i think it will i think we should go in and get him and if he is an infiltrator what will you find asked chin the young agent thought for a few seconds maybe he wont swallow it while theres life theres hope right look at kim shin jo came down to shoot park gets caught and ends up with a nice suit and eating out peking duck some of the boys tell me that when he wanted he even got to go to the angel cloud house the kisaeng girls pampering and singing to him nice work if you can get it yes well this guy isnt kim shin jo said the older agent pausing unscrewing the top from a dristan bottle and tilting his head back his voice more strained if we rush our boy might pop the pill then where are we he paused snuffling back the nasal spray while screwing the lid back on damn summer cold he turned to the younger agent but lets say theres a slight chance he doesnt know hes being followed that he simply ran out of time maybe he remembered the curfew but not the blackout after all blackout only happens once a month might be doing what a lot of others do just sitting it out so while hes still got light to see by he heads north on sejong to yulgog then straight to the garden before blackout begins so asked the younger agent in the morning we follow him home thats what we want why grab him now if we can get the whole cell you believe he doesnt know were on to him no answered chin but its a possibility old kim shin jo didnt know those woodcutters were on to him either did he you have a point the air raid sirens were reaching full volume and the lights were going out all over the city huge skyscrapers that dwarfed the secret gardens gnarled pines and tile fluted walls suddenly appearing twice as big and brutish in the moonlight you want some gum offered the younger agent gives me gas said chin turning toward his younger colleague but unable to see him the moon now enveloped by cloud even so the younger man sensed the other tensing what is it unless began chin his voice dropping the garden is the meeting place and he has a set planted the younger agent heard his colleague take out the walkietalkie his voice in whispered tones requesting the rdf radio direction finding truck to move in to pick up any signals coming from the garden ah said the young agent hed be a fool to transmit from here in the heart of seoul you remember sorge asked chin germans top communist agent in japan the best of them told moscow japan wouldnt be attacking through siberia so the russians were able to move a million fresh troops from siberia to stalingrad changed the war you know where sorge transmitted from my young friend youre going to tell me right used to give parties for all the big shots in the japanese military aboard his yacht in tokyo bay hed slip away from the party transmit from the cabin right below them he had balls then you think we have a communist with balls here asked the older man snuffling the spray again not what youd expect is it transmitting right under our noses no the young man conceded it isnt after a few seconds he spoke again shouldnt you wait longer with that stuff what asked the older agent nose spray it can screw up your sinuses if you take it too often whose nose is it soon in the darkness they could hear the rdf truck rolling softly down the alley toward the entrance to the secret garden crushing the ginkgo leaves blown down by the summer wind chapter seven in washington it was morning and the president james r mayne was about to go jogging along the camp david trails for the tv crews to get their clips for the evening news but there was a problem the forestgreen jogging suit which would blend in well with the woods and was being insisted upon by the secret service was objected to by the presidents press aide paul trainor trainor was advising the president to wear the white jogging suit which would stand out more in contrast with the woods it was silly and normally jean the first lady would have settled it on the spot but she was away campaigning for the president in the northwest in her absence the chief executive left media tactics to trainor the election was only eight weeks off all polls showing the race would be a cliffhanger mayne was still getting high marks for what looked like another arms reduction treaty with the soviets but his challenger sen j d leyland from texas was batting well too with his promise to trim the federal fat from overused overabused social programs so that he could in fact reduce taxes without weakening national defense maynes election platform was based on his cuts in defense spending directly related as his campaigners pointed out to his muchlauded success in having kept the united states from becoming embroiled in other peoples wars particularly in central america he had also been successful in keeping down the costs of maintaining us bases throughout the world such as the fortytwothousandman force in south korea senator leyland on the other hand was running on a platform charging that america was becoming gravely weakened by her cutbacks in defense and that the presidents nonintervention in the wildcat fires of central america represented not so much a saving in americas defense budget as a bankruptcy of national policy which ignores the demands of us national security and global obligations mr president it was trainor handing him the new york times and washington post latest polls sir they confirmed it was still neck and neck but increasingly the presidents age factor sixtyone against that of his challenger fiftyone was commanding more attention from the press okay ill wear the white suit the president told trainor he didnt like playing the media game but he knew it would be a heck of a lot easier getting things done for the country if he was reelected after the photo opportunity in front of aspen lodges kidneyshaped pool the president and trainor headed out by limousine to andrews for the long hop to california on the way they saw a banner reelect mayne the peace president that said trainor with conviction is whats gonna beat the ass off leyland seems a terrible thing to say mr president but in the long run vietnam may have turned out to be a blessing in disguise for this country well paul said the president on the lookout for more groups of supporters youre going to have to explain that one to me i mean mr president that this country is going to think twice before they let the drum thumpers send our boys out to get slaughtered for a piece of real estate that means squatall when you come right down to it a group of leyland supporters flashed by holding an enormously long banner reading vote leyland and make america great again thats one hell of a drawnout message said the president glancing back take you half an hour to read it yeah agreed trainor look great on tv though theyll have to pan wide to get it all in more exposure by making america great again reflected the president i suppose they mean its time we bombed something flex american muscle something like that responded trainor well if thats what they want from me theyre going to be sadly disappointed chapter eight before dawn independence day the pungent odor of breakfast kimchi and gasoline fumes filling their interiors the riot buses twenty of them wound their way down through the early morning traffic and pollution to central seoul disgorging a squad here a squad there at various strategic positions throughout the city subway entrances in particular were favored by those retreating students hoping to grab a train out of the fray when the riot ritual as the police call it got too rough for them and it would get that way soon enough in the exhausting and exhilarating business of baiting the police amid temperatures that afkn the us army radio network predicted were going to climb well into the nineties with matching humidity creating a fiftyfifty chance of late thunderstorms but now it was still cool as the police quietly took up positions throughout an hshaped grid running northsouth through the citys western sector down sejong and taepweong and in the eastern sector running down changgyeong joining the two arms of the h were platoons stationed along cheong gye the largest concentrations in the left half of the h around city hall of the squads allocated to the protection of us buildings most were stationed outside the us chancery as it unlike the heavily fencedin embassy was immediately accessible from the street maybe itll be too hot for them joked a platoon leader in one of the rear buses its too hot now replied one of those standing in the aisles this gears killing me there was a chorus of mock sympathy and a punching of shields youll have rest soon enough chun said the platoon leader some studentll put you on your ass ill break his head first said chun lifting his truncheon you monster cried out another what if its a woman then ill stick it somewhere else chun retorted someonell have to show you where it is i know where it is chun was twentyfour son of a janitor and a policeman who hated university students with a passion it wasnt only the fact that he had come from a poor family and had missed out on the opportunity to go further than high school that made him feel so hostile toward the students rather it was what he saw as their blatant hypocrisy the same hooligans who would be throwing rocks and insults at him today would in four years time be executive trainees for hyundai samsung or some other giant chaebol while chun would still be a policeman fighting a new generation of students shouting their obligatory antius slogans the latest were drive away the american bastards and down with the government banners scrawled in their own blood oh some of them the leaders were genuine communists and chun hated them the most for inciting the more gullible in the giant reunification rallies thousands of students deafeningly applauded the democratic reunification partys bellycrawling overtures to pyongyang but chun believed most of them were simply out for excitement under the pretense of it being serious political protest it was a lark a time to vent all the teenagers pentup rage against parents forever pressuring them to kongbu haera study study a chance to lash out at police teachers against all the confucianbred respect for authority chun filed out with the rest of his platoon near city hall but designated as a flying wedge his platoon would not remain at any particular junction instead it would be on standby ready to move quickly to reinforce weak spots in the h chun took great pride in knowing he was a member of the most experienced riot police in the world never mind all the cherry beretsthe old olympic policesliding headfirst down ropes like monkeys for the evening news crews or the bluedenimed national police when the big battalions of protesters came out when it went from bricks to molotov cocktails it was chun and the other darth vaders the blackhelmeted riot police who settled it a squad of neatly turned out national police passed by their white helmets wonderful targets for any projectile one of them waved chun nodded with stiff formality the riot police remained aloof someone in chuns platoon said the catholics and protestants were coming out in support of the students so a rookie asked protestants replied a corporal thats how they got their name right protesttants means golchikkoritroublemakers as far as chun was concerned the catholics were no better and if it was true the christians were going to get involved it would be a long hard day students might then win middleclass support the worst possible combination he heard a crackle of radio static another three platoons a hundred men in all were being requested by the officer in charge of policing the square around myongdong cathedral catholic nuns were forming a human chain swaying and singing hymns then there was a call from police hq diverting two platoons to yonsei university in the west less than a minute later an urgent plea came in from korea university campus in the citys northeast this was unusual the students normally favoring innercity streets for their protests where they could best be concentrated to gain maximum tv coverage and where if you ran out of paving stones there were always construction sites plenty of loose brick besides the molotov cocktails made mostly with empty ob and crown beer bottles were much more effective against closely packed police in city streets than on open campuses what was behind the new tactic chun wondered a most urgent call came in for a wedge at the corner of yulgog and donhua about four blocks northeast of the us embassy the first shower of projectiles thudded against the buss thick window mesh as it passed changdokkung palace on the left chun could see the students about two thousand he guessed overwhelming a hundred or so national police white helmets dotting the huge crowd as it swarmed about the entrance to the secret garden a phalanx of placards demanding reunification soon the crowd of students half already inside the gate was expanding contracting and expanding again at once controlled and uncontrollable pushing and pulling its waves surging through the gates spilling into the gardens beautiful said chun those bastards are bottled up inside by the wall perch in a pond he pulled out his club boom boom chun sir youre on tear gas yes sir said chun cursing under his breath he badly wanted to use the stick he broke open the short widebarreled gun and plopped in a canister of pepper gas the most acrid then snapped the gun shut next he tightened his gas mask and flipped down the steel mesh face guard the platoon now in its darth vaders was ready dont be disappointed chun said a muffled voice fire em off quickly then you can go in with the butt perepitv somebody shouted migook american chun pulled the stock into his shoulder aiming high as if readying for a lob shot but the moment the cameras were gone or their view blocked by the wall he intended to fire straight into the crowd and if it zapped one of the protesters full force on the headtough tit accident wedge forward came the command and chun fired four of the halfdozen leaders of the riot all members of the drp democratic reunification party were at the secret garden at the time but this wasnt known until film of the incident was replayed several days after by police by then it was too late the two kcia men at the garden entrance never stood a chance swept along in the irresistible tide of students and riot police much of the crowd lost from view in the gardens where giant billows of tear gas enveloped the ginkgo trees and evergreens like morning mist many of the students eyes burning stumbling blindly into the lily ponds the riot police now in free run clubbing as they went leaving the dazed and fallen to be arrested or clubbed again and dragged away to the buses by the more lightly equipped national police regrouping in the rear the younger of the two kcia men his voice drowned in the cacophony of screaming students fleeing from the gas was knocked down still holding his coat his other hand reaching into his shirt pocket extracting his kcia card the next instant he was trampled underfoot warm blood streaming down his face unable to see he lost consciousness by the time he was picked up his kcia card lost in the stampede and put in an ambulance the only available emergency ward was at severance international hospital all the others were already overflowing from the citywide riots that now included songan university as well badly concussed the agent also had six ribs broken minor cuts and abrasions as well as a split on his left forehead requiring ten stitches in plain clothes being mistaken for a protester he was put in a room under police guard after x rays were taken a upi united press international stringer celebrating independence day with relatives from kwangju in the southwest cholla province had taken his visitors up on the cable car to the top of namsan or nam hill to escape the muggy teargassed atmosphere of the city relishing the cooler temperatures atop the observation tower that rose another four hundred feet above the ninehundredfoot hill with the vast bowl of the city stretching all around them he pointed southward to the site of the old olympics on the far side and to the nineteen bridges that spanned the han river looking northward through the coin telescope they could just make out the tearoom and restaurant atop pugak skyway and beyond it blue smoky ridges that obscured the dmz the wind shifted clearing parts of the city previously hidden by tear gas and off to the southwest they could discern the suburban sprawl running either side of the han spreading westward to the harbor and industrial clutter of inchon twenty miles away beyond inchon there was a metallic glint the yellow sea separating korea from china broken here and there by the gray slivers of american warships the stringer excused himself from his relatives and called the four emergency wards closer to the city center before phoning his contact at severance international around am yes said the contact a nurses aide there was something she could tell him a young man name on the security card lee sok jo brought in about an hour ago had just died brian hemorrhage they thought after repeating the name to make sure hed got the spelling right the stringer exiting the booth and adopting the fourth level or tone due the most elderly of his relatives excused himself to make one more call to upis downtown office he could feel his pulse racing with a civilian dead he knew it was no longer just another riot it was now as his american colleagues would say a whole new ball game within minutes the name lee sok jo was on the wire services all around the world and being simultaneously broadcast on seouls four major radio stations and the us armed forces network in korea by midafternoon students at all eightyseven colleges and universities throughout the rok had declared war on the government for its massive brutality within two hours the riots were nationwide by pm despite official denials lee sok jo had become the latest martyr of the struggle against the oppressive imperialistic regime of the south korean government puppets of washington when fumbling bureaucrats finally discovered that lee sok jo was not a student but had in fact been a kcia agent this information was deliberately withheld by the government for fear it would be seized upon by the students as further evidence that security agents were being used as agents provocateurs and spies against them it was a gift to both the leftists and the democratic reunification party the police could not contain the riots beaten back by hails of pavement stones and molotov cocktails scores of police and students were injured some seriously the worst fighting occurring around myongdong cathedral eight blocks southwest of the secret garden the gardens themselves now all but deserted agent chin called the vendor in from chamshil and replayed as much news and police video as he could get his hands on not surprisingly no matter how many times chin froze the film zooming in for a closeup the vendor couldnt pick out the stranger hed seen in the myongdong from the crowd particularly as many of them were wearing either blue or white gauze masks as protection against the pepper gas whether the north korean agent had reached a phone in the gardens during the night and enlisted the leftists help in getting him out of the gardens or whether hed simply lucked out chin would never know by pm the situation especially around myongdong cathedral was rapidly getting out of control exhausted riot squads chun among them charged repeatedly through choking riotstrewn streets only to find themselves reeling under new onslaughts of stone and fire many driven back so far they ended up crashing into the long congo lines of arrested students who heads bowed holding one anothers waists as ordered were snaking through the rubble herded by national police to waiting paddy wagons at a momentary hush not unlike those experienced in the midst of a village shamans incantations suddenly descended upon the feuding students and police even the endless swirl of humanity about the pagodashaped namdaemun or great south gate slowed to a crawl as a buddhist monk in his early twenties assumed the lotus position poured kerosene over himself and struck a match for a second his saffron robes were as one with the flames his charred torso curling into the fetal position like burnt paper immolations by several other monks in kwangju and in the always politically discontented cinderella province of south cholla injected more tension and violence into the increasingly chaotic scenes of seoul finally at pm that evening south korean president rah felt he had no option but to call in the army for the first time in ten years rioters were confronted with live ammunition the troops were ordered to fire overhead and did so but several firing just as a new hail of projectiles rained down upon them instinctively lowered their weapons their volley tearing into the panicked crowd two students were killed seven badly wounded several democratic unification party leaders were arrested along with most of the known leftist leaders a few of whom the riot police had nabbed in their sweep through the secret garden the government announced it would put them on trial for insurrection kbs the korean broadcasting system yonap and kodo the japanese wire service together with the three american networks and the bbc foreign service had it all live in washington it was now am too late for the visuals and sound bytes to run on good morning america and its ilk but in plenty of time for the networks much more influential evening news broadcasts the arrests triggered further riots leftists and reunification party members under house arrest now called for general strikes but rahs government was determined not to give in at pm radio pyongyang reported that it was deeply distressed by the situation in the south and described in glowing terms the earlier arrival at panmunjom of the more than ten thousand peace marchers from the south pyongyang television then showed pictures of the north and south korean students joyously greeting one another and then as dusk had fallen bidding each other farewell in a moving nostalgic rendition of uriuisowonuntongilour wish is reunification major tae and his guards having watched the rally from the southern side of the dmz were convinced that more students were now heading south than had arrived in the dmz that morning a perfect opportunity tae thought for the nka to slip infiltrators across accordingly he ordered the roks dmz unit at panmunjom to halt everyone on unification highway after they had cleared the dmz and to carry out a thorough identity check the students objecting vehemently as he knew they would were incensed enough to fight but the rok troops stationed along the dmz were heavily armed and less tolerant than riot police besides now that it was dark student leaders knew television coverage would be minimal and so advised their fellow protestors not to resist the usrok search but rather to show dignified solidarity in the face of the imperialist lackeys despite the downpour of a thundershower the single file stretched out for over two miles inching forward each student being searched for arms and false papers the thing that most struck american commentators at the time as well as the south korean reporters was the fact that despite its obligatory use of communist rhetoric pyongyang radio had for once shown some political sophistication and even perhaps goodwill in publicly counseling the students during the liberation day meet at panmunjom not to provoke a confrontation clearly intimating that the north did not wish to do anything that might undo forthcoming negotiations concerning the possibility of peaceful reunification between the two koreas at midnight as usual pyongyang polly came on the radio announcing the evenings reading verse by the venerable and much honored grandfather of our great and respected leader kim jong il the poem pine trees on namsan ending with i will be unyielding while restoring the country though i am torn to pieces major tae there was a long silence tae busy with paperwork as the last hundred or so students were being processed yes he asked pulling yet another file toward him he was tired but relieved that after all his apprehension another liberation day had come and gone without any military incursion from the north to shatter the fragile peace when he looked up he saw a guard drenched by the rain reluctant to enter water still dripping from helmet and boots but as tae rose a smell or perhaps it was the way the soldier moved told him something was wrong well what is it demanded tae the guard turned motioning to someone outside a figure appeared mija she pushed back a wet strand of hair it was a small gesture but tae could not tell her eyes in deep shadow whether she was looking directly at him or not but in his fury his humiliation he interpreted the gesture as one of defiance he made as if to speak stopped then turned away search her he paused shes no different from the rest of them yes sir when the guard had taken her away tae sat staring straight ahead at the small map of old chosunkorea land of the morning calmbut he could not see through tears chapter nine as liberation day had ended a spectacular sunset of huge towering creamwhite cumulonimbus edged with gold the men of the american second infantry division platoon manning op observation post fort dyer were at stand to normal procedure at sundown all along the dmz and a drill that was as old as the roman legions as soldiers stood armed silent straining to hear or spot any movement in the rich green valley of rice paddies below that was turning soft black in the dying light sgt elmer franks standing on the trenchs wooden duckboards was looking through the periscope binoculars he could see nothing beyond the wire soon he would move over to the big infrared scope no color in the picture but contrasting black and white shapes were enough the problem with the infrared scope however was that it was not passive so that rather than simply picking up infrared emitted by a target it needed to project an infrared beam which in turn could be picked up by the other side if they had the right equipment to cover their bets the americans at fort dyer also had a ti or thermal imager which was passive and through which radiant heat from beyond the wire would show up in opaque sections like white blobs on an xray film overhead storm clouds began crashing into each other lightning spitting in the distance franks looked through the ti chapter ten two hundred seventy miles south night mist shrouding her the fast guidedmissile frigate uss blaine part of the seventh fleets carrier screen sliced an oily calm between koreas southernmost point and japans tsushima island off her starboard bow as the ship left the warmer waters of the east china sea heading north into the sea of japan the sweet smell of land wafted by momentarily subduing the rubbery smell of the bridge it was a routine patrol and ray brentwood the tall thirtysevenyearold annapolistrained captain of the blaine was on the bridge halfway through the eighttomidnight watch for a moment brentwood found himself thinking of his wife beth their two young children and of lana his sister in new york whose last letter to him was full of unhappiness about her marriage his eye caught sight of the sign remember the stark taped to the bulkhead and he immediately put all thoughts of family out of mind hed drawn the sign up himself and had copies posted throughout the ship the stark a us guidedmissile frigate of the perry class like the blaine had been attacked in the straits of hormuz in by an iraqi jet firing two exocets only one of the missiles had gone off one was enough thirtyseven us sailors killed asskicking all down the line the captain courtmartialed and behind all the official inquiries families and friends devastated by the loss the sign on the blaine was the young captains exhortation to his crew to keep sharp not to let the boredom or fatigue of a far eastern patrol dull efficiency to remember that for all the wondrous gizmology aboard the uss blaine and wondrous it was the first warning that a missile was going to hit the stark had not come from the ships stateoftheart slq radar but from a manthe starks forward lookout who saw the exocets blue exhaust ten seconds before it hit above all the sign was a reaffirmation of man over machine in the most mechanistic age in history at the end of his watch before going down to the ward room for a snack brentwood made his way to his cabin drew the green drape shut tossed his cap onto the bulkhead peg and sat down at the bare gray metal desk to perform his weekly duty of writing home he smiled at the snap of the four of them taken a few months before during the spring when they had visited beths folks in seattle across from their navy home in bremerton they were all in gaudycolored shorts young john four bribed to grin with the promise of a big mac jeannies sevenyearold smile trying to be sophisticated despite the missing teeth beth petite brunette didnt like the photo unfair shed proclaimed goodnaturedly rays eyes are so nice and blue healthylooking cant see mine for the bags aghh look at my hair said she looked worn out too pale a hundred and four instead of thirtyfour which her mother said was par for the course seeing as how the navy had moved them four times in five years and with two young ones divorce her mother had added ominously was highest in the navyforced separations its major cause nevermind forced separations hed told beth jokingly it was tough enough when you did get together with the kids at this age trying to make love was like planning dday impossible before ten oclock at night by which time beth could only flop exhausted in the living room needing an hour of ann landers and anything that moved on tv to unwind theyd tried getting rays mom to come to bremerton from new york to see the kidsrun interference but she said she couldnt stand the rain what she meant was she couldnt stand the strain didnt like babysitting and having to read the same bedtime story fifteen times with interminable cries of toilet and thirsty ray didnt blame her didnt blame the kids missed them terribly said so in his letter each week but next leave damn it he and beth were going to take off a couple of days up on the olympic peninsula a little place like la push cottage by thundering greenwhite surf the smell of dead intertidal life giving off that fresh ozoney tang and craggy pinecovered mountains sweeping down to the sea he and beth in bed all day then chilled cans of olynone of the diet stuff make love till they couldnt do it anymore he felt the ship alter course slightly strangest thing was he couldnt picture her face clearly after a month out her facial expressions blurred in memory precisely when he thought they ought to be clearest the voice tubes hollow whistle sounded captain here what is it cic sir immediate brentwood grabbed his cap from the peg and headed for the combat information center one deck below the bridge whatve we got he asked entering the bloodred cave of winking consoles bogey not sure sir reported the first officer a blip from five thousand feet hundred miles from us very fast then nothing but scatter at sea level brentwood looked at the situation board the carrier salt lake city was a hundred miles behind them downed aircraft asked brentwood none reported sir brentwood turned to the radar operator what do you think sailor dont think its a black box down sir answered the operator meaning an airliner no sos is it in the alley brentwood asked referring to the civilian corridor between japan and korea yes sir off cape changgi one of the radio beacons acting up suggested brentwood negative sir first thing i checked no steady beeps since first sighting no sir sporadic brentwood studied the chart in the cics subdued light cape changgi was the eastern tip of pohang harbor twothirds of the way down south koreas eastern coast how far are we from the area around a hundred miles sir exactly ah ninetythree point seven miles sir very well flank speed flank speed came the confirmation steer two seven five two seven five announce condition three ordered brentwood condition three sir replied the officer of the watch informing the crew over the pa system the ship was now in the middle of five stages of alert a third of its complement ready for immediate action brentwood rang the galley for a mug of coffee and glanced at his watch he estimated they should be off pohang shortly after dawn chapter eleven at fort dyer sergeant franks checked the thermal imager again no movement but the usual noise of north korean loudspeakers from which pyongyang pollys seductively soft warm voice wafted through the rainy darkness as usual exhorting the americans to desert the reward for turning over a radio franks noted had held steady at two thousand won while the amount paid for defecting with a helicopter had increased slightly to sixty thousand there wasnt going to be any war she told them unless the gangsters in seoul and their guerae migook american puppetsinvaded the democratic peoples republic of korea in which case the loyal workers and peasants of our great respected leader and teacher would repel the aggressors are you lonely private long asked the sexy voice who wouldnt be you are forced to stand guard for the corrupt lackeys in seoul and washington while you are standing in the rain your capitalist bosses are sitting in their warm mansions enjoying their women and their wine they send young men like you away from your families you think they would come in your place private long a newcomer from yongsan base had been warned about this personal approach bullshit he grinned at his buddy but he was shaken it was an unnerving experience no matter how often youd been told to ignore it particularly when she started in with personal details that you thought were unknown to anyone else least of all the north koreans to make matters worse the volume of the speakers was now so loud to compensate for the thunderstorm that long knew she could be heard all over she mentioned his fiancée joan would she remain faithful to her soldier so far far away private long of course your friends will look after joan make sure she wont be lonely why dont you come over there are nice girls in pyongyang sweet dreams for private long everything about the korean night was alien the monsoon was different the stench of human feces used as fertilizer rising from the rice paddies revolting even the sounds of the insects were different he ached to be back home sergeant franks called the platoon corporal to take over the ti scope so he could go and talk to young long halfway down one of the sandbagged trenches radiating from the bunkers hub franks heard an explosion minefield someone yelled franks cocked his m swung it onto the sandbagged parapet lights two oclock three searchlights swept and crisscrossed the dmz he saw tracer arcing leisurely toward their position mark and fire shooting erupted from both sides a searchlight tinkled and died the firing kept up flare ordered franks this was followed by a loud pop and night became flickering day it was an errant musk deer one of its hind legs missing the other caught in the fence frantically thrashing against the barbed wire the animals huge soulful eyes bright beneath the dying flare its doglike bark growing louder get a light on it said franks and taking careful aim shot it dead soon everything was quiet again except for the reassuring hiss of the monsoons rain following normal procedure fort dyer reported the false alarm to big blue the situation board deep in the underground headquarters in seoul twentyfive miles away in seoul the meteorologists forecast more rain chapter twelve in the predawn darkness off koreas east coast a hundred and eightyfive miles south of the dmz six bombers were coming in low their undersides white the remainder of the fuselage a navy blue the russianmade tum backfires were traveling at mach the sea a leaden blur beneath them their wings fully extended rather than in the sweptback position sacrificing speed for greater maneuverability each bomber its nineton load the equivalent of several world war ii squadrons carried two sevenhundredpound cbu cluster bombs each of these containing smaller threepound bombs set for a dp or dispersal pattern saturation bombing three onethousandpound iron or highexplosive bombs and ten onethousandpound concretepiercing bombs the remainder of each bombers load around eleven thousand pounds made up of fifty twohundredpound faes fuel air explosive a close relative of napalm all six planes in tandem vformation were under strict orders not to activate either their bee hind guncontrol radar in the rear barbette of each aircraft or the down beat attackandnavigation radar situated in the nose both sets involved using active signals and any emissions from them could bounce high enough off the water to be picked up by lowhorizon scanners some of them on the coast about pohangs sevenmilewide harbor and one at cape libby near the eastern terminal of the transkorea oil pipeline another near the barracks of the us marine corps advisory group south of the bay an rok destroyer in pohang harbor managed to get off several bursts from its quad radarcontrolled millimeter cannon before its radar was jammed the backfires made only one pass over the harbor airfield and environs thus denying rok ground control a second chance to lock on to any of the planes infrared signatures on a second run one pass was all the backfires required their cluster bombs splitting open releasing eighteen hundred threepound high explosive minibombs and incendiaries and six fae pods the pilots now miles beyond the craterpocked airport could see the faes thickenedgasoline canisters bursting on impact filling the air with a fine aerosol covering camp libby and the entire dockside area then in the few additional seconds it took for the silvery gasoline mist to ignite over the big oil tank farm at camp libby creating a raging inferno covering several square miles the six backfires one losing speed because of a hung bomb banked in thunderous unison streaking inland toward the big air base at taegu fortytwo miles three and a half minutes away behind them the entire city of pohang and the storage dumps were afire flames leaping madly hundreds of feet into the air fanned to firestorms by the stiff east breeze that had assisted the bombers on their run in of the five thousand casualties in the first ten minutes of the raid the lucky ones were the twentythreehundredodd who died outright from suffocation due to the sudden loss of oxygen as the fuel bombs exploded for the remaining victims flesh melting like plastic their agony overwhelming any emergency services that were still operating the final hours were a horror of bloodied screaming shapes once human stumbling grotesquely through the ruins many of them begging the few soldiers who had survived the holocaust to end their agony with a bullet still flying low the backfires lighter now came in faster over taegu each aircraft releasing its twelve onethousandpound concrete piercers the pilots all the time half expecting to be attacked by phantoms but there were no american fs in sight or rather none that could fly after the meticulously coordinated early morning sabotage attacks by nka infiltrator cells all across the south some of whom had been waiting years to hear the last two lines in pyongyang pollys rendition of pine trees on namsan the backfires threeman crews pilot copilot and electronics warfare officer could hear nothing but the panicking radio traffic of the roks taegu ground control and the comforting scream of their bombers twin kuznetsov afterburners speed indicators moving steadily from mach to as the planes gained speed and height over the mangled airstrip that had been taegu base the sootcolored spars and ashes of the gutted fs receding far below like spilt campfires turning hard right the backfires climbed northwest up over the black bulk of the fivethousandfoot sobaek range its peaks hidden by the monsoon into which the bombers now sped finally the hung bomb on one of the backfires released disappearing into the wilderness as the bombers dropped low again over ulchin tandem v intact wings swept back for maximum speed heading fast and low over the sea of japan as dawn broke on the dmz sergeant franks could see the dead deers leg still trapped in the barbed wire by the time it occurred to him to ask himself why the animal would have suddenly jumped the series of cow fences between the north koreans and their carefully plowed minefields it was too late several miles to the west driving wildlife frantic before them ninetyfive of general kims i corps dark green tanks upgunned chinese versions of the russian ts were racing toward kumchon seven miles south of the dmz preceded by the turretless ungainlylooking but highly efficient plowandroller t mine clearers that had startled the deer and other wildlife the deep tank traps in which rokus command had placed so much faith were easily forded by t bridgelaying tanks their unfolding steel lattice spanning sixtynine feet across the traps eight feet more than rokus intelligence had thought possible behind kims armor came support battalions of motorized infantry their millimeter heavy mortars already putting down deadly fire on the flanks of the roads that the tanks used to breach the dmz on a fivemile front but this attack for all its shock was only a feint kim unleashing the main nka thrust a quarter hour later farther east down the western prong of the wishbone whose junction was uijongbu only twelve miles north of seoul from here the nkas historic fourth division in recognition of its blitzkrieg attack of that had so astonished the world was assigned the task of quickly smashing its way down the uijongbu corridor to seoul and so while all usrok attention was being focused on the smaller and totally unexpected breakthrough around kumchon in the west kims fourth armored division of men with the first second and third motorized rifle divisions in support half choking from the subterranean dust streamed out of five undetected fumeladen tunnels six miles south of fort dyer and three other usrok forward observation posts overrunning the eastern road of the uijongbu wishbone major taes sector didnt come under attack until after the first exchange of fire three miles south of the dmz around munsan at the bottom of the big u formed by the imjin river before it flows into the han estuary and then to the yellow sea with the exception of a lieutenant who stayed behind to help him destroy classified files tae ordered his staff to head for the big shelter near the swissswede un observers hut threequarters of a mile away only minutes before a mortar shell hit the quonset hut ripping open its roof leaving an enormous hole at least twenty feet across through which tae and the lieutenant could see bruisecolored storm clouds passing swiftly overhead in the distance they could hear the rolling thunder of the nka artillery seouls position to the south behind them clearly indicated by towering columns of black and gray smoke rising to join the rainladen stratus that had come streaming out of the north theyve even got the weather on the run said the lieutenant bitterly tae didnt respond he was still gazing up through the hole that had once been the roof of his briefing room where only a day or so ago he had told a contingent of visiting american officers of his fear that the nka might invade that in an age when nuclear war was so feared by both sides conventional war would ironically be the only alternative the one kind of war for which the democracies particularly america were least ready to fight the lieutenant kept feeding the fire theyd made for the classified documents but his attention like taes kept wandering skyward as they waited anxiously for the reassuring chuffing sound of gnats the cobra choppers on twentyfourhour alert which should soon appear squadron after squadron of them filling the sky cannons spitting their wing pods winking tae told the lieutenant that coming in at over six hundred miles per hour the effect of a ninetyfivepound hellfire antitank missile against the armor of the older russian and chinesemade ts and lighter pts would be like watching a tin can hit with an ax but when tae saw only a few of the helicopters silhouetted against the raincurtained sky to the south he feared the worst that the networks of infiltrators all over the south had struck in deadly unison though he tried not to show it the shock was such that he did not hear the lieutenant who was now crouching by the radio telling him that forward american observation posts were reporting more chinesemade ts crossing the dmz in force the usrok minefields unzipped by the nkas creeping artillery barrages as the americans voices faded radios transmitting only static until this too ceased pyongyangs radio signals grew in strength giving horrifying descriptions of the riots in the south pyongyang polly repeatedly referred to the deaths of several monks and of lee sok jo as undeniable evidence of the unprovoked violence against our brothers and sisters in the south who no longer able to tolerate the oppression of the american warmongers have called for us to come to their aid in their hour of need under the leadership of our great and respected leader kim jong amid deafening earthshattering noise dust and screams that signaled the nkas advance on his sector a strange calm visited tae it was as if now that the worst certainly his worst prediction had come true a great weight was slipping from him now whatever the danger the terrible nerveeating suspense of all his years on the dmz was finally over his persistent requests that us radar stations not be lit up at night against the american assertion that the whole point was to let the north see what they were up against his part in the long hard battle almost lost against carters intention to pull out altogether from korea all had been to no avail it was the end sir the lieutenant was pointing outside tae turned his hopeless gaze from the turbulent sky to the brown dusty window of his office across the white cement strip that marked the old demarcation line and where several us marine guards lay dead he saw nka assault troops greenmustardsplotched figures fanning out a hundred yards off encircling the hut he cocked the m and opened the canvas bag of grenades motioning to the lieutenant to help himself the lieutenant a much younger man in his early thirties was drained of color a mere ghost in khaki trying to talk his throat dry as leather with fear tae adjusted the sights knowing this was it as ready as he ever would be all the names of the roks informers were in seoul headquarters tae keeping only situation reports from the forward ops in his sector the names of the roks top five counterinsurgency agents two each for pusan in the southeast and kwangju in the southwest one for taegu were in his head too important to put on any piece of paper not that theyd seemed to do much to thwart nka sabotage so intense was his calm that tae felt as if he would momentarily nod off even as the lieutenant almost apoplectic with fear continued racing from window to window as if a different view would present a more comforting reality the thing that kept tae from total surrender to the impending catastrophe was the thought of his family there was a crash of glass the lieutenant spun around and fired a long burst at the far window the hut ringing with the sound of the bullets piercing the corrugated metal it hadnt been the nka at all but a piece of loose guttering giving way the lieutenant sweating profusely tried to stuff more grenades into his pockets fumbling dropping two scrabbling frantically for them under the desk as if they were gold tae felt sorry for him but it was the detached feeling of an observer as one felt for a trapped fish that is until the major thought once more how neither of them would see family again of how none of those trapped would ever see loved ones again unless they could somehow hold hold until the us air force out of japan two hundred miles to the east out of the yellow sea to the west out of anywhere could launch air strikes on either side of the dmz and drop ammunition and supplies to the beleaguered troops until ground relief was possible it was a fantasy for his sector and he knew it but any delay he and the lieutenant could inflict on the nka might save someone further down the line outside there was an increase in the din of the battle all through the joint security area clouds of dust from grenades exploding whose he couldnt tell he caught a glimpse of a mortar being set up two hundred yards off opened up with his m and saw the bullets kicking up dirt about the mortar crew the nka soldiers disappeared in a small depression for a second or two all tae could hear was the steady thumping of artillery then came the highpitched rattle of aks their rounds going too high to do any damage only raking the huts eaves but frightening the lieutenant very badly the next bursts were lower but still too high to be dangerous next tae could hear the pomp pomp pomp of either ts or lighter pts multiple grenade ejectors spitting out smoke bombs that quickly covered the entire joint security area with a dense white cloud the nka platoon nearest the hut was obviously waiting for one of the tanks to save them the bother and simply roll through the quonset probably not even bothering to waste a shell for some inexplicable reason tae found himself noting the time seven minutes to ten and it struck him how it was an illusion that such situations as he was now in take a long time to resolve that in fact most of the firefights over the relatively open ground would be over quickly it was only in the hills and mountains where the terrain lent itself naturally to defense that a single engagement could stretch into hours days and even months he heard a flapping noise then more thunder in the distance artillery or real he couldnt tell it began raining heavily and the flapping noise ceased it had been the huge scale map of korea in the huts briefing room shredded by the wind but now sodden with rain and flattened against the wall a large strip where the yalu river had marked the border between china and north korea missing theyre gone said the colleague in astonishment i dont see anything mov soryong it was coming from where die nka had set up the mortar but like the lieutenant tae couldnt see anything and there was something odd about the voice for a moment taes ears ringing from the sounds of battle couldnt tell what it was tae soryong major tae how began the astonished lieutenant how do they know your name everyone knows my name said tae the lieutenant wasnt sure whether to laugh or to be more terrified than he was for it suddenly dawned on him that in the battle swirling about them presumably all along the dmz this brief pause about the lone quonset hut might have been a conscious decision by the nka they wanted tae tae admitted it was possible it would explain the poor shooting the aks going high into the hut merely to keep heads down until the political officer reached their position but how about the roof the lieutenant asked tae the mortar shell a lucky shot said tae or unlucky depends on your point of view the nka officers voice was starting up again and tae realized what was strange about it it was coming over a batteryoperated megaphone or some kind of loudspeaker mounted on a vehicle the voice was explaining in english to any us or rok soldier within or without the hut that the army of the democratic peoples republic had no wish to hurt major tae they simply wanted to talk to him comrade to comrade and if his friends cared about him and themselves they would stop all resistance it was all quite hopeless anyway the voice told them the entire sector was surrounded give us the major comrades there will be a big reward the major will be safe otherwisethe voice warned it would be very bad for everyone inside the quonset the lieutenant laughed nervously i could earn a few won he said adding just as quickly that of course he didnt mean it it was only a joke tae nodded understandingly he knew it was a joke tae heard something clattering above them on the roof and lifted the m ready to fire loose guttering the lieutenant said hurriedly tae was watching the jagged circle of steelgray sky why would they want him surely the names of the roks top counterinsurgency agents in pusan taegu wherever wouldnt be any use to them now unless like a long line of conquerors before them they wanted to teach a quick lesson to the occupied population to show unequivocally that whoever opposes the party in thought word or deed whoever dared oppose the beloved leader would be publicly denounced and executed to demonstrate conclusively that underground resistance was futile tae vividly recalled old villagers telling him how the british and american soldiers had feared the north korean guards more than the japanese the cruelty of the north koreans so infamous that the mere threat of handing prisoners over to the nka had been enough for the nkas allies at the time the chinese to quiet their most intransigent american and british pows theyre waiting said the lieutenant sweat trickling down his neck i know tae soryong major tae came the tinny voice you have five minutes to surrender or your comrades will die chapter thirteen in a revetement area six miles south of uijongbu tank troup commander lt george clemens field glasses scanning the luxuriant green of paddies and blue mountains beyond felt his skin itching an infallible sign as if he needed to be reminded that he was in an acute stage of excitement after all this moment was what he had been trained for dreamed of and wanted all his adult life since he was a boy the behemoths of the battlefield from the huge cumbersome monster pillboxes on tracks that were the first tanks in world war i lumbering across the fields of france to the blitzkrieg panzers of rommels north africa corps churning up the sand in the western desert had awed him they were for him like a ship selfcontained an island of war above all free to move and everyone knew the tanks would decide the ground battles despite what all the air boys said about the deadly saturation fire they could unleash from choppers and ground support fighters he was sure that once the battle was joined the confusion of smoke and dust cloud would mean particularly at night that for all the fancy arsenal of the airtoground missiles the fight would end up like that of a dogfight in the air tank against tank the very kind of dogfights the experts said would never happen again after world war ii because the planes were so fast so modern until it happened all over again in the skies over vietnam one on one his m tank the abrams was the best main battle tank in the world the brits had tried to better it with the challenger the west germans with the leopard but in the last five years it had been the m that had consistently won natos canadian cup the top tank gunnery competition it was enough for clemens that the tanks design from its long millimeter gun to its low profile and sloping armor plate hull which mitigated all but a direct hit put it ahead of the others in its class other features that made it exceptional were the c laser range finder and airconditioning to insure longer crew endurance times clemens had grown up with the m from the early days of congressional heat because of cost overruns the months of the temperamental test engines till now he had kept the faith above all and this rather than any technical explanations is what had won most congressmen over there was the experience of sitting in an abrams its fiftyfour tons accelerating from zero to twenty miles per hour in six seconds moving over rough terrain at forty miles an hour dust flying the engine roaring but not screaming and that turret steady as a billiard ball on green baize its low body hence low silhouette riding on a cushion of independent suspension the likes of which had never been seen before it was a thrill not easily forgotten apart from the sheer ascetic beauty of it it meant that the m at top speed fifty miles per hour could fire as if it were standing still when in fact racing at a speed that had once merely been a dream in what some experts had thought was a mad designers eye as clemens waited then saw the greenbrown camouflage of the first p the tin can of the nka appear on the uijongbu road he almost felt sorry for them until he remembered how murderously and mercilessly they were shelling seoul killing american and korean women and children indiscriminately tae had always been prepared for invasion and as he had a plan for his family he had one for himself his plan predicated on the assumption that in most mens lives the glass would be halfempty rather than halffull even so it was no comfort amid the rage and dust of battle that he had long predicted an allout attack by the north for in the end each man who had taken the oath of loyalty to the rok would have to make his own decision the line between surrender and cowardice often so nebulous in the split second of combat as to have little meaning he saw the lieutenant in front of him quaking at the thought of surrendering now only one hope remained not that the rok or us army would counterattack both were in disarray nor did he suppose the nka would treat him kindly the war within a family was the most ferocious the most unforgiving his only hope he believed lay in the cyanide issued to all front line intelligence officers the safest place for this tae had discovered was not the teeth most people ground their teeth at night or in the wristwatch for the communists would take this not so much for its material value but because a watch in solitary confinement was a comfort often it was the only thing by which one could measure the passing of the hours and seasons sometimes the years the very act of measurement of recording a day at a time was a way of staying sane the orifices of the body too were unreliable not only because they were often searched by the enemy but there would always be danger of a capsule or in this case a small chewinggumike strip of concentrated potassium cyanide breaking in the body releasing its poison accidentally tae had studied the problem as diligently as he had the matter of the different lengths of chopsticks in this case it was a german research project into tunneling mine and avalanche disasters that had caught his eye wherein german scientists had tried to find out the most reliable place to insert a small microchip beeper to send out a signal in the event of a cavein it had been discovered that the most reliable place on the body was a workers boots for unlike shoes or any other form of clothing these nearly always remained no matter how many tons of debris or harsh treatment the body had suffered it wasnt a foolproof plan of course in battle boots were often claimed as bounty particularly in peasant armies and besides a man without footwear was more a prisoner than if you put him behind barbed wire unable to run very far in bare feet and tae also knew that footwear was sometimes removed for purposes of torture but generally except for their laces which like a prisoners belt were removed as possible instruments of suicide boots he knew were left to prisoners of war for a very downtoearth reason namely that in the heat of battle moving captives quickly required it at considerable expense tae had a fake heel made and in it placed a cyanide capsule the nka knowing that such was the prerogative of any rok intelligence officer privy as tae was to sensitive counterinsurgency material tae then had a small flexible gumlike sliver of potassium cyanide developed by the americans sewn within the doublelayered tongue of the boot where even if his nka captors searched the boot flexing it feeling for hidden razors and the like the gumlike strip would bend as one with the leather it was for this reason that despite the shock and smell of battle the clouds of phosphorus tear gas and the hiss of spent shell casings in the monsoon rain an extraordinary island of calm lay within him for the major carried with him if it became necessary the ultimate choice in any mans life the choice of the moment he would die he prayed he might not have to of course but if as american colleagues were fond of saying things got too rough and he felt he couldnt keep the names of the top antiinsurgency agents in the south from being given to his nka captors then it would be his moment not theirs he looked at his watch the five minutes theyd given him were almost up of course they might shoot him there and then but he doubted it then again he placed the m on his desk glanced up at the surly sky for a moment then walking to the door asked the lieutenant to open it frantic with fear and the sense of urgency the lieutenant jerked the door handle toward him as tae raised his arms the lock on the door always temperamental wouldnt give when finally it gave way and tae walked out hands high he heard the lieutenant coming behind him murmuring in shame but more in relief its the right decision sir the nka squad leader in dustcovered green and khaki battle uniform his face a smudge of camouflage paint waved for tae and the lieutenant to come over toward them quickly the nka were very professional no friendliness but not the rage that tae knew the front line troops often exhibited under fire along the dmz the squad leader up close he reminded tae a lot of his younger brother in seoul an accountant had tae manacled hands behind his back and scribbled a note on the label that one of the others had looped loosely about his neck the squad leader detailed two men of the squad to take tae to fourth division hq immediately now four other men two americans two rok who had only reached the slit trench a hundred yards or so behind taes hut before they came under fire took their cue from tae and surrendered these four as well as taes lieutenant were also manacled and the nka squad commander bayoneted them their severed heads stuck on posts around the quonset hut it was very important the squad commander reminded his eight men that they use the bayonet as much as possible as a round not fired in action was a round wasted he then ordered them to collect all weapons and ammunition in the area that had been abandoned by the imperialists mostly rok soldiers hastily retreating ridding themselves of anything that might inhibit them as they ran to catch the last trucks and jeeps out of the area while most of the machine guns had been spiked and were of no immediate use they would be collected by mopup teams and sent back to pyongyang to be melted down to make new weapons for the democratic peoples republic the m rifles many of them intact along with ammunition clips would be immediately used to arm comrades overrun in the south as they were given the simple choice join the nka or be killed news of the decapitations at panmunjom the squad leaders superiors knew would quickly spread through the fleeing rok regiments and bring the nka many new recruits in this the nka was aided and abetted by general cahill who ordered news of the atrocities to be beamed via the three us highresolution kband satellites to show the world the kind of people he was up against believing that it would help galvanize the american publics support for koreas defense what in hell was washington doing anyhow as far as his shattered local communications allowed him the general also beamed news of the atrocities to his retreating american regiments the message here was more brutal apart from total victory the only way out of korea would be in a body bag chapter fourteen supported by guns including over two hundred sovietmade millimeter corpslevel howitzers which the south koreans did not even know the north possessed the invasion front now stretched seventeen miles from kims tank and rifle regiments in the west to his four divisions east above uijongbu a newsweek reporter filed a story about how the big russianmade millimeter howitzers part of the price moscow had paid kim il sung for sending a small but politically highly symbolic contingent of nka volunteers in to aid the soviet invasion of afghanistan were all mobile with selfcontained tractortrucks and sixteenman crews who were laying down huge variablebag charges and highexplosive shells at a round a minute hurling each twohundredpound projectile over seventeen miles into seoul when the story reached newsweeks tokyo office en route to the united states an editor did not consider the part about the circumstances under which the ussr had given the north koreans the guns to be of general interest and that section was cut as being too dry in fact the circumstances under which the guns were given by the ussr to the nka would have profound implications within the next seventysix hours not only for the beleaguered usrok forces in south korea but for the rest of the world meanwhile the world looked on stunned by the rapidity of the nka advance and the concomitant humiliation of the americans in one brilliant move primarily through the use of the tunnels the nka had not only succeeded in launching an attack beneath and beyond the dmz in several places but in doing so had now trapped over ten thousand forward troops of rokus command which had included major tae and his intelligence unit in what was already being called the squeeze box caught between kims troops who were overrunning the dmz and his four crack divisions over fifty thousand attacking farther south from the tunnels the zone between the two nka armies was to be a killing ground unless the surrounded americans and south koreans could somehow fight their way out through an escape corridor blasted out by the us air force it was a dim hope for at the same time as the backfires attack on pohang was taking place all the major air bases throughout the south including those at ulsan and pusan thirty and sixty miles south of pohang were attacked by small mobile heavy mortar units of activated nka infiltrators trained in the th guerrilla units at kwangju in the southwest an infiltrator group was caught in the process of setting up an eightyonemillimeter mortar for a concentrated triangle of fire fifty rounds for the mortar neatly stacked in carefully prepared and camouflaged dumps this early alarm saved the six f phantoms normally parked at kwangju but the other airstrips came under withering twentysixroundsaminute heavy mortar fire effectively destroying the core of the usroks air interceptor defense a defense that in the war had blunted the nkas dash southward to pusan the war however and vietnam particularly the north vietnamese communists siege of khe sahn had taught the nka and the chinese volunteers in that war that while enemy air power alone could not win a conventional war its ability to play havoc with your supply lines and to resupply its own troops giving them valuable breathing space even to the point of enabling them to mount a counterattack could be formidable for general kim the only answer to this was the present byorak kongkyok lightning warin which the primary objectives the enemys air bases had been taken out by the nkas own air strikes or as in most cases had been rendered inoperative so swiftly from within that the united states even with its massive reserves in japan and its b bases in okinawa would be unable to catch its breath before korea was lost chapter fifteen at dawn heading south down koreas rugged east coast a supertanker the mv new orleans had requested rok coast guard assistance several miles north of pohang she reported that whatever it was that had struck her a shiptoship or airtoship missile she was badly holed in her stern had lost control of her rudder including the auxiliary and was now drifting while one of the three rok destroyers in pohang harbor was ordered by roks area fives southern command to remain behind on picket duty just beyond cape changgi the other two destroyers were sent to assist the tanker out of fear that a massive spill oif south koreas famed beaches would feed the inferno on pohangs waterfront or rather what was left of it after the backfires sneak attack the tanker was now a mile from the two rok destroyers themselves a quarter mile apart their captains deciding the best way to harness a towline before trying to deal with the problem of the hole in her stern not yet visible because of the headon angle of the tanker as dangerous as the salvage procedure would be in the deteriorating weather both skippers were greatly relieved at having the opportunity to haul the leviathan away from the coast it would recoup part of the acute loss of face which they were suffering after having failed earlier to detect the approach of the lowflying backfires though they guessed correctly that at that moment there were many others throughout the length and breadth of south korea who could see courtmartials stretching before them indeed the nka infiltration units had been so successful that the problem facing usrok hq was that if everyone were to be courtmartialed who should be particularly those who had parked their fighters in rows instead of staggering them the armed forces attorneys general would have enough work for the next ten years however morale was so low that seoul hq decided that to call so many to account at once would only further erode the armys confidence and add to the already acute embarrassment of seoul and washington proceeding slowly through increasing fog the two rok destroyers were a quarter mile from the tanker when she dropped the hinged panels on both sides of her flying bridge launching four exocets at what was effectively pointblank range the first destroyer hit both on the bridge and in its guncontrol radar antennae managed to get off one of its elevenhundredpound harpoons the missiles aim thrown off however by the cluttering images of its own bridges flying debris it missed the tanker by a wide margin the second rok destroyer was already a mass of flame both exocets having exploded at the waterline the fuel tanks ruptured men drowning in oil undeterred the tanker jamming the picket destroyers radio calls for help maintained a steady heading toward pohang harbor using the southern curve of yongil bay not hit by the bombers earlier in the day as a reference point its quaint oldfashioned jumble of hotels rising higgledypiggledy above neat rows of advertisers red white and green beach umbrellas on the golden crescent of yongil bay confused and terrified tourists including members of the local pohang pelicans who earlier had been readying for their monthly predawn dip when the backfires had appeared were now stunned as the city proper across the big bay and now the destroyers continued to be consumed by the fire as the tanker appeared emerging from the early morning haze it appeared to be disintegrating as if one of the waiters from the sun day hotel commented pieces of it were peeling off no information could be gained from pohang central telephone communications and roads having been cut by the bombers raid only two inhabitants in all of yongil bay could remember anything like it the great fires lit by the retreating usrok forces over fifty years ago when in pellmell retreat from the pursuing nka the americans and south koreans had frantically gone round torching massive supply dumps denying them to the communists this time however pohang had been attacked not by nka artillery but by its air force the backfires flown by norm korean veterans who had served in the syrian air force in the arabisraeli wars and who against all prediction had come in so low on the final run before the hop over pohang and taegu that they had been no more than forty feet above the waves it was for this reason that the uss blaine now approaching the area at had earlier picked up only one of the bombers as a faint and inconclusive blip on its radar at a fisherman trying his luck six miles off cape changgi in windscattered mist saw that what those on yongil beach had thought were pieces of paint or scales flaking from the giant tanker were in fact swarms of apcs amphibious personnel carriers and other assault boats carrying two thousand nka marines and flanked by two nanuchka guidedmissile patrol boats all had slid effortlessly from the tankers rollon rolloff stern cavity each patrol boat armed with a twin fiftysevenmillimeter aa gun a single seventysixmillimeter aa gun one thirtymillimeter generalpurpose gatling and two tripleloaded n natodesignation gecko airtosurface missiles with a range of six nautical miles it was not realized at the time but these were the first nanuchka class iiis the west had seen as soon as she understood what was happening her radar and radio signals to the us naval advisory group in pusan still jammed the lone rok destroyer off cape changgi joined battle engaging the two patrol boats at a range of eight nautical miles she destroyed one of the nanuchkas with a harpoon missile but the other patrol boat closed in a fast weaving pattern to six nautical miles putting the destroyer within range of the nanuchkas sans firing all six missiles the patrol boat hit the korean destroyer with three of them it was not the explosions themselves that did in the destroyer so much as the resulting fires amid the massive structural damage fires that could not be fought effectively as most of the water lines had been severed or punctured by whitehot splinters the russianbuilt missiles slamming into the ship at six hundred miles an hour the fires heating the aluminum superstructure caused massive blistering on and between decks filling the air with highly toxic fumes from incinerated plastic moldings the fumes alone responsible for half of the destroyers eightythree casualties thirteen of whom had been killed outright by the missiles impact disgorged from their mother ship like sharks from the belly of some great whale the armada of landing craft in all wasted no time heading toward pohang beach churning the gray sea white while a flight of twenty bulbouseyed kamovs rose from the bowels of the supertanker their distinctive doubledecker contrarotating rotors catching the weak morning light as they passed over the wakes of the assault force armed with airtosurface rockets under each stubby wing and millimeter nose cannon ten of the twenty kamovs each carrying twelve spetsnaz or special force troops ferried a mile beyond the beach the other ten kamovs took another spets twentyfive miles inland south to the kyongju junction on the vital east coast rail link between pusan and seoul to thwart any possible counterattack from what was left of the american base at camp libby or from the usmc advisory group garrison two miles south of yongil beach nka commanders knew the beach must be reached in under twenty minutes for this to happen the first wave of commandotrained assault troops plus combat engineers had to be in action the moment their amphibious tracked vehicles hit shore they would be followed at threeminute intervals by a second and third wave each containing more riflemen and antitank weapons followed by the fourth and final wave of a battalion of forty pc plavayushchiy amphibious tanks each upgunned to a millimeter cannon instead of its usual millimeter gun and sprouting a standard coaxial millimeter machine gun atop its cupola but going in with the tide as planned the amphibious tanks capable of ten kilometers per hour in calm water now reached as much as thirteen kilometers per hour the increased push of the surf helped conserve precious fuel that would otherwise have been expended in powering the tanks hydrosteer jets but the saving in fuel was offset by serious steering problems as spray from the wakes of the amphibious personnel carriers ahead now too close in front salted up the tanks extended periscopes this caused several of the pc tank drivers to steer blind the result in the heavy surf was over two dozen collisions five of them fatal as the twentyfivefootlong fourteenton tanks tore off each others trim boards between glacis and nose plates each of the doomed tanks horsepower watercooled diesels driving them under before power could be shut off despite the loss the nka commander knew that the advance force of spets ferried in by the first ten helicopters held the key to success at pohang beach and already he could see them through the binoculars establishing a small but highly concentrated perimeter of fire fed by hundredroundperminute aks pkms millimeter light machine guns heavy mortars and if needed twentyfivepound sagger antitank missiles in all over two thousand nka regulars a small but superbly trained force were involved in the pohang strike on a onekilometer front the nkas big gamble was that if the second spets ferried twentyfive miles inland could sever the vital arteries of the seoulpusan expressway and seoulpusan rail link then pusan the east coasts major naval port would be isolated infiltration units already having cut the alternate route between pusan and taegu farther inland with the beachhead at pohang consolidated by additional troops securing it in depth air strikes could then be launched from pohang field against the usrok naval installations at pusan not only would the headquarters of the rok navy be in the hands of the nka but the vital sea link to japan and its formidable us garrison would be severed as the ragtag usrok army unit of less than six hundred men hurriedly assembled from the remains of camp libby clambered into armored personnel carriers setting out to counterattack the beach they were about to become the first victims of what in the dry technological jargon of ballistics research was called the development of improved sleeve design it was something that the doomed and already demoralized american and south korean troops could only have known about if us intelligence had penetrated an elite soviet guard regiment us intelligence had not done so and consequently there was no way for the men in the usrok counterattack from fort libby to know that the new sleeve design for the standard soviet and chinese millimeter round increased not only the velocity of the depleted uranium bullet but also its penetration capability on the beach at pohang this meant that the very fast eightandahalfton americanbuilt m armored personnel carriers each powered by an eightcylinder chevrolet engine and capable of transporting thirteen men were stopped dead in their tracks the nkas sovietmade millimeter rounds fired by sovietmade pkm light machine guns not only penetrated the ms hulls but traveled so fast that even after penetration of the apcs hulls a single ricochet inside the personnel carrier was capable of killing or wounding several men a full burst often as not put the entire thirteenman squad out of action the bloody scenes described later by a few survivors of the pkm slaughter of the ms could not begin to convey the extent of chaos and panic inside the jampacked carriers falling bodies and loose weapons often doing as much damage as the ricocheting millimeters themselves from that time on even though any objective assessment of the defeat of the american and rok troops at pohang beach showed that this was due as much as anything to the overwhelming force and professionalism of the attacking nka spets blame shifted quickly to the inadequacies of the ms aluminum hulls and though the army would not admit it after pohang us and rok commanders had great difficulty in persuading men to be transported to the front in the ms the army kept touting the personnel carriers advantages including its unmatched speed of fiftyeight kilometers per hour but us officers in all theaters remained unsuccessful in trying to have the carriers loaded to their full capacity of thirteen the ageold superstition about the number thirteen reinforced by the disaster at yongil bay but if the penetrating millimeters had surprised the usrok forces at pohang this was as nothing to the far greater shock that was to come chapter sixteen in seoul miles northwest of pohang deep in the subterranean headquarters of the usrok defense force the extent of the nkas daring initiatives was only now being fully realized as field reports slowly found their way through the nightmare of a frantic bureaucracy and broken communications one aspect of the invasion that was becoming clearer with each new report was how successful the coordination of the nkas attacks had been one of the most difficult of all the military arts such superb timing evidenced a professionalism that even dedicated anticommunists like cahill begrudgingly admired for the civilian population towering columns of black smoke seen all over the south were testimony enough of just how widespread and effective the nka infiltrators and regulars had been however the most stunning news in seoul that morning of august was that following the nkas breakout southward through the tunnels both pincers of kims army had now reached uijongbu junction in all two hundred thousand nka troops were massing less than ten miles north of seoul for the final surge down the uijongbu corridor general cahill knew that professionally he was finished unless he could buy time to pull a macarthur launch a massive amphibious assault at a weak point somewhere along north koreas western coastline and push inland cutting the nkas supply line which due to their present rate of advance might soon become dangerously overextended the initial reluctance of seouls stateoftheart headquarters to believe that a fullscale disaster might befall them originated in a faith bordering on evangelicallike confidence in hitr or hightech readiness cahill general lee and the other commanders in the top echelon had relied too heavily on such indicators as vibration sensors along the dmz these however as predicted by cahills aide proved as deficient in the spongy terrain of the monsoon as they were efficient in the hard frozen ground of winter when any armored invasion was supposed to happen now seoul was relying heavily on two last aces the first a direct and normally militarily sound tactical descendant of world war ii an elaborate system of highexplosiverigged rail lines culverts highways and bridges throughout the south where there were no natural culverts or bridges enormous concrete slabs had been built either side of the highways with all roads already assigned code black all cahill had to do was order the recdet remote control detonation units to pull the switch and mountains of debris would come crashing down forcing the nkas armored and motorized divisions to a standstill and if the nkas armor couldnt move its infantry couldnt advance in the face of the usrok millimeter artillery that was answering the communists barrage at least this was the theory the other ace seoul hq had up its sleeve was the cobras two hundred of them armed with gau armorpiercing thirtymillimeter cannons and walleye antitank bombs which once the enemy tanks were identified by the onground laser source would home in riding down the beam blowing the tank apart fifty were based at kunsan a hundred miles away on the west coast another fifty in the center at taegu the remaining hundred at osan thirty miles south of seoul cahills disappointment was too much for him to bear when he heard they no longer existed many of the captured saboteurs immediately executed by the rok had been sleepers working at the various air bases for civilian contractors and it wasnt until an hour after the first nka shells shuffling through the air in their strangely muted staccato had started crashing into the south korean capital that the first reports about the cobras reached cahill among the pile of other sabotage reports and assorted debacles and it wasnt until the radio message from fort alamo a mile south of the dmz came in reporting firing in the distance but no breakthrough in their sector that cahill and his staff realized the nka had simply bypassed many american camps on or near the dmz leaving the isolated american strongholds for piecemeal destruction later on it was the delay in such reports reaching him rather than the contents of the reports as later charged that made cahill reluctant to signal washington with a defcon advisory to put all us forces on a war footing with his communications in such chaos verification of reported conditions at the front was at times impossible and the last thing he had wanted was to be accused of panic he also knew it was possible the nka was feeding false information he had assumed for example in accordance with his standing orders that at least half the cobras would already be in the air shortly after hostilities began with weapons freed clearance and in action all along the dmz what had actually happened and what cahill wasnt told until three hours later was that while the first messages from osan reported only a few helos afire in fact most of the remaining choppers had been destroyed by either mortar splinters or infiltrator sniper fire what had fooled those reporting the damage was that so few choppers were on fire but this was not due to any lack of shrapnel or snipers but to the cobras plastic inert gas fuel tanks their honeycombed interior specifically designed not to burst into flame when fired upon it was only later after ground crew felt safe enough to go out on the tarmac that they discovered the extent of the damage the cobras riddled by rifle fire that had easily passed through the thin fuselage slicing and mashing the maze of electronics and hydraulically operated controls in taegu the nka infiltrators didnt bother to set up mortars because of more frequent patrols operating out of the air base itself and from camp carroll ten miles away instead they simply hijacked four threeton trucks shot the drivers and crashing the mesh perimeter drove directly onto the tarmac into the line of twentyfive parked cobras demolishing million worth of aircraft and ordnance in less than eight minutes at the same time osanni ammunition dump for the koonni air range on the west coast south of seoul blew when two of the nkas kis kim il sungs suicide squads drove a oneandahalfton jeep packed with dynamite through the checkpoint killing the two mps on the main gate before slamming into the dump the shock waves of the osanni explosions were felt several minutes later in seoul the pall of coalblack smoke rising ten thousand feet curdling virginwhite cumulonimbus that were sure to bring more rain hope the cavalry arrive in time cahill said grimly from the control bunker whose atmosphere had rapidly changed from alarm to near panic as the blue aura normally cast about the ops room by the big board was increasingly pierced by the flashing of red lights each one signifying another position overrun by the nka troops some of whom were now only nine miles from seoul cahill ordered the detonation of all demolition charges along the uijongbuseoul highway it was the first in a series of hard decisions it meant that eight thousand usrok rear guard units fighting their way down the highway were lost but at least the demolition would force kims armored columns off the roads into the flooded soft paddies and by that time the cavalry planes from the seventh fleet and bs from okinawa would be overhead pounding the crap as cahill put it to general lee out of the nka armored spearheads the tanks especially the lighter pts would be sitting ducks until the nka could move the rubble of the demolition you think the fleet planes can turn it around asked lee quietly determined to keep the tremors of impending defeat out of his voice how about the nkas mobile sam sites theyll get a few of our boys no doubt answered cahill calmly so will their fighters but the mig s are no match for our fs and the smart bombs anyway general our flyboys are the best and yours of course best planes besttrained people in the world this was all true but what army general cahill had overlooked not surprisingly given the myriad complexities of modern conventional warfare was that the laserguided smart bombs can only be smart when a laser beam can be bounced off enemy targets by real time laser designators or target markers that is a mobile laser source like the man with a mirror signaling the cavalry in the old west had to be in the area where the aircraft would be attacking in any event the nka fearful of the us dominance of the air in both the earlier korean and vietnam wars knew this well and its artillery in close support behind its advancing armor was laying down heavy hexachloroethane shells producing dense curtains of smoke which played havoc with a laser beam slicing it up into segments in effect slicing up the signal outside uijongbu kims fourth armored was encountering stiff resistance from rok reservists who had been carrying out maneuvers that morning near camp la guardia two miles from uijongbu reports to kims headquarters indicated that the unexpected rok resistance had forced an nka column off the highway rok rear guard units reported the same thing to seoul hq cahill was buoyed by the news by what he called the first major tactical blunder kim had made cahill was now convinced that if he could force the other nka columns off the roads and keep them off until the weather cleared enough for his fighters to zero in he would halt the entire advance stopping kims legendary fourth division alone would mean blunting the nka thrust toward seoul and giving the hardpressed retreating usrok divisions an enormous psychological lift for so far the nkas fourth had penetrated the south korean defenses with such stunning speed that news reports around the world of the latest nka advance were virtually outdated the moment they were broadcast cahill was equally aware that should he fail and the capital fall the impact on the rok and us prestige would be devastating the prestige of the communists dramatically increased cahills hope of help from the air was another dream quickly punctured when a squadron of twelve american f phantoms managed to scramble aloft out of the chaos and confusion that had once been seouls kimpo field streaking into the rainthick sky above the dmz reaching mach they suddenly found themselves in combat with fifteen migs diving on them at mach from the higher thinner air us intelligence had known since late that as part of building up the nkas overwhelming advantage in numbers of combat aircraft to the souths moscow had begun delivering fortysix mig flogger and su fitter fighters to north korea following kim ii sungs visit to the soviet union the previous spring and so it wasnt the appearance of the russianbuilt fighters that was a shock to the pilots of usafs seventh tactical fighter wing but rather the small blips which turned out to be ass airtosurface antiradiation missiles the as while something of a loafer compared to the speed of other airtosurface rockets and no threat to the phantoms was nevertheless a potent killer of antiaircraft missile sites and via their onboard computers ten ass homed in on the roks four hawkeye and nikehercules batteries hurtling in at seven hundred feet a second the twothousandpound missiles failed to take out the roks missiles but wiped out the batteries radars which provided the hawkeye and nikehercules with their launch vectors it meant that in the first day of the invasion roks four surfacetoair missile battalions as against the norths fiftyfour were rendered useless the loss in fighters to the nka was seven migs shot down by the phantoms it was a high price for both sides but in neutralizing the rok missile batteries the norths migs had opened a window for further as attacks leaving south korea woefully understrength in antiaircraft defense on the dmz elements of the nkas second armored held in reserve until fourth and first armored had broken out into the south were now reported crossing the dmz in force despite some determined firefights forts dyer cheyenne and all other forward observations posts in area from kumchon in the far west to a point fortythree air miles east beyond alamo a third of the entire dmz were now overrun in many of the trenches leading from the usrok control bunkers fighting was hand to hand and private long so recently wooed by pyongyang polly was one of the first americans killed in world war iii decapitated by an nka splinter grenade in terms of usrok prisoners taken that first day over seven thousand the most humiliating of all was the capture of lieutenant general hay commanding officer i corps at his uijongbu hq while he was in the midst of organizing his eleven rok divisions and one us division for a counterattack that never materialized in seoul there was utter panic and confusion as the firing of over two thousand massed guns along the dmz continued the and pound highexplosive and white phosphorus shells tearing through the raingray air thudding into the cluster of usrok targets in and about the south korean capital millions of panicked civilians clogging all roads leading out of the capital prevented rok armor and infantry from getting through to mount effective counterattacks the fleeing mobs were soon out of control terrorized by the thick acrid smoke which they thought was some kind of poison gas because of its yellowish tinge the latter in fact a result of seouls polluted air and burning briquettes which many households had stored for the coming winter trying desperately to escape many were caught in running battles with squads of riot police who were trying just as desperately and futilely to clear the roads for military traffic which was now backed up as far as chamshil iron bridge olympic park and the sports complex the shell of the main olympic stadium holed in several places and burning despite the determined efforts and initiative of chamshils fire brigade who finding water mains severed coupled hoses and used the olympic swimming pool as their water supply three of those in the retreating millions heading frantically for the bridges over the han were mija her younger brother dyoung and their mother for major taes family the possibility of forced evacuation from the capital had always been presented to them as a distinct possibility by their father and long ago the family had reluctantly promised him that in the event of invasion they would head south with everyone else for civilians he had told them there will be no honor in remaining warning them to go go as fast and best as you can where her lover jyunghun was mija had no idea she tried to phone but all civilian and most military lines had been cut hours before one of the few who were not trying to leave and whose family was busy at work in the holeinthewall rooms that he grandly called his factory was the owner of the magic cloud souvenir shop off sejongro selling north korean flags faster than his family could sew them as the nkas barrages were a matter of rolling indirect fire pinpoint accuracy was not needed so that changes in the artillerys fourteen variables from wind velocity and humidity to gun jump due to barrel elevation at the moment of firing didnt matter as much as they normally would it was only important for general kims gunners to know whether their fire was hitting the city the only parts general kim did not want to hit if he could help it were the bridges as their destruction would delay the nkas progress over the han down the chengbu expressway to the western plain and taejon the southern railhead for the seoulpusan and seoulkwangju lines for this reason alone kim instructed his gunners to be guided by the forward observers firing no farther south than yongsan barracks if possible the agent who had escaped from the secret garden was one of those whose job it was to act as forward observation officer and he was doing so from namsan hill where only yesterday in the vibrant sunlight tourists had been enjoying the view of one of the fastestgrowing and most westernized cities in asia beyond the citys punch bowl the flames strangely beautiful against the scudding overcast the agent could see that a good part of the northern suburbs was also afire especially he was glad to note the area immediately around the blue house a few errant shells like those hitting the olympic sites were overshooting exploding buildings around the mosque and some fires were starting in itaewon whose bars and girls served or rather had served the yongsan base the fact well understood by the agent that sooner or later he would die in the barrage the ninehundredfoot hill he was on being the central grid reference or aiming point for the artillery was a given he was only one of many volunteers who with their powerful shortwave radios were calmly reporting the dispersal pattern of the guns fire indeed even as he spoke he knew there were other agents atop pugak mountain on the citys northern perimeter sending in their reports by pm all the bridges over the han except three the panpo and hannam leading to the kyongbupusan expressway and the songsan bridge leading to kimpo airport and inchon were finally clogged solid with refugees the air filled with a rancid mixture of pickled cabbage sweat and cordite the republic of korea was teetering on the verge of total collapse for even if the fighting was to go on a simple but terrible truth was becoming slowly but inexorably evident to seoul hq it was one that no journalist and certainly no politician would utter let alone a military commander who cared anything for his career nevertheless it was a fact that the best troops in the american army as in all armies were those who wanted to be where they were rather than those who had merely enlisted with some vague hope of learning a trade or of escaping what academics called socioeconomic ghettos those enlisting with the highest educational qualifications got first choice of postings and korea despite all the stories of the easy availability of women in seoul came in well after west germany in the gis list of preferred postings and the best of those who were in korea those who had volunteered for duty on the dmz on the front line from fort apache to camp pelham were now trapped gone from the big blue board in seoul hq where the nkas overwhelming superiority had now all but turned the board red the remainder of usrok i corpss eleven divisions ten of them rok one us now withdrawing from uijongbu were simply not up to anything like the standard of the fiveyear term soldiers of the north korean divisions in the sudden shock of the nkas highly professional attack where rapidity of movement had been everything in the early hours of engagement these usrok ground troops had quite simply been outclassed and in the confusion and contagion of impending defeat men who had been trained a hundred times in mock battles often with live ammo being fired overhead froze in the initial bowelchurning terror of real combat and so did not move fast enough to capitalize on any holes that did appear in the nka advance this was especially true in the case of three infantry battalions on maneuvers in the whiskey sierra tango training area ten miles north of la guardia and in falling water on the outskirts of uijongbu nine miles north of the capital by late afternoon the situation in seoul had deteriorated so badly with millions of refugees now choking all nineteen bridges over the han that general cahill was about to make the bravest to some the stupidest to others the most militarily sounddecision of his entire career far to the southeast off cape changgi the sea mist took on the aspect of moody ghosts rising one minute returning the next inside the blaines combat information center the radar operator saw two or three more blips appear in the radar sweep then more soon they were a swarm captain what have you got asked ray brentwood calmly fishing fleet with news of the nka invasion flashed to all us ships the radar operator wasnt sure whether the skipper was fooling in any case he pressed the computer for a readout of the unidentified blips speed forty knots sir patrol boats looks like it sir satellite confirmed satellite confirmed answered the operator but no flag brentwood put down his coffee looking intently at the small white squares with the white dots inside them signifying unknown surface ships radio traffic negative sir range fifteen miles and closing very well send message unknown vessels this is a us navy warship on your zero eight five request you identify yourself and state your intentions aye aye sir the message was sent and the blaine waited there was no answer repeat message ordered brentwood aye aye sir again there was no answer call general quarters ordered brentwood general quarters general quarters all hands man your battle stations look for skimmers instructed brentwood alert for skimmers repeated the ood the lookouts on the bridges wings lowering their binoculars scanning the graying sea looking for a flash in the distance anything that would indicate a missile coming in low under the radar screen in seoul general cahill ordered all but three of the nineteen bridges blown and with the weather clearing firmer ground in the offing he could finally unleash his heavy fiftyfourton ms americas main battle tanks to buy time for the massive american reinforcements he was sure would come major tae had been pushed into one of the long columns of over seven thousand battleshocked and bedraggled south korean and american prisoners of war taken along the dmz who were now trudging along in the mud of flooded roads the forced march confined to side roads passing lush green paddies and brownish shrubcovered hills seventy miles in all from panmunjom east to chorwon only a few miles south of what just fortyeight hours before had been the dmz now they were being herded southwest again heading back toward uijongbu it would have been half the distance to go straight from panmunjom to uijongbu but the speed of the nka advance was such that the administration of prisoners always low in the priorities of an attacking army had gone awry tae like other intelligence officers with labels about their necks ticketing them for interrogation found himself pushed from one column to another and witnessed the mounting frustration of the nka guards these were fanatical young reservists who didnt seem to know where they were going themselves and took their frustrations out on the prisoners screaming at pows too weak to go on as if they alone had been responsible for the guards confusion instead of the victims of it at first there were enough ablebodied men among the seemingly endless columns of prisoners to aid those too weak to go on putting them on makeshift stretchers of bamboo poles and rain ponchos but as exhaustion and lack of food weakened the stronger ones as well the bayoneting began some of the guards taking obvious relish in killing those south koreans who had showed any signs of camaraderie with the americans some of the americans tae saw were obviously being killed for their personal possessions particularly watches and muchcoveted cigarettes tae had wanted to help on several occasions but fear for his own safety made him hesitate the warning about the watches swept through the columns but did little to stop the slaughter as prisoners were now being pulled out at random by the aktoting guards and searched if they found anyone trying to secret something away or not surrendering it immediately the prisoners death came slowly and brutally the guards using rifle butts in a fury that tae with his coldly objective eye recognized as a savage product of pyongyangs ingrained hatred and envy of americans in general it also came from the lingering fear of all guards in all armies that if they arent tough enough the entire mudsloshing column of prisoners might rush and overwhelm them through sheer weight of numbers the kind of rush the japanese had traditionally made preferring death to the ignominy of surrender the best way to keep control the guards obviously thought was to execute any prisoner for the slightest sign of disobedience the terror of randomly being chosen for death was so palpable in the column that every now and then there was a panicky movement like columns of ants climbing over one another as men on the columns edges sought greater safety by pushing farther into it to tae who had been in the front line of the counterinsurgency war for so many years the murders of the americans did not come as a surprise of all the communist countries the north korean regime was unquestionably the maddest what did disturb him was the extent of the savagery toward the hated migooks so that by the time the column reached chorwon more than forty americans had been butchered more than anything else it told tae that the communists feared no retribution that they were quite sure like the north vietnamese before them that they were going to win so they feared no reprisal an american next to tae his left eye bloodied and sodden the dressing slipping down his face tripped in a mudfilled pothole instinctively taes right hand shot out to steady him the next second tae heard shouting the mustardcolored water splashing about him as prisoners stumbled away from him and the young american a heavy thud and taes head shot forward a burning sensation in his shoulder blades as he sprawled in the mud he heard the guard cock the kalashnikov and looking up saw the bananashaped magazine curving down toward the wounded american soldier the skin around the americans good eye crinkled in a smile as he fixed his gaze on the south korean major thanks buddy he began the kalashnikov jumped the sound of the bullet echoing through the lonely rainy valley either side of the column the guard swung the semiautomatic toward tae about to pull the trigger again when he saw the label hanging from about taes neck and began screaming that tae shouldnt be here waving his hand back in the direction of the dmz shouting that tae should have been taken west to divisional headquarters at kaesong tae got up unsteadily from the mud the white of his eyes so marked in contrast to the mud that he looked like a minstrel clown he replied in as nonthreatening a tone as he could that hed gone where hed been ordered during the incident the column had not stopped only a few heads turning back out of curiosity the savagery visited upon the american having already become the norm as tae knew only too well people could get used to anything an nka sergeant superiorooking unusually tall for the nka came bustling up chastening the guard hadnt there been an explicit order about conserving ammunition the guard quietly turned the tables on the sergeant by dutifully pointing out that the collaborationist south korean major should have been shipped back to divisional headquarters for investigation the sergeant frowned tae realizing the label had even more power than he had realized glad he hadnt taken it off at least it might buy him time perhaps even special treatment though this he knew could end up being followed by much worse than what was being meted out to the column leaning forward the sergeant wiped the mud from taes collar the patch of newer cloth showing where the majors pips had been before hed torn them off and thrown them away when the random killing had begun you follow me the sergeant told tae sergeant may i request a favor what is it the sergeant asked sharply the americans identification tags could i have dog tags said the nka sergeant in english exuberantly i study english at beijing foreign language institute ah said tae noncommittally the sergeant cut the dog tags cord with his bayonet with the tags there was a small gold cross on a slim chain which the sergeant pocketed his god did not help him he said grinning handing the dog tags to tae tae said nothing and dropped the identification disks into his tunic pocket the sergeant was now going through the americans wallet taking out won bills he saw tae watching him and suddenly became rigidly officious this is for the peoples army he said i was looking at the photograph said tae quietly the sergeant handed him the wallet with an air of stiff magnanimity you may have it thank you said tae the sergeant waved down a motorbike and sidecar its driver and passenger caked in mud the engine spitting and coughing as if it were about to give up any moment ahead tae saw the long column of sodden american and south korean soldiers fatigues clinging to them like black wrap as they continued trudging along the narrow flooded road that disappeared into another misty valley it was the most hopeless sight he had seen the sergeant ordered the driver to take the south korean major ahead to uijongbu explaining that he was an important prisoner to be debriefed as soon as possible there was an argument ending with the passenger in the sidecar getting out grumpily and stalking off with the guard whod shot the american to the rear of the column the sergeant ordered tae into the sidecar and started binding his hands with twist wire tae wondered if theyd let him keep the wallet at uijongbu he took his only comfort in the cyanide strip hidden in his boot it was doubtful he thought that theyd take his boots away from him the bike moved off slowly sliding at first in the mud the sidecar ahead of the bike the sergeant pushing then it picked up speed and straightened tae looked back at the murdered american a khaki heap in the rain wondering who he was chapter seventeen washington dc it was breakfast time the sharks were hungry and press secretary trainor having strongly advised the president to spend a day or two at camp david being presidential meeting with arab heads of state now gladly offered himself for consumption enjoying the cut and thrust with the pack some of them former colleagues a few still friends but shouldnt the president be in the white house it was from some young hotshot blonde at the post her white lace bra clearly etched beneath the tight white silk blouse and black tie that only accentuated her femininity rather than conveying the nononsense toughpresswoman image shed intended trainor responded smiling assuring them that the president is receiving regular reports on the situation in korea what he didnt say was that the last report had been received at am four hours ago pm in korea trainor saw the young reporter scribbling frantically about to launch another question but in all the excitement shed forgotten to predicate her first question by indicating thered be a followup trainor pointed to the atlanta constitution who did announce he had a followup mr trainor weve had reports from kodo news service that north korean forces are already halfway down the peninsula can you confirm this well with the dmz being already halfway down the peninsula mr burns id be surprised if they werent a chuckle from one of burnss colleagues a mistake thought trainor dont alienate them i know what you mean mr burns no we dont have any information that would confirm that or would deny it get it over quickly thought trainor no ah miss vogel she was a tall older frecklefaced woman they called string bean who had seen four presidents come and go her favorite technique was to let the eager pitchers go first then shed step in with the curve ball mr trainor and no crappola her expression seemed to say when did you last hear from seoul and i have a followup this morning trainor answered you crafty old bitch and i know your followup precisely when was that trainor paused say you dont know and youll be assigned gofer status tell her it was four hours ago and your informations got whiskers on it trainor had never had to deal with a military incident this size before but he knew enough that in modern conventional warfare let alone nuclear strikes four hours could turn defeat into victory or vice versa earlier this morning he answered ms trainor looked puzzled trying to read the name on the press pass of a newcomer giving him time to regroup his defense she was a honey blonde goodlooking about five feet four inches cool blue eyes miss roberts she said does the president plan to remain at camp david until the new hampshire primary trainor struck a thoughtful pose giving the question its due both hands on the lectern remembering that the opinion polls were showing a surge in support of mayne as the presidential candidate least likely to involve the united states in military actions around the world especially in another quagmire in asia trainors strategy of getting mayne off to camp david over the weekend before he could make any premature statement about korea left senator leyland plenty of room to lose himself in how hed deal with the korean situation stay away from it mr president trainor had advised ask anyone in the street where the hell korea is they dont have a clue over there somewhere the olympics one time the president trainor answered has full confidence in general cahill commanding officer of all us forces in korea and in the republic of koreas ability to repel the incursion thats a new one a reporter muttered in the first row incursion trainor wasnt happy with his answer either but only because he had mentioned cahill first and not the rok he couldnt mention president rah of south korea even his own people had serious doubts about his commitment to democratic rule the best you could say was that the old fox as they called rah in korea was more liberal than anybody in pyongyang how big is this incursion someone shouted from the back ah the information we have john is that its regimental size the blonde from the post was on her toes both hands waving in the forest of other hands pen mikes and barely controlled mayhem how big is that she called out willing to show her ignorance of military dispositions the moment she sensed trainors throwaway nonchalance as a little too cool how big is that she repeated loudly stretching to her full height the lace bra threatening to burst right out of the blouse a beefy middleaged west german reporter from der spiegel looked at her as if appraising a good leg of lamb depends he said to no one in particular but with his eyes fixed on her it means two and a half thousand men in the nka nine hundred in the us quite a difference she said the germans bottom lip protruded ja i think he wants you think american nine hundred trainor was pointing to someone else in the front row as the blonde sitting down pressed the german how come theyre so different in size she tried to read his name from his press card but it was hidden beneath his blue suede jacket very confusing he answered nka is based on the russian regiment you see they only have the same firepower though as a us regiment now the post was really confused so theres no difference really the german held his hand up for her to be quiet his attention shifting to trainor someone probably a plant he thought was asking for the administrations response to senator leylands accusation that the apparent debacle now overtaking one of americas foremost allies was an example of the serious implications of president maynes cutting of the defense budget trainor loved it it wasnt a plant it was a gift from heaven he could take the high road if senator leyland wishes to disparage our allies and use this incident to inflame sword rattling then of course hes free to do so this administration this president has repeatedly said that the security of the united states has no price and quite frankly im er im somewhat taken aback by the senators apparent attempt did he use the word debacle yes came a shouted chorus no tv at camp david called out another there was laughter trainor shrugged all i can say is that debacle is an odd word to be using only hours after some violations of the dmz have been reported but if senator leyland is so desperate for votes that he wants to characterize theyre shelling seoul arent they thats not new retorted trainor they were closing in on him but he saw a way out gentlemen and ladies he was flushed but it was anger they were seeing not embarrassment if you people spent as much time in korea as you did in the he almost said tel aviv hilton but stopped himself in time in the middle east youd realize that in korea as in the middle east incursions take place every week along the korean dmz and that there have been several false alarms already as recently as july we had the hands shot up again are you saying then that this is a false alarm no im not saying that there are significant numbers of troops moving but ah as yet we dont know the full extent an aide slipped in from behind the podium keeping his eyes low out of the glare deposited a note on the lectern and was gone despite the heat rhetorical and that coming from klieg lights trainor felt his gut go cold general cahill the note informed him had ordered the three remaining bridges leading south out of seoul to be blown within the hour trainor didnt read the rest of the page or notice the fact that cahills decision signified much more than the imminent collapse of seoul because the subway stations of hapchong yongsan ichon oksu and kangbyon all on the north side of the river had been gutted by nka infiltrators earlier that morning the three bridges to be blown songsan leading to kimpo airport tongjak bridge seven miles east leading out of the city from yongsan and niblo barracks and chamshil iron bridge near the old olympics site all packed with high explosives ready for destruction were the only escape routes left for millions of civilians still trying to flee the city and there would be no time to clear the bridges even if they could be cleared by the time set for demolition all trainor knew was that his and national security adviser schumans plan to distance the president in order to underplay the situation was collapsing around him mayne had to get back to the white house and fast the news conference amid howls of protest the scratching of chairs and dousing of lights was called to an end trainor excusing himself smiling nodding saying no comment trying to avoid the snaking tv cables that despite his strict instructions to have them coiled and bound with fluorescent tape seemed as disorderly as ever waiting to trip him up if it was a coldblooded military decision on cahills part to blow the three bridges it was a hotblooded affair for the millions of terrified civilians mostly women and children and elders their screams heard above the screams of artillery some stumbling near death pressed into three enormous funnelshaped escape routes converging on the three remaining bridges many people on the outer edges of the funnels spilling off others shoved aside down embankments into the now putrid river or trampled to death by those behind in the unstoppable force that was five million trying to flee the razored hail of hot steel the nkas fourth division met its first really sustained resistance around uijongbu in doing so the nka tied up so many of the rear guard elements that the nka special forces corps on the western flank driving south from munsan to reach the han three miles west of seouls western outskirts easily forded the han in an armada of lightweight canvas boats under cover of heavy smoke chapter eighteen melissa lange was one of pacific northwesterns brightest and most beautiful her sweptback ashblonde hair and wide sensitive eyes turning heads wherever she went on campus she didnt flaunt it but she knew she had it which made it doubly hard for her to understand why david brentwood down to his candycanestriped shorts was standing in the middle of the room glued to the tv its bluish aura intensified by the soft peach lighting of the room and the heavy drapes shutting out the morning sun youll catch cold she said they can fight the bastards he said got to give em that behind abcs sam donaldson there was a gray highrelief map of south korea four wide red arrows curving down from the dmz converging on seoul holy cow said david shaking his head look at this there were pictures very shaky bad sound tracks of the bridges being blown the air full of black smoke and dirtcored waterspouts then a very wobbly shot as if the cameraman had stumbled of the bridges the songsans span now vshaped some of the spans of the chamshil iron bridge still standing others simply not there the smoke from it strangely yellow the explosions having set afire a nearby barge of sulfur melissa was out

the bed his face was flushed with excitement they kissed hard and longingly and he rolled on his back so she could sit astride him her breasts firm yet pendulous above him she leaned forward gently rocking side to side her long ashblond hair falling down like warm rain mogul emperor he said in she giggled and sat up blocking his hands with hers their fingers intertwined she fending him off what

kissed him wetly hard tongue thrusting hard for his dont dont leave me davy she called softly gently lonely as a child in the night i wont he said now he could feel her buttocks the hard rounded silkiness rousing him so he doubted he could hold out much longer she stopped perfectly still sensing his razoredge excitement as he calmed down her smell was overwhelming him and now for a moment a man possessed beyond his years his vision blurred she came back into focus and he could feel the blood pulsing through him she raised herself above him using her elbows and began moving rhythmically again side to side his mouth like a fish gasping for water she laughed and it relaxed him his shoulders slumping back falling on the pillow she had to be careful sometimes the slightest giggle could make him angry as if he thought she was laughing at him instead of with him for him youre going he stopped to get his breath to be late for class yes she smiled sweetie lets get married now today this

trying it on said stacy you see the news this morning looked pretty bad to me sure it does right now surprise is with the north always is with the attacker youll see itll be over by christmas not like it was back in the fifties caught the south napping thats all presidentll mobilize the reserve maybe that sends the message to moscow and china real quick end of series they dont want a war neither did south korea but theyre getting it stop worrying it always takes us a little time to react but when we do its game over moscowll tell them to get their ass out of there russias got enough to worry about estonia latvia you think the president will mobilize the reserve asked melissa no question doesnt want to seem too weak not with old leyland breathing down his neck in the polls but doesnt want to be seen as a warmonger but he wont send troops in happens all the time melissa you call up the reserve or hold maneuversthats another good one sends the right messages to beijing moscow what if they call our bluff hey are you serious chinas on overtime just trying to feed itself and russias had one of the worst harvests in years where have i heard that before she said frowning unable to pin it down exactly what asked stacy as they walked over past the library to the cedarhidden geography building stacy thought for a minute bastogne he proffered thought we had it all wrapped up and bam out come the panzers but we beat them no said melissa it was in korea macarthur or someone said it would be over before christmas then the chinese came in history said stacy and history repeats itself right up to a point thats an old wives tale its always different really then itll be different now she said if the president mobilizes the reserve maybe it wont work listen melissa and dont take this the wrong way im no male chauvinist they kept walking toward the quadrangle the smell of the cedars strong in the high humidity but putting an mthats a tank i knew that richard well what im saying is that putting our ms up against what the north koreans have hell like a heavyweight boxer against a bantamweight no hay compracion no contest i hope youre right bet you dinner the steakhouse said stacy okay she answered knowing the moment shed accepted she shouldnt have it would only antagonize david further but dam it his final words had hurt the ingrate anyway it would probably be weeks before the korean business was over she never did see why so many americans had to stay there it was up to the south koreans to protect themselves well in a few weeks everyone would have cooled off david would have simmered down he wanted her as much as she wanted him they both knew that and richard would probably win his bet about the korean thing being over by christmas and impress his international relations seminar shed gladly pay for the steak dinner and invite david to keep the peace from his wellcamouflaged revetment area six miles south of uijongbu tank commander lieutenant clemens no longer felt the slightest pity for the men he was sure he was about to kill news of the atrocities found its way into the crackle of radio traffic one of the four who had been beheaded had been from one of the dualbased mechanized infantry support companies out of california clemenss own state on hearing the news clemens steeled himself for vengeance now he could see the first of an nka battalion of pc tanks the tin cans emerging like parts of a long segmented green snake on the rainpolished highway his laser rangefinder told clemens that the distance between his six american tanks and the nkas sixtyfour was exactly meters well within the ms fourthousandmeter range the range confirmed by the additional thermal sight used in bad weather or at night clemens elbow resting on the cupolas millimeter machine gun could also see nka infantry moving up alongside the dark green pts the ceremonial red stars normally visible on the turrets painted over with slightly darker green camouflage paint clemens gave his orders quietly and unhurriedly to the loader and gunner the gunners integrated computer display verifying the elevation of the millimeter gun and compensating for crosswind and raincaused deviations as the ms fourman crew waited patiently for the enemys lead pt to come to a thousand meters so that the whole column would then be within killing range clemenss thumb was rubbing the steel guard ready to press the computerized fire control system that was even now compensating for the effects of wind drift barrel bend temperature and humidity clemens had to make the decision whether at the moment of firing the tank would be buttoned up or he would do what the four men in his tank and the other two tanks of his platoon called an israeli standing up his head and shoulders out of the turret despite the tanks stateoftheart co laser range finder drivers thermal viewer and the rest of it an israeli would afford him a better allround view of the road and surrounding paddies and so clemens kept standing careful not to make any move that would shake the camouflage netting around the fiftyfourton tank quietly telling his driver the fallback position once the tanks initial rounds gave its present position away to the enemy column the uss blaine was in condition five its top readiness alert on its radar the swarm of white dots within the white rectangles that had signified unknown surface ships had now become white squares hostile ships identified now as three footlong nanuchka and fourteen shershenclass fastattack torpedo boats armed with four twentyoneinch torpedoes and four twin thirtymillimeter machine guns the shershens originally moving at thirtyeight knots were the faster boats but now held back knowing the us frigates more sophisticated electronic defenses could better be penetrated by the nanuchkas which were now closing in the rolling fog banks missile incoming shouted the blaines ood and the phalanx mark closein radar and weapons system with its twentymillimeter gun opened up together with the seventysixmillimeter gun aft of the multiple target radar hard right five degrees ordered brentwood hard right five degrees the blaine was now bow on to the oncoming swarm attempting to deny the nka boats a wide broadside target in or out of the fog as she ghosted projecting fake radar images of herself to decoy the attacking boats even while her sixbarrel gatling gun with a sound like linoleum was spitting out a hail of depleted uranium bullets at over three thousand rounds a minute any one of the bullets twice as dense as the normal steeljacketed kind was capable of deflecting or causing detonation of incoming missiles weve been locked on shouted the electronics warfare officer indicating one of the nanuchkas fishbowl radars had switched to fire control mode immediately the tactical action office ordered chaff and the torpedo launcher shot out a cloud of fine aluminum chips to hash the incoming missiles radars another high tone from the blaines slq radar indicated another missile had been fired at the blaine seconds after ray brentwood ordered the four antiship harpoon missiles fired from the launcher forward of the bridge he felt a slight tremor from the backblast and at the same time received confirmation that the blaines two lamps light airborne multipurpose helicopters had taken off within seconds of each other from the stern pad armed with clusters of airtoship rockets the next minute he heard two thumps that reverberated through the frigate as the blaines two tripletube torpedo launchers discharged four mks into the swarm now closing at less than two nautical miles there was a bright orange flame forward of the starboard beam about three hundred yards into the fog an enemy missile hit and a second later the crash of a destroyed nanuchka came rolling over the ship at the same time the tao reported bogey missiles destroyed there was a cheer in the combat information center cut short by the taos command to the radar operators to compensate for clutter caused by the blaines own chaff and the increasing chop caused by the wash of the remaining sixteen nka boats a sharp pulse of light on the radar and seconds later the sound of an explosion told them another nanuchka had been hit but brentwood was worrying about the changing positions of the two remaining nanuchkas to maintain flank speed would mean entering the swarm sooner but to slacken off would give him less maneuverability the fact that the two nanuchkas were slowing down didnt abate his fears as they had separated to form the two tips of a bullshorn formation meanwhile the armored shell of the blaines combat information center being below the bridge brentwood and the others were only dimly aware of the cacophony of firing outside as the shershen attack boats coming at him broadside opened up with thirtymillimeter fire and began launching their torpedoes from staggered overlap tubes the bullshornlike formation of fast boats now becoming a rough semicircle of a halfmile radius launching twenty torpedoes at the blaine fish incoming called one of the radar operators bearing the operator stopped brentwood swung around saw the problem there were so many a single bearing wouldnt help hard left ninety he ordered reducing the sector of the torpedo attack to a quarter instead of a half circle and hoping to outrun the incoming torpedoes now coming at him from abaft the starboard beam but also putting the blaine broadside to the extreme left half of the semicircle the lead boat a nanuchka closest to him he now engaged with another two harpoon missiles the blip that was the nanuchka amid the dancing fuzz of chaff and other clutter suddenly grew very bright on the screen then disappeared hard right ninety degrees he shouted anticipating a cheer or two from the cic crew but now everyone was silent only the hum of the electronics and that tattoolike din outside faintly audible above the radio crackle of the two helicopters one pilot yelling at the other two oclock two oclock and they actually heard the sound of a missile passing one of the helos in quick succession another three torpedo boats blossomed on the screens and disappeared taken out by the helos but now they could hear the scream of the electronics warfare officer aboard one of the choppers as he was hit by machinegun fire seconds later they heard the bang of the helicopter hitting the water followed by the rattle of machinegun fire the attack boats raking the blaines starboard side fish incoming starboard quarter brentwood knew he could do nothing the torpedotracking radar and digital sonar now malfunctioning and knew that either hard right or hard left would expose his stern to the torpedoes racing toward him at over fifty miles an hour two torpedoes went past whitishgray streaks in the fog the startled starboard lookout informing the bridge a second later a machinegun burst hit the blaines stack puncturing it but doing no more damage as the ships gatling gun swung sharply continuing to fire causing another missile to explode within a few hundred yards of the ship but now the blaines phalanx radar was in danger of fuzzing up from overload the sonar operator ignoring all else carefully monitored the sea bottom alert for the telltale ping of mines while his colleague on the milerange airsearch radar informed the tactical action officer that the radars dish between the bridge and the satellite communications dome was out brentwood knew that of all the battle group ships on forward screen for the carrier salt lake city the blaine like her sister ship the uss des moines forty miles to the east and closing to assist the guided missile frigate had never been designed to go it alone in such outnumbered circumstances the frigates weapon system had been designed primarily for mediumrange escort duty for what the pentagon had designated a lowthreat environment and the sea of japan had been just that until the nka had crossed the dmz sir the surface radar operator began but then checked his excitement enemy disengaging no one in the cic or anywhere else on the ship eased off knowing it could be a sucker ploy but the operator proved right after losing six patrol boats and only damaging the american warship though they had downed one of its helicopters the nka naval force it seemed had had enough still brentwood kept everyone at their stations despite their fatigue and the stench of perspiration thick in the air even as the enemy was retreating he ordered another four harpoons onto the rails and in the bowels of the ship the loader pressed the button for the automatic feed quipping half in relief half in celebration four pack to go brentwood made an immediate note to enter into the ships log together with the tape that like a civilian aircrafts black box was set to start recording the moment a us navy vessel went on action station alert how astonishingly ineffective the nanuchkas missiles had been now it seemed all the peacetime speculation was over the suspicion among the experts that quantity rather than quality was the central theme of the nkas that is the russians strategy seemed confirmed inbound missile inbound missile all the lookout saw in the fog was a blue sphere of light the size of a basketball the sixteenhundredpound exocet skimmer coming in amid the radar clutter hitting the blaine amidships on the starboard side ripping open the threequarterinch armor plating like a fist through glass six miles south of uijongbu lieutenant clemens saw the line of sixtyfour green pts halt through his binoculars he could see the enemy tank commander emerge wearing the russianstyle leather helmet looking a little like a world war ii pilot big bumps over the earpieces cmon said clemens cmon god make him then clemens saw the nka commander thump the cupola and the tank its gravelly roar giving off a thick bluish exhaust moved forward again leading the column when the lead pt was well within the onethousandmeter range clemens gave the order to fire the ms gunner pushed the ranging button activating the splitsecond computerization then squeezed the trigger there was the thud of the recoil but the m hardly moved because of the superb suspension of the sevenroad wheels sprung on each side on torsion bars the hesh or highexplosive squash head round did its job hitting the pts sloped glacis plate with such force that it blew off scabs of redhot steel inside the pt creating a lethal shrapnel within seconds the pt slewed to a stop three figures all on fire tumbling out of it the driver trapped in his hull seat beyond the turret soon the whole tank was engulfed by fire the molten scabs of whitehot shrapnel igniting the tanks oil reservoir creating a thick billowing cloud of black smoke to clemens dismay the smoke was widening and flowing back over the column in as effective a smoke screen as hed ever seen laid many of the pts now adding to it by popping off clusters of smoke grenades left and right of the road within minutes the entire tank column was enveloped hidden from the view of the two american tank platoons in all six tanks that were situated in strategic firing positions under camouflage nets either side of the road behind a rise that was now only nine hundred meters in front of the nka armor but clemens and two other ms fired at the second and third pts the hesh rounds stopping them too dead in their tracks littering and blocking the road with their burning wreckage but though the americans had stopped them the pts immediately behind the gutted hulls kept returning fire within fifteen seconds clemenss m as well as the other five tanks that had also fired into the column and so revealed their positions to the nka were also under mortar fire from nka tank support infantry situated in the flooded paddies and from the shoulders of the road clemenss m was retreating down a shallow depression to its next selected firing position on a hillock two hundred yards farther back still on relatively higher dry ground above the road the aim of the return fire from the upgunned pts millimeter cannons shooting solid apds armorpiercing rounds with discarding sabot was poor and even when struck the tank easily deflected two rounds the ms turret armor so sloped as to deny a flaton impact still the fact that the rounds were coming close told clemens that the five american ms were being sighted through the thick pall of smoke by either laser or thermal imaging reflecting the nkas that is the russians military strategy of equipping tanks even the older models like the pts with nighttime ranging capability it was another indication of soviet military thinking their belief that their best chance in any battle with the west was a quick win which meant keeping your crews fighting twentyfour hours a day before the united states had time to rally the political will to reinforce their troops or others in the western alliance the sound inside the m as it geared down breaking its speed as it approached the tall bamboo was like some enormous earth mover but to the few ragtag platoons of supporting usrok infantry outside the m sounded remarkably quiet not much noisier than a growling pickup as the fiftyfourton tank moved at over thirty miles per hour across a corrugated stretch of ground its gun steady and maintaining its six rounds of accurate fire per minute even as it geared up heading at full speed over forty miles per hour toward the heavy stand of bamboo overlooking a curve on the uijongbuseoul road incoming missile shouted the gunner clemens dropping down the hatch which was seated and secure in a second it was not a round from any of the pts which were now breaking left and right of the blocked road as the five american tanks opened up from the bamboo and surrounding hills but a relatively slow russianmade antitank spiral coming in at meters a second less than half the speed of a tank round it struck the ms turret exploding against the twohundredmillimeterthick sloped armor failing to penetrate the shock wave quickly dissipating throughout the composite or layered spc armor but it caused a ringing that even through the crews protective earphones was so intense that along with all the other internal noise of the fifteenhundredhorsepower gas turbine controlling gun elevation and depression the constant hum of the computers and the steady blowing of the air conditioner the fume sleeve halfway down the barrel evicting noxious gases from the exploded powder none of the tanks crew could hear anything on the radio for at least ten seconds and so they didnt hear the warning transmitted from the other two tanks in clemenss platoon a second antitank missile wireguided had been fired at them from ten oclock from a fringe of smoke fifteen hundred meters away in the paddy off the lefthand side of the road the russianmade sagger moving at under five hundred meters a second came through the black and white smokescreen rolling over the paddies hitting the right track of clemenss m as it was nearing the bamboo thicket there was a muffled explosion more sound shock and then a clanking sound like chains unraveling from a snow tire damn shouted clemenss gunner as the tank crashed into the bamboo thicket the top of which rose a good six feet above the hillock immediately to the right of them blocking them from the nka tanks view and placing them in a perfect position for defilade fire providing the driver could manage to turn the fiftyfour tons using only the intact left track and what was left of the right can you do it johnny shouted clemens itll take the right track off lieutenant do it the m shuddered right then the driver in his forward hull semireclining position used all the skill he had been taught at fort hood coaxing talking to the twentyfivefootlong eightfoothigh tank as a cavalry man of old might have cajoled his wounded battle horse to climb that few feet more up the reverse incline of the bamboo hill to the defilade position in the lowest gear the tank gave a throaty roar inching forward on the slippery cane of the bamboo almost to the summit of the hill here given the light rain that was now falling and the smoke the tank was barely visible and here its gun the product of the best engineering in the world could lay down fire with minimum silhouette the enemy could return effective fire only if the m could not withdraw before the nka range finders picked it up with the right track off clemens knew he couldnt fire and withdraw with any speed and so asked his wingmen the other two tanks in his platoon to overwatch him to feed his tank information about any advancing nka infantry with antitank weapons or pts looking for a lucky shot from the paddies on one hand clemens felt trapped because it would take several hours at least to fix the unraveled track if they could do it at all in the field and yet he was in a perfect position with a wide down angle of fire across the paddies now stretching fifteen hundred to five thousand meters in front of him he was waiting for the smoke to clear one of the other two tanks hed requested help from didnt answer whether it was hit hard and out of action or whether its radio had packed it in clemens didnt know in any case the other tank gave clemens the happy information that cahill had released a full batallion of ms thirtyfive tanks in all which were now rolling up unification highway within twenty minutes theyd be in the area engaging the remaining sixty lighterarmed and lighter pt tanks now presumably scuttling across the paddies either side of the road under cover of the smoke trying to find whatever defensive positions they could in the interim clemens decided to save what was left of his original fiftyfive rounds until the smoke curtain cleared how many shots we got left luke fortytwo what we got on the menu ribs lobster never mind the shit whatve we got shoes twenty he ten and twelve hesh it told clemens he had twenty rounds of solidshot armorpiercing ten highexplosive shells and twelve highexplosives with squash heads well said clemens trying not to sound too satisfied up against the pt tin cans that should hold us awhile i reckon said his gunner as general kim in his headquarters six miles east outside uijongbu was informed of the m spearhead rapidly approaching his face remained impassive even as his infantry commanders worriedly reminded him of the cardinal rule that while it was permissible for tanks to move without infantry this was only wise when you were advancing and using the infantry as your eyes and ears but in this situation with a long line of american m tanks the nka armored column would quickly be thrown on the defensive the supporting regiments behind the nka tanks slaughtered by the cannon and machinegun fire of the formidable ms unless they were withdrawn radio intercepts kims officers pointed out already confirmed that the ms their laser range finders thwarted by neither rain nor smoke were less than twenty minutes away and after the executions at panmunjom the migooks would surely show no mercy and would fight eye to eye with the pts kim merely nodded he was already quite aware that he was about to engage in the first massed tank battle since the days of the israeliarab wars one of the infantry commanders a colonel russiantrained and in charge of one of the crack nka sapper units had as kim ordered already gone ahead of the beleaguered pt column and blown a huge hundredyard gap in the road in effect creating an enormous tank ditch which no tank including the m could ford but this the colonel pointed out to kim could only be expected to delay the americans for at most a quarter hour and it would not be long he told kim before the american fleet in the east sea would be near enough to launch aerial antitank attacks this was dangerous for any tank the top of the turret being the leastarmored part of the vehicle but for the relatively lightarmored pts it could mean annihilation kim did not respond as kim left the headquarters tent walking across the squishy ground to his private quarters two of his chief staff officers tried to fathom kims intent perhaps he thinks proffered a battalion commander that once the ms engage our tanks they will be too close any aerial bombardment would also destroy any american tanks nearby i think kim has something up his sleeve why asked the colonel he did not seem overly concerned about the mis didnt you notice asked the battalion commander i noticed that is what bothers me he does not fully comprehend this situation you cant tell with kim said the colonel he is known for not divulging his tactics till the last minute fears a security leak ive no doubt hes studying the situation carefully hes up against the american cahill kim hates him so do i said the other officer but hating is not enough hate will not stop an m no agreed the colonel but it will help how the colonel shrugged inclose armored fighting is not something the americans you think americans are no good at this dont you remember patton yes of course said the colonel but that was a long time ago and what happens when washington sends reinforcements pressed the infantry commander the colonel laughed they wont if they do we will have over half the south before they get here the americans love to argue their democracy said the colonel contemptuously is all talk they talk big they have big tanks they have big egos countered the colonel remember vietnam my friend once their ego is punctured they become very depressed the americans first said the infantry commander id prefer to see the ms punctured be patient said the colonel the infantry commander looked at his watch it wont be long they will be entering the area within five minutes then said the colonel we dont have long to wait comrade i think we are about to make history chapter nineteen president mayne didnt favor the worldfamous oval office in the west wing except for the most official occasions most of his work was done in the smaller more ordinary study next door and it was here that peales portrait of george washington was moved in those lonely times that only a president knows when only he could break the deadlock of advisers conflicting advice mayne would retreat here to mull over the options the possible consequences or what trainor called the bottom line situation for mayne the oval office had always seemed too big for serious contemplation no matter how cozy it looked in the narrowfocus television brought to it hiding by omission the large area between the fireplace and the white leather lounges in front of the desk the secret service thoroughly approved of the smaller room for the men who protected him the oval office being on the southern corner of the west wing was a much more vulnerable target for anyone who might penetrate the elaborate yet mainly unseen protective screen of heat and movement sensors that covered every sector of the grounds the secret service had installed a rectangular titanium shell sandwiched in the paneling of the study making it even more secure but above all the president liked the room because he could darken it completely and keep the secret that only he his wife and trainor shared this morning he sat down with the pentagons updated report of the north korean invasion early in his presidency mayne had decreed that situation reports be as brief as possible no more than two pages doublespaced a oneandahalfinch margin for his comments despite all the words put in his mouth by speech writers and advisers throughout the country at heart he disliked any kind of verbosity for truman it had as everyone knew been the buck stops here sign that greeted visitors for reagan it can be done for mayne it was get to the point quickly he had long accepted the fact so difficult for others to understand that decisions from the white house including those involving life and death often had to be made without all the facts being in all the facts in any given situation would take a lifetime to uncover a luxury that only academics and gunning for you journalists could afford when hed finished the first page of the korea report he pressed the button for his national security adviser harry schuman to come in and kept reading with a growing sense of alarm the most disturbing of the pentagons facts was that if the american tanks could not hold the line and substantial us reserves were not committed immediately korea could be lost within weeks faster than it had taken hitlers panzers to overrun poland in if this happened warned the combined chiefs of staff us treaty obligations and guarantees throughout the world would be considered worthless of no more use than chamberlains piece of paper and the temptation of the sovietwarsaw pact nations in eastern europe particularly east germany pushing to reabsorb and effect the reunification of east and west germany might prove irresistible mayne simply did not believe the latter moscow no matter its posturing in the postgorbachev era would not endorse such a move in the gdr the kremlin as much as anyone else wanted to avoid another war conventional nuclear biochemical whatever harry schuman a bushyeyebrowed southerner whom the white house staff called kentucky fried entered the office and wordlessly mayne handed him the first sheet of the report as he continued pondering the second the pentagon in his view was overplaying the concern about nato versus the sovietwarsaw pact forces in europe but they were correct he believed about a victory for north korea weakening confidence abroad particularly right next door in central america and in china where beijing coveted taiwan as theirs because of all the mainland chinese who had gone over with cash my check in when the kuomintang had fled the victorious mao most of all if there was any serious weakening of confidence in america in the middle east iran would be licking its chops as trainor was apt to put it and israel always surrounded could be attacked yet again and if iraq used chemical weapons as shed done against iran in the war it could well spark a string of firecrackers from the gulf to the bering strait mayne picked up the phone to gen ernest gray head of the combined chiefs of staff general mr president your people are telling me that if i dont commit more forces to korea immediately were in serious trouble well lose korea mr president the koreans will lose it ernest well be kicked out mayne felt uncomfortable with calling the general ernest didnt sound right yet ernie invited a familiarity that he didnt like to encourage with the military as their commander in chief what i want to know continued the president and this is no reflection on your colleagues but are we overreacting mayne had seen the television shots of a few of the bridges going but tv had a way of making a dormitory riot seem like a whole university was on fire when as he remembered from his own days as a freshman most students didnt even know where the dorm was let alone a riot i support general cahills decision to take out the bridges sir said gray i know it didnt go down well on the sixoclock news but militarily speaking i have no problem with that general awful as it is but your people worked overtime on the hill to get more m tanks in europe so that we could spare several companies for koreas dmz the ms would be the bulwark you said if i remember correctly against any possible incursion by the north now we have the incursion and im not hearing anything about the bulwark ah mr president theres a coded update coming in now it might be fine call me right back yes mr president at the pentagon general gray and his aides were in a quandary on the one hand to admit that the battle of tanks shaping up south of uijongbu had not been decided was to admit the pentagon might indeed have been overreacting about losing the peninsula on the other hand to paint too gloomy a picture would be to undermine confidence right down the line what the pentagon was really doing was hedging their bet angling for reserves to be in place in the unlikely event that the ms could not hold the line the decoded message was reporting the attack on a guided missile frigate the blaine this had already been noted from satellite photos but when gray rang the president back he used it as ammunition for the pentagons overall argument what were saying mr president is that the stakes not just for the koreans but for the united states are enormous here on top of vietnam any hint of defeat in korea could undercut confidence not only among our allies but in our ah you mean my administration mayne cut in to put it bluntly sir yes bluntly is what i get paid for general but ive been talking this over with harry schuman the fact that we cant hold so far with forty thousand us troops and the rok forces might be just as bad a signal to send if confidence has been undermined then its been undermined i dont want to send any more boys in there if were going to lose the place anyway all i can say mr president is that general cahill and rok command concur with the jcs assessment its a very tenuous situation sir harry schuman scribbled a note and pushed it across the desk as mayne asked general gray what precisely had happened to american air cover as he answered gray could tell from the echoing quality of his voice that the president had put him on conference harry schuman sitting in as far as gray was concerned schuman should stay in his office in foggy bottom for all the help he was to the military always prevaricating general put in schuman peering over his bifocals as they switched to visual conferencing its my understanding that we have the seventh fleet moving in off he turned to look at the stand map of korea next to the president pohang yes sir but their planes arent in range yet for air cover over the uijongbu corridor in any case well have to clear the area of migs before our navy choppers and what few as we have left can go tank hunting up there and the point is sir no matter how much air cover we can provide the battles ultimately going to be decided on the ground our tanks and theirsll be too close to all right general but keep me informed halfhourly sooner if necessary meanwhile ill authorize reinforcements from japan what i want to avoid right now is sending any troops from the united states everyone knows japans our reserve base for southeast asia so we can do that without causing undue panic fine mr president but if youll permit me sir i need to know whether the reinforcements can be deployed immediately mayne glanced across at schuman to see if he had any advice general put in schuman itll be twentyfour hours before they reach korea i think itd be a good idea to leave that question open for now sir answered the general were going to need marines or airborne if were to secure a landing zone nka infiltrators have effectively cut off pusan hasnt fallen put in mayne no sir but its a long way south i know two hundred and fifty miles answered mayne bridges over the naktong are cut sir mayne nodded glancing up from behind his desk at the large stand map of korea well general you people try to secure the airfields around pusan nka cant get across from seoul very quickly cahills at least seen to that general gray stiffened sensing an undercurrent of condemnation of cahills action in any event continued the president you people have a lot of faith in the ms they could still turn this thing around couldnt they yes sir i think they will i merely wanted to know about deployment of reserves in case lets see what cahills armor can do south of uijongbu first very well mr president mayne flicked the phone off conference and his hands forming a cathedral leaned back in the leather chair looking thoughtfully across at schuman what i want to know when this is over harry is how the hell were so many north korean agents allowed to infiltrate the south my god theyre blowing everything up left right and center theyve had a lot of years to plan it mr president maynes cathedral collapsed well blame can wait what we need now is for those tanks to stop the nka dead in their tracks schuman was about to comment favorably on the pun but thought better of it entering the pentagon crises room several of the joint chiefs aides noticed it had been freshly carpeted golfgreen the military psychologists gray told them had found that the old deep maroon tended to depress people with mayne and his defense cutbacks thered been enough of that besides gray had always kept a putting iron and onehole mat in his office to unwind after the conferences used to look like hell on maroon several of the aides allowed themselves a smile at the generals joke but it was difficult to do with the wall map of korea showing red arrows well below what had once been the dmz when all the chiefs had arrived gray informed them that despite his conviction that the mis cahill had unleashed from the revetment areas beyond seoul would turn the battle it would also be necessary to start moving the thirty thousand reserves across the sea of japan it was a logistics problem that airlift alone even if theyd had landing strips could not solve they would have to use troop ships theyve got no subs to speak of an aide said encouragingly no interjected admiral horton chief of naval operations they didnt have any nanuchkas either until they attacked the blaine nor any skimmers to speak of put in another aide that could be airaunched were not sure it was hit by an as missile replied the admiral could have been by one of those migs they didnt have there was a heavy silence but horton wasnt about to back off from his criticism of grays heavy reliance on the national security agency with the same determination that the admiral had argued against putting out frigates as a naval group screen without air cover he believed just as strongly that the military could not gather intelligence by electronic means alone what i dont understand is how you people missed the migs weve got a billiondollar satellite up there thats supposed to be able to read pravda and you dont see any fighters i doubt we missed them admiral replied the nsa representative james halpern my guess is they were probably ones we already know about but were flown down from manchuria or across the yellow sea from shanghai trainings probably done over southern china probably wont do it for us jim said the admiral you either know where they are or you dont there was another awkward silence gray moved to a more positive note at least we have the reserves to move i didnt think wed get that much from the president to be quite honest why not asked admiral horton his directness was unnerving to the other combined chiefs of staff he can do that problem is getting congress to go along i dont think therell be any problem there admiral general gray assured him this isnt a gulf of tonkin resolution its invasion plain and simple maybe but ill sleep a lot better when i know your tank boys have stopped them general so will i conceded gray what about the blaine it was a little tit for tat blindsided replied the admiral the carrier salt lake city was in contact with her right up until she was hit another frigate is going to assist if the blaines still afloat you keeping senator leyland posted yes soon as we know anything more definite well inform him later after he was satisfied everything that could be done by the pentagon was being done general gray rose indicating the conference was over but as they filed out he asked air force general allet about the extent of the sabotage in south korea against the airfields gray already knew the answer but it was a pretext to get allet off to the side bill weve been caught with our pants down on this one everyone heres been so goddamned worried about europe and the mideast he paused point is now were in it we ought not to paint too rosy a picture about any shortterm victory william allet looked up in surprise you mean you dont think the ms can buy us the time we need oh sure theyll knock the crap out of those damned tin cans point is i think we need to give those north korean bastards a lesson they wont soon forget senator leylands of the same mind allet nodded but general gray didnt know whether that meant acquiescence or mere acknowledgment chapter twenty brentwood heard the screams of men trapped in the tangled debris of the redhot bulkhead the jagged hole amidships causing the blaine to heel dangerously to starboard as she reduced speed from flank speed of thirtyfive knots to slow ahead at five still taking water he ordered the port side compartments flooded trying to bring the frigate back onto an even keel lifting the punchedin starboard side above the waterline over the sound of the men the phalanx gatling gun kept up its murderous fire aided by the blaines remaining helicopter attacking the retreating patrol boats as they sped southeast now that theyd crippled the american frigate the blaines designers sacrificing weight for high speed and greater maneuverability had installed stateoftheart electronics in the warship but with its armor plate less than an inch thick the result was a gaping wound in her side roughly twelve feet in diameter fires raging inside the aluminum superstructure reaching temperatures unheard of in the slower heavier ships of old the decks becoming so hot that fire hoses and the firefighters boots began to burn twentythree men were killed outright by the explosion of the exocet against the ships side another nine dying from burns and hemorrhaging before the asbestosclothed rescue crews could get anywhere near them four men simply disappeared at the point of impact but by far the most damage was caused by the toxicity of the fumes as the ultramodern materials in the superstructure everything from tabletop plastics in the mess to plasticcoated wiring melted their deadly poisonous gases spreading in a hot fog throughout the ship the blaines position now visible on sattnt photos as a white blob so dense that normal infrared was having difficulty penetrating it some of the crew had time to don gas masks but except in the more heavily armored and protected combat information center immediately below the bridge the curling tumbling smoke pouring through aisles and ventilation shafts of the ship killed another fifty of the crew within five minutes half the cic watch became nauseated to the point they could no longer properly monitor the radars which for the most part were either malfunctioning or useless anyway the exocets impact having severed communications within the gutted ship that was now moving ghostlike in the fog messages had to be sent by runners trying to circumnavigate the inferno in the belly of the ship where white jets from the fire hoses crisscrossed the water immediately vaporizing as it struck superheated metal the second missile eight minutes after the first hit her port rail its high orange explosion erupting in front of the bridge where brentwood was issuing orders for damage control the fireball enveloped the bridge sections of the bulletproof glass bulging like some grotesque metallic monster the sudden heat driving the exploding glass into the bridge molten shards instantly killing the helmsman and decapitating the ood brentwood saw a blinding white slab his body crashing into the deck hands pressing hard against his face his fingers awash with the warm blood the second officer his clothes lacerated his left arm shattered eyebrows burned stumbling grabbing the batteryoperated megaphone yelling at brentwood that they should abandon ship very began brentwood he nodded and blacked out his face appearing to the second officer as if parts of it had melted flaps of skin dangling loosely from what had been a face hearing the order to abandon ship the tactical warfare officer one deck below in cic inserted the key opening the clark meyhew automatic destruct charge setting the fuse on the mark ii decoder for fifteen minutes only a yeoman firstclass who had been on the chopper deck astern assisting the helicopter to land on the fifteendegreekiltered deck noticed while racing forward along the relatively undamaged walkway that although the port quarter was a shambles of twisted railing the decking about it buckled from the missiles impact the multimilliondollar ship though limping badly was still afloat he shouted at one man who was tightening his life jacket on the starboard rail not to jump that their sister ship in the carrier screen the des moines must be coming for them for a second the yeoman couldnt see the figure he was yelling at a gunners mate still wearing his asbestos hood looking strangely like a polar explorer lost momentarily in the churning white smoke that was boiling up from the well deck the wind shifted for a second smoke clearing but the mate was gone looking over the side the yeoman could see several oilslicked men striking out in an australian crawl others breaststroking the noises of their cries remarkably like wounded seals heading as best they could through the black scum of the debris toward one of the half dozen beaufort life rafts that were now bobbing unconcernedly on the oilsmooth chop like huge contented orangeglow igloos in the uijongbu corridor it was still raining late in the afternoon the monsoon seeming to set in for the rest of the wet season as forty m tanks fanned out into overwatch positions two wingmen or flank tanks overseeing the advance of a middle tank which in turn would pair up with one of the remaining two and watch over the advance of the third tank clemens took delight in watching them spreading out to encircle the pts the latter were now withdrawing across the paddies heading for the foothills of the mountain range as fast as they could clemens cursed being unable to move in for the kill in his disabled tank but did his best on his radio from his defilade position on the reverse side of the hill to guide some of the ms through the thick choking smoke that the fleeing north korean tanks and infantry were laying down across the darkening green of the countryside and around the enormous flooded ditch that the nka had blown out of the ground to serve as an antitank defense through the noise of the battle and that of his own tanks motors clemens could hear the american commander brusquely alerting all tanks to go around the ditch that clemens had warned was not just another paddy the commander also ordered the tank crews to ready their fording equipment in the event that any of the other normally waistdeep paddies flooded by the monsoon proved too deep to negotiate on tracks alone within minutes of general kim ordering the pts to withdraw as fast as possible the ms were in trouble in the paddies as kim knew they would be it was the culmination of a plan he had fought so long and hard for in pyongyang arguing against all the norms of military logic for a monsoon offensive rather than a winter or spring attack when the ground would still be hard enough to allow for a rapid armored advance he knew as did everyone else that the abrams m was quite simply the cadillac of tanks that next to them the pts appeared as model ts in his aides description the old s tough and reliable in their own way but with nothing like the speed armor or shooting power of the american tanks the americans had long known this and what kim had banked on was the americans very willingness to engage the pts he knew the ms like the s were also capable of fording waterways with the huge flotation skirting but he also knew something else something that came from a simple mathematical equation in the art of modern war the abrams m had been designed to go up against the equally heavy russian ts and ts a strategy that had not bothered itself with the old tin can pt and so was not prepared for the difference between the ground pressure exerted by the fiftyfourton m and the ground pressure exerted by the fourteenton pts the difference the m exerting a ground pressure of pounds per square inch as opposed to the mere for the pts meant that each fiftyfourton m now had to spend vital time once it was stuck in the soft flooded ooze of the paddies while its flotation skirting was unfolded in those few minutes the much lighter pts were still free to maneuver this single fact proved deadly for the americans as kim closed the trap in the mutual slaughter that kim had predicted to his dear and respected leader the ms laser range finders and millimeter cannons put out an awesome rate of fire crippling the pts the latter having served kims purpose of drawing the americans into the paddies were now sacrifical lambs as crack nka infantry able to set their aim on the temporarily stationary ms delivered the knockout blows with everything from the old but reliable inventory of wireguided russian saggers to sophisticated oneshot onetime rpg s and s and the at spandrels whose hit probability at five hundred meters exceeded percent contrary to what those outside the military believed kim was well aware of the fact that tanks even the most modern ones advancing without infantry support were much more vulnerable than was generally supposed and were one of the easiest targets to destroy providing they stopped long enough for you to sight them in the ms were able to spot some of the rpg launchers because of their backblast which in the paddies created an aerosol spray of water behind the launchers even so the ms the giants in the contest of armor against armor were for these few minutes at their most vulnerable standing still in deep muddy water many of them knocked out of action by the inflatable skirting catching fire and in effect baking the fourman crews especially the drivers whose positions forward of the turret offered them less protection and many of whom were machinegunned as they tried to escape fume and flameengulfed tanks many of the gunners on the left flank from clemenss company most of whom hailed from the san diego area were among the first hit some of them drowned as they fell badly wounded flopping around in the water like winged ducks as kim wrote in his glowing report to pyongyang few of the ms were holed by the nkas antitank weapons the crews killed by sparling the ricocheting of equipment knocked loose inside the tank by impact creating a deadly hail of shrapnel whizzing around inside the tank like a scythe amid chaff many of the americans blinded from shattered periscopes others burned alive despite the automatic extinguishers which could do little if any of the ms fiftyfive rounds of highexplosive and armorpiercing shells were hit a dozen or so of the american commanders who opened the hatch to snatch a quick look at the allround situation were dead within seconds from the nkas hail of infantry and sniper fire the americans slumping over the hatch from which they had to be either dumped quickly overboard before the hatch could be closed or dragged back down bleeding often blocking vital steering and gunnery controls kims infantry paid heavily as well as the pts thirtyfour of his tanks destroyed outright by the deadly accurate ms which for as long as they lasted in their stationary or near stationary positions delivered as much as they got but there were many more pts than ms and soon under the combination of the more mobile pts and heavy infantry antitank rocket and missile fire all the american armor except for one platoon of three tanks was knocked out of action kim knew that if the americans were allowed time to retake the ground by air strike then their logistical genius for quick repair would come into play and tanks that had now been taken out of the battle because crews had either been killed or their ms had lost a track could be in action again in six or seven hours kim had never forgotten his fathers stories of how north korean commanders had stood mouths agape at the incredible speed with which american seabees had cleared roughtimbered ground and laid down mesh airstrips within twelve hours accordingly kim sent in mopup squads of demolition experts some of whom were cut down by the few remaining m crews manning the commanders and the loaders machine guns before they too were silenced the nka squads placed plastique on the tanks with times fuses set for forty minutes giving all nka squads time to clear the area the uijongbu corridor exploded in a roaring cacophony of blackorange balls spewing into the dark and monsoonriven sky as the plastique and rounds aboard the tanks exploded kim would have liked to use the tanks but the nka didnt have the supporting ground crews for each tank that the american army had now instituted or enough electronic experts to service the sophisticated equipment on board only two ms were spared so that when the day came that the south had been crushed the tanks could be forwarded to kaesong where they would be airlifted by the big russian condor transport to moscow for thorough dissection by the russian army seoul was kims and as tens of thousands of nka regulars reservists and artillery closed in the ring of steel about the capital it was an ashenfaced cahill whose officers had given him firsthand observation reports of the carnage in the city abovelike tossing grenades into packed rooms one of them had said cahill was now confronted with the inevitable by midnight korean time the situation was so hopeless that amid the shambles and smoke of what had been one of the most sophisticated electronic communication centers in asia the american general asked permission from washington to surrender seoul into enemy hands general gray replied that any delaying action would help the reserves on the way from japan while satint suggested the nka were pausing to ford the han across pontoon bridges approximately a half hour later cahill received more reports that thousands of nka regulars wearing normal peasant and worker garb had hours before the last bridges were blown infiltrated the columns of refugees and were now causing further chaos and thwarting south korean artillery batteries trying to reach the han from the south at am the usrok command in effect cahill was given an ultimatum seven hours to surrender or answer for all the consequences to the rest of the world now watching to america holding its breath the seven hours granted cahill to make up his mindwashingtons mind was puzzling in europe it was being touted by commentators especially in the eastern bloc as a generous act of humanitarianism in modern war obviously kim was giving time for as many civilians to escape over the few remaining bridges as possible in fact kim had given cahill seven hours for one reason only by that time it would be dawn the usual time for the us and rok flags to be raised so that kim and his troops as all the world looked on could be photographed in full light as the american and south korean flags were taken down he could see no reason why washington would prolong his artillerys systematic destruction of the city he was correct the flags were hauled down furled and general cahill but not general lee was instructed to hand the american flag personally to general kim without looking at it kim peremptorily handed it to an aide who set the stars and stripes on fire lifting it high on a bayonet waving it joyously for the cheering nka army and the world to see chapter twentyone if we do nothing it will be interpreted as weakness confidence in our treaty obligations in europe would be seriously under i agree comrade said the premier but our far eastern fleet has already put to sea is that not message enough no answered the defense minister a stocky georgian leaning back in one of the leatherbacked chairs in the premiers extraordinarily long rectangular office trying to compose himself it was no use he was leaning forward again his impatience and anxiety evidenced by his nicotinestained fingers fiddling unconsciously with a thick glass ashtray he looked across at his comrade from the ministry of the interior then left at the premier in his seat at the top of the tshaped conference table and spread his hands on the green baize in a gesture of accommodation what i wish to point out comrade premier is that sending our eastern fleet out of vladivostok is standard procedure whenever the american seventh fleet enters the sea of japan the americans know this our warsaw allies know this it does not send a strong enough message in my opinion his fingers tapped hard on the table we need to take a step which will send a strong message that the sea of japan cannot be used as an american lake as as an operational area from which to bombard north korea as it was last time the defense minister turned and pointed at the pacific rim map it would be the same as if we sailed into california waters can you imagine i understand this comrade put in premier suzlov but i think a strong enough message is being sent to everyone with the deployment of our eastern fleet the public in the warsaw pact countries dont know it is standard practice they will see it as a very strong measure on our part so will the american public the important thing comrades is that we know the pentagon understands it is normal procedure but the pentagon suspects us of being in collusion with north korea answered the defense minister undeterred suzlov looked about the table for an informal poll our dear comrades in pyongyang have made a grave error by invading south korea they did not consult us nor inform us of the time they never consult us grumbled the marshall of the air force they are a law unto themselves law skoffed admiral doldichthey have no law they are ruled by an overfed ego in a mao suit he has placed us in a very dangerous position comrades if we do not support him we are seen as deserting a socialist brother an ally if we do support him we risk widening the conflict we have enough trouble now with every republic from here to turkey clamoring for semiautonomy which means autonomy chimed in the minister for defense this is precisely why comrade premier i urge a tougher stand here comrade doldich is quite correct that everyone in our fifteen republics is watching us if we falter if moscow fails appears weakkneed on this it will only fuel divisive elements from estonia to mongolia to make matters worse beijing is being foolish again about their borders the minister meant damansky island and the far eastern border along outer mongolia which fronted the soviet unions back door and laid claim to more than a million soviet troops permanently stationed there particular knowledge of this area lay with kiril marchenko a colonel in the service of the stavka the general headquarters of the soviet supreme high command one of the specialist advisers invited on occasion to politburo meetings it was to him that suzlov now turned for his opinion the stavka suspected that doldichs dispatch of the soviet far eastern fleet had less to do with sending messages to the us seventh fleet and more to do with doldich wanting to have the fleet at sea rather than risk having it bottled up the fate of the german surface fleet in both world wars but it had been stavkas intelligence reports suggesting the ussr show its muscle to china that had caught the premiers attention he favored giving a clear signal to beijing that despite the postgorbachev rapprochement between the two countries moscow would not yield to unrealistic demands for more territory on the far eastern border if china became obstreperous which it seemed to be doing as it had done in the sixties and seventies then the russian navy was there ready to pulverize anything that moved against the vital soviet security zone between the manchurian border and the ussrs huge yearround icefree port of vladivostok marchenko was about to begin speaking when the defense minister put up his hand his rows of afghanistan service ribbons catching the early morning light from the woodpaneled beige walls and the portrait of lenin directly behind him if i can return for a moment to the matter of our european allies if we do not take stronger measures if we do not come quickly to the aid of our north korean comrades he held up his hand like a traffic cop to stop oncoming objections until he was finished despite their rashness if we as the leaders of the socialist world do not come to their aid our warsaw pact comrades have every reason to doubt our commitment to them in the future to socialist solidarity all over the world and if god forbid there is ever an attack against our soviet motherland and we need them to aid us and quickly then our reactions now to our comrades in north korea will decide the issue no one stirred or even raised an eyebrow at the defense ministers use of god forbidgorbachev had used it all the time during his years in office the question for them comrades continued the minister will be why should we fight to protect the soviet unions borders why should we be the buffer zone in eastern europe if the soviet union does not move to aid one of our brother socialist countries in north korea colonel marchenko made eye contact with the most powerful man in the soviet union though he knew that as colonel he was not entitled to speak at such a highlevel meeting unless specifically invited to do so stavka not only supported the premiers position regarding the eastern fleet and china but also shared the defense ministers concern marchenkos intelligence sources had painted an even more frightening picture of the spread of underground dissident movements within the republics gorbachev and his precious perestroika had lifted the lid from the can of worms encouraged by his call for reforms the underground indeed everybody from the decadent rock and roll starsbyebye miss american pieto literary professors quoting the leftist traitor orwell had started yelling about freedom freedom for what marchenko wanted to know freedom to be degenerate sex drugs and mayhem in the streets the kgb had over three million files on latent dissidents who had surfaced in the gorbachev years in addition to those already known as dubious characters all of them just waiting and watching like delinquents for the first sign of the parents discipline weakening but even this was as nothing compared to the threat posed by the clique of delinquent generals on overcrowded taiwan agents who often sent in conflicting assessments were as one in their reports that the taiwan clique were positively drooling at the prospect of a sovietus conflict andor chinese preoccupation in a sinosoviet conflict over far eastern borders and the present northsouth korean war was a prime time one that would not come again for taiwans americanequipped navy vastly superior to mainland chinas to retake some of the offshore islands yes colonel said the premier encouragingly struck by the officers fearlessness in the presence of so much top brass mr premier began marchenko i suggest that the far eastern fleet be authorized to carry out airtac exercises in the south china sea supported by amphibious elements from our base at cam rahn bay this would be enough of a departure from normal far eastern fleet maneuvers to give a clear signal to the americans but still be part of the usual exercises so that it should not unduly alarm washington it would also be far enough south of korea not to be viewed by the americans as moscow interfering with korea it would also mean our fleet would be strategically positioned between the offshore china islands and taiwan to signal the opportunist generals in taipei very clearly that we will not tolerate an attack upon mainland chinese territory which would further destabilize our far eastern border situation this would also put us in beijings favor and may reduce tensions on the far eastern border itself premier suzlov nodded pondering the suggestion a double play he said using an american baseball expression he had picked up years before during his stint as kgb head of station in washington suzlov turned to the politburo well his gaze resting on the ranking minister of defense ilya yes said the georgian but we must still be seen supporting pyongyang not to do so will only encourage the americans to become further involved they already have reservists en route from japan the problem will only a volunteer force cut in marchenko from all socialist countries we could fly them out from berlin the stavka colonel realized this time hed not only spoken out of turn but jumped the gun butting in on the defense ministers response but as the british said in for a penny in for a pound dobrovoltsy volunteers he continued from all socialist countries would absolve moscow of any direct intervention yet we would all be aiding our north korean comrades suzlov looked quickly about the room as marchenko added socialist solidarity it was heartfelt for the colonel no mere slogan he hated america a mongrel mix of races he called it his father an adviser in north vietnam killed by the american division outside khe sahn the defense minister turned toward suzlov unable to decide whether the upstart colonel deserved a damned quick putdown or a promotion never would have happened before gorbachev of course gorbachev was the one who had encouraged this kind of spontaneous exhibitionism the colonel was indulging in still the defense minister saw the colonels point was supporting his where the defense minister asked marchenko would you get these volunteers from cuba east germany marchenko paused we were still able to get volunteers for spetsnaz for afghanistan afghanistan was a mistake said the air marshal it was the party line it had also cost the air marshal many pilots and put pay once and for all to the idea as the americans had learned in vietnam that air superiority alone could decide a war unless you dropped atomic bombs yes agreed premier suzlov but the colonel is correct we did get volunteers despite the unpopularity of the war and for spetsnaz he was referring to the toughest most hazardous duty of all the special forces and said the colonel pausing a little more cautious we could offer some kind of inducement recognition by the state he meant bonuses of course cash coupons for the specialty stores normally open only to the party suzlov saw the heads nodding lenin would have understood perfectly he was no fool this colonel chapter twentytwo the moment nato hq in brussels had heard that the north korean army had crossed the dmz all units along the nato front from jutland in the north to austria in the south went from normal alert status to military vigilance if the sovietwarsaw pact armies were to invade the west there were three most probable points of entry the first was the fulda gap here the end of the barbed wire east german funnel thrust into west germany between mount fichtel gebirge in the south and the harz mountains in the north where hitler had used thousands of sscontrolled slave laborers to build the v rockets in the deep underground tunnels near nordhausen the second probable point of attack was in the far south near burghausen on the austrianwest german border where tanks could race through the hof corridor utilizing the plain about the danube northeast of munich the third most probable point of entry was in the far north along the elbe on the north german plain here attacking forces would almost certainly try to isolate jutland while racing to hamburg and bremerhaven to cut off the vital ports needed by nato for the massive us reinforcements which after one week of war would have to start pouring in if nato was to have any hope of stopping the sovietwarsaw pact juggernaut it was clearly understood as laid out in the un charter that an attack on any of the sixteen nato signatories would be considered by the united states as an attack upon it it was possible of course that the sovietwarsaw pact forces could attack all three points at once this was considered highly unlikely however as even with the soviets overwhelming numerical advantage of forty thousand main battle tanks against natos twenty thousand six combat soldiers to natos one it would mean the swp splitting their forces against the numerically inferior but mechanically superior nato armor in fulda gap fifty kilometers northeast of fulda on the central german front stood tower alfa natos forwardmost observation post along the trace the fiftyyardwide dmz that stretched for miles separating the two germanys here the americans of the us fifth armys blackstone regiment had the responsibility of guarding the fifteen miles of the arrowheadshaped sector not far back from the tower in the platoon hut they had been through the routine quite literally a thousand times snatching up rifles on the double the white and turquoise walls of the hut a blur as they raced out to man the machinegun posts and the ms never knowing when the choking horn sounding the jump from normal alert to military vigilance to reinforced alert and finally to general alert meant a drill or the real thing but the americans were always keen no matter how many times theyd been through it as mindful as hans meir the wermacht liaison officer serving with them that if the russian ts came bursting through the gap the men at alfa would be at the point of maximum danger that a world war might stop or proceed depending on the swiftness and the bravery of their response meir had never forgotten his grandfather telling him how if just one officer one man had stood firm on the bridge across the rhine in that fateful summer of world war ii might never have begun hitler having secretly ordered his men not to proceed if resistance was met after that meirs grandfather had explained it was all downhill to munich being stationed at alfa therefore was an awesome responsibility for young men and their commander lieutenant general sutherland never tired of telling them that their greatest danger lay not in the bean count the twotoone numerical superiority of the russians and warsaw pack armies in men tanks and aircraft a count used to get us congressmen to vote for better more sophisticated weapons but in the very dullness of the alfa routine the general constantly lecturing them on the need to be ready when they had heard of the nka invasion however and the continuing debacle of american arms in south korea general sutherland said no more the sight of their flag burning on jubilant east german television was enough for hans meir the threat was more pronounced for while his parents lived in west germany in frankfurt only seventy miles southwest of the fulda gap his sister her husband and two children whom he had never met still lived in east berlin a hundred miles northeast of fulda meir knew that if war ever did break out the vast sea of the sovietwp armies would immediately close the lonely narrow onehundredmilelong corridor that ran from west germany to the island of west berlin hunkered down in the most forward machinegun post by the lonely creamcolored watchtower overlooking the pleasant rolling countryside beyond fulda gap hans meir prayed though he was not sure whether he believed in god or not that the koreasache korean business as they were calling itwould soon be over that tempers would cool logic applied as darkness descended over the trace he saw the lights of east german farms come on like tiny stars in another universe chapter twentythree a long shiny black zil swept out of sheremetyevo airport in a gray dawn heading south through the green belt before reaching moscows outer ring passing through the flickering sunlight of the garden ring road arriving a half hour later in dzerzhinsky square outside the childrens world the route was a small variation in director chernkos routine for normally the head of the sixhundredthousandman kgb would have been driven either to the front of or behind the ochercolored facade of number dzerzhinsky square chernko preferred the older sevenstory allrussian insurance company building fronting on lubyanka prison rather than the ugly modern headquarters in the suburbs chernko did not intend to make any mistakes and small changes in his arrival routine were part of his plan to keep any potential assassin off balance he knew that to confound madmen wanting to kill you was a difficult thing even in the ussr but there was no point in helping them besides it was a good example to set for those of his agents still in training variation in standard procedure was the most difficult thing to imbue a good agent with after all theyd been brought up in a world of apparatchiks bureaucrats for whom conformity to the rigid system was safety and there was another good reason for obeying strict procedure orthodoxy in terms of chain of command and basic trade craft was essential if the first directorates one hundred thousand agents abroad were to function with any discipline but now summoned home for an extraordinary meeting of the politburo when the korean war broke while he was attending a highlevel ussrus peace study group in zurich chernko knew that if his supposition about what the politburo meeting would be about was correct then the agents he wanted now would be the most unorthodox the most willing to adapt to quickly changing circumstances indeed the first order the tall asceticlooking chernko gave his aide upon reaching his seventhfloor office was to bring the files of all operatives in canus canada and the united states who had been disciplined in the last two years for exceeding their authority andor violating operational procedure as the major went to records on the fourth floor chernko pressed the buzzer for tea the swiss could make superb coffee but their tea it was as weak as a congressmans principles chernko liked his tea so dark he had told his staff that i can fill my fountain pen with it when it arrived on a silver salver he took a cube of hard sugar placed it between tobaccostained teeth and sipped the steaming brew glad to be home looking out over the square the breezes blowing softly down from the lenin hills to the west carried a smell that for chernko was as nostalgic as watching the shivering leaves of beech in the last golden light it brought a sense of sadness of time lost never to be recovered of long summer days when he and the other privileged nachalstvothe establishmentenjoyed their cool dachas at uspenskoye by the moscow river yet as well as nostalgia for the past the smell of autumn carried with it the feeling of hopethat the americans would see all the signals the idea of the volunteer force released by the politburo and quickly picked up by the western media the presence of the eastern fleet in the china sea the maneuvers off cam rahn bay amphibious maneuvers the phrase that had been suggested by colonel marchenko had precisely the right tone telling the americans that if the soviet union wanted to land on the korean peninsula in force it could chernkos aide returned with the list of agents there were seventythree whod been cited for infractions the most common being excessively high expense accounts back when the american president carter proposed a tax on the twomartini lunch chernko told the major it raised more hackles with our washington head of station than with the capitalists on wall street the major said he was surprised by the number of infractions its the american air chernko said halfjokingly it encourages rebellion against rules the major gave a noncommittal nod sipping his tea chernko ignored the cases of inflated expense accounts and odd unadvised liaisons with street women finally he had ticked off fourteen names eleven men three women who had been singled out for uprostit delo cutting comersa phrase that meant that in these cases the agent had upon encountering unexpected difficulties violated strict precautionary measures a series of obsessionally followed multiple checks against entrapment or enemy surveillance these are the ones chernko said arrange special meets he instructed the major no code transmits no pouch by hand vancouver the point of entry advisories to toronto and new york yes sir special couriers no well use our two best izvestia people to take the instructions journalistic cover chernko thought for a minute picking up another cube of sugar travel piecesthis land is your land east to west that sort of thing he saw the major didnt get the play on words of the popular american folk tune he toyed with the sugar cube as he looked down the list tapping the yellow paper vancouver is sister city to odessa isnt it the major was embarrassed he didnt know ah we have a consulate there yes it is said chernko answering his own question odessa and vancouver in the fall a nice travel piece csis the canadian security intelligence service had montreal and toronto pretty well bottled up and the cia of course had new york well covered but vancouver was known within the first directorate as not only an easy entry point to the united states but also as one of the most beautiful cities in north america which would make the journalist cover more convincing how many agents will be going through asked the major ill start preparing the paperwork chernko drank his tea until the sugar cube crumbled under the pressure none he answered the major no we dont want to start putting in new people now major he gave an enigmatic smile it would upset the cia he glanced up at the clock below the mounted emblem of the gold shield and sword i have to meet with the premier in half an hour two cars yes sir answered the major picking up the phone to order the cars while deducing that if delivery of the directorates message necessitated the directorate using two of their top journalist agents in izvestia and not even entrusting it to top secret code traffic between moscow and the soviet embassy in washington then the message must be one of the most important moscow center had sent in years it was as the zil picked up speed across the square the twin flashing red lights on either side of the spassky gate changed to green the guards coming to attention and saluting chernko looked across at the major major do you remember rust the major thought hard was he one of the agents in place a sleeper in america or was it canada the german hooligan said chernko he landed a plane in red square here yes of course about this time of morning added chernko as the battered white volga sedan they were riding in behind the decoy zil limousine slowed before entering the kremlins sulfurcolored inner sanctum from here chernko could see the red star high above the bell tower of ivan the great chernko allowed himself a smile of satisfaction of course that hooligan performed a great service to the revolution the major who prided himself on a photographic memory was having a bad day how is that comrade director he allowed gorbachev to fire the minister of defense and his clique all the old bednyagifarts in the party the ones resistant to change chernko saw that another zil was entering the courtyard it was admiral doldich all stars and flags a wonder there wasnt a brass band and chernko continued the hooligan helped comrade gorbachev break down opposition to perestroika and opposition to detente with the united states new openness gorbachev and reagan a breath of fresh air you see just what we needed the major was nodding it had indeed been the schastlivoe vremya happy timefor the kgb so that now chernko said as the door opened we are ready he nodded to doldich morning admiral comrade director responded the admiral the navy man would not have made a good agent chernko thought his expectant look his need for help was written all over his face as they walked to the premiers office the admiral announced forlornly the fools have attacked an american frigate i know replied chernko satellite pictures show it is still burning is your fleet steaming south the admiral looked up warily at chernko your agents can tell you an american frigate is afire but they miss my whole fleet how is that chernko started to smile but saw the admiral wasnt in a joking mood of course we did not miss it he explained but i mean have you reduced speed the admiral glanced about as they continued walking toward the premiers office yes will you stop it no the americans would see that as indecisiveness quite correct commented chernko foolhardiness was one danger indecisiveness the other yes he assured the admiral the best thing is to steer a middle course the admiral frowned with concern this is very difficult to do with japan on your port side and korea on your starboard theres not much room no one of the premiers aides rushed by them a sheaf of cables in a folder ive never seen them move so fast said chernko now whats happened worried the admiral aloud the damned cubans interjected a voice from behind it was the air marshal with that loudmouth castro gone i thought theyd settle down but no i tell you their biggest export is trouble chapter twentyfour in seoul thirtythree thousand american soldiers in the biggest mass surrender since corrigedor in made the short but humiliating march across the nkas pontoon bridge built in the shadow of the old chamshil iron bridge toward the shellpocked olympic stadium where they were separated according to regiment fiftytwo senior officers were weeded out as quickly as possible the nka interrogators insisting upon pain of death that the officers sign confessions of criminal imperialistic aggression against the democratic republic of korea only three signed seventeen of the others described over the loudspeakers as recalcitrant warmongers were shot in the dressing rooms below the baseball stadium their bodies dumped on the diamond from a captured us army truck that roared about the field of six thousand prisoners the blood of the murdered men dark on the poorly lit artificial turf one of the bedraggled and shellshocked soldiers a us private from the eleventh division clutching a military blanket about him watched each of the bodies fall limply onto the treadtorn diamond wondering aloud why they had not killed all of the officers who had refused to sign why seventeen he asked numbly of no one in particular to scare us answered an rok lieutenant who had torn his intelligence corps patches off moments before he was captured to show the others what happens if they hold out to show us what will happen if we resist the american looked around the dimly lit stadium few of the lights working after the artillery barrage there are ten times as many prisoners here as guards but theyve got the guns said the rok soldier one of the bodies they saw was a major his collar stud standing out even in the poor light he looked as if he were smiling but it was an illusion a death mask of pain tortured before they shot him the private noticed for the first time that the white us stars on the trucks doors had been smeared red when it drove out of the stadium there was a silence heavy with the stench of pickled cabbage and excrement the nka had forbidden use of any of the toilets behind the stands and most of the wounded were now crowded into the north corner beyond the diamond where they had to defecate into a shallow trench soon the loudspeakers were ordering all intelligence officers to report to the stands fuck you the rok lieutenant shouted in perfect english and got a weak round of applause chapter twentyfive heading out into the midatlantic the us nuclear submarine uss roosevelt received its digitized burst message via its trailing vlf aerial the message lasted less than twohundredths of a second too short a time to alert an enemy sub to vector the roosevelt one of the sea wolf class ii dualpurpose hunterkiller and ballistic missile subs normally patrolled deep at a thousand feet below the surface but in order to be on station to receive the scheduled burst message through its very low frequency aerial the subs captain fortythreeyearold robert brentwood had had to bring the roosevelt to feet the message told robert brentwood and his crew two things they were spot on their prearranged patrol route and the balloon had gone up in korea this meant that they like all nato units were now on the second stage of the fourstepalert ladder but as to exactly what had happened in korea they did not know nor under the cnos standing orders was it necessary for them to know what had gone on over seven thousand miles away besides the coded messages in order to keep the location of the american subs secret from the russians had to be kept as short as possible your brothers out there somewhere with the seventh fleet isnt he captain asked the executive officer peter zeldman last i heard answered brentwood gm frigate your kid brother might end up in action before you do skipper hopefully pete none of usll end up in action said robert thoughtfully adding my guess is its some border incident on the dmz probably blow over in a few days zeldman wished he hadnt said anything about the skippers brother hed merely meant it as a bit of conversation something that was in short supply on a sixmonth patrol back and forth across the atlantic in various attack and defensive patterns between norfolk virginia and holy loch the immediate question for the crew was how long would it be before they were in scotland robert brentwood knew that next to being home in the united states the high point for most of them was refit and supply at the scottish sub base while the repairs at holy loch were usually minor not requiring a stay of more than a day or two sometimes they had more shore leave than expected if he decided a new coat of anechoic or sponge paint as the crews called it was needed the red paint absorbed active sonar pulses sent out by sub chasers and so denied them any return echo or at least diluted the echo so much that it was too weak to be of any use to the enemy painting the bottom of the footlong footwide sub that served both as an attack submarine and a trident ii balistic missile carrier was a job that took two weeks in the dry dock affording the crews alternating shifts at least a weeks liberty even longer if the subs barnacleencrusted exterior had to be scraped down and new primer applied however with roosevelt on secondstage alert executive officer zeldman had a hunch none of them would be seeing holy loch for a while he put the question to brentwood who said well see skippers not exactly bursting with information is he said the third officer hes got his reasons answered zeldman not permitting himself to be drawn into taking sides but the lieutenant did have a point zeldman couldnt quite figure brentwood out either he was one of those men zeldman thought who seemed to be born old it wasnt that he looked old despite slightly graying hair but rather that he had an unflappable manner and deepset brown eyes with a penetrating quality about them that constantly made you feel he knew what you were going to say before you said it luckily however unlike some people who thought they knew everything robert brentwood wasnt the least bit arrogant or impatient with others the kind of man zeldman concluded a boy would be lucky to have as a father but zeldman doubted if the skipper would ever be one he wasnt married unlike most of the crew or even engaged zeldman had put it down to brentwoods obsession with his work he was first and foremost a submariner everything else took second place so much so that zeldman had become convinced that though robert brentwood came across as a strong silent type he must be driven deep down by a burning ambition to surpass his fathers achievement as admiral zeldman was quite wrong about this robert brentwood had no intention of trying to surpass his fathers reputation he merely loved submarines always had years before when lana and david had asked him how he could possibly sign on for coffin duty in what was essentially nine titaniumalloy spheres welded together and covered in a superstructure that at times looked stronger than it really was robert brentwood had no good answer all he could tell them was that he did not share their fear of death by sudden implosion death was inevitable the way you went he told them was beside the point and what zeldman had at first taken to be his quiet allknowing air was nothing more than shyness brentwood was conscious that his reticence was often misinterpreted by the men on the tennessee as aloofness a kind of carefully constructed emotional shield between captain and crew so that orders were less likely to be questioned in times of crisis with women it was different for he discovered that most of them intuitively understood that his shyness was not a deliberately erected barrier or a lack of feeling but rather the quietude of a man confident in himself and his work a man most of them liked but one whose most passionate affair was with the sea a pretty young englishwoman in her late twenties during one of the welcomeashore parties arranged by the british admiralty at holy loch had once unabashedly told robert brentwood over her half pint of guiness id like to go to bed with you thank you hed replied its so then no sorry the woman had appeared stunned why ever not not before marriage the girl a smashing blond bit as his english host had described her to brentwood before her arrival had spat out half her guiness in astonished gaiety at the americans joke when she saw he was serious surprise quickly gave way to anger youre not a sailor it was delivered with all the finesse of a depth charge meant to shake the very bulwark of his masculinity i can assure you i am maam dont maam me are you queer no maam jesus youre worse than bing crosby she said pushing a napkin at him to wipe off the chocolatey stain of guiness brentwood had taken the train to london a few days later for a bit of sightseeing and had ordered a biography of bing crosby at marriages bookstore back list sir the manager informed him without bothering to consult books in print we could have it in five days brentwood told him he wouldnt be able to pick it up for about three months but offered payment thats not necessary sir the manager informed him brentwood ordered the book anyway mad at himself for having mentioned how long hed be away the length of his next patrol a breech of security for which brentwood roundly chastised himself a few days later when he returned to the ship then in the floating dry dock he asked zeldman one morning you know anything about bing crosby the executive officer had shrugged big shot in the forties and fifties i think a crooner whats that a singer what kind of singer not sure my grandpa used to talk about him love songs far as i can recall pretty slow was he ever married think so said zeldman whod been pouring the coffee in the galley at the time his voice rising above the hammering echoing through the roosevelt as yard birds replaced one of the hatches on the six multiwarhead missile bays aft of the sail which the sub carried along with the eight attack torpedo tubes forward standing in the sail as theyd slid slowly out of holy loch for another nato atlantic patrol the second officer had asked zeldman ex you ever heard of a bing crosby for crying out loud said zeldman whats with this bing crosby skipper was on about that yesterday yeah said the second officer he was asking me this morning from that point on captain robert brentwood became known as bing among his crew and the boats unofficial theme song was moon river crew members occasionally providing impromptu renditions during offhours zeldman figured that if the skipper heard some of the associated jokes his hair would turn completely gray overnight chapter twentysix lin kuang stood alone in the forest darkness high above taiwans taroko gorge the sound of the rushing river far below melding with the swishing sound of the wind in the pines and here he pledged to matsu goddess of the sea by all that was holy to him that he was ready for battle the waiting was over the invasion fleet ready as it had been since his grandfathers day since that terrible day in when the communists had driven the kuomintang to the sea when thanks to the mercy of matsu the fleet of the two million chinese nationalists under chiang kaishek had arrived safely on taiwan and made it their own lin kuang had never been home to the mainland but one night as a junior officer years before he had been the captain of one of the nationalist navys motor torpedo boats that had landed a raiding party during the intermittent fighting over quemoy island just off the mainland the purpose of the raid was ostensibly to gather and update intelligence reports on the communist ports defenses but the real purpose was to keep every soldier in the kmt practiced and ready to prevent them from ever sinking into the passive acceptance shown by the rest of taiwans eighteen million of believing that formosa as taiwan used to be called was home the kmt ruled taiwan and built up enormous financial reserves to the point that it was now after japan the richest asian nation but with the legendary chinese patience the kmt had never lost the belief that the communists in beijing were but temporary usurpers one day to be thrown out unlike so many westerners who accepted the legitimacy of communist china and had now turned their back on taiwan lin kuang and his fellow officers never doubted that one day it would be their day to return superbly trained equipped through their billions of surplus dollars with the latest in technological advances in the west the kmt knew that the communist hold on mainland china was in large measure an illusion the chinese communist party constituting only percent of the population could no longer hold it together there were hundreds of millions in the farflung regions of china who had never been anywhere near beijing for whom beijing might as well have been on the moon as there were many millions in the farflung republics of the soviet union whose loyalty to moscow was as tenuous as a failing marriage the parents unable to control the children who sensed the great divide and wanted to go their own way promise the farflung republics their own country said the kmt and the center was yours lin kuang closed his eyes breathed m the cool damp air happy that autumn was upon them it was a time for changewhen men would need to brace themselves for the stormy seas of winter in his minds eye he was no longer inhaling the air of taiwan but that of hangzhou where his fathers fathers had been born and raised the city of which marco polo had once said in heaven there is paradise on earth hangzhou there on the west lake serene amid a garden of gladioli lawn and fish ponds was maos villa it was lin kuangs dream to be the one to retake hangzhou to personally raze the villa to the ground in washington state mount raniers volcanic cone was visible from seattles northwest university over sixty miles away the mountains peak shrouded in a rosy hue of pollution and midday sun while fourteen miles west of the city a trident nuclear submarine glided gracefully out of the upper reaches of hood canal it passed the spidery wire webs of the onshore degaussing stations which would wipe the sub clean of any telltale magnetic signature that might otherwise be picked up by a ship nearby especially the soviet trawlers that often lay listening north of the bangor base beyond the strait of juan de fuca which ran between washingtons olympic peninsula and vancouver island sometimes as was the case this day a coast guard cutter plowed ahead of the trident making lots of noise and running interference against hydrophone arrays that might be trailing behind a russian trawler as the sub headed into the vastness of the blue pacific david brentwoods father had often taken him out to see the ships leaving the east coast and david always found it a calming experience which was why hed driven out to the placid waters of the canal the fight with melissa was still officially on but hed hoped that if he could cool down by the time he got back that evening then she would have simmered down too he needed her especially now for on the circuitous route down through tacoma and up across to bremerton the classic rock and roll hed been listening to on the buicks radio had been interrupted by a news flash that an american frigate had been attacked in the sea of japan but as yet the pentagon hadnt given out the name somehow david knew in his gut that it was the blaine by the time hed reached bangor another radio flash had cut into the program it was the uss blaine no information on casualties then forty minutes later a pentagon announcement saying the ship had apparently been hit twice the national security council and combined chiefs of staff were meeting with the president david felt terribly guilty he had grown up in a naval family his grandfather had fought at midway but instead of following his brothers into the navy he had bitterly disappointed his father by joining the army reserves at northwestern instead of the naval reserves now he suddenly felt somehow responsible that somehow he should be in rays place or in roberts place aboard the atlantic fleet sub wherever it was his father had always told him that he didnt care what line of work david got into after college so long as youre happy that at least was the official liberal stance of exadmiral john brentwood he had never indicated any disappointment about david joining the army reserve yet david felt it whenever his father was talking to someone about the boys likewise david held back from talking about his fathers honorclad career for much as he admired his father david always felt pressured to perform as well as his two navy brothers one reason he felt he couldnt but which he had never confided to anyone not even melissa for fear of them thinking him weak was that he had a terror of the sea itself from a distance he could admire and enjoy it as one admired people on the high trapeze but the very idea of dying at sea of being entombed forever in the great dark abyss sent a cold shiver through his bowels his father obviously without meaning to terrify him and more as a simple point of information had once told him when david was a young boy that the marianas trench in the pacific was as deep as everest was high to david it became an idée fixe a phobia that no doubt like all phobias would merely have sounded silly to someone else but one that for a young man from a distinguished naval family was nothing short of cowardice the thought of the closedin darkness the enormous pressures that could crumble bones to dustthat was another of his fathers favorites began to haunt david to obsess him so much hed gone to the library at his primary school and with all the guilt of a pornographer had looked up whether his father was right about the marianas trench surely nothing could be as deep as mount everestwas high his hands trembled as he flicked over the ms in the encyclopedia heart racing ready to shut it immediately should anyone approach him the marianas trench wasn t as deep as everest was high it was deeper by another five thousand feet later davids rational side did battle with his irrational shadows after all to die was to die but logic held no ground in the battle between primeval fear of being buried in blackness and the calm logic that argued that however you died was in the end immaterial the memory of seeing his grandmothers body borne away on a wet and windy fall day in new york the sounds of horns honking impatiently and uncaring from behind the hearse as rainpolished it pulled off into the cemetery had stayed with him watching the coffin lowered hearing the run of the ropes and the thump of the clay to close you in forever hed decided there and then he would be cremated when it came his time but did the soul still rise or did it die too in the funeral pyre driving back to northwestern anxious about whether or not ray had been injured or killed he heard a pentagon spokesperson come on the radio informing the press that at this point in time we cannot categorically say whether the missile was fired by another vessel or a plane the woman droned on with more points in time instead of presently and it all added up to the pentagon wasnt sure what the hell had happened david watched the long black sub now no more than the size of a small branch floating out on the clean and vibrant blue taking what he could from its deceptive serenity as much as hed feared the sea he also felt a strange communion with it at times an attraction of opposites david thought of his mother pained at the thought of her pain on the other side of the country and it plunged him into a dilemma should he go back that evening to be with his folks his father of course would never admit it not for me son you understand but itd do wonders for your mom thrown her for a loop david well dad mom she handles loops pretty well why dont you just say davy i need you or should he wait a few days first until the pentagon knew for sure what had happened who was hurt driving over the seattle overpass david thought of how melissa would be waiting for him now full of sympathy and feminine comfort god he could play it to the hilt if he wanted stoic expression the brentwood tradition just as quickly he was ashamed of even thinking of using it to his advantage as he thought of her he felt himself getting hard was it normal his brother thousands of miles away the blaine and ray in god knows what shape and here his kid brother at home was so damned horny that the mere thought of having a woman could override his concern for his brother david could see her now she was slipping off her jeans but nothing else yet parading for him in the semidarkness of his room he could feel her hand cupping him squeezing bringing him to her in one long even pull a light changed to red and he hit the brakes next to him a big mack semitruck shuddered its raw power barely held in check the driver chewing gum looked down at him shaking his head when david got to her dorm it was four in the afternoon there was a note for him folded and taped to the doorknob davy its dreadful i just heard be back from seminar fivethirty wait for me love you lissa he went down to the dorms lounge room and wandered over to the pop machine before flicking on the tv dave he turned around to see it was stacy only guy he knew who wore a bow tie to class he had a short neck too looked ridiculous and loaded with library books for effect you get the message asked stacy melissas davy asked annoyed that stacy knew ahead of him had probably read it too no answered stacy your dorm havent been there yet answered david oh reserves are being called up fort lewis your names on the list david felt a rush in his gut you sure brentwood d thats you old buddy hey listen im sorry about your brother damn stacy why the hell didnt he give you the messages one at a time and in order for gods sake david wanted to ask him what exactly hed heard about the reserves but hesitated stacy thrived on the drama all right so what did you hear you mean you havent heard jesus christ stacy whats going on it was hit pretty bad looks like cbs is running an indepth report at seven sometimes david didnt know whether stacy was just plain dumbindepthor was just too gee whiz to realize how insensitive he was to others indepthchrist some file footage probably with a cutesy leadin blaines shame or how about bam in the sea of japanthat would be par for the course these days davids anger was now turning to consternation and turmoil the upgraded hazard perryclass frigate as his father proudly told anyone whod listen was one of the worlds most sophisticated warships its phalanx radarweapons system capable of tracking and destroying multiple targets simultaneously how was it possible that the blaine for a moment he thought his brothers frigate might have been blindsided one of the defense systems turned off as it had been on the stark david just as quickly dismissed the idea from his mind hell that mistake on the stark had been imprinted on the mind of every cadet out of annapolis his brother ray had even made up some kind of sign about it or so his dad had told them dont forget the stark or something it was also clear now that stacy hadnt been trying to be a smartass with his indepth pun and that he david had simply been overreacting then stacy gave him a slip of paper the number at fort lewis that all the college reservists were supposed to call was stacy helping him or helping stacy very considerate of him to have it all ready like this almost as if stacy was in a hurry to see him off campus i guess this is the downside commented stacy as they approached the quad cypress trees glistening with rain from the night before of what pressed david trying to be civil despite the conflicting responsibilities and choices coming down on him his mom fort lewis melissa a possible extension might be granted from the army until fall terms end but how would it look with his brother downside of the army paying your tuition stacy explained enthusiastically you know tit for tat yeah said david trying to hide the fact that stacy was getting to him if thats what he was up to you could get a deferment probably opined stacy i know a guy in commerce hes a corker at writing out requests for deferment he did it for a corker asked david the little shit was definitely trying to get to him sorry said stacy with an air of ivy league superiority except that he was on the opposite side of the country corkers a british expression explained stacy you know means firstclass top of the line my roommates a brit i pick up things like that i guess what things brits or the way they talk way they talk old boy dont you know barf brentwood didnt know which would be worse putting up with this crap for another term or fighting gooks melissa had got after him one time for calling them that as he reached his dorm gladly saying goodbye or toorooloo as stacy had put it david brentwood knew there was only a slight chance he could apply for a deferment from the callup of reserves he started to get mad with his brothers just as he had as a youngster always having felt he had to measure up to them what the hell had ray been doing out there anyway daydreaming walking slowly up the cement stairs the dark shaded mouth of the dorm swallowing him like some leviathan of the deep he recalled theyd said something on the radio about patrol boats having attacked the ship but had they been russian or north korean or did they say south korean he was confused everything seemed to be coming apart at the seams chapter twentyseven because he had been summoned to report immediately to the chungang chongbobusouth koreas cia headquarters during the hours before seouls fall chin sung was unable to attend the funeral of lee sok jo his young colleague who had been with him as the students had rioted outside the secret gardens chin had been ordered to proceed on what he was told would be the most important mission of his career he was flown out of seoul by one of the few remaining helicopters to pusan and then to tokyo the apache chopper ferrying him across the sea of japan barely made it being mistaken for a split second by an f out of japan for a soviet mi havoc the rok pilot ferrying chin frantically firing off packs of flares lest the heatseeking missile be fired by the americans by mistake from pusan chin had flown to tokyo the immaculate khakiuniformed and whitegloved japanese police were out in force at narita the airport having become a target once again for the japanese red guard terrorist faction who encouraged by north koreas bold move were now issuing more than their usual weekly number of bomb threats the sight of the japanese police was at once reassuring to chin and disturbing in his grandfathers day the japanese had been the everpresent enemy not only from across the east sea but as occupying troops whom it had taken korea over thirtyfive years to evict their loyalty to the emperor and their legendary cleanliness and cruelty were inextricably linked in chins mind to all the images of childhood hatred but now as allies of the united states japan and the rok were in the same boat one that as south koreas ashenfaced president told chin was rapidly sinking doomed if the americans could not stop the nka washington he confided in chin as if chin were hearing it for the first time had lost all stomach for another fight in asia after the humiliation of vietnam said the rok president the american public simply would not tolerate another asian adventure ninety minutes after he had left the president and was en route to pusan chin heard that seoul had fallen the shock of it caused him to walk about naritas crowded rotundashaped waiting tower all but oblivious to what was going on around him no one seemed to be talking about it most of the passengers canadians americans and australians on stopovers out of shanghai and communist hong kong didnt they realize what was happening if korea went the western world would not have a single foothold on mainland asia chin sat down listening carefully to the public address system worried he might have missed the first call for his flight to europe everything was strange the disinfectantlike odor of the waiting room the buzz of tourists preoccupied like him with the tv arrival and departure monitors the fresh fruit juice counters the dolllike complexion of the young girls in white behind the counters above all the absence of familiar smells nothing was familiar nothing reassuring heard about seoul mate he heard an australian asking a friend it reminded him of the old beer ads by crocodile dundee nah said the other australian last i heard the commiesd surrounded it surrounded it theyve taken it mate lock stock and barrel yanks threw in the towel hour or so ago what the whole shebang not yet only seoul so far but its just a matter of time i reckon the australian made a joke about the south koreans having four gears in their tanks one forward three for reverse the other aussie indicated chin sitting near him the korean airlines bag at his feet its loop handle around one ankle sorry mate said the australian to chin me and my bloody big mouth just skylarkin sport skylarking chin had never heard the expression before but it was an old joke usually made by americans about the rok it hurt and though the two australians had no way of knowing it in chins mind their comments had confirmed the necessity of his mission even if the us reserves from japan arrived they were not battletried they might not even be able to land their convoy if blocked or otherwise engaged by the soviet eastern fleet steaming south or if they were attacked by one of the nkas diesel submarines president rah had been right if the republic of korea was to be saved from communism from utter defeat drastic actions were called for the announcement came over the pa for the lufthansa flight to west berlin it was surprisingly clearvoiced unencumbered by the usual hollow echoes of most other airports hed been in and chin took it as a good sign aboard the plane chin waited till takeoff watching the passengers watching the cabin attendants watching the video of what to do in an emergency he knew what to do it was getting there that would be the problem they had a safe house in kreuzberg three miles south of the old reichstag and two miles southeast of the church of reconciliation reconciliation normally it would have elicited a wry comment from him to lee sok jo but lee sok jo was dead and besides chin was too tired before the movie in which a grayhaired tom cruise was playing a dignified old general forced out of office for opposition to a new spacedecked beam weapon chin went to the toilet and unbuttoned his shirt taking a sheaf of deutsch marks from the money belt they didnt want him to use any travelers checks and signatures that either the west or east german intelligence services could trace one of the deutsch marks had been torn in half the meet in berlin would take place only when the other half of the bank note was received by chin the fact that the note had been hastily torn ripped rather than neatly cut with scissors was only a minor detail and made do difference to chin but the tear spoke volumes in terms of the urgency with which the operation had been set in place it was thought chin as if the person in the chungang chongbobu who had torn the deutsch mark had done it with trembling hands when he returned to his seat chin sat back and tried to watch the movie people were laughing but chin couldnt hear it properly the earphones crackling besides his sinuses were acting up again he pulled out his dristan bottle and took a sniff at thirtyfive thousand feet the sinuses cleared but he knew from his previous trips abroad that the trouble would start as soon as they began to descend the pain like a redhot needle being pushed through the bone directly above the bridge of your nose the thing that worried him most was that the success of the nkas special forces sabotage meant that the nka network had been extensive and well trained so that it was naive for him to think that pusan a major gateway to the west had not been carefully watched by nka operatives the question was had they had time to make him andor follow him onto the same flight he looked around the plane seemed full and they would have had to bump someone or buy out someone elses ticket to get space on such short notice of course it wasnt essential that they start at this end they could merely fax instructions through to berlin and follow him out from tempelhof if it was someone on the plane it would be someone chin thought very much like him no luggage to declare so as not to be delayed in customs theyd be carrying an overnight bag maybe a camera touristylooking chapter twentyeight colonel douglas freeman dreamed of war the thought of commanding vast armies on a european front as battle moved back and forth across the surface of the earth so filled his imagination the scenes of glory that visited him so powerful that at times he couldnt sleep then walking quietly down to the main floor of his house or rather the armys house which overlooked monterey beach he would stare out into the darkness of the sea beyond the line of fluorescent waves at once convinced that his destiny was nowhere near fulfilled yet anxious as to what form it might take and when in his basement den tv earpiece in so as not to disturb his wife doreen sleeping above freeman would replay the videos of all the wars from the reconstructed sites of the peloponnesian war to videos of victory at sea the great war the longlost battles of indochina and the most recently released footage from britains war office of the communist insurgency in malaysia and the falklands war everyone else who freeman knew in the armored corps was busily writing tanks off the debacle of the mis in the uijongbu corridor supporting them but freeman believed the problem was not the team but the tactics they were still fighting world war ii that was the trouble the hardest thing he knew as did guderian liddell hart and patton was to get a man to change his habit simple things ask someone who loves coffee to drink water a smoker to quit to move anyone out of a mode that for all its inconveniences and ill side effects hes grown familiar with and you might as well talk to a rock and after forty forget it freeman knew colonels no older than he was at fiftyfive who finding themselves in a crowded field for promotion had simply stopped trying accepting that colonel was as far as theyd go freeman wanted to break out he heard a faint scratching upstairs their cat alexander clawing at the kitchen door and doreen getting up to let him out freeman preferred dogs cats could be so damned uppity but he and doreen had compromised the persian doglike in his loyalty freeman expected loyalty unconditionally and it was something he and his wife had given each other for the most part it had meant a happy marriage with doreen independent enough not to let the service life from here to there get her down and now with their two girls out of the nest and settled down life was easier than it had been for years but freeman knew he would have few if any regrets if suddenly called upon to serve in europe if war broke out while other colonels he knew were planning their retirement talking about secure portfolios with the bright young men from harvard business school freeman spent most of his time in his basement poring over his mockups of european battlefields demolishing the armys main battle tank and armored vehicle tactics history repeated itself and yet it did not like a football field the terrain remained the same but each match was different no matter if youd played the game a thousand times before the important thing he kept telling himself was to keep yourself fit and ready he heard the slap of the morning paper on his porch and went upstairs still in his robe he glanced at the headlines and began muttering korea was a rout air strikes from the seventh fleet were unable to inflict any decisive damage on the communists so long as the north korean troops continued to mingle with the panicstricken streams of refugees he switched on the tv good morning america the nato line was on full alert sovietwp forces flexing muscle along the line but both sides informing the other of any unusually heavy movement above battalion or squadron strength but the state department spokeswoman was assuring everyone that despite the worsening situation in the korean peninsula the state department and the white house believed that there is no danger of an outbreak of hostilities elsewhere the nato and sovietwarsaw pact alert it was explained is fairly standard procedure in times of such tension freeman shook his head sardonically at the state departments use of the korean peninsula instead of plain korea peninsula made it seem not only far away and out of sight but a minor inconvenience merely a wart on the body politic freeman sat there as the flickering tv images filled the darkened room like the flashes of distant artillery more conscious now of the crashing of the sea no more than a hundred yards away suddenly depressed by it all wondering how many other men and women in their time had sat through their imaginations lonely vigilance in the night and dreamed of faroff glory of things yet undone of leading their country out of dark hazard he was thinking again of football of how the t formation that had revolutionized the game had come directly from coach shaughnessys study of guderians panzers tactics during the infamous blitzkrieg of that had overrun france thought to be the greatest military power of her day in less than ten days shaughnessy was careful not to tell his players or anyone else hed been studying the nazis but he started drawing funny diagrams on the board and then suddenly it happened the chicago bears devastated the washington redskins defense bears seventythree washington zip then shaughnessy took the t formation to stanford derided as the alltime losers in the pacific coast conference another blitzkrieg a lightning run which shot stanford from the doghouse of the pacific coast conference to whipping nebraska twentyone to thirteen but freeman knew as shaughnessy had that tactics are always changing shaughnessys t formations were no longer as effective in the modern world and just as the football coach had studied the german general it was now time freeman believed for the general to look at the new game of football increased sophistication in communication allowing instantaneous instructions from coach to player was akin to the stateoftheart electronic communications between the tank commander and his echelons there was less time to make a decision and the only way to counteract it was to buy time with more sophisticated deception he had thought about it long and hard and now on impulse took out a piece of blank by typing paper wrote down his assessment a battle plan folded it meticulously slipped it into an envelope and went upstairs doreen was putting on the toast she was used to him being up so early but this morning he was scratching his wrist he was chafing at the bit you okay she asked switching on the coffee grinder it sounded like a loose bearing hed once heard rattling around in an ms gearshift im okay he answered how much extra is special delivery another dollar youre better off using fax she advised no he said its personal who is she larry oakes twostar general in the pentagon whats he got that i havent he slapped her on the bottom with the envelope clout can i ask what its about europe answered freeman possible attack plan for the russian c in c youll look a bit foolish if youre wrong cant win it if youre not in it she finished for him its worth a try they wont attack nato she said matteroffactly maybe he put the envelope beneath his car keys and what would happen to me she asked well he said kissing her on the cheek its all hypothesis alexander was scratching at the door in washington dc it was hot and muggy thunderstorms moving in across the river from virginia the presidents coffee had gone cold by the time his national security adviser harry schuman and joint chiefs in the white house situation room had filled him in suggesting different plays now waiting for his decision senator leyland wasnt there but everyone in the united states was hearing what he thought about the situation outside the capitol where there were so many flashbulbs tv lights and microphones that it looked as if they were making a movie leylands call was for decisive action not a time for pussyfooting not simply americas honor were talking about here but her security security was getting high marks in the polls but leyland wasnt saying just where the line should be drawn pusan subic bay wake island midway honolulu how about san diego said trainor watching the senators tv performance if we pull everybody out argued general gray it can only be interpreted for what it is a humiliating defeat people have never forgotten the sight of us scrambling off the top of that embassy in saigon and i might add mr president pushing off so many who had been loyal to us we cant desert the rok general mayne pointed out his tone growing tougher by the minute if its already a humiliating defeat we might be wise to cut our losses i think mr president we have to stand and fight thats what cahill was supposed to do on the dmz not the president waved his hand at the crisis map a sea of red dots spreading like measles over south korea a sprinkling of blue in a rough semicircle in the southeastern comer of the country its outer perimeter an arc stretching south of pohang on the east coast through taegu in the center seventy miles inland and down onto yosu on the south coast pusan the vital southeastern port was halfway between yosu and pohang report from nato asked mayne no unusual movement reported general gray my hunch is that moscows as worried about this as we are mr president i think youre right general but i dont want any triggerhappy private pulling the trigger anyway to be on the safe side ive put a call through to suzlov admiral hortons bushy eyebrows lifted i wouldnt trust suzlov as far as i could kick him their fleets already off manchuria i dont believe that maneuvers line theyre giving us for a moment theres a lot of traffic in and out of cam rahn bay they advised us of that admiral mayne pointed out trojan horse the admiral responded probably carrying enough troops aboard that battle group to reinforce pyongyang three or four hours they could be unloading at wonsan he could see the president didnt know where it was he moved the pointer up along the east coast of north korea only sixty miles from the dmz they come down that coast road well have another front we have to contend with if they turn up at wonsan said mayne well ask them to stop sometimes the admiral simply despaired if the presidents advisers had kept their boss half as well informed about naval matters as they did the latest gallup polls the whole country would be better off the entire soviet order of battle was clearly evident in the satellite and he reminded the president of this theres everything in there from the ninethousandton mike subs to the alfa and yankee classes as well and then if we can see them admiral the russians must want us to know where they are doesnt that tell you something our satellite photos tell us theyre only proceeding at five to ten knots admiral hardly battle speed is it i havent been advised of this we got the call before you arrived interjected trainor from nsa the admiral was embarrassed and trainor could see there was going to be some ass kicking in naval intelligence when the admiral got back to the pentagon then suddenly the embarrassment vanished from the admirals face as he cast a cold professional eye over the chart surveying not only korea but the entire northeast asian operational area from japan to the china sea he quickly calculated the soviet fleets position why had they slowed surely this would upset their amphibious maneuvers timetable a highly complex combinedservices operation that had slim time margins at the best of times my god he said turning to the president that places them on the thirtyninth parallel one thirtyone longitude off wonsan mayne looked across at general gray order the reinforcements en route from japan to disembark at pusan as quickly as possible yes sir chapter twentynine rescue boats all out sir three returning very well answered the skipper of the uss frigate des moines binoculars steadied against the flying bridge stanchion watching through the haze as the two lamp helos dropped vermilion marker flares about the beaufort rafts now two miles or so from the blaine the crippled frigate was listing hard to starboard white smoke still pouring from her now and then a crimson streak of fire could be seen erupting from deep inside her the skipper of the des moines had to make the decision whether or not to use the choppers as additional rescue vehicles or to release them to complement his radar as part of his protective screen all about him he could hear radio chatter between the des moines rescue boats including the shiptoshore launch helos to resume screen he ordered for the price of a few more men lost to exposure in the oilslicked sea the young skipper decided he would prefer to use the choppers as airborne eyes something had gone drastically wrong aboard his sister ship the blaine and until he knew why hed rather be reprimanded for overcaution protecting his ship than have to explain to a naval board of inquiry as brentwood would have to if he pulled through how it was that his men had abandoned the multimilliondollar ship when she was still afloat and though it was sheer chance it wasnt going to do ray brentwood badly wounded as he was any good to have to explain how it was that he and his second officer were the first to be pulled out of the chuck by the des moines already thered been strict orders that upon return to port there was to be no comment made to anyone until admiral horton chief of naval operations had directed otherwise most of the men picked up were already dead drowned despite their life jackets by the oil breathed in some asphyxiated by the lack of oxygen in the oil slick fires that were still burning around the smoking ship sonar contact range three thousand yards bearing asked the skipper zero fiveniner hard right rudder instructed the skipper he flicked onto the cic channel pushing the squelch button drowning out the rescue craft traffic what have we got tom from the cic below the bridge there was a pause the computer racing through engine signature matchup no match which meant it might be hostile but was definitely not friendly the young skipper was thinking fast the signal was increasing its echo louder it should be closing said the skipper to the electronics warfare officer down in the cic how about passive mode any noise from it negative very well torpedoes ready ready standby to fire stand by to fire lookouts sharp the starboard lookout shouted an alarm but it turned out to be one of the white iglooshaped beauforts bobbing up and down contact fading reported the radar operator it was an awful decision the damned thing was thirty fathoms below the surface a new sub with no known signature waiting the computers werent sure absorbing a lot of clutter from the dozen or so small rescue boats and clutter from the sewnin metal reflectors on the beauforts size asked the skipper cant say reported the ewo echo returns but its fuzzy the skipper decided he couldnt take a chance range twelve hundred yards bearing zero six three stand by to fire one and four ready to fire one and four bearing zero six three holding steady range eleven hundred yards and closing fire one and four two mks the most sophisticated torpedoes yet made were running through the chop in excess of sixty feet a second diving homing in on the target contact fading hes hightailing came a voice in the background but the target wasnt running it was the angle of the ship turning that only made it seem that way two miles ahead the sea rose out of itself shattered white and brownspeckled the whoomp of the second torpedo quickly following the first the sound of both reaching the frigate seconds later the brown spots in the white mushroom were beaufort life rafts tumbling down into the vortex of the collapsing column its bubbling base dirty with oil bodies and pieces of metal possibly from the blaine as well as from the target blown skyward several of the blaines crew spilling out of the falling beauforts disappearing along with the glints of metal the contact vanished from the screen the skipper not knowing whether hed sunk an nka diesel sub though this surely would have made more noise or whether what he had torpedoed was a hunk of metal having sunk and been suspended in the heavier salinity layers and for which he had killed over forty more of the blaines already shipwrecked crew those close to the explosions of the torpedoes having their spines and necks snapped by the concussion it was his prerogative and his conscience no board of inquiry would fault him parents would write and say they understood which would be the most terrible burden of all as the lufthansa began its descent into west berlins tempelhof airport chin felt the thickening pressure growing above his eyes he had already taken an ornade capsule but didnt want to use any more he wouldnt be driving which the label warned against but he would need a lot of concentration nothing less than the fate of his country hung in the balance in the seat pocket in front of him he saw a copy of paris match a headline about the communists for peace volunteer force chin was sure the force wouldnt be composed of merely anyone who wanted to fight us imperialist aggression it would be the cream of the crop special forces from the spetsnaz air marine commandos most probably including the pithhelmeted vietnamese the latter particularly courted by moscow as the outstanding brothers in the fraternity of socialist states the ones who had humiliated the americans in vietnam even so it wouldnt be the numbers initially only a few thousand or so from different communist bloc countries that would leave east berlin that would prove to be strategically important in the eyes of the world but rather their entry in the war on the side of the nka even now as affluent young west germans cruised down west berlins neonsparkling kurfürstendamm less than two miles from the eastern sector which though it had ostensibly been socially and commercially integrated with the west retained its own political demarcation proscenium radio and television were reporting that there were already mass rallies in east berlins alexander platz the vast square was jampacked with everyone from athletes marching in from the sportforum in the suburb of weissensee to workers from as far away as karl marx stadt in dresden over a hundred miles south bussedin crowds spilling out onto the unter den linden and down past the reinstated statue of frederick the great while bands played the national anthems of each country from cuba to the dozen or so african nations hardly any of which the east germans knew much about the crowds kept growing and surging amid calls for socialist solidarity in the face of american aggression the east germans were clearly taking the idea of the communist volunteer force much more seriously than moscow then the internationale was struck up by the band of the bereitschafts polizei the blueuniformed civil police and enormous splotches of yellow red and black the longtime colors of the gdr and the red flags of the revolution struck a vivid contrast to the white uniforms of the athletes and the hazy blue sky the east berlin parades could be seen by hundreds of west german residents mainly turkish gastarbeiters or guest workers looking through the holes made by souvenir hunters and down over the remnants of the wall from apartment balconies in kreuzberg the suburb an island of foreigners within the island of west berlin it was here chin now headed within twenty minutes of landing at tempelhof the cab driver like the older insulaners islanders of west berlin had heard all the noise before whenever the communists wanted to whip up an antiwest rally kreuzberg was a suburb which had always been avoided by most west germans not because of its proximity to the old wall but because for most west germans kreuzberg belonged to the turks who had come in their thousands after the wall had gone up in and who though they liked deutsch marks did not like what they saw as west german decadence the turks were not so much unfriendly as separate it suited them and it suited the kcia for in the netherworld of the only west german city exempted from the drafts in order to attract businessmen and young workers kreuzberg had also become a haven for dropouts and squatters it was good cover as they entered the outskirts of kreuzberg chin could still hear bands less than a mile away and the tinny sounds of loudspeakers it seemed as if someone was being denounced and then a band would strike up but because of a wall of trees he could not actually see what was going on and this put him on edge when he arrived at the row house a threestoried redbrick place out of the nineteenth century he saw that the gardens about it had run wild unattended for years many of the cobblestones in the street visible beneath the wornout scabs of bitumen through which green vegetation was poking very ungerman this he knew but one way that frustrated landlords had of trying to force squatters out all it did was attract more appearing twisted and bent the woman walking toward him as he looked through the bubbled glass was an elderly asthmatic and it took her a long time to answer his knocking even before she reached the door chin could smell strong pungent turkish coffee and sausage a batteredlooking golf van came round the corner stopped and unloaded a group of turks who were talking and laughing at the days end as they dispersed down the street most of them smoking and taking no notice of him several doors opened children spilling out onto the road greeting fathers who putting lunch boxes down on the pavement lifted their children high twirling them in the air they seemed oblivious to the racket from beyond the wall chin looked up for the late sun to judge how much time theyd have but it was blocked by me wall which in this part of kreuzberg had not been battered by the souvenir hunters of gorbachevs heyday then he wondered whether the rapidity of the fading light was due to the fact that the wall that rose straight up from the small backyard of the house was blocking it or whether someone in seoul had slipped up in the panic looking at the wrong month on the calendar and so getting the wrong sunset time for all his training this uncertainty panicked him for a moment but then the door opened at last as he entered bowing graciously to the turkish woman he saw the other agent emerging from the bathroom head bowing apologizing profusely when the old woman had passed them back into her kitchen they matched the deutsch mark though it was hardly necessary as chin recognized him as one of the agents whom had worked with years before when assigned to bonn behind the wall they could still hear massed bands playing in the distance as they got into a gray bmw six miles south along the line of what used to be the graffitiscrawled wall they came to a creamcolored nondescript apartment building in the suburb of neukölln near east berlins schönefeld airport from the blacktarred top of the apartment they would be able to see the airport proper the two giant condors sovietmade transporters sitting side by side a hundred feet from each other not far from the main terminal their tail planes much higher than chin remembered from any of the recognition charts hed had to memorize the sheer brutishness of their size their lower half a blue wave pattern the top a mottled khaki made them frightening even from a distance now more bands could be heard they were obviously marching south from alexander platz the sound of the bands drowning out the usual puttputting sound of east german cars tribants mostly which during his earlier posting had always sounded to him like the twostroke motorbikes mat weaved in and out of the traffic a law unto themselves he could smell a mixture of high octane in the late afternoon air as the fumes from planes landing and taking off from schönefeld washed over into the west on a brisk east wind there was a tremendous roar from the southeast and turning he saw it was the pm aeroflot flight from moscow through the smell of the kerosene fumes he could detect a faint but much more pleasant odor of fried liverwurst everything was at once so foreign yet so familiar here the dmz had been known as the death strip the mixture of the familiar and unknown was unsettling in chins tired and nerveracked condition the wall having once created the deadly illusion of safety in the west but he knew that the wall had served exactly the same purpose as the dmz in korea locking in the peoples of the communist blocs prisoners of the totalitarian state the same state that was at this very moment ripping his country apart sweeping down from the north like the barbarians of old had swept against the great wall of china then it happened the other agent had assured him that everyone necessary from the trade legation in berlin was ready but now he learned that one of the men the rso or resident station officer had had to back out at the last moment because he felt someone either from the west german police or from the staatssichereitsdienst the reinvigorated east german state security service that was supposed to have disappeared in the postgorbachev euphoria was watching him the agent chin had made the meet with realized that chin was not listening to the explanation instead the older man had stopped hands in his light gray summer raincoat looking up and down the street those trees he said id forgotten what asked the other agent apprehensively oh yes ginkgo trees the same as home but they are not indigenous to germany said chin i remember it struck me the first time i was here in the other agent didnt care about trees and as delicately yet persuasively as he could ushered chin inside the apartment block i dont know about the trees he told chin chin could see he didnt care but the older man was smiling it was an omen how was it how could it be that the same beautifully exquisite fanshaped leaves native to his homeland were here across the other side of the world in berlin still green and full of light bravely growing and vibrant in the dying rays of the sun that were now flickering down through leaves intertwined with or were they being strangled by the indestructible barbed wire that was still there through the branches of the ginkgo trees he saw scrawled freiheit freedom the um and the yang from the turmoil of opposites would come the eternal calm such omens were no accidents he believed they only underscored the unity of all and the unhealthy futility of drawing borders through mens souls his country was on the edge of the precipice the time had come for the clash of the opposites from inevitable turmoil would come the eternal calm when do they start to load he asked eight oclock answered the other agent chin glanced at his watch then we have two hours to fill the other man said nothing the five of them were in a room on the eighth floor on the eastern side of the apartment huh one of the agents grunted after gorbachev they were going to be one big happy family that was before suzlov said another agent everything changes and everything stays the same one of the three men who were introduced to chin began brewing coffee another passing around cigarettes from a goldplated case chin hesitated hed tried too many times to give it up american said the junior man an army captain in mufti chin took one sat back and felt himself relax inhaling the smoke deeply letting it settle in his lungs before blowing it out in a bluishgray jet he felt strangely at peace everything would now be simply a matter of operational procedure and the men under his command could tell from his face there was no turning back chin told them of the five us and rok servicemen who had been beheaded at panmunjom seoul hq he said had told him that they had a video of it not a very good one taken by one of the last units to get out of the dmz but that seoul hq wouldnt release it to the media upset the folks at home chin said what about the airport security tower he asked the younger one drew a sketch on the back of a copy of abendzeitung well take them out or at least keep them occupied said the agent have you got suppressors chin asked we dont want any noise here putting us off yes suppressors of course two rifles the agent identified the marksman who inclined his head respectfully chin told him to destroy the sketch then said nothing more there was a long silence the evening light growing dimmer chin could sense the question in the air from all four of them but calmly kept smoking composing himself the marksman was looking over at the younger agent and the other two with the suitcases we were wondering sir began the younger agent tentatively should we not do it now chin looked around at them taking his time are you afraid i dont want people who are afraid no no hastened the younger agent with forced unconcern i merely thought that while there is light there is no point in half measures son chin responded he paused the end of his cigarette glowing more brightly now no one put on any of the lights in the apartment nearing the end of the cigarette chin asked for another one accepted it graciously tapping it on the gold case thinking for a moment about his young colleague whod been trampled outside the secret garden chun looked up are there any other questions there were none lee he signified to the young agent you should stay here to stop anyone at the door just in case i will go up with the others chin nodded toward the other three men sir asked lee with great respect sir i would wish to be with my colleagues we have served together in berlin and chin shrugged easily very well i will stay here he looked around seeing it would be no problem to put the sofa across the door but in truth he expected no one they had been very careful they all said leaving the embassy and all their homes in west berlin at different times using different routes and chun was now sure no one had followed him from tempelhof when chin glanced at his watch again it was go up in ten minutes he said quietly has the roof lock been freed yes sir answered one of the men everything has been prepared chapter thirty in the wars of the early and mid twentieth century the naval yards of bremerton west of seattle had seen many a ship launched and not return but it was never something you got used to most navy wives carrying it about with them until the day their husbands retired beth brentwood as had her motherinlaw and many navy wives before her thought about it every night when she put the children to sleep and went to an empty bed sometimes she would take one of his shirts to bed with her she had prepared herself for the knock on the door one of the things rays mother had told her she must do as a service wife it was no good trying not to think about it catherine brentwood had told her only fools told you not to think about death we moved toward it since the day we were born to imagine it said her motherinlaw and how it might come to your loved ones could sometimes help dampen the fear once youd imagined it in all its obscenity it wouldnt have such a hold on you besides beth knew navy wives were expected to have the right stuff too and so dutifully beth had imagined rays death or at least receiving the news of it a naval officer probably another captain smart dark blue uniform with the pristine white cap and gold braid a gentle knock on the door their eyes would meet and the first thing would be to get fouryearold johnny who right now could talk the leg off a chair away from the door jeannie eight next week would realize with her sensitivity that something dreadful was up and beth knew she could appeal to her maternal instincts to look after johnny while the naval officer cap off smiled down at the two children waiting then when the children were out of the room sorry maam but i have to tell you the uss blaine but it wasnt like that at all jeannie had been bratty about cleaning up her room daddy wouldnt make me oh yes he would no he wouldnt it had quickly degenerated into jeannie charging you dont love me and beth answering ungrateful brat and telling her no she certainly could not have melanie home to play after school jeannie had obeyed bringing home not melanie but judy the daughter of one of the blaines petty officers beth had had to make a polite but firm stand and tell judy that she was sorry but that jeannie hadnt been behaving and had been told she couldnt have any friends to play after school thats okay mrs brentwood judy answered bubbling bye jeannie thered been another fight and beth had sent jeannie to her room after which jeannie had immediately sent young johnny on a reconnaissance patrol let jeannie come out mom pleeeease no beth screamed frightening johnny when the doorbell rang she felt like a quivering mass of guilt anger and sheer frustration and on top of it all the dishwasher that was supposed to have been fixed still didnt work the sight of the woman in navy uniform drained beth of all color she forgot to invite her in heard jeannies can i come out now and the woman saying something about normally the pentagon but in light of the news reports as soon as they have further information beth finally rallied enough to ask the woman in but she said no asking whether there was anything else she could do mom can i come out beths hand was on her forehead trying to sort it all out she asked the wave whether rays parents had been notified no maam our policy is to first notify when will you know for sure mom can i come out be quiet jeannie sorry we should know something more in a few hours mrs brentwood ill be sure to call you when beth walked back from the door johnny saw something was wrong that lady an officer mom he asked timidly yes beth was stirring the fiercely boiling water macaroni packet unopened she talking bout daddy what beth looked down at johnny he was holding the macaroni packet can i open it mom im strong sure she said johnnys cherubic face grinned then turned red as he tried valiantly to puncture the pushopen tab i help you when daddys away mom beth bent down and hugged him jeannie she said you can come out now jeannie came out pouting but not daring a repeat offense so soon come over here honey said beth her voice soft unhurried when she pulled jeannie to her the three of them clung in an embrace and it struck her how small a physical space a family actually occupied a feeling of being infinitessimally small of the blaines man crew only were rescued of these dying within the first two hours of pickup and still in shock with thirddegree burns including ray brentwood whose face was so badly disfigured that the des moiness sick bay petty officer after giving brentwood a shot of morphine had left him till last assuming he was a goner the time better spent on some of the others the burn victims the worst of whom were brentwood and the lookout whod been on the port side when the second missile slammed into the port side railing were ferried to the salt lake city ray brentwoods nose was nothing more than a skewed lump of flesh a molten pulp now cooled so that he was forced to breathe through his mouth creating an alternately groaning and dry whisking sound which for all the compassion they had in the sick bay several of the attendants found difficult to tolerate and so sent someone else to do the awful job of dabbing cool saline solution to wash away the globs of congealed blood from raw flesh that had once been the patients face brentwoods eyes having been partially protected by sunglasses but more effectively by the instinctive closing of the eyelids during the flash of the explosion seemed not to be affected but if he survived this would have to be confirmed by later and more detailed tests once they got to tokyo now and then he tried to say something but no one could understand what it was and put the garbled and repulsively snorting sounds down to pain and narcoticinduced delirium in the tokyo us army hospital beneath the junglelike oppressiveness of an oxygen tent brentwood felt a searing burn so intense he kept blacking out beneath the onslaught of pain the merest eddy of air tearing across his raw flesh like a whitehot rake what the voice inside was trying to ask was what had become of his men and of his ship but no answers came only enormous and elusive shadows bending over the tent the roar of his own breath like that of a doomed animal the rushing of what he thought was his own blood unbearable but which was in fact his urine something wrong with the catheter filling the bed the warm acidic solution burning his already burned legs his sense of smell gone he was screaming with all the will he could muster ray brentwood prayed for death and now the jungle of vines iv tubes swinging about him went completely black shrinking to a distant point of light then a gentle blue the color of the exocets exhaust growing larger until it began to fade flickering away replaced by a long intensely white tunnel and within him a sense of rising above the earth his screams unheard chapter thirtyone the meeting requested by the us ambassador in beijing had begun at am precisely being late for an appointment being considered a grave insult to the chinese the white lace antimacassars draped over the arms and headrests of the oldfashioned maroon velvet lounge chair struck the american ambassador as typically chinese at once quaint and sensible like the covered teacups on the table between him and the maosuited chairman of the chinese communist party the ambassador noticed that there was a new spittoon this one a lighter gray than the last which sat at the chairmans feet looking for all the world like a childs potty the lounge chair was so comfortable it made it difficult for the american ambassador for anyone to make a strong point for in order to drive home the argument most people found it necessary to first do battle with the chair that enfolded them yet sitting on the very edge of the chair gave one the undignified attitude of an eager schoolboy in front of the chairman a position contrary to the dignified pose striven for by the representative of one of the two most powerful nations on earth president maynes instructions had been clear to assure the chinese that the presence of the american carrier salt lake city in the sea of japan was not meant in any way as a threat to the peoples republic but was there merely to assist american action in south korea as it was permitted to do under the terms of the un charter of which the peoples republic was a member the chinese chairman was smoking as he spoke to the interpreter a thin young man in rimless glasses who even as he was receiving his instructions was looking at the american the chairman understands mr ambassador but there must be no interference north of the thirtyeighth parallel on this matter we are resolved the american ambassador acknowledged the point but did remind the chairman that it was not south korea that had initiated engagement and that the us government might find it necessary to operate above the thirtyeighth parallel if it involved securing the safety of south korean andor united states citizens the chairman disputes your claim insofar as it was clearly the repeated provocations and aggression of the seoul government which precipitated hostilities as a good neighbor of the democratic republic of korea the peoples republic of china may have no alternative but to aid the koreans in freeing their country of hostile and antidemocratic elements but not in the south asked the ambassador the chairman began the long warmup preparatory to spitting sounding as if he were in the grip of a severe case of catarrh the chairman spat at the spittoon the ambassadors eyes scrupulously avoiding witness of the act by watching the interpreter who was busy informing him at the chairmans request that the chinese peoples republic did not recognize such designations as north or south korea that there was only one country and this was the democratic peoples republic of korea the seoul gangsters were merely usurpers in beijings view the chinese peoples republic had no quarrel with the united states and wished friendly relations with washington but the chairman on behalf of the politburo would reserve chinas historical right to intervene should the integrity of the peoples republic be threatened which meant that as in beijing would not tolerate any american action north of the yalu along the manchuriansovietnorth korean border as the ambassador left the great hall of the people tiananmen square was bathed in pale sunlight the soft and dirty haze over the city pierced here and there by highrises but in the main beijing remained a flat city on the north china plain its pace still remarkably unhurried compared to western cities the endless rivers of bicycles flying pigeons jostling with less expensive models for position never ceased to entertain the ambassador as it was here that the ingenuity of the chinese was so everywhere apparent their ability to use bicycles to haul everything from sofas to enormously high stacks of crated chickens and even twentyfootlong heavy steel rods for concrete reinforcing as impressive an example as you could find of a people anywhere in the world coping with daytoday problems that were all but inconceivable in the west as the cadillac drew up outside the great hall the ambassador saw construction workers walking by with woven cane safety helmets they were not a people to go to war with when the chauffeur opened the back door of the black cadillac that to passersby looked remarkably like any other limousine except for the thickness of the bulletproof windows what they could not see was the heavy armor plate between door panels beneath the chassis and sandwiched in along the roof interior with all the added weight it meant that the car could get only ten miles to the gallon but the ambassador didnt give a damn about the cost for he knew that if push came to shove the car he was in might be the only thing capable of getting him to beijing airport in a hurry and alive as usual scores of chinese stopped what they were doing and stared at the big nose beyond the stone flag and heroically cast soldiers that celebrated the revolution the lines passing through maos mausoleum were ushered through with an efficiency one normally didnt see in china it was just as well for the vast crowds would have led to chaos if they had been left on their own to visit the mausoleum and to see mao under glass the ambassador sometimes wondered whether maos head the only part of him visible was a wax fake whatever he was still venerated by most of the chinese despite the killing and madness of what was euphemistically called the cultural revolution when the red guards had run amuck putting people to death arbitrarily sending intellectuals to work as peasants and putting the country twenty years further behind the west someone at the embassy had worked it out that with chinas population of over a billion and the line outside the mausoleum the usual four abreast the line would never end their sheer numbers and the fact they had the abomb made them a formidable force and the american ambassador recalled the chilling words of general lin biao so many years ago when macarthur had threatened to cross the north korean border with china and drop nuclear bombs on the staging areas in manchuria upon hearing this lin biao shrugged so we lose a million or two next into the lounge chair was the russian ambassador leonid guzenko conveying cordial greetings from moscow and reassuring the chairman that premier suzlov wished beijing to know that the dispatch of the soviet far eastern fleet from vladivostok had been effected solely in order to send a clear message to washington that interference in northeast asia would not be tolerated the chinese premier spat again and said that no foreign navy was welcome off the chinese mainland which the russian ambassador replied was precisely why admiral golchin had been given explicit orders to keep not only outside chinas twelvemile territorial sea zone but beyond the twohundredmile extended economic zone as well the chairman spoke quickly to his interpreter and then began clearing his throat again the chairman says that it is his understanding that soviet aircraft are capable of flying more than two hundred miles from the minsk guzenko fell silent for a moment to answer yes might be interpreted as lending credence to the traditional chinese mistrust of the soviet union to answer no however would be absurd for quite clearly the chinese knew soviet aircraft had a strike range well beyond two hundred miles he remained silent the premier spat then turned rather stiffly the ambassador noticed to his left to take the lid off his teacup disturbing the antimacassar the russian followed suit it was a pleasant mellowtasting long jing green tea from the hills of hangzhou a chinese aide entered and spoke softly to the interpreter the premier listened while offering the ambassador more tea the russian accepted he had been in china for five years and it was as if he had just arrived you were never sure how to read the signs but you always knew that beneath the surface current there was a subcurrent and beneath that a contrary current and beneath that they thought themselves better than everyone else the premier was staring ahead smoking asking about the response east germany had received as moscows proxy to the call for an international communist volunteer force to aid chinas friend and ally the democratic republic of north korea it has been excellent comrade chairman guzenko replied truthfully in fact we had to discourage the cubans he smiled they wanted to send three regiments the premier nodded seemingly approving both sides of the argument your restraint he said wheezily is proper it was said in the tone of a headmaster addressing one of his junior staff there is no point in pulling the tiger by the tail the russian seemed pleased and he added jokingly even if it is a paper tiger premier the chairman showed no emotion as he spoke but his interpreter nodded sharply many mistakes began the interpreter have been made the tiger has claws and in the desert the russian turned to his own interpreter now not knowing what to make of it the russian interpreter was also unsure of the chairmans phrasing but hazarded a guess i think mr ambassador the chairman is referring to our intervention in afghanistan the rebels backed by the americans the ambassador was sitting forward on the lounge chair looking distinctly uncomfortable as if he had gas the chairman is quite correct i think we have all learned our lesson about adventurism the chinese interpreter wasnt sure but informed the chairman this might be a reference to chinas vietnamese war about the same time as the russians were in afghanistan we are concerned the interpreter abruptly told guzenko about the kuomintang i am sure they will behave themselves said the russian in the spirit of family members talking hopefully about a deviant relative and if they do not moscows position on this has long been clear answered the ambassador if the taiwanese stick their nose in where it is not wanted we would insist that they withdraw immediately what would you insist with comrade guzenko was surprised at the sudden shift why were they talking about a policy mutually agreed upon long ago by the two communist giants taiwan was an outlaw as much a nuisance to washington as any wayward republic in the ussr as tibet was to the chinese peoples republic there was only one way to deal with them we would insist by force of arms said the russian ambassador it was the one thing the russian could state unequivocally without any clearance from moscow the chairman rose then we can rely on you certainly i wish to release this pledge of support publicly said the chairman yes guzenko answered there was no problem in this standard party policy taiwan had no legitimacy at all either here in beijing moscow or anywhere else it had long been relegated to the backwater of history ejected even by the un years ago thank you said the chairman nodding his head and extending his hand the russian struggled awkwardly from the lounge chair making a mess of the lace antimacassar will beijing contribute to the volunteer force he asked quickly we will see said the chairman through his interpreter satisfied the chinese didnt suspect that moscow had dispatched the far eastern fleet to remind the chinese who was boss in northeast asia the soviet ambassador nevertheless left the great hall of the people dissatisfied with the meeting everything had been going fairly well he thought until taiwan the orange light on the zils phone console was blinking relentlessly yes mr ambassador it was his military attaché a bright young man but with a high piercing voice that irritated the ambassador yes the kuomintang navy with transports is entering the taiwan strait on the chinese side the ambassador issued an oath for which he used to be soundly whipped as a boy their course he demanded looks like weitou the ambassador repeated the oath weitou was on the chinese mainland at the mouth of the jinlong jiang and within the range of the two offshore islands of jinmen and xiamen formerly called quemoy and amoy both islands were heavily fortified and belonged to taiwan the ambassador felt ill soon as word got out and the chairman would make sure it did that through its ambassador moscow had promised military intervention should the kmt attack the peoples republic the soviet politburo would be furious he thumped the armrest damn the chinese they must have known the kmt were in the taiwan strait as they were talking to him a trap and hed fallen for it but who would have thought taipei would and sir came the military attachés piercing voice yes yes snapped guzenko go on ah mrs guzenko would like some lucky strikes the ambassador slumped back into the plush leather friendship store he ordered the driver who was beaming broadly it was a chance to stock up on western goods with foreigners exchange yuan the ambassador knew that no promise with china would be honored unless the ussr was directly threatened moscow had enough problems of her own but if the kuomintang attacked quemoy or one of the other offshore islands and moscow didnt supply military support the ambassadors career would be over the driver was beeping the horn constantly and the chinese moved when they were ready chapter thirtytwo a hundred fifty miles south of seoul on the littered and burning outskirts of taegu long spirals of thick blackish smokerubber tires burning there was a nomansland not yet reached by the nka but abandoned by the retreating rok forces trying to consolidate the perimeter a few miles south of the city the distant thunder of the nka artillery unrelenting james law a world press photographer was tired and disgusted with himself despite his best efforts he always seemed to be a half hour behind the action the only people moving through now were terrified refugees women crying exhausted some with babies strapped with blankets to their back moving in a kind of shuffling half run energy long gone but still going out of sheer terror but the world had seen countless women and babies in countless wars he called over two boys who like so many others hed already seen didnt seem to belong anywhere as if appearing out of nowhere scavenging through the rubble for food clothes anything they might barter away including themselves they were crouching over the body of an american gi stripping it bare as he approached they started to run but he held up his hands patting the air to calm them you boys speak english they both looked at each other frightened and suspicious finally one of them nodded hello how are you im fine said law smiling listen he peeled two tendollar notes from his billfold you like sure okay law looked about indicating to them that he wanted something on which to write they produced a few scraps of paper no no he said big over there boxes you savvy hello here ill show you the packing box he stamped it flat and made a writing motion one of the boys pointed to laws shirt pocket no no said law no pens too small something big superduper one of the boys started to run toward one of the fires and came back with a block of soft charcoal now youre talkin said law good boy now here hand me the carton he ripped it in half taking the most ragged part and using the piece of charcoal he printed in a childish hand we hate americans yankeess go home he poured some water from the dead mans canteen into a kleenex and squeezed it under one of the boys eyes he took ten shots with the asa film shooting half on f and half on f as backup and three with the polaroid one of which was very good because it showed the boys really scowling their eyes full of hate getting the americans corpse in nearby and violating the old world war ii photographers taboo by making sure the puffy face was plainly visible flyblown and bloodcongealed law heard the crack of a rifle and the next minute shots were whizzing nearby rok or nka he didnt care he got into the jeep and took off the two boys running into what had once been a bakery shop its counter covered in glass and spilled flour that looked like snow when law reached the pusan office he sauntered in announcing to the army clearance officer that i just got a shot you wouldnt believe christ make you sick he showed the officer one of the polaroids which he knew he could use to jump the fax line if the wire service dispatcher deemed it good enough jesus said the dispatcher this wont get past the censor christ its not a military installation were in a war what are we talking here another vietnam coverup thats the way it is sam thats the way it is the censor passed it law checking to make sure the photo credit was well within the faxsized paper within an hour it was the photograph of the korean war two korean youngsters crying in their sorrow shouting their hatred for the united states and pleading for it to stop the war to get the hell out of their country in moscow it came in over the wire from the soviet embassy in washington and was rerouted to dzerzhinsky square these days chernko was staying there a cot set up in the annex to his fourthfloor office he took the photograph to the major who awoke startled from an early morning nap after having been up all night good he said very then he saw the photo credit james law gospodi my god you see major said chernko now it pays off eh all the training the waiting yes agreed the major he had difficulty recalling laws face as he had been one of the early illegals they had shipped over in gorbachevs time the director was walking away holding the photograph high power of the press in washington protestors had already started to gather about the white house the photo galvanizing opposition to the war chapter thirtythree in east berlin the loading of the two giant fourengined russian condors the worlds largest military air transports was delayed each plane assigned to carry members of the communist freedom volunteer force from east berlin to pyongyang via khabarovsk was waiting for the cubans to arrive the east german commander was annoyed but the members of his shock troop company though in full battle packs had no complaint the shock troops who had been waiting for more than an hour in the huge overheated cavern of the condors had been told that some of the cubans sent to help the communist volunteer force aid north korea were women they had also been told by their political officer they must not call any of the women senorita or senora this was something you heard only in the decadent american western films so beloved by equally decadent west germans nowadays they were instructed they must address the women as comrade compañera but as they filed into the transports from the long flight from havana to east germany the cuban women over twenty of them aroused intense curiosity among the east german soldiers for the east german troops used to the hard athletic beauty of their women the cuban womens beautifully developed bodies were more supple in appearance the compañeras swarthy latin color their golden faces beaded by sweat their combat bras damp through their dark green tshirts were an intriguing and welcome sight several of them had to press up closely against the men in the tightly packed aircraft but not one of the men complained it would be a long flight sicherheitsgürtel anfassenfasten seat belts for takeoff despite some eager helpers not one compañera needed assistance most of the cubans wearing red a patches on their black berets signifying they had served in the african campaigns of fraternal assistance from angola to the sudan as the pilots in the two condors began the preflight checks the seven hundred troops in the condors were ordered to put in their earplugs as the engines went into their distinctive highvibration scream for a few token bulgarian assault troops who had never been flown into action before the noise in the huge military plane devoid of the insulation normally accorded passenger aircraft was frightening despite the noise and the earplugs dieter meir a tall blond east german the cousin of hans meir at outpost alfa managed to introduce himself to the cuban woman next to him ich heisse juanita my name is juanita she said putting out her hand seeing his surprise at her knowing german she explained shouting close to him in competition with the engines we have many experts from germany meir nodded rather than saying anything as now conversation was impossible the huge condors engines were in takeoff pitch as its nose wheels traced the white floodlit semicircles about schönefeld terminal beginning its lumbering and surprisingly bumpy roll toward the main tarmac the second condor was taxiing three hundred yards behind as they moved to the runway best suited for takeoff in the berliner luft the legendary and invigorating wind that blew down across the old prussian plain across west berlins grunewald forest and toward the east german farms beyond kopenicks forest when juanita had said germany rather than east germany to dieter meir it struck a responsive chord for he hoped that one day in the heart it truly would be germany again not just when the politicians declared it was but united in spirit in the same way that he and the cuban from thousands of miles away had come together in their common ideology to help unite another country and yet he sometimes wondered if it would ever really happen in his own country families like his own separated too long still split asunder the lingering legacy of having been apart for so many years beyond the kilometer antifascist barrier inside the terminal the bereitschaftspolizei police band played a stirring rendition of freiheit and peace at once entertaining the waiting passengers for domestic flights and being recorded by soviet and other eastern bloc radio and television networks to mark the historical occasion on which the socialist world had after so much inner turmoil risen as one in defense of the north korean workers democracy in their struggle against the american assault how typically stupid the americans had been to assume that after the workers democratic movements had erupted in the gorbachev years somehow everyone would suddenly throw away the good socialist things with the bad and declare themselves lovers of capitalism to trade socialist evils for the evils of capitalism as if there was nothing in between aboard the condors none of the more than seven hundred east german cuban bulgarian and romanian troops could hear the ceremonies or speeches but there was excitement in the two huge transports most of the troops were under twentyfive and needed to prove themselves on the other hand gen hans demmler commander in chief of the communist volunteer force could hear the pomp and circumstance over the earphones plugged into the aircrafts circuits but he took no notice of it his hands were full hoping that as the different segments had not time to train together for the task at hand they would fight well as selfcontained units not that he had any choice for full integration would be impossible with the language barriers despite liaison officers right now he was checking that each ak was tipped to protect the barrel and front sight from any damage during the flight although the troops had been told the flight plan called for a landing at khabarovsk if possible they would refuel in the air as moscow deemed this would be an impressive logistical display for the americans the engines screamed in protest as the flaps were tested then the brakes released as the first condor began the long run gathering speed on the south runway the shadowy figures of the two men on top of the eightstory kreuzberg apartment block were all but invisible one of them leaning against the northeastern comer of the water tank for support head bowed right hand as one with the gripstock of the stinger it was not the stinger of afghan guerrilla fame which in fact had often refused to fire but the much improved stingerpost incorporating the passive optical scanning function so that the taxiing condor completely filled the aiming circle the edge a little fuzzy due to diffused heat waves at the planes extremities that were rising and falling in the stingers sight like a mirage the condor was equipped with exhaust baffles or shields to minimize hot exhaust trail but as the fully loaded plane rose and banked hard right both port and starboard engine exhausts were clear to the naked eye let alone the stinger the agent squeezed the grip the stingers backblast illuminating the rooftop momentarily scorching the agents arm the condor in effect a climbing fuel tank with soldiers aboard exploded like napalm reminding chin of the american challenger explosion years before one of the condors engines part of the wing still attached cartwheeling disintegrating in a fizzing halo of scarlet ripping open the night the main body of the condor fell as if leadweighted onto the tarmac like a zeppelin tight with hydrogen as it burst into flame the first fifty rows of tiny soldiers could be seen heads black as burnt matches then disappearing in the orangewhite inferno that raced hundreds of meters down the runway suddenly the second condor in the process of braking tires sparking exploded its four nose wheels collapsing fuselage sliding along the tarmac like the chin of some huge dinosaur on black ice plowing into the inferno of the first plane in the near daylight intensity of the scene as fire engines screamed the koreans atop the building threequarters of a mile away could plainly see some communist volunteer troops in the second condor sliding down open ramps most of them afire others coming down into a fuel slick that ignited seconds later the ribbing of the fuselage now stretched against the skin of the aircraft in an x ray of the plane the roar like a thousand christmas trees going up there were no screams or at least none that could be heard over those of the sirens a tongue of flame like a ceremonial dragons shot out and around the rear cargo door of the second condor incinerating the remainder of the fleeing troops then the koreans could hear a rattling sound becoming louder as searchlights streamed out into the night like wildly flung straws darting over the west german apartments across the bulldozed remnants of the wall the rattle was the sound of machinegun fire lets go said chin there was shooting all the way from treptow east berlins most southerly suburb around the east german airport to pankow east berlins most northwesterly suburb sixteen miles away most of the shooting however was concentrated in kreuzberg from where the missiles had been fired outside the apartment the big crowds that had been racing down from the backstreet kneipenpubs toward the wire fence along the river spree now started to retreat as rifle and machinegun fire increased in the flickering light of a flare chin saw an old man in pajamas and robe standing in the street below the apartment complex gazing skyward a woman darted out from beneath the ginkgo trees shouting and dragging him away toward an old section of dilapidated wall it wasnt certain who had started the smallarms fire and chin suspected that some of it was probably the ammunition going off in the condors in any event now both sides were at it all here chin asked in the darkness the sky to the east glowing a soft pink each man responded they went down to the gray bmw all in chin asked again yes where are the cases the trunk chin told the agent driving to pull up on the first bridge over the teltow canal on their way back to the trade legation offices but there were too many people about mainly police cars and so they went on to another bridge where chin got out and ditched the two missile launchers switch off he told the driver he listened for a moment thinking hed heard footsteps nearby but now all he could hear was the cracking and pop of the smallarms fire now look chin said stamping his feet it was damper and colder by the canal youve all done a firstrate job i want you to know well he paused never having been one for sentimentality but wanting to convey to his men how satisfied he was with their performance the four of them had volunteered even though they didnt know all the details of the job komawōthanks he said he shot the driver first the man immediately behind the driver second and then the third man trying to scramble out the back door the man in the center was begging for mercy his hands up high dont sir chin stood back a little and shot him trying not to get anything on his coat in a chain reaction all along natos line phones were ringing off the hook fighting had broken out in berlin and reinforced alert had become general alert at outpost alfa two hundred miles southeast of berlin hans meir who with an american was manning the observation tower the scene of hitlers nazis crossing the rhine bridge clear in his mind knew what to do he was no less than samson at the pass only instead of the jawbone of an ass with which to beat back any breach of the trace he had a direct line to fifth army corps millimeter artillery batteries behind him ready to pulverize the soviet and east german echelons groups of five tanks if they dared try to punch their way through so far it was a quiet country night broken only by the sound of an owl then meir heard at least half a dozen dull thumps some miles to the east of him what was that asked his american partner there was a faint pinkish glow the size of a tennis ball from where they were hans meir didnt hesitate lifting the phone he rang alfa hq he couldnt get through the line sounding like frying eggs in the main alfa hut a mile behind in a pine wood they were trying to contact the alfa tower but all they heard was static on the line it wasnt a line in the oldfashioned sense of radio cables but rather the elaborate fiberoptics links that were on the blink the fiberoptic system was thought to be impregnable against an emp electromagnetic impulse the kind of shock blasts given off from a nuclear explosion scrambling all sensitive electronic equipment from televisions to defense computers at natos headquarters in brussels calls were coming in from pay phones from as far south as burghausen in bavaria to fehmarn in schleswigholstein in the north all computers and fiberoptic radio links between bonn and nato hq as well as all those between armorinfantry artillery and air forces including ground tremor sensors had simply gone mad spewing out nonsense that was only adding to the general air of confusion in the rainslashed darkness around alfa one klaus meir and his army buddy johnny malvinsky were watching the gap when the american his bronx accent markedly different from meirs collegetaught english said something to meir who thought it sounded like ruf ruf meir said a ruf malvinsky seemed to say its moving where malvinsky handed him the infrared binoculars two oclock by the rise near the barn the american was right but it wasnt a roof at least not a fullsized one more like that of a small toolshed moving the infrareds scope picking up spotty thermals what magnification is this asked meir they were still trying to call alfa hq since the order had come taking them from military vigilance to general alert usual setting said malvinsky i didnt change it at alfa hq the infantry troops had come through the door of the metal hut as if there were a fire the liftup counter slamming back held down by the sergeant as he kept intoning lets go lets go the ms were coughing once then there was a deep throaty purr surprisingly quiet to infantry used to the old m patterns no one questioned whether it was a drill or not theyd get their butts kicked if they didnt do it within the required time and suffer restricted furlough as well outside as they moved beneath the pines into the bradley armored personnel carriers thirteen men apiece the column started off for the trace near the tower facing the fulda gap from the east meirs and malvinskys opposites members of a squad from the east german fourth and soviet thirtyninth motorized rifle divisions saw something moving along the plain through their infrared looks like an outhouse moving the east german told his russian liaison officer the russian agreed but the thermal images were spotty because of the light rain that had now started in any event the shape of whatever they were watching was much smaller than that of a tank besides in regular radio line rather than fiberoptic contact with their headquarters they would have been informed of any unusual traffic the farmer driving the tractor like many others all along the front between east and west germany was one of those who had agreed to work farmland in and around the dmz provided they were given special risikoentgeld danger subsidies but the subsidy the east german farmer had long since told his wife did not cover nuclear war thank you very much working patiently and only at night he had fitted the tractor with a rude protective shield of steel slabs either side and over the roof his wife and two children sitting behind him now on seats he had expressly built along with a huge white flag that would flap as he unfurled it at the fulda gap and how his wife had asked him do we get across the strip she meant the mines many of which had been left in place after the west and gorbys moscow had ended he told her he had mounted a roller plow on the front with loose chains to act as flails nothing new about the idea old as the hills its crazy she told him woman hed replied when the shooting starts there will not be time to discuss what we might do but where do you prefer to take your chances in the east or the west his argument was sound enough as it went and a rainy night was made to order still there were two things wrong the first was a loose bearing on the tractors right wheel making the squeak of the tractor even more pronounced than usual and the white flag which wouldnt have made any difference to the east germans anyway was so sodden by the rain that it didnt flap at all but merely hugged the pole like some thin frightened ghost in the east germans infrared scope whatever was moving disappeared for a moment behind a wood but then came back into view as a frosty outline nearing the fence in tower alfa hans meir tried to make his decision this wasnt the bridge leading to the rhineland in where grandfather said you could see the nazis clearly coming at you but of course using camouflage is precisely what the russians would do trying to confuse alfa just long enough den mann halten stop him ordered the russian liaison officer its an american mine clearer the east german fired meir didnt see the antitank missile streaking toward the trace only a white streak across the infrared scope backblast said malvinsky ten oclock got it in sight asked meir in sight answered malvinsky the at launcher on his shoulder fire malvinsky fired at the east german backblast position bits and pieces probably signed pine branches still visible like pricks of orange snow melting on the glass of his infrared scope nearer the trace was a rolling fireball followed by pieces of flaming debris from the tractor there was no human noise the tractor stopped the east german fired back at alfas tower but by then meir and malvinsky were halfway down the staircase and into the jeep pulling back to the next position in the pines on their side of the strip the east german rocket missed the tower crashing into the pines above them setting the trees afire and throwing long shadows across their dugout meir fired three scarlet emergency flares as they burst high above alfa one hq the soviet headquarters at zossenwünsdorf using the oldfashioned radio lines ordered operation home rule to begin twenty sovietwarsaw pact divisions infantry and four thousand tanks began to move preceded by hundreds of strike aircraft primarily sufencers for ground support and migs with airtoair alamo and antiradiation antiradar airtosurface missiles with russian nrmillimeter tankdestroying cannon all converging on the fulda gap most of the soviet aircraft while visible on us and european satellite pictures were not visible to the knockedout fiberoptical radar systems on natos central front north and south of the fulda gap here the soviets afoms antifiberoptic measures had been most effective nevertheless in response to the firing in berlin and the flares at outpost alfa nato as part of its forward defense flexible response strategy sent hundreds of ms toward the gap while concealed millimeter and millimeter artillery guns behind fulda began pounding the gap through which the t echelons were expected to come pouring heavily camouflaged tanks of the us eleventh armored dug in behind preselected revetment areas in defilade positions waited should the sovietwarsaw pact tanks burst through the saturating fire of the artillery in their deep second forward observation hole hans meir and malvinsky hunkered down by the infrared periscope ground shaking all about them trees trembling as the deadly artillery rained down only a quarter mile from them this is it fritz said malvinsky ja meir pulled a walkietalkie from the ops alert kit they had been taught and they understood that for them there could be no retreat their only job the most important of all as nato front line ops was to hold as long as they could to give situation reports vital to the artillery and tanks to buy time as malvinsky stayed glued to the periscope seeing the earth erupting before him in jagged white plumes on the infrared he could hear meir cranking up the minefield charge box for their sector are they coming through yet he asked malvinsky jesus replied the american have a look at this general sutherland had told them the sovietwarsaw pact would most likely come through in echelons of fives two wingmen one either side of the three center tanks to protect the flank but to see his infrareds circle blocked solid with the thermal waves of so many to actually see more tanks than he had ever seen in his life coming straight for him was something that no amount of live ammunition training or anything else had prepared them for settle down said meir as much to himself as to malvinsky are they in our sector yet hundred meters to go said malvinsky hold it the forest was erupting trees splitting all about them the scream of hot metal shards carving up the air malvinsky swung the infrared scope around and for as far as the eye could see there were thick billowing clouds of white and the steady pomp pomp pomp of smoke grenades spewing from the forward tanks whose earsplitting frenzied sound was now joined by the nato mines as they began detonating meir heard the distinctive screech of tracks coming off roller wheels and the heavy metallic thumps as the minedisabled tanks were shoved aside by those behind them who now continued converging on the gap within minutes a squadron of nato as came in low over the trees wings rocking in their tight subsonic turns almost like a car too powerful for its driver despite the rain and darkness the as performed superbly as they flew below the russian migs and fencers their telltale bugeyed twin jets well back and the high lizardpatterned khakigreen camouflage visible in flare light the a thunderbolts showed astonishing virtuosity seeming almost to hover momentarily their noses down the fortytwohundredroundperminute millimeter cannon spitting out long orange tracer wherever the cannon fire struck the russian tanks reactive armor the millimeter bullets disintegrated the explosivereactive armor destroying the cannons bullets before they could even penetrate the tank metal proper but wherever the rain of orange cannon fire found the thinnerskinned turrets it was enough to stop the tank the air inside the vehicle a whizzing cloud of whitehot razors many of the tanks exploding as the as fire not only passed through the turret but superheated the tanks own supply of ammunition by the loader as well most of the big american and millimeter selfpropelled guns behind alfa one were able to change position before the answering sovietwarsaw pact batteries got a fix on them and were now tearing into the more than five hundred ts and ts that were the first to reach the fulda gap the russian tanks now within range the dugin ms and ms were waiting until the last minute for their best shots to stop the russian tanks that had survived the deluge of artillery and the assault of the usluftwaffe tenth tactical fighter wing at times the nato fighters managed to penetrate the thick russian mig cover below which soviet fencers were providing ground support for their tanks their wings no longer swept back but in the straight lateral position as they came in low seeking out the american as meir and malvinsky knew that sooner or later theyd be overrun no place to hide caught between the steamrollers of the two opposing armies through screaming bursts of shell fire malvinsky was reporting tanks coming through in battalion strength fifty at a time now that gaps in the minefield had been ribboned out russian and east german infantry having quite literally laid out fluorescent tape to mark the safe entry points through the strip if that happened disaster would result with the sovietwarsaw pact echelons pouring through then splitting off into arrow formations one right northward towards kassel the other left south to frankfurtammain driving deep wedges into natos central front the crisis for nato at the moment as meir knew first in his forward position was that of the fiberopticalguided missiles long lauded as much cheaper than the old standard missiles which had to carry their own expensive independent control system the fiberoptical missiles were guided by images relayed back to a central fire control but the fiberoptical missiles had now been neutered by the fuelair explosions one of which meir and malvinsky had seen earlier that night as a pinkish glow to the east and which had sent out pressure waves twice as powerful as that emitted by a twokiloton nuclear bomb the waves ineffectual against the oldfashioned clunky russian missiles a motorcycle messenger sent out from fifth army headquarters to alfa one was told about the fiberoptics screwup and hitting miles an hour on the autobahn had taken the message back to fifth army hq which had still not heard anything directly from natos commander in chief of the thirteenhundredkilometerong central front nevertheless despite the dire situation fifth armys general willison was refusing to unleash his stochastic robot mines designed to be set loose to roam for up to four days attaching themselves to the magnetic field of a tank exploding with fifteen kilograms of explosive the trouble with this plan willison realized was that if the nato forces couldnt stop the enemy tanks at fulda gap and nato tanks had to go into the gap then the stochastic mines would be just as much a menace to his us ms german leopards and british challenger tanks the fulda gap was now a caldron of flying steel and volcanic earth as the russians spearhead column littered the ground many of its tanks still burning crews dead or dying aboard hulls of others ripped apart but still the russians kept coming with a sixtooneman ratio over nato the gap might still be breached migs and fs thundering overhead in the night contesting the space above the potential breakthrough point all meir and malvinsky eyes red with fatigue and fear could do was to keep changing dugout positions as much as they could trying not to expose themselves to either enemy or friendly fire as they watched tracer arcing out from the ms machine guns finding the range the ms lasers put out of action either by the tanks own reactive armor packs exploding or direct russian fire over a hundred of the ms destroyed by east german millimeter armorpiercing discarding sabot rounds capable of piercing the ms twentycentimeter steel it was now twenty minutes after two on the morning of september when because of the massive blackout of communication along natos line natos european commander in brussels general koch had no alternative but to formally release by pay telephones those not plugged into the fiberoptic system and dispatch riders all sector commanders to proceed on their own initiative he emphasized the main tenet of natos forward defense flexible response strategy that the enemy should be engaged as far forward as possible to buy the desperate one week needed for the american reserves to enter the war the nuclear option being the strategy of last resort and only permissible under the express orders of the nato council for koch there were only two decisions he could have made one to do as he had done or secondly to defer to the nato council but in the time it would have taken him to convene the council he was ordering the recall of dualbased troops from the united states that is those troops who on paper were in europe but were only at half strength an economic measure left over from the habit of bleeding the united states european garrisons to put reserves into vietnam koch knew the decision he made to recall the dualbased troops was in effect a decision that might force the us presidents hand unlike his nato brief koch did not have the authority to move any us unit higher than a fortythousandman corps his request for the dualbased troops a request that he knew would be known as quickly by moscow as washington would be one that in effect would widen the war but if not made would make it impossible for the united states to reinforce europe in time besides if he didnt issue the order the russians would see this as a weakness and what might have been an intention simply to gobble up territory along the near front would expand anyway encouraging the swp forces to press on farther into western europe knowing the farther they went the less likely it was that natos nuclear option would be invoked koch fully understood what it would mean for president mayne but historians could argue about it if there was anything left to write about which there wouldnt be if the russians broke through the president could refuse the request of course but this also would be seen by moscow as a lack of resolve another munich sellout and would only encourage moscow to grab even more territory when press secretary trainor got the request he was at once shaken and relieved he and the president had been holding a decidedly gloomy discussion in the oval office with the joint chiefs about the political necessity of ascertaining whether or not the missiles that hit the blaine were fired by nka patrol boats or had come in via low air attack launched by a russian aircraft out of cam rahn bay or from the southbound soviet far eastern fleet but now the request from saceur supreme allied commander europe endorsed by cinc south and cinc north rendered the question about who fired the missiles academic the north koreans have tripped the whole goddamned thing off anyway said trainor a call came in from premier suzlov he was demanding that mayne order nato to cease its fighting and surrender all territory gained by the sovietwarsaw pact countries mr premier answered the president i dont want this you dont want this call off your people in korea i have no people in korea you have people in korea i mean call off pyongyang we have no people in pyongyang it would be interference in the internal affairs then said mayne calmly call off the fraternal assistance you are giving east germany poland czechoslovakia we did not begin this mr president your act of terrorist aggression in east berlin that might well have been terrorist mr premier but it was not an act of any government in the nato alliance of this i can assure you assure me you can assure me of nothing however if you contain your nato armies i will agree to mr premier the line went dead what the hell began mayne the nsa electronic experts overseeing the white house and situation room communications punched all the right buttons including timeofconversationcessation tone for number coding into the computer most likely explanation they informed the president connections purposely cut the president looked up astounded by whom the joint chiefs of staff knew and trainor knew they knew but coming from them it could look almost selfserving it was for a moment as if each of the joint chiefs aware that history was being made did not want to come out on the wrong side of it some of suzlovs generals see this as their chance trainor proffered quietly adding in an even quieter but more chilling tone as the british would say in for a penny in for a pound what in hell does that mean snapped the president go for broke trainor answered quietly the nato forces might be reeling they wont get another chance like this for a hundred years harry schuman sitting next to admiral horton was nodding in agreement hardliners have been fretting ever since gorbachevs reductions i think mr trainor is correct in his assessment mayne was rubbing his forehead all right general gray whatll it take rollover sir he meant the nato policy of atlantic necessity of the us british and other nato navies but primarily the us and british having to accept enormous losses simply roll over them to get the reinforcements of men materiel and food to reinforce europe if they were to have any hope of pushing the russians back mr president said admiral horton in the first hundred and eighty days were looking at a minimum of six thousand cargo ships each ship making six round trips means a minimum of thirtyfour cargo ships a day excluding naval battle groups for escort and carrier air cover for the convoys can we do it we do it or we lose europe do it said mayne at that moment trainor knew that from here on in the government of the united states would function from the bombproof shelter of the white house situation room and that senator leyland had just lost his bid for the presidency on capitol hill the entire place under the heaviest security ever seen in congress president mayne for purposes of national as well as european morale made his address from the house of representatives as roosevelt had done to show europe that both democrats and republicans supported him as he mounted the podium the silence was palpable as the speaker invited the president to address the congress this day as you know war has broken out in europe soviet and warsaw pact armies have attacked the nato alliance through the very iron curtain that for years past has been the front line between the forces of freedom and those of oppression and once again the united states has been called upon to stem the tide of tyranny a tide given its force by those in moscow who in their unshakable communist determination wish to rule not only the soviet union but the rest of the world i have asked premier suzlov several times this day through the offices of the soviet embassy to agree to a ceasefire by midnight tonight washington time should i not receive the answer we want that hostilities shall cease at that time that both nato and the sovietwarsaw pact units will withdraw to the positions they occupied before hostilities began then we must understand that a state of war exists between the united states and the soviet union and her allies i ask you all to join with me to pray for peace but to stand ready for war we like all our allies hold our breath for all mankind for all those on the edge of the abyss but should it come to this we are resolved to fight if we have to with all the resources at our disposal let us be calm but let us be firm firm in the conviction of those americans who have gone before us for those americans who went to do battle with the evils of hitler and all those of his ilk who would make us slaves and extinguish the flame of freedom rest assured that the united states will do all in its power to bring the hostilities to a quick and peaceful end but if our overtures of peace are rebuffed then the fate of our children is at hand and will reside in our determination as americans to stand up to a bully in the only way we know how in the words of another american to give him a thrashing hell never forget god bless you all trainor was stunned as was a good part of the congress by born the brevity and starkness of the presidents oration suddenly the congress erupted in applause as the president walked from the podium surrounded by a standing ovation the people trainor saw had done what americans had always done rallied about the presidency in times of national peril the secret service contingent was unable to hold the members of congress back as they crowded about to shake the presidents hand but mayne his demeanor calm his stride purposeful walked up to senator leyland and extended his hand for that moment in the nations history following the speech beamed all over america time seemed to stand still and there were no democrats or republicans blacks or whites there were only americans trainors beaming smile was not simply that of a pr mans victory but one of genuine affection for his boss the hemingway paraphrase about thrashing a bully was a master stroke he thought so long as no one pointed out that hemingway had committed suicide by am the fulda gap was choked with armor the destruction by the us fifth armys artillery so unabatedly concentrated that east of the gap the plain looked like some vast scrapyard strewn with the steaming hulls of over a thousand sovietwarsaw pact tanks the majority of these being obsolete ts of which the russians alone had twentythree thousand in reserve and which were unofficially known among the moscow general staff as dryan fodder but the tanks had kept coming and at times with the airripping scream of wireguided and fireandforget antitank missiles blanket artillery fire and the cacophony of assorted small arms barrels threatening to jam from unprecedented sustained action us and west german troops manning tank graders had to be called in to clear a way through as more and more nato units arrived the a thunderbolts or rather those who managed to penetrate the increasingly accurate russian sam screen continued to buoy meirs spirit though his hearing had long gone in the deep fallback bunker at alfa two he still managed to glimpse with awe the twinengined jets screaming in just above tree level their sevenbarreled avenger gatling guns ripping into the oncoming swp armor the stream of the thirtymillimeter cannon fire stuttering into the tanks at over seventy rounds a second many of the tanks exploding illuminating others nearby which became the thunderbolts next targets the antitank missiles were doing well but it was the as that despite their losses continued to be the best antitank weapon nato had in the field augmenting the fire of the hidden ms whose millimeters kept thumping away from the woods although many of the american tanks over had been destroyed by the sovietwarsaw pact onslaught as the carnage continued the biggest surprise to the nato generals was that the highly touted and sophisticated swedish bill antitank missile system proven so effective at homing in above and destroying the thinner turret armor was being foiled by the lesssophisticated soviet t tanks with reactive armor packs on the turret as well as around it and by foilspewing ejectors that scrambled the incoming missiles homing radar the bill topattack warheads however extracted a savage price in swp infantry the russian bmps personnel carriers much thinner armor and tracks easily penetrated by the missiles but still the russians and east germans kept coming astonishing the forward infantry companies of us fifth army by using infantry in several instances to clear a minefield before the tanks by running through it an old russian tactic from the days of stalingrad then at am pm washington time russias c in c of the western military theater or tvd major general agursky received reports that brigades from west germanys first armored and second mechanized divisions were being diverted to reinforce the nato semicircle of armor around fulda gap and that the british first army in position south of the elbe was moving farther south to shore up the areas depleted by the west germans heading to fulda agursky gave orders for the second phase of operation home rule to begin the soviet ninth armored division leading an attack of thirty sovietwarsaw pact divisions fifteen armored fifteen mechanized infantry over troops in all struck and broke through in the far northern sector of natos front twentyfour miles east of the elbe racing for hamburg and bremerhaven the prime designated ports for us resupply of nato nato headquarters had never been sure of denmarks willingness to intervene against such a russianwarsaw pact right hook south of denmarks border and eventually natos high command was proven correct for while the west german sixth mechanized division in schleswigholstein attacked bravely and without hesitation aided by elements of the eightyfour thousand first german corps and northern elements of british first army the danish parliament debated the advisability of becoming involved by the time theyd decided to send a stern note to moscow the sovietwarsaw pact blitzkrieg spearheaded by five thousand soviet ts was racing through the dawn toward the vital ports of hamburg and bremerhaven the ts millimeter laserguided cannons blasting everything before them the most strategic bridges over the elbe were quickly in the hands of the soviet th airborne who started a row at sovietwp hq by taking all the glory for having secured the bridges when it was in fact spetsnaz special force teams already in place in the west who had secured the bridge crossings by thwarting nato demolition teams in the first place at fulda gap one of the t fivetankplatoon leaders was lt sergei marchenko twentyfour younger son of kiril marchenko and who because fate had decreed that he be less than five feet six inches in height had automatically been conscripted to the soviet tank corps the meterhigh t being the lowest silhouette of any tank in the world but what sergei marchenko had really wanted to do was fly what his father wanted him to do was to obey orders so that in time if he acquitted himself well as a tank commander he might qualify for transfer right now however all that marchenko was concerned about was staying alive the inside of his t devoid of the airconditioning of the american ms extraordinarily hot due not only to the heat generated by the tank engine and the motors that moved the tenton turret but by the smoke and heat generated by the scores of other tanks in the tank division moving toward the gap many of the tanks were now more than fifty meters apart violating the normal twentyfive meter rule of russian armor it was an onthespot decision by the corps commander to get his tanks as far from one another as possible in an effort to avoid the heavy punishment being meted out by the thunderbolts and the legendary concentrated artillery fire of the americans many of whose guns as in fulda gap had long been prepositioned to saturate grids within grids apart from the heat in the tank marchenko after two hours of combat found the noise of the turret grating and squeaking the crash of the automatic loader the high whine of electric motors and above all the radio traffic was so overwhelming in its disorientation he removed his headset it was a courtmartial offense during full attack but whoever wrote the rules in moscow didnt drive a tank lowering his dust goggles he stood up one arm resting against the machine gun as he watched another wave of armor and armored personnel carriers barely visible forging through the dust and smoke the whole division under orders that once they were through the gap they were to wheel south in an effort to engage american and german reinforcements on the fulda front what they needed now thought sergei even more than airconditioning was for the soviet migs to deal a death blow to the fs and fs and to clear the skies of damned american apache helicopters that were so good at ducking down in gaps between the woods and ambushing two to three tanks at a time before they were blown out of the air unfortunately the soviet havoc helicopters at a distance could easily be mistaken for an american apache and some of these had reportedly been hit by mistake above the smoke and crash of the ground battle over sixteen hundred nato and sovietwarsaw pact aircraft from highperformance jets to subsonic groundsupport aircraft were engaged in a fierce battle the nato air forces biggest problem being that although they could launch over three sorties per plane in the first ten hours compared to the russians two their heatseeking missiles had in fact taken out over thirty of their own aircraft in the hightech confusion over fulda gap where murphys law operated with even more devastating effect than in peacetime when laser beams fixing on the wrong target simply resulted in an embarrassed pilot in the skies over fulda it meant the death of a pilot and while the west could replace fighters at a faster rate than the sovietwarsaw pact alliance the russians reserve of pilots had been carefully built up to a threetoone superiority over nato as marchenko looked above him glimpsing dogfights through the wafting smoke cover he wondered who was getting the best of it he wasnt even sure what was happening in his sector let alone what part he played in the master plan all he knew was what any other commander tank crewman or infantryman knew their local action no matter how small was merely part of the master plan hatched by some genius out of the frunze military academy after gorbachev had so stupidly signed the inf ridding nato of all its mediumrange missiles and so forcing nato to face only two possibilities in western europe either a modern conventional war now under way or allout longrange nuclear holocaust in which no one would be the winner marchenkos troop of five tanks had stopped for refueling when they got the message german armor ahead marchenko felt his stomach tighten half fear half excitement if you beat the germans youd done something the americans were tough but this was german home soil what are they marchenko asked ms or pattons leopards ones or twos his wingman signaled that they had finished refueling whats the difference asked the sergeant over the radio from the starboard tank a leopards a leopard oh said sergei with mocking nonchalance no difference you clod the mark twos reach is an extra thousand meters a slight advantage over the one wouldnt you agree that was the major trouble thought sergei never quite knowing what you were up against his was only a small piece in a great puzzle of war now if you were a fighter pilot then at least youd have more freedom of movement than in one of the nine hundred tanks now wheeling en masse to engage the west germans the biggest problem for the next few miles being a collision in the damn smoke then news came that another lightning strike had been unleashed by major general agursky this time a left hook around the czechoslovakianaustrian corner near the bohemian forest across the river in inn fanning out on the ancient danube plain and streaming into bavaria who told you that shouted sergei american armed forces network sergei smiled despite the dustthick air that was making it almost impossible to breathe why did the americans tell everybody he couldnt understand it they had to tell everyone everything they were telling the world nato was on the run reeling two hundred miles to the north the swp forces smashing through the dutch th armored and now two hundred miles south through the austrian border splitting the nato defenses into three sectors clearly agursky was set on the right course seeking to divide the nato pockets then pulverize them into submission before americas enormous production potential to resupply could come into play and the farther the swp penetrated into west germany the less likely it became that the americans could even consider the nuclear alternative the radio crackled informing marchenko that the leopard tanks were mark ones god is good sergei said and got a belly laugh from the driver who was so wound up that the thought of his t having a thousandmeter advantage over the leopard one seemed to him nothing less than a gift id still rather be up north put in the driver if the american radio is right why asked sergei id rather be fighting those dutch hippies said the driver the krauts are a different matter comrade ah said sergei dismissing the odds well shit all over the tank swerved violently to the left to avoid a fortyfivedegree antitank slab there was a tremendous thwack and sergei saw a fine red mist then his gunners head rolling by his feet the mans torso bubbling with blood in the south on the donau or danube plain the weather over the bohemian forest was closing in hampering natos fourth allied tactical air force so that to its luftwaffe commander general heiss it seemed that even god was against nato before congress had even heard of and ratified the presidents declaration of war the british convoy under british naval escort was already under way the us navy to take up escort duty twelve hundred miles north of newfoundland and in manhattan lana la roche nee brentwood had carefully aligned the arrows on the childproof safety top of her vial of sleeping pills and poured them down the toilet earlier that day she had left her apartment on the upper east side and walked down to the plaza for some reason which at first she couldnt explain she found central park to be a kind of magnet in her depression she had scrupulously avoided watching television or reading a newspaper for her own bad news about her marriage jay would still not agree to a divorce was enough to cope with and it was a long time before she realized why she had been going to central park often at night it was dangerous a punishment for her failure in her marriage at college at living then whether she liked it or not the world came crashing in on her she had been standing by the park wall across from the plazas north entrance barely noticing the traffic sliding by a young man showing off coming out of the hotel crossing over to the horsedrawn cabriolets bowing deeply before a bejeweled blonde twice his years soon she would grow old and hed still be young the whip struck the horses flank and it began the lovers walk through the park raucous rock was booming from the band shell and roller skaters with ghetto blasters weaved by why didnt they get walkmans or earphones or something and just blow off their own ears she wondered then she saw someone nearby reading the times its banner headline telling the world that an american warship the uss blaine had been hit in the east china sea she had felt her heart racing with the shock yet simultaneously she felt a surge of exhilaration for the overwhelming fact was that for the first time in over a year of utter defeat she knew exactly what to do a few days in new york to get things set up and then to california david brentwood hadnt had the freedom that his sister for all her troubles had and as one of the sixmonth reservists his was a stark choice deferment then go where the army sent you or volunteer now for the marines stacy and melissa who had come over to the rotc office were watching him marines he said the look on stacys face was worth it or so david thought until david got to parris island and quickly came to the conclusion that it had been the dumbest decision hed ever made hed said marines to impress melissa that bastard stacy had conned him chapter thirtyfour a bakers bar asked lana no a baker bar explained the surgeon at san diegos war vets hospital his swissgerman accent was clear his manner polite coat as white as the gleaming walls of the intensive burn wing it is named after its inventor after all night on the redeye flight from new york lana still wasnt getting an answer to her question of why she was unable to see ray god if shed known this hadnt been so impulsive in the first placeshe could have stayed in new york but then she didnt want to be in new york that was the whole idea to get out away from the pills the corrosive selfpity to be with her brother the plan was to comfort him to think of someone else for a change their parents beth and the two children had come down again from bremerton it was supposed to be what a family did in crisis but here was dr franz lehman maxillofacial specialist seemingly still unmoved by their pleas to see him in fact he understood their concerns very well it was for that reason he was so insistent on them not seeing ray so soon after the first of the long series of operations that would be necessary to reconstruct something that resembled a face skin grafts from the arm and hip seemed promising but in any event it would be a long time the baker bar dr lehman explained would be only a small part of it a curved fourinch gold rod cemented to the top jaw replacing bone that had been smashed by shrapnel after building the bar anchoring it either side in the remaining bone a partial denture of five teeth could be attached to the bar by two small inverted ushaped clips inside the denture the gum line being a meld of plastic and gold to reduce expansion and contraction coefficients a millimeter difference could cause maxillofacial strain on the mandibular joint and the telltale click in most people merely the sound of the joint functioning would in ray brentwoods case cause massive malfunction the precursor of severe headaches that would involve the whole head and radiate deep into the neck shoulders and lower back couldnt we see him for just a second lana pleaded though she knew well enough from her premed days that it was useless to push but she felt somehow that if she could see him it would help just say a few words to him but in the doctors experience it didnt help at all it was doubtful whether under the pain medication which was only partially effective in burn cases anyway the patient was fully cognizant of what was going on and often the confusion only added to the burden of inner anxiety being suffered it was better to wait awhile not because the patient didnt need support or like so many vietnam vets was refusing to see anyone out of a sense of bitterness of having been rejected by his country but the ugliness of the tight polished skin where the fire aboard the blaine had burned him made ray brentwood want to withdraw into a deep cave of cool silence where the pain from the searing fire that made every breath an agony might finally abate in that cave dr lehman knew the greatest fear of all could be hidden for a while to prepare him for the shock in the mirror of the visitors eyes the eyes that could never lie despite the visitors determination not to betray shock or any other kind of surprise in ray brentwoods case there was an added torture to the constant searing pain of his disfigurement as captain of the blaine he was solely to blame not only for his own condition but for all those one hundred fortythree men who had died in the attack on the blaine like the parent of a lost child he constantly replayed the attack if only hed given an order for lefthand rudder perhaps the missile might have missed them altogether if only he had picked up the skimmer on radar or was it fired by a ship in which case he couldnt be blamed could he what stoked the nightmarish obsession and knotted his stomach with anxiety was the thought of the coming inquiry when he would have to explain to the board why he the captain had abandoned the uss blaine while she was still afloat of course he must tell them the truth but what was the truth he remembered being conscious at the time but couldnt remember giving the order to abandon ship and the worst of it the worst possible outcome for a captain was that the blaine though badly holed listing dangerously to port and spewing flame had her fires doused by monsoon rains that night only to emerge her fires out towed in ignominiously by the des moines to the shipyards at nagasaki where she was now undergoing repairs whatever had happened ray brentwood knew that as captain of one of the united states navys most modern warships he was the man responsible and along with the dead skin of his body now blistering and peeling revealing pink and custardlike mucous below ray brentwood saw the death of his honor as well as his career and all the dreams he had brought with him from annapolis which during the fifteen years he had worked so hard to attain exonerated or not in that deadly phrase of the navys his being named a party to the inquiry meant he would never command again early one morning he had managed against hospital orders to ease himself out of bed it had taken him fifteen minutes his legs in poor shape but not broken to shuffle with the stoop of an old man to straighten up was to stretch the skin toward the washroom he had sat for twenty minutes trying to defecate but the painkillers had constipated him badly and it was impossible for him to do anything when slowly he got up he risked a look at himself in the mirror now that some of the gauze had been removed the only discernible features were his eyes the rest of what had been his face an angry red of loose and taut skin the two orifices of what used to be his nose obscenely turned up one hole smaller than the other where the cartilage had collapsed his breathing hoglike because of the melted flesh obstructions inside his lips peeled back suture scars on scabrous skin seeping his speech they told him should be all right after much of the internal swelling from the operations had diminished in any case he would have to continue being fed through straws daily astonished at how different food tasted when pureed to slop in the vortex of pain and loneliness only death seemed to offer any solution but hed been brought up a catholic and though no longer a practicing one those early years had marked him too teaching that despair was a sin itself even so had it not been for beth and the children he doubted whether he could have held on he refused to see any of his family and robert the one member who john and catherine brentwood thought might have the best chance of getting through next to beth because of security considerations covering submarine whereabouts at sea could not be informed his sea wolf ssn uss roosevelt being on patrol beth had been allowed to see ray only once and he asked her not to bring the children she didnt argue with him and after she had been carefully robed in antiseptic gown cap and mask she was only grateful that he could not see anything other than her eyes she could not sit on the edge of the bed because the slightest change in surface tension over the sheet would cause rays whole body to stiffen in pain which the doctors called discomfort do you good in here beth had said bravely lose a bit of weight before you come but she couldnt say home home had been another place had been another time when the world was another place everyone and everything had changed forever i love you she said gripping the bed rail willing herself again against her heart not to touch him he mumbled something his voice nasal and rough like someone with bad flu even a cold they said would kill him in his present weakened condition the very worst thing she told rays parents and lana was that because of the suturing theyd had to do on his face he was unable to smile for fear of tearing open the nowclosed fissures it was a thing you took for granted she told lana as they sat together in the visitors room waiting for the doctors latest report with ray unable to smile beth told lana there was no way of knowing he was all right no comfort for her or for anyone else around her lana wasnt really beths type beth had always thought too busy always wanting to do something not bossy exactly but a doer who made you mad with your own inaction ate all the right foods and smart not that there was anything bad in being vigorous healthy or clever but sometimes after a day with the kids she felt such a flop compared to lana and a little bit of jealousy here was ray disfigured for life and there was lana wife of jay la roche what could she possibly know about their kind of life with her big cars always dressed like a fashion plate some said she looked like a brunette grace kelly not a hair out of place never disorganized and nice on top of it all especially about ray but then she could afford to be next week it would probably be palm springs or some charity ball for president maynes war bond drive she could walk away from the pain of course they might not take me lana was telling beth i used to have asthma as a child at least thats what they told me personally i dont think they were ever sure whether it was more an allergic reaction anyway i had to choose daddy said asthma or prince our dog i suppose rays told you all about it i kept the dog my parents had a dingdong row about that one who mightnt take you asked beth trying to disentangle the conversation the waves said lana i have a year of premed and they told me before i left new york that but what about your husband lana was nonplussed beth havent you heard a word of what ive been she paused well they say ill probably be posted to halifax theyre so short of nurses that itll be sort of learning on the job wheres halifax that in canada yes somewhere in nova lana and beth could see some kind of commotion several patients including one in a wheelchair were hurrying toward them to look at the big tv screen in the visitors room news flashes were coming in that the nationalist chinese from taiwan under us pressure were backing off from getting too close to mainland china there was some generally poor footage of tanks in a rainy field the scream of an antitank weapon and the tank upsidedown for a minute the reporters rapid breathing caught on the sound track as the camera was righted the reporter explaining that the tank had just been hit by an antitank missile oooh said a petty officer stopping by the door looking up at the tv really an antitank missile he looked across at lana and beth some of these tv guys i tell ya he looked back again at the screen and saw two wide red arrows spreading north and south over a green map of west germany where are the french the petty officer asked i dont think said lana france is in nato they are and they arent said the petty officer it was only as the man turned round toward her that lana noticed he had one arm the others shoulder stump covered by a pajama sleeve rolled and pinned up theyre still in it continued the petty officer but they wanted their own command structure withdrew from the joint command structure in sixtysix they want the nato umbrella so they pay membership but want to use their forces how they want the po looked at lana autonomous command he said derisively you know like im a member of the ball team but when i dont want to play i wont so long as they help said lana i dont care how autonomous they are the french help the french lady said the petty officer always looking for a backdoor deal such as you dont come into france and we wont fight you well keep out of it whos you anyone who might muss em up remember they wouldnt let us fly through french airspace to hit libya only maggie thatcher stood with us to hell with em said the petty officer walking on only thing i like about the french is french toast theyll sit on their butt till ivans got germany then hell want alsacelorraine and then hell want france and have forty divisions all down the line then the commie c in c can ride down their champs elysees on his white horse no said lana francell come in well said the petty officer turning back i wont be there it was said with relief but also with regret beth envied him in a way hed lost an arm but compared to ray lehman had told them that in the end they might have to consider a porous skin mask that would allow him to go out in public but he would have to take it off now and then like dentures at night to help keep the skin clean be best to remove it at night let the skin breathe what would they do wondered beth if he wanted to make love would he still be able to do it after all this trauma they often said that after combat high stress many men just couldnt do it anymore if that happened ray would get mad then thered be more stress maybe she could just do it for him some way that wouldnt and she thought of what he must feel a young man captain at thirtyseven clearly marked for promotion and then so suddenly so terribly fallen from grace thank god the navy would pay the medical bills jeannie had said if daddy loved us hed let us see him beth had torn into her dont be so goddamned selfish jeannie hes hurt very badly youll understand when you get i know jeannie said sobbing but we miss him too beth had folded and taken the children to see him the nurse informed her that captain brentwood did not wish to see anyone yet exhausted beth looked down at the two children if it was one of us all burned up what do you think daddy would do come see us said johnny alerted by the nurses station lehman intercepted them in front of the burn unit i dont he began they want to see him doctor once the ivs are taken out it will be all fine he didnt know what she was talking about she was obviously quite beside herself your fatherinlaw was in this morning and im afraid your husband didnt want to see him either he wants to make his own recovery mrs brentwood in his own good time beths hands clenched as she held jeannie and john straining for control dr lehman flashing a smile had knelt down next to the small boy your daddy needs a lot of sleep right now when youre feeling how do you sayyucky well sometimes you just want to go to bed and not see anyone till youre better isnt that so yes put in jeannie she liked the doctor he was the kind of father figure she always expected of doctors i think the doctors right mom said jeannie tugging at her worriedly yeah mom chimed in johnny we shouldnta come beth had aboutturned her high heels striking the hard highly polished floor echoing the full length of the ward she spoke only once at the entrance of the hospital okay thats it you two we are not going to the hospital again until your daddy asks for us understood john nodded jeannie became little miss proper when youre out yes mother beth jerked jeannies arm i brought you all the way down here because you pleaded begged me to do it then you embarrass me like this were sorry mom said jeannie johnny thought about it for a minute mom yes if daddy dies do we get all his money once again realizing she hadnt been listening to lanas plans for a new hopefully more useful life beth was forced into noncommittal murmurs trying to cover her inattention chapter thirtyfive parris island south carolina david had heard all about it laughed about it and determined it wouldnt get him down as hed stepped off the bus in the darkness david could smell the last of the purple oleander blossoms from the trees that had flashed past the greyhound as it made its way over the long causeway to the island in the dim glow of the buss cabin lights he could see a di peaked scout hat strap at the back khaki shirt and pants pressed with knifeedge precision and could hear the sound of insects from the tidal flats then a voice demented shut your fucking mouths all your shit off the bus into the barracks now david got such a fright that rushing back into the bus to get his kit bag he stumbled on the bottom step whats your fucking name screamed the di me sir yes you youre the only goddamned stumbleass around here whats your fucking name brentwood sir the di leaned forward i cant hear you brentwood sir i cant hear you brentwood sir fucking who brentwood sir wrong your names stumbleass whats your name stumbleass sir what stumbleass sir what stumbleass sir right now get your kit and run david wished hed joined the navy inside the white building there was a sparse barrack room an antiseptic smell a line of double bunks down both sides the same di standing hands on hips waiting for david the last recruit in after the delay at the bus it meant he got the only bunk left right by the door there was a whisper who spoke shouted the di it was the first thing about a di that david noticed they didnt roar like lions they shouted a tad below hysteria a black recruit stepped forward putting his hand up put your goddamned fucking hand down until i tell it to move yes sir yes what yes sir you talk again string bean and i will personally cut your balls off do you understand me yes sir yes what yes sir there was a long silence at least five minutes no one moved someone broke wind the silence continued then the di his voice rolling over the already tired and demoralized recruits recited the litany of reception in a deliberately unemotional monotone which made it even more foreboding for the recruits though it consisted of telling them the obvious where they were parris island though some thought it was a nightmare theyd woken up in most wanted to get back on the bus but the bus had gone the di informed them that because of the small numbers of the peacetime standing army training would have to be completed in a much shorter time than usual if he had his way he would work the miserable maggots eighteen hours a day but insofar as congress in its wisdom had decreed that a maggot had to receive seven and onehalf hours of uninterrupted sleep the maggots would have to work much harder than was usual for maggots in order that they might qualify as members of the worlds finest fighting organization the united states marine corps and that they were to do exactly as they were told to do would not speak unless spoken to and always end a sentence with sir strange insects buzzed and flapped against the gauze reincarnated recruits though david trying to remember from his zoology course whether it was the female mosquito that made the zinging noise or the male anyway it was like the di the one you didnt hear was the one that got you the one youd like to kill one of the fluorescent lights had started flickering they were still at attention stumbleass yes sir whats in that plastic bag david was so rattled he couldnt think the sweat was pouring down his back ah candy i it was some candy melissa had given him when hed left candy bellowed the di candy shit youre not going to have fucking time to chew fucking candy are you stumbleass no sir now what no sir david couldnt believe the obscenity the only person hed ever heard talk like this was an australian take off your fucking pants the di bellowed at the recruits and began walking down the rows oh lookit this a recruit quickly risked a glance to see what the di was looking at keep your fucking head up turd the recruits head shot back up and stared ahead eyes glazed by fear oh look said the di his bellow daring anyone to look what have we got here limp dink valentine shorts david could see far enough up the line without moving his head to see the recruit a puerto rican his boxer shorts covered with valentine hearts the di walked around the man once reversed direction and walked around the other way david had never seen a more miserablelooking soul on gods earth than the hapless puerto rican the di stood up to his full height his nose almost touching the recruit whose head was straining back while at the same time trying to remain at attention without tipping who gave you these thelma name is thelman shut your fucking mouth your names thelma who gave them to you thelma my mother sir mommy long as youre here youll wear standard issue thelma if youre good enough to be a marine which i fucking doubt you will continue to wear standard issue do you read me yes sir the di turned get your fucking plastic bag up here stumbleass on the double dump it on the floor david did so there was a card from melissa that fell out with the candy david was beetred from embarrassment and anger he knew what the di was trying to do everyone knew it didnt make it easier that you knew the di handed him the card youre the worst fucking lot ive seen yet war brings out the best and worst in men and you are the fucking worst empty your pockets and kits of all shit now understand yes sir reverberated the barrack shit for you stupid assholes is any substance contrary to regulation aspirin is shit narcotics are shit vitamins are shit prescription drugs are shit candy is shit booze is shit anything i dont like is shit understand yes sir only wedding rings are permitted whats that a radio sir transistor thats shit the pile of drugs combs neck chains condoms gum cigarettes filled the plastic bag but this was the easy part next day beginning with the usual breakfast by numbers at david saw his hair the last vestige of his individuality falling from him in great gobs unceremoniously pushed away by an enormous broom into a garbage bag then there were the obsessive forming rituals of induction week the humiliating asshole inspection the endless grueling day of di abuse the numbingly repetitious use of every weapon from ms to the laserguided tow the alfa bravo charlie delta alphabet so that messages might never be misunderstood the stifling nauseating forced run through the gas hut the issue of standard condoms along with other standard equipment the bare dining room with the words tact loyalty gungho courage teamwork honesty knowledge morale stenciled on the support posts above the painted footprints where you had to stand what david remembered most was the kind of small incident that for some reason stays with you for life it was one night just after lights out the moon cold comfort over the carolina low country when the puerto rican called thelma turned to david and said i came here to be a marine to fight for my country not this kind of crap from near the mouse house the dis small room with basin at the end of the hut a silhouette appeared its peaked hat sharp against the halo of the moon the dis voice for the first time that david could remember was not shouting we dish out shit son because youre going to get shit the russians and their helpers arent going to throw flowers at you the recruit said nothing the di turned to walk away to his billet stopped and looked over his shoulder one more thing you scumbags if this thing doesnt get sorted out over there the red bastards will end up in your backyard i want a marine next to me i love this country i love the corps by the time david brentwood thelma and the others had gone through basic training their platoon of seventyfive had only purple streamers attached to their platoons standard this meant that unlike the superiors they were merely runofthemill marines and had not distinguished themselves above the other marines in platoon marksmanship and other battlefield skills but they were marines and were told they would be among the first used to plug the gaps in the dike questions asked the di his voice now approaching normal not friendly but not as sarcastic as usual what dikes that sir the dikes are everywhere marine you just remember everything youve been taught and you might just stand a chance another recruit put up his hand sir can you tell us how its going in korea chongju fell last night after chow with graduation next morning they began the difficult informal goodbyes laced with false bravado lest they be thought too sentimental it made no sense to david hed hated the place but now that hed qualified in fact he thought his shooting had been pretty good though the final marks were not in on that yet there was a feeling of belonging in the relatively short time theyd known one another the men who had made it formed a bond that they instinctively knew would last a lifetime and which marine tradition told them would and each of them as they packed his kit knowing he would soon be called to war to face the fear and all the dangers of the unknown felt ready toughened and in each mans thoughts the honor rolls from montezuma to iwo jima to the fighting retreat from chosin reservoir all rang with glory for as yet none of them had known the smell of it the feel of it or the horror they knew it only in the abstract and for all theyd been told of what to expect each of them held the young mans eternal secret it would not be him and in that he found his bravery his willingness to go forth on the last day the di read out the numbers of assignation to the marine platoon of seventyfive devane zero three zero zero least you can fire a fucking rifle there was subdued laughter training over the future before them brentwood zero three zero zero looks like you and devane are for magtaf whats that sir sounds like a disease said someone else marine airground task force idiot out of camp lejeune means they think the fuckers can shoot scratch ass and jump from a plane at the same time whose ass someone put in for the first time the di did not bawl out at the goofing off it was as close as a di would come to showing affection thelman zero three zero zero magtaf the di ticked him off the list do i train em or what yes sir webster one eight zero zero engineers means you might be fixing toilets there was silence the dis clipboard in front now that hed finished reading off the whole platoon all right now heres the score you made it through boot camp youre marines dont ever forget it wherever you go youll be marines marines dont give ground they take it im not gonna shit you right now the gooks and the russians have got us by the balls our backs to the sea i dont know whether youll be going in but youre all going to end up in it somewhere korea or europeless some dumb bastard pushes the button which so far hasnt been the case and which i personally dont think they will anyway not so long as they havent blown their wad in conventional arms and got nothing left to throw at us but wherever you go youve got one big thing in your favor you believe in what youre fighting for when they get tough and they will your belief in your country in the corps is an extra shot up the spout good luck god bless on the final night after the graduation packing his kit for camp lejeune david brentwood was feeling down thelmans stepmother had attended the graduation parade but neither of davids parents could make it thered been multiple bomb scares at jfk and la guardia and by the time the passing review rolled around john and catherine brentwood were still on the ground in new york it was one of the great disappointments of davids life he was quite surprised at how disappointing no mail from melissa either but then mail right across the country seemed to be in a shambles these days more bomb threats and one big explosion in chicagos central post office killing three inside workers and scores of others theyd said it was sabotage as david took melissas photo down from the hog board in the barracks room and thelman took down his girl he asked brentwood whether he believed all that crap the di had said bout us having an extra shot in the spout i figure the russians tell their guys the same thing probably said david yeah well said thelman any russian gets on my two hundred line ill blow his head off david said nothing he was still thinking about his parents not being there to see him graduate he knew it wasnt their fault and theyd had a bad time of it just trying to cope with ray his mom wanting to go over to california every time he had an operation it became too expensive and anyway shed promised ray she wouldnt come see him until he felt ready truth was ray was getting on davids nerves a bit david didnt want to admit it but damn it the only praise hed received from anyone in the past ten weeks was during the days when the platoon had gone out for qualification to try for the requisite out of on the firing range it was the one time when the di stood back and a coach was assigned to every two recruits some were more sarcastic than the dis and a few like the one that david and devane got sergeant osborne really cared about the young recruits under them osborne spoke quietly and rather than push them he led them into doing a good job he even spent time with them on the smith wesson side arm practice usually dismissed as fun or fuckin useless for marines except the di said if you let a fucking gorby get that close to you then you dont deserve a side arm use your hands stiff arm with the left and grab the privates privates but in an age besotted by automatic wonders osbornes approach imbued them with a respect for the oldfashioned side arm he himself approached the weapon with the respect of a novice taking his first communion can be used for good or evil boys he said no matter what the damned liberals say commies can come and take you away in the middle of the night in this country you have to have a warrant thats a big difference thats a difference worth dying for what made him give them that little speech neither brentwood nor devane had any idea maybe hed overheard thelmans cynicism on the night of the full moon he was a little odd they said but whatever he did teach them how to fire the breathe in hold no no son squeeze dont jerk it ive seen guys qualified with the m couldnt hit a dis butt with a jammed up him way i figure it theres gonna be a lot of use for these little babies you take good care of em hear david had worked hard for osborne because the man not only genuinely cared about what he was doing but reveled in their success way to go private he called out to brentwood when he made qualification with the out fucking standing as the banked in preparation for landing at camp lejeune both marines proudly wearing their marksmans badges on their tunics thelman was thinking about osborne and his love affair with the why we going to need pistols i dont know said brentwood looking down at the brownishgreen scrub that was the training area for the marine airground task force but ive got a feeling were going to find out real soon lejeunes pretty tough probably give us a can of beans one mag each for the and see how we do one can of beans laughed thelman man im way ahead of you on this one they dont give you nothin in this outfit is what i hear they send you out and you have to live off the land for five days what the hells the use of that asked brentwood we arent supposed to be runnin from anybody marines take ground right its called tactical retreat they drop you in a zone before your supplies are unloaded from the chopper its all blown to hell then you gotta make do live off the land till they can send a whirlybird in for you as the descended they could see marines taking off in harness from the parachute towers small khaki figures beneath them shaking their fists and seeming to be in apoplexy dis jesus said brentwood i should have gone for deferment latrines nah said thelman youre a mover stumbleass first time i saw you crash that bus step i said to myself now theres a mover shut your face chapter thirtysix nkas fourth divisional hq was now situated in the shellpocked catholic church in what had been the bustling city of uijongbu the smell of the american and south korean rout was heavy in the rainslashed air hulks of threeton trucks and tanks still burning but barely as if even the fires were exhausted fresh motorized columns of nka troops stonyeyed but flushed with victory wove through the wreckage of the us eleventh corpss fighting retreat the bodies of american and south korean soldiers lay strewn about beneath the gunmetal monsoon sky the heavy cloud cover was continuing to make it difficult despite infrared lookdownshootdown scopes for the few american pilots flying out of pusans sabotaged and potholed airstrips to distinguish friend from foe beneath them especially given the nkas cannibalization of us trucks and jeeps from his crowded cell in the partially destroyed school opposite the church major tae could see over fifty m pattons that had been knocked out by wireguided tank missiles the wires now strewn across the roadways like so many abandoned fishing lines general kim was overwhelmed with logistical problems the advance in a crucial stage because of the monsoons bogging down the american ms he had made enormous gains in territory in the three weeks since his invasion of the south but the supplies he needed were slow in coming what he wanted now was to crush as many american and south korean troops as possible by smashing through the protective triangle stretching from yosu sixty miles away on the south coast through taegu ninetyseven miles from ulsan on the east coast in all it was an arc of about miles behind which the americans after losing kyongju were hastily trying to regroup their stunned and exhausted army forming a defensive perimeter with pusan sixty miles away from the arcs outermost limit as the linchpin kim was haunted by the american counterattack from the southeast corner in the war of the s and knew pusan must be captured as quickly as possible in order to deny american reinforcements en route from japan a beachhead of all the nka commanders their confidence further boosted by their infiltrators sabotage of the giant hyundai shipyards in ulsan kim had the clearest understanding of the americans incontestable ability to organize a huge logistical effort on short notice like all democracies the americans were of course degenerate and flaccid in peacetime kim told his staff officers but galvanized by war their industrial capacity was kōch anghan awesome the only certain way was to deny the reinforcements a foothold and for this he called for the kim ii sung chasal putae suicide squads to spearhead the infantry and armored wedge that he intended to drive toward pusan feints would be made first on the southern flank toward yosu and on the northern toward ulsan to dilute the american defense the main wedge with air cover moving two hours later against pusan both pyongyang and moscow which had been furious with pyongyang for initiating the action believed that as in the case of vietnam once the americans were driven into the sea the american peace groups heavily infiltrated by nowactivated sleepers together with public opinion simply would not support president mayne in any venture that would risk so many more american lives to retake the peninsula mayne would fight where he had to in europe but not in asia despite his preoccupation with what he was sure would be the coming victory over the americans kim took a minute to light a fresh american cigarette and watch major tae being marched out of the school to join the line of other captured rok officers outside the interrogation tent whats his interrogation status kim asked his chief of intelligence there were only two categories of prisoners in the nka cooperative and reactionary we do not know yet general he should have been questioned at kaesong but apparently he was incorrectly diverted have we any leverage cut in kim from my experience at panmunjom tae was very stubborn yes were attending to that now weve been able to keep close surveillance on him his daughters boyfriend was an active member of the reunification party hes a migook lover yes said the intelligence chief hadnt the general heard him were prepared never mind about any information on seoul said kim tapping the bone cigarette holder impatiently on an ashtray made from an american howitzer shell well ferret out their underground units now that weve taken the city what i need to know and quickly colonel is who are the kcias counterespionage chiefs in taegu and pusan those who could provide local leadership sabotage railway demolition anything to slow our final attack on pusan we cannot attack yet but as soon as we get enough supplies to taegu we will move but i dont want even a days delay because of sabotage even a days delay for us could be critical you must understand the americans are not only in disarray but thoroughly demoralized by our success in taking them by surprise they are now at their most vulnerable it is essential that the civilian population realize we have totally infiltrated their defenses we must give them no hope that helping the americans will change anything we must discover who the chief undercover kcia counterespionage chiefs are and execute them immediately of course general i understand a hundred yards away standing in the mud outside the interrogation tent with the other prisoners major tae saw kim watching him from the churchs narthex its canopy scabrous from the shelling long twists of reinforcing steel rods protruding from one of the rods the bodies of two men one american and one south korean dangled turning slowly tongues grotesquely black eyes bulging obscenely signs around their necks marking them as pihyōpnyōchōkin pantongpunchauncooperative reactionaries the thing that struck tae was that the signs were so neatly made it was highly unlikely theyd been painted on the spur of the moment or in the heat of the battle but rather prepared long beforehand as part of a carefully thoughtout nka policy of terror tae felt weak unsure as to how much of it was due to sheer fear how much to hunger trying to remember as nka guards moved down the line of prisoners giving them mugs of weak tea how long it had been since he had eaten two civilian women eyes carefully avoiding any contact with the guards were brewing the tea in a large copper washing tub outside one of the tents the nka soldier handing out the tea was smiling at each man as he gave them the steaming liquid you help us he told them and there will be no trouble the carrot or the hangmans noose most of the officers in the line tae noticed had removed their intelligence insignia one of them a captain he recognized as one of those who had been brought up from seoul for interrogation kim had disappeared from the opening in the church after tea tae thought of the american murdered before his eyes the mans tiny cross and after getting the guards permission he took off his boot on the pretext of shaking out a pebble then putting the boot back on he used his forefinger as he retied the lace to feel for the gumlike sliver of potassium cyanide hidden in the tongue christians he thought would feel for the cross as their talisman he would feel for the cyanide strip the knowledge that in this battle against the nka he would have the final say continued to fortify him major tae it was an nka lieutenant tae stood up yes what are you doing ii was fixing my boot something the nka lieutenant slapped him across the face you are lying take off your boots tae did so the lieutenant handed them to the guard but he was still watching tae you will follow me chapter thirtyseven it was a bright clear day a cobaltblue sea and sky not a day for war twentyfour hundred miles northeast of newfoundland in the thirtyfour million square miles of atlantic ocean the first british convoy of world war iii was under way dispatched by saceur supreme allied commander europe the convoy consisting of twenty fifteenthousandton containertype ships escorted by twentyfive nato warships primarily british was negotiating its way past an iceberg floe for though it was early autumn the ice sheets still extended from greenland no difficult task for each merchant ship it was a major headache for saclant the supreme allied commander atlantic admiral horton in norfolk virginia as the convoy designated rresupply one was just the first of dozens that would have to be made in the first fourweek period after that the nato reserves particularly of fuel would be dangerously low and the russian monolith with no such problems of crosssea reinforcements would clearly win the deadly cold war game of asw antisubmarine warfare of hideandseek between the soviet sub fleet of four hundred and natos had been waged with deadly seriousness ever since natos aim having been to demonstrate to the russians that the cost of a soviet sub offensive would be disastrous for the soviet union but all that was before the sudden surge in soviet submarine technology in the late eighties due largely to the american walker spy ring who with other highly sensitive material it had gained access to had sold the soviets top information including the location sites of natos sosus sound surveillance system an underwater network of microphones or hydrophones which picked up the movements of soviet submarines throughout the world the russians also knew that quite apart from trying to sink a whole convoy they would win the war if their navy could sink allied shipping at a faster rate than lost ships could be replaced this was especially true for tankers carrying fuel which unlike the russians western europe had to import even the british who didnt import their oil from the middle east any longer but from the north sea were dependent on the transport of that oil by tankers vulnerable to the russian subs it was a simple enough equation but a devastating one for natos forward defense in western europe admiral horton explained it by quoting patton my men can eat their boots but my tanks gotta have gas and if europe went so would america the sub packs from russias northern fleet came out of murmansk and down from the kara sea of them the americans k satellite picking up their thermal discharge patterns it was an underwater armada of huk hunterkiller submarines the satellite photos suggesting their course was set for the giuk greenlandicelanduk gap in effect two gaps one group of subs heading for the denmark strait the other for the icelandfaeroe rise through which they must pass if they hoped to intercept the convoy the sound prints picked up by natos sosus hydrophones on the ocean bottom of the giuk gap together with magnetometer readings taken by lowflying norwegian pb asw planes via their longtrailing wire antennas confirmed the satellite projection of the subs course the noise of each sub as peculiar to itself as the noise of each automobile gave off different sound signatures or fingerprints fed into the computers of natos naval commands matchups were made with the known noise signatures of all russian subs ever recorded by nato within an hour norfolk virginia and convoy r knew via satellite burst message that of the subs from russias northern fleet heading for the convoy were modern snorkelbreathing dieselelectric huks were nuclear and the remainder old dieselelectrics used for training purposes the dispatch of the old dieselelectrics by arctic tvd military theater naval headquarters at severomorsk was viewed by norfolk as an effort to throw everything at the convoy not simply to maul it but annihilate it to demonstrate to nato that the cost to them of reinforcing europe wasnt worth the candle norwegian air patrols were taken over by american air trackers out of iceland where the us navy escorts would take over from the royal navy to see the convoy safely to halifax on canadas east coast the largest northernmost port of north america best able to handle the huge shuttle and storage of materials and ordnance for nato resupply most of the cargo now being assembled on the halifax docks was in containers one modern container ship carrying as much cargo as twentyseven world war ii merchantmen this meant that convoy r would if it arrived safely in halifax equal the cargocarrying capacity of twenty world war ii convoys a lieutenant commander at norfolk virginia asked why the brits nato he was corrected sharply by admiral horton were in this together commander and its not the playoffs its the world series right here right now he said tapping the lastreported position of the convoy sorry sir but whys nato sending over twenty cargo ships wouldnt it make more sense to simply load or expropriate container ships here in the us and canada load em up and move out were doing both replied the admiral waving the lieutenant commanders suggestion aside weve no time to lose either end and remember extraordinary security procedures are in effect we find a leak from this side of the atlantic and ill deepsix the son of a bitch he was edgy the russians knew the giuk gaps were the choke points transiting lanes deep in places but relatively narrow that had to be negotiated before the soviet northern fleet could hope to break out into the deeper vastness of the north atlantic twentythree hundred miles north of newfoundlands cape bauld convoy r was proceeding southwest the square of twenty empty cargo vessels five a side a mile between each ship surrounded by a larger squareshaped u of twentyfive asw sea king helicopters in front of this double square there was a fanshaped deployment of gruman eab electroniccountermeasures prowlers each plane its telltale proboscis sticking out in front of the cockpit for midair refueling was so jampacked with detection and jamming electronics it was simply too heavy to be armed the main business of its crew of four pilot copilot and two electronic warfare officers was to be constantly on the lookout for visual as well as dipstick sonar evidence of submarines between the advance screen of grumans asw helicopters and patrol aircraft and the protective outer square of frigates and destroyers that surrounded the core square of twenty container ships there was a wide arrowhead formation of ten british trafalgarclass nuclearpowered attack submarines behind these were four older oberonclass diesel electric subs and a lone dutch glassreinforced plastichulled minesweeper of the hms wilson design with its corrugated hull of fiberglass on plastic formers looking distinctly ungainly as its twentyseven hundred tons plowed through the medium chop and it became the butt of many jokes the minesweeper had been sent along by saceur simply to be on call though the nato commander of the convoy british admiral woodall suspected that as the ship had been designed for coastal defenses it had really been dumped on the convoy as a tryout for it wasnt the russian northern fleet that would now be fretting about mines in the giuk gap nato had lain both magnetic and signature primed mines sometimes only a hundred meters apart woodalls sudo submarine distribution officer was matching noise signatures recorded by the norwegian pbs and the sosus hydrophone networks that had not been affected by the electromagnetic pulse that had blacked out natos computers along europes central front the sudo tapped the computers keys with the unhurried competence born in the nexus of long training selfconfidence and expertise in stateoftheart submarine disposition programs there they were on the monitor the hitherto white sub signals indicating vessel country unknown changed immediately to red subdivided into dhsdiesel hostiles and nhsnuclear hostiles forty miles ahead of the convoy the blue wrinkle of sea beneath him glinting with sunlight one of the prowlers picked up six blips instantly alerted two asw sea king helos peeled out from the fan racing ahead of the convoy rotors catching the sun toward the six blips four seconds later admiral woodall received coded burst messages from saclant confirmed by buda the underground listening bunker in norway and by cinceastlant commander in chief eastern atlantic northwood england that the first group of the russian subs was approaching the giuk gap the six blips on the prowlers radar however were not coming from the west but from the south forty miles ahead of the convoy admiral woodall instructed his sudo to code top secret to c in c east atlantic where are soviet minesweepers an integral part of the whole nato forward fleet flexible response policy at sea was to cause a major traffic jam at the giuk gaps literally cutting the russians off at the pass buying time for the nato convoys and forcing the russians to send in timeconsuming minesweepers woodall reminded his ood that when in one mine layer dropped its load in the red sea it had taken over seventeen minesweepers eight large helicopters plus dozens of support vessels from six countries more than three weeks to clear the area nato had laid the equivalent of twenty mine layer loads in the giuk gaps of course woodall pointed out the bolshies might send in remotecontrol metallic barges four abreast to detonate the magnetic mines but that was easier said than done and even so it would still leave hundreds of soundactivated mines already coded to home in and detonate on the noise signature of each russian ship that would have to pass through the narrow channels woodall was anxious to hear just how many minesweepers had been sighted as the two sea king helicopters approached the six blips well ahead of the convoy they recognized them with great relief as norwegian purse seiners their high poop decks and nets that are pulled in into the coneshaped purse quite visible from five hundred feet for a distance of three miles the norwegian flags flying stiffly in the breeze as the sea kings now descended to make sure in the words of the sea king leader that there was no bloody hankypanky the fishermen however looked positively relieved to see the sea kings their voices on the radio band clearly conveying their alarm at not knowing where they could go in one sense it seemed a ridiculous question to the crew of the sea king the blue expanse of the atlantic all around but the fishermen told the pilots that on their way back from weeks at sea since hostilities had begun they simply did not know which coastal region was safe the natural answer of course would have been to head for iceland but despite the nato alliance the sea king pilots were aware that thered been some nasty cod wars within nato over fishing rights around iceland and greenland and the fishermen reported that theyd rather head back to norway if it was possible or attach themselves to the convoy for safe passage the lead sea king pilot said hed have to verify with the convoy commander but told them that meantime they should move over to the eastern flank of the convoy a polite way of telling the fishermen that the convoy would not alter course for the time being and that admiral woodall would not take kindly to any trawlers getting in his way please explained one of the trawlers we have yet to bring in our net all right reported the sea king leader the helo rising the fishermen looking fat their yellow wet gear ballooning in the rotors wash but youd better hurry it up upon returning to the convoy the pilot was ordered to land his craft on the helicopter carrier ship nearest admiral woodalls destroyer stunned the pilot was severely reprimanded for breaking radio silence without express authorization from woodall the point that messages had been sent to c in c east atlantic by the admiral himself did not absolve the pilot the messages sent to c in c east atlantic were burst coded a matter of milliseconds and of import to the convoys safety while the chatter with the norwegian trawlers had been long enough for the enemy via satellites andor listening posts from murmansk to the north cape to get a vector fix it didnt do any good for the pilot to explain that given the low transmission power hed used it would have been all but impossible to pick up the exchange with the norwegians hell complained the pilot to his comrades if they dont know where we are now their satellites arent worth a tinkers damn he looked at his copilot asking bitterly how the hell else should i have communicated with them by bloody semaphore for christs sake should have lowered down one of our crew said the copilot gamely the sea king pilot snorted went to his cabin furious at woodall but mostly at himself of the fourteen submarines in the advance fan screen four of the nuclearpowered trafalgars had now sprinted ahead at thirty knots submerged to a point thirty miles ahead of the convoy reducing speed to ten then five knots thus eliminating their own noise they deployed their hydrophone arrays extruded astern like a long tube worm in neutral buoyancy the subs sat and listened their computers automatically subtracting any noise they emitted against incoming noise received by the passive radar active radar would not be used as while this would bounce off any other sub and give its precise position to the listening trafalgars the trafalgars themselves would also have been identified as a noise source in passive mode however no noise was sent out by the trafalgars their operators listening intently to the noisiest place on earth the seas high density of life gave off a cacophony of sound everything from the snapping noise of swarms of shrimp to the muted hornlike calls of seals and whales and other mammals in addition there was the din of currents in concert currents in opposition turbulence of small and enormous mud slides jets of superheated mineralrich water steaming out of thousands of vents after traveling through the hot volcanic aquifers far beneath the seafloor interface one of the loudest noises was that of the plankton which rose with the coming of night and fell with the coming of dawn their sizzle confounding the sonar operators ever since world war ii when the noise was first heard in the sonar war against the nazi wolfpacks the plankton layer still interfered at times with even the strongest and most sophisticated electronic filters as the billions of microscopic creatures created a massive blanket of sound distorting all other in the same way different density layers that never mixed created through temperature differentials warm oases teeming with life in depths once thought uninhabitable all this meant that to detect any particular noise sound moving much more quickly in water from liquid molecule to molecule than in the air was as much an art as a science for a trained operator to detect another submarine was as much art as science one had to develop the feel for the sounds the ability to eliminate all similar sounds to sort out one propellers cavitation from another listening carefully on the narrowband receivers for the sfp sharp frequency peaks and on the twohundred to twothousandhertz band for the singing sound of a propeller shafts vibrations these varying within the same ship in proportion to rate of speed blade shape and hull curvature all affecting the overall noise signature in addition to all these concerns of the sonar operators the nato navies were not really sure of the full extent of the damage done by the american walker spy ring or by toshibas sale of the toshibakonigsberg quietpropellermaking machine to the soviet union in any event to find their way through all of this the sonar operators of course needed excellent hearing it was something that capt robert brentwood skipper of the uss roosevelt now back on its norfolktoscotland patrol made a point of doublechecking whenever a new sonar operator was assigned to the sub it was usual for skippers to acquaint themselves as quickly as possible with each new man aboard but as well as finding out something about their home town family hobbies and such robert brentwood always made a point of asking sonar operators what kind of music they liked pointing out that there were all kinds of tapes aboard the subs for offhours earphone listening robert brentwood was an honest man straight to the face his officers described him or no horseshit as the crew put it but he did not want to prejudice the operators answer by making it seem like a very serious question and so he did practice on these occasions only a willful deception on his men if a sonar operator said he liked rock and roll he would smile accommodatingly and as if he were an aficionado himself inquire hard rock if the operator said yes sir he would never be first choice on sonar in any crisis situation no aspect of submarine warfare had escaped brentwoods attention and he knew that though in all other respects a persons hearing might test normal in boot camp and training school sustained hard rock especially as experienced through headphones inevitably damaged hearing and as a result unknown to the operator hightone differentiation would be lost the failure of a sonar operator to hear such a tone as sometimes emitted by the high electric whine or cue tones of homing torpedoes and subrocs surfacetosub missiles could cause the death of men at a thousand feet the roosevelt sat listening her tow array hydrophones weighted for three thousand feet an optimum sound channel depth according to computer readout of gulf stream salinity temperature and current strength in ideal conditions sound could travel through this layer for over four thousand miles roosevelt was also quietly leaking cold water from its asrec antisatellite recognition emission control the cold water neutralizing the radiant heat from the subs machinery which would otherwise produce a hot spot on the sea surface recognized by satellites infrared cameras the problem for the roosevelt now was for its operators to separate the noise of the convoy which according to brentwoods calculations it should pass near the halfway mark between newfoundland and scotland the sonar operator informed brentwood that he could hear no hostiles very well said brentwood phones in phones in confirmed the ood peter zeldman and brentwood could hear the faint soft sound of the big spool hauling in the twoinchdiameter oilfilled hose a long pale yellow snake containing the series of tiny wristwatchsize black microphones two thousand miles northeast of roosevelt the sonar operator aboard the trafalgar suddenly threw his headphones down hands clutching his head in pain the six norwegianflagged trawlers were on the port beam of the convoy when a mine exploded beneath a merchantman the rapid expansion of carbon dioxide and methane gases combining with vaporized water to buckle a starboard plate of the mv clyde creating a jagged fourmeterong hole below the ships waterline next to go was the mv bahrain the explosion directly beneath her bow as the cold waters of the atlantic rushed in over redhot steel and stiffener beams they produced plumes of high hissing steam mistaken by some among the twentyfive escort ships for smoke of the kind expected after a skimmer or airtoship missile had hit it was an assumption that sent the escorts crews to their antiaircraft missile consoles however admiral woodall who as a very young midshipman saw action in the falklands war immediately noticed that neither of the two merchantmen that were hit and sinking had seemed buffeted sharply to one side in the telltale manner of a missile whose blast wave punched its target with such high speed that it usually crumpled much of the upper deck or superstructure one of the british frigates tracking radar operators picked up a blip coming in abaft on the starboard beam in a millisecond the signal flashed from the trackers office to command center in the ships middle then through the computer to the swing sixrocket sea wolf launcher on the weather deck forward of the bridge one of the consoles hinged jaw flaps opened and out streaked one of the sea wolfs antimissile missiles which in seconds blew a sea king helicopter out of the air the helos fiery debris further cluttered the radar screens of the nato escorts whose firing of chaff or aluminum foil deception rockets caused further disaster as some foil due to moisture absorption in one of the rockets stuck together in a ball its size causing overanxious radar operators to report incoming missile in seconds the confusion of antimissile missiles and radar jumble including a spray of highspeed depleted uranium coming from the dutch minesweepers inclose weapons system added to the chaos two heathoming sea king rockets wiped out a destroyers launcher stripping the ships missile consoles fuses in the process so that soon more missiles on the automatic feed stack below began exploding from the sea kings miles ahead on forward screen high above the whiteflecked blue of the sea it looked like a daytime fireworks display gone wrong but no one was laughing as men from the two merchantmen were calling for help desperately trying to swim out of the wash of oil and flotsam bubbling up from their sunken ships nearby a dutch destroyers broadband filters and circuits were reported so severely damaged by friendly fire that a hero warninghazard of electromagnetic radiation to ordnance was flashed through the ship for technicians to take appropriate action before unprotected circuits could prematurely detonate all depth charges aboard one of the trawlers was three miles to port already burning fiercely from a sea king airtoship missile as its crew and the men from the merchantmen struggled for their lives in the burning slick the merchant sailors screaming and waving for help admiral woodall aboard hms newcastle his helovstol vertical takeoff and landing aircraft cruiser issued orders for the entire convoy to turn about and to withdraw as near as conditions would allow along the same course as that on which they had entered the minefield strict orders were given that no ship was to stop to pick up survivors for if russian subs were in the area the covering noise generated by the convoy to mask each ships exact position would be imperiled by any ship slacking off from the convoy and if enough ships stopped they would be picked off one by one all sea king helos and the advance grumans on screen were ordered to return and form a closerin protective perimeter about the convoy as soon as possible on the bridge of hms newcastle the officers and men didnt have time to realize the full extent of the calamity that had befallen not only their convoy but the entire nato convoy strategy for now that radio silence had of necessity been broken the air was filled with coded message bursts from r to saclant in norfolk virginia and acchan allied commander in chief channel forces in northwood uk only further confounding the postworld war ii years of argument between proconvoy and anticonvoy tacticians those against convoys were now pointing at r as stark evidence against convoy strategy and for ims independent merchant shipping strategy with smaller hightech highspeed boats assigned escort duty this they argued would reduce risk both in terms of cost and men and more important would free subs and surface vessels from escort duty giving them the freedom to spread out in searchanddestroy missions rather than being inhibited by an overconcentrated and slower convoy even as the convoy was turning there were two more thunderous explosions mushroom plumes of oil and boiling water rising high into the sky then collapsing in on themselves three more merchantmen were going down and when woodall saw one of them had been at least a mile to his port side the other a mile or so starboard he assumed for a moment that at least two russians had joined the attack there was another explosion and the calm voice of a british captain aboard a sheffieldclass destroyer reporting to woodall that he was taking water abaft the starboard beam the trawlers mines set for individual merchantmens signatures now became obsolete but there was still a question of whether magneticpressure mines reacting to water displacement and magnetic fields passing over them had been set for the heavier merchantmen thus allowing the lighter escorts including the dutch minesweeper to pass over before being triggered as unlike most of the escorts the merchantmen did not have selfdegaussing or magnetic wiping systems that could give them antimagnetic protection against such mines woodall gave orders for the escorts to form a single line as the best hope of getting out of the minefield and to fire at will at the trawlers beg pardon sir said the captain of the command cruiser one of thems on fire i wouldnt imagine sink them mr rees very good sir the sheffield destroyer holed abaft and sinking quickly listing dangerously over her pumps working overtime led the attack with her milimeter forward gun pumping away at the first big oceangoing trawler flecks of paint and rigging spitting up into the air above her the fish boat turned tail its stern now to the destroyer the highpiled netting seemed to shrivel up and fall away there was an orange wink two other trawlers were doing the same skimmer midships shouted the destroyers starboard lookout a split second later the destroyers radar which activated the closein phalanx system began firing the destroyers radar mast collapsed on the bridge as the sea dart roared off from its weather deck mount but the list of the sheffield was so acute that only the milimeter gun could depress far enough to do any damage the gatling gun effectively raking only the trawlers wheelhouse the trawler suddenly bucked its stem lifted clean out of the water by the force of a british destroyers exocet but not before the trawler and two of its sister craft had fired four fiftyfivehundredpound styx surfacetosurface missiles two of them missed or rather were exploded by inclose gatlings the other two hit the entire superstructure and bridge of the next ship in the line a sleek leanderclass frigate were engulfed in fire her radar and radio masts collapsing into the hot maze of twisted steel like a longlegged insect the crescentshaped radar antenna aglow as it struck the water and temperatures generated so high that the port side lifeboat was incinerated amid the reek of cordite gasoline and burning bodies other men spilling into the sea many of them afire and methodically above the sound of the screaming men the steady pumppumppump of cannon fire pulverizing the remaining trawlers several of the officers aboard the long line of british dutch and german escorts had difficulty stopping their gunners even after it was obvious that the trawlers were well and truly done for among some men it had been an unwritten contract in a war that they knew would be waged with the speed and force of missiles there would be no time for such oldfashioned notions as rescue better a bullet than to be left drowning in oil by now it was dusk and as the convoy reformed in squares the dutch minesweeper leading woodall ordered all ships to turn south again in a wide arc avoiding the area where the trawlers had sown their deadly harvest but only he among the entire complement of the cruiser and all the other ships knew that r had been an experiment with the empty container ships as decoys as another admiral before him mountbatten had sent the canadian corps to invade a beach in normandy to test the theory for dday to see if it could be done woodall was now seeing if rollover was feasible and as mountbatten had hoped to draw out the luftwaffe during the dieppe raid now r was to draw out the russians for the killing the dieppe raid had been a terrible failure more than twothirds killed the rest taken prisoner but from it came the invaluable lessons of dday the men like horton in charge of rollover had to know as quickly as possible whether the square base fanshaped screen convoy was workable in real combat but the awful thing for woodall was that now that it had been tried in actual battle conditions the first time in modern missile warfare he knew he could not give saclant or anyone else a definitive answer other than to say that the soviets had very effectively attacked the convoy by deception using mines to devastating effect without question it was a terrible loss for the convoy eight of the container ships sunk two escorts a total of over four hundred men dead but the russian subs the more telling test for the longrun strategy had not appeared at all so far again woodall wondered what was happening at the giuk gap where nato had laid its noisesignatureprimed mines acchan in northwood uk had replied that as yet no explosions had been picked up by the guik sosus network or by any towed sonar arrays the only good piece of news woodall received was that greenlands ice sheet was farther out than usual for september making the greenlandiceland gap even narrower so that if the soviet subs were going to break out it would most likely be through the icelandfaeroe gap as they rounded norways north cape that would narrow the field the cruisers captain commented to woodall possibly answered the admiral unless they used the ice sheet as cover then theyd have to bust through sir make a hell of a din could hear it in piccadilly no said woodall they could use the sheet as cover until theyre well south of the main channel then break out on their left flank at speed into open water theres still our mines said the cruisers captain then why havent our listening posts in iceland heard them popping off pressed woodall yes unless the captain could see that the admiral had already thought of it too the possibility of it the trawlers being the tipoff bloody hell sir special forces yes replied woodall bastards might have wiped out the listening posts either that or been digging up the damned sosus lines dragging them up would be tricky commented the captain take an age too i agree said woodall worriedly his eyes roaming the leaden horizon as night began its descent id say were not hearing anything because the lines have been closed put in the captain as eager as woodall for an explanation woodall was pacing back and forth across the cruisers bridge oblivious to the winking lights of the steering console and the phosphorescent sweep of the radars arm id say the posts are still operational but are being run by the spets theyve deactivated the mines from shorecontrol relay were being fed silence he stopped walking looking across at the cruisers captain everythings seeming normal to us even a little static on the line how about the callin code checks theyd have to answer broken the code old boy or more likely theyve been sold the bloody things some pretty east german secretary in bonn no doubt slipping her boss a bit more than rollover i dont like that much said the captain neither do i those subs could be breaking out right now they were both quite wrong no listening stations had been overrun nato had given top priority to defending them nor was the sub fleet that had come out of the kara sea and around the kola peninsula in the process of breaking out they had already done so hours before chapter thirtyeight uijongbu in the morning tae had told the nka interrogation officer major rhee albeit politely that he would not cooperate the nka pulled two teeth with pliers tae blacked out for a second or two but once conscious again shook his head refusing to tell them anything beyond his rank name and rok identification number rhee told him kŭsaramtŭl orarŭl chikae kŭchinkuhante sikanŭl nangpihaethey werent going to fuck around with him and sent him back to the schoolhouse cell his hands still bound behind his back when they came for him later it was late in the afternoon the sun out briefly making steam for the rice paddies he was pushed roughly inside the bleak mustysmelling interrogation tent its hanging light bulb swinging slightly in the wind the moment he entered seeing major rhee sitting behind a folding camp table writing pad and pencil before him as he sat staring at tae tae noticed another smell something instantly familiar the fragrance of plumeria it was mija standing quietly in the far corner of the tent to his left the light was poor but not so dark that he could not see the tears streaming down her face appa daddy she began be quiet ordered rhee without looking at her then addressing tae a beefy nka guard behind you will tell us instructed rhee all the names of all underground counterespionage leaders in taegu yosu and pusan otherwise we will give your daughter to our soldiers to do with as they please tae shook his head unable to speak his head now bowed in shame the nka major walked over to mija and took her long dark hair wrapping it around his wrist jerking her head back sharply and tearing her bodice open with his other hand her breasts naked in the dim yellow light as they rose and fell sharply in her panic tae knew that if he gave them the names they wanted not only would the chief underground counterinsurgency agents be rounded up and shot but also their families and everyone who knew them hundreds rhees left hand flashed up and grabbed mijas breast his finger and thumb squeezing at the nipple she cried out and tae turned to help her only to be knocked down with the guards rifle butt onto the earthen floor the taste of mud now mixing with the metallic taste of blood the names yelled rhee now tae had intended giving them false names to buy time the name kim for example as common as smith in english the nka major the guards eyes popping out with surprised delight moved his left hand down and began rubbing it hard between mijas legs leave her screamed tae frightening the guard who stepped back from him before he retaliated smashing tae in the face with his rifle butt mija heard the bone crack and saw her father fall unable to get up with his hands still bound behind his back his foot slipping on the muddy floor even as he tried rhee let mija go and she ran to tae crying pleading hysterically to tell them tae on his knees was shaking his head in a way she had never seen before like a stricken dog trying to rid himself of some internal noise which he couldnt locate and for which all prior experience had not prepared him stunned and as full consciousness returned wondering how they had found mija perhaps through her boyfriend in the reunification party which explained to tae why theyd taken several days before deciding to interrogate him up ordered rhee and tae using one of the tables legs for support struggled unsteadily to his feet untie him ordered rhee and the guard used his bayonet to cut the knot the major held out the pencil to tae print he ordered and you he shouted at mija who was now cowering back in the far comer of the tent like a whipped dog trying to cover her shame be quiet or you will be sorry tae heard his daughters terrified sobbing and wrote down the names rhee was under no illusion that tae had given all the names to him but it was good enough once you had one or two names you could start breaking down the various organizational cells in each city and then usually more quickly than you anticipated everything would start to unravel some of them surrendering even lured on in part by terror of what would happen if they didnt and in part by public promises of forgiveness and reeducation rhee looked down at the list nine names for three cities about right he pulled out his revolver to shoot tae mija screamed and ran to her father she was checked by the guard and fell back as if bouncing from a solid wall the bottom of her dress now covered in mud tie him to the chair ordered rhee letting his revolver slip back into the holster walking over to the table he kicked two of the folding legs from under it so that the table was now inclined like a childs slide he ordered the guard to hurry up and tie tae securely to the chair and when he finished to tie the girl to the table if you resist he said flicking a hair away from her face i will shoot him as we did your boyfriend you are all lackeys of the americans mija closed her eyes and began reciting a christian prayer this infuriated the major who slapped her hard unbuttoning his fly rhee smiled hatefully at her and behind him the defeated rok major lashed to the chair you are all whores of the americans she began to fight trying vainly to get away from the table her muscles tightening but was unable to loosen any of the bonds i will kill him rhee warned her and she stopped still and staring at the moldspotted roof of the tent that seemed to be breathing as he mounted her grunting his pleasure her father screaming at him the blood from taes mouth running over his mudspattered chin gag him tape him ordered rhee the guard stuffed an oily rag into taes mouth and taped his eyelids back so that he was forced to watch mija kept looking up at the tent breathing over her after staggering back like a drunkard from the table almost falling against the side of the windbulged tent rhee out of breath told tae hoarsely now the men can have her tae said nothing but looked over at his daughter with all the love he could muster mijas wail of despair no louder than the squeak of a small animal in pain i was mistaken major rhee said smiling at the guard she wasnt a whore the guards eyes were bright again with expectation he asked the major what he should do with her the major put on his cloth camouflage cap whatever you wish he said give her to the men chapter thirtynine on their way down to the white house situation room mayne asked his press secretary trainor whether senator leyland had accepted the presidents offer to join the white house war advisory committee no answer as of an hour ago but you did make the offer public yes sir this mornings press conference some of the southern papers were a bit smartass about it but the times took the high road he showed mayne the leader about nato units falling back in southern germany quite frankly mr president i dont see how he can say no if he declines he looks like he doesnt want to help the country when it needs him if he accepts hes on our side there arent more than two sides in this country bill said mayne not in this war you see the people in the streets everywhere i go you can feel the momentum they dont want war they know i didnt want war but this isnt any hazy gulf of tonkin a million miles away this is outandout aggression this is the communists stepping over the line and the american people know it he paused for a moment how many listeners did you say voice of america has seventeen million thereabouts mr president with all due respect mr president i dont think any fireside chats are going to sway the russians im not an idiot said mayne sharply point is our intelligence reports from different sources can seldom agree on anything but theyre all saying the same thing on this one theres a lot of restlessness out there among the republics we too often think of it as just one big bloc i guess it was always a weaker federation of states than we thought but when gorbachev got in started promising them perestroika glasnost and all the rest of it he gave them hope thats a pretty potent force bill this country was built on that in our revolution maybe sir but hope can go either way doesnt necessarily mean the ukrainians the azerbaijanians and all the rest of the republics will side with us to overthrow the russians ukrainians hated stalins guts and he slaughtered eighty percent of his officers in the purges but when the nazis hit him what did he fall back on no call for the revolution to be defended no sir it was all mother russia he was lucky countered mayne when the wermacht drove into the ukraine the peasants hailed them as conquering heros that didnt last for long though mr president no and you know why sent in the ss after the army and they started their usual horseshit worse than the russians so the ukrainians went back to uncle joe missed opportunity bill could have changed everything which is why i want voice of america telling those people the truth that with all our warts our sides the right side and well help them get their independence if they throw in their lot with us problem there mr president said trainor as they passed the situation rooms marine guards is anyone with a radio or tv set on the wrong channel is going to end up in a salt mine in siberia they dont have salt mines in siberia bill old wives tale mayne paused glanced at a white house secretary and nodded at the chiefs and aides but his mind was still on the voice of america possibility and the whole range of propaganda that might help him what they needed in europe hell what they needed everywhere was time if they could get the hungarians and poles to do something not actually fight the russians which would cause massive reprisals but perhaps get them to use goslow tactics that would help solidarity should know how to arrange accidental breakdowns in the war industries problem was the puppet states had tried it a few times already hungary in czechoslovakia in and only got their faces kicked in and with the sovietwp pushing nato back which brought him to the first question of the meeting with the joint chiefs of staff natos communications as well as voa and radio free europe were in a shambles from austria to belgium why was it mayne asked that the only hard intelligence the pentagon was getting the last few hours was coming from the french thats because said army general gray suzlov or whoevers in charge over there is playing footsie with france the russians want france left out of it that way they can concentrate all their forces gray turned toward the map stand i can read a map general interjected mayne what im asking is havent we got underground units in eastern europe that should be doing the same thing with soviet communications there was a pronounced silence well dont all speak at once said mayne looking about his gaze shifting from general gray to admiral horton us chief of naval operations and natos saclant well pressed mayne why arent the bridges in eastern germany and up there on the northern plain cut why havent they been taken out most of them have been mr president said general gray after all he was the army authoritybut the one thing ruskies are very good at is quick pontooning they can get four tank regiments across in less than an hour they open the valves sinking the pontoons a few inches and we cant see them from the air can anyone tell me if were holding ground anywhere west germans and some of our forces are holding the thurian alps sir well why wouldnt they be why in hell would the russians try climbing over mountains when theyve already got us on the run are we holding our own in the air yes sir answered air force general allet for now next the president turned around to the marine corps commandant general barry i hear your boys are giving a hundred and ten percent at fulda general yes sir are we holding them i dont honestly know mr president its an hourbyhour situation their tanks are breaking down faster than ours but were getting hurt too at fulda we need a sixtoone kill ratio just to stay even the use of the phrase kill ratio got the attention of the secretaries present up until then things had been so frantic the war meetings were much like any other major white house crisis hostage taking attacks on embassies but kill ratios was not the usual prepressconference banter in all the meeting was short and gloomy each service giving its report the central front was sagging but holding here and there the question was for how long but korea was all bad rok and us units still in what reports were pleased to call retreats in force which means the president responded were getting our ass kicked he turned to admiral horton can you give us what we need admiral weve been practicing this one for a long time as you know mr president and what were your casualties during practice admiral high sir considerably higher than we anticipated well fill me in is anything moving out there theres a convoy under way this minute sir out of southampton nato escorts which we will take over from halfway northeast of newfoundland our sub fleet already at sea very well the president stood up and left the room one thing he had learned in politics was that it was essential you husband your time right now this night there were vast armies of men locked in mortal combat and until the situation changed sufficiently to warrant his intervention there was only one sensible thing to do im going to bed bill wake me if its code one will do sir chapter forty william spence was a cooks helper aboard hms peregrine not yet a chef but determined to become one cooking was the thing he loved to do best because hed seldom seen people happier than when they were enjoying a good meal his parents richard spence an industrial chemist for a large heavy industrial adhesive company in london and anne spence a retired grammar school teacher lived in one of the uppermiddleclass green belt housing estates near oxshott in the south of england forty minutes by train from waterloo young william had never intended to join the navy certainly it had not been his fathers intention for him but with the middle class increasingly distrustful of the secular state schools demand and fees for private schools had gone up dramatically richard and anne spence had scraped and saved early in their marriage so that their two eldest children could go to private school for rosemary now thirty it had been the school best equipped to get her into teachers training college and for georgina now twentyfive the school best suited to win her entry via scholarship to the markedly secular but reasonably prestigious lse the london school of economics and political science william on the other hand had not been planned and when anne in her early forties had found she was pregnant there had been a frightful row between her and richard but one conducted in the absence of the two girls anne finally decided not to abort but now richard on the verge of his sixties when both he and anne had anticipated early retirement was faced with paying the bills for william to be at a private school it meant delayed retirement for richard for at least another five years resentment of his predicament however had long ago given way to a love for his son that he had not thought possible and certainly the kind he had achingly missed with his father then one day shortly after his eighteenth birthday william announced he didnt want to go to university he wanted to be a cook a chef corrected richard in astonishment even then william could see his father was at once disappointed and relieved relieved because erroneously richard spence expected it would cost less money to train his son in the culinary arts and disappointed because the spences had always been of professional stock solicitors doctors even the odd barrister no criminal briefs of course mainly mercantile law it was one of these relatives who before the war broke out had advised richard of a solicitous compromise which he believed would satisfy both richards desire to see his son in a respectable profession rather than merely a trade and williams choice richard demurred however on the subject of a child of his being in well manual work being a chefs not like being in a trade these days richard williams greatuncle had advised in high church tone more of a guild i should think point is if you want both hell have to don uniform have to pass the entry exam of course but hell get his o levels shortly richard assured him what do you mean by uniform not a bad arrangement at all the uncle had continued and theyre desperate these days no offense richard but they do want volunteers if they can get them william seems bright enough i see no reason why after a while he couldnt apply for officer training school rather rushing them through these days i should think with all this talk of trouble brewing in europe the uncle had looked satisfiedly into his dry sherry yes i should think it would suit him admirably end up with a commission and he sipped the sherry i shouldnt be surprised if he was running a large hotel in years to come could do worse i suppose began richard if he wanted richard old boy once he gets his one stripe hes way ahead of other applicants for any hostelry business officer cordon bleu and all that doesnt do any harm richard i do think that given his rather limited aspirations it would be best for him richard was coming around slowly any of the services will do i expect asked richard the uncle came as near as he ever had to swallowing sherry without savoring it first certainly not i strongly suggest the senior service the air force said richard dont be fey richard the navy of course i wasnt trying to be fey then your ignorance on these matters is lamentable but ive never thought of william as a sailor anne wont go for it richard had said i can tell you that now all this business about the possibility of war breaking out war richard old man youve been watching too many of those dreadful insight programs either that or reading the mirror the uncle took his brolly and hat from the front stand using the unfurled umbrella as a pointer you send him to the navy mark my words richard was right anne didnt like it but he told her it was most likely that unless the unthinkable happened william would be posted to a shore establishment in any case if there was a flareup with modern weapons it would be like the falklands so many years ago over very quickly eleven months to the day william spence was leading seaman spence cooks helper aboard the destroyer escort hms peregrine after a very rushed rather peremptory training drill ashore he now found himself aboard one of the latest dd escorts his job one of the least glamorous most important jobs in war to prepare food for convoy under attack to guarantee no matter what the conditions that everyone in the ships company got his natorequired three thousand calories a day for all the destroyers modern technology hot meals were as the cook quickly explained illadvised at most and sheer bloody impossible in the maelstrom of an engagement hot stoves soup tubs spilling despite their gimbals mountings steaming coffee and tea that would burn and ovens that unattended could cause a fire as lethal as any missile yet if morale was to be kept up food was fundamental providing the highsugar highadrenaline level necessary for any kind of sustained battle william spence had heard but seen little of rs action against the trawlers apart from the bridgewing lookouts no one was permitted on ships decks the millimeter gun and the australian ikara subrocs going off along with the limbo depthcharge mortar unloading its deadly ordnance off the stern of the seventhousandton ship the bristolclass destroyer her twin funnels astern behind the rotary bar radar her telltale markings had fired her millimeter at two of the trawlers but her angle in the close pack of the convoy prevented her from launching torpedoes after the sinking of the russianmanned trawlers the men who did not have their stations overlooking the well deck and so had not see the carnage of broken bodies adrift in the icy waters of the atlantic were the only ones who were hungry but the cook a chief petty officer assured william spence that later that night when the others shock of seeing their first dead men wore off they would be ravenous especially if the big fish came william spence didnt get the connection torpedo attack explained the cook nights still the worst time fancy radar or no and if that happens itll be bloody mayhem laddie ship darkened cic dimmed so you make sure youve piles of boxed sandwiches and keep those thermos cups bunched ready to go in the elastic basket we go into search or evasive pattern this tubll be swinging from starboard to port port to starboard so fast itll make your head spin and itll last hours and no onions or garlic old manll go spare cant abide em hardly haute cuisine chief said spence the cook had seen many a recruit come and go but there was something more likable about spence than most perhaps it was his unabashed naïveté an eagerness that assumed the best in everyone he met and the cherubic face that was in stark contrast with the saltleathered scowls he got at times in the mess not all of them like johnson who was peeling spuds for the freezer were volunteers like spence and that yank bloke we have aboard said the cook nato liaison fella no marmite for him they dont understand it cant say im mad about it myself smiled spence ah said johnson puts hair on your chest right chiefie iron in the old pecker said johnson cock stiffener spence blushed the cook said nothing they were sending him choirboys they were all keen and woefully inexperienced in the ways of the world but unlike some of his ilk the chief cook aboard hms peregrine took no delight in watching the transition from recruit to leading seaman never mind him said the cook pushing the big thirtytwoonce jar of black beef extract spread toward spence just dont put it on till youve made all the other sandwiches most crew dont like it when its been sitting around too action stations the cooks voice was drowned out as the sound of the alarm and men running grabbing life jackets asbestos balaclavas and gloves thumped quickly through the guided missile destroyer in an instant the high whine of abrupt startstop electric motors could be heard bringing weapons into line with radar guidance peregrine heeled sharply to starboard at thirty knots the flare of her bows lost in a gossamer of spray phosphorescent with plankton william spence could hear the sudden dump dump dump of the millimeter and then the hardrunningfaucet sound of the ikara torpedomissile peregrine turning so violently to port that coffee spat out of the hot twin silex pots that had been shoved hard against their metal guards a sub said johnson either very brave or feigning indifference yes said the cook a sub and youd better get on with it soon as youve finished with that lot you can put them in the freezer give spence here a hand with the sandwiches johnson was getting mad as he was forced to hold hard on to the sink as the ship rose bucked hard astarboard and fell through a bellywrenching slide into a deep trough only the british bloody navy would have you peeling potatoes on the yank boats ships corrected spence goodnaturedly more in the way one might help a friend rather than criticize quite right lad said the chef ship ship shit whats the difference we arent sailors i didnt join up to peel the peregrine now bashed its way through a wave the heavy spray like fine rain above them the second escort a lump against moontinted sea a quarter mile to port spattern said spence but the chef was looking at johnson handing him back the scraper hed dropped in the heavy sharp roll thats where youre wrong johnson we are sailors without food lad this ship cant function he handed johnson another potato all right then johnson grunted besides continued the cook if you cant take a joke you shouldnt have joined i didnt said johnson his tone turning surly it was either this or a year in the nick what for asked the cook spence was amazed hed never actually seen a real live criminal before let alone worked next to one i found some silver said johnson defiantly where asked the cook in a house where else whats done is done said the cook unscrewing a peanut butter jar face going red just so long as we dont have any silver missing around here because continued the cook handing the jar to spence if we find anything missing well cut your bloody twinkie off like one of them ayatollahs right spence spence didnt know what to say well it doesnt matter anyway does it johnson continued unrepentant swinging the french fry cutter toward him i mean were all for davy jones he saw spences alarm and smiled yeah thats right mate food for the fucking fishes we are what flamin chance ave we got next to one of them russian subs you answer me that the ship was slowing down the bell signaling endofaction and standby stations see said johnson waving his peeler in the general direction of the combat information center in the heart of the ship they dont know whats fucking going on probably just a drill said the cook johnson tossed another potato into the bucket you know how many miles weve got to go yet he asked them ominously next couple of days said william the americans will take over midway point oh said johnson i see once the yanks take over well be all right dont you know well be taking their convoy back spence didnt reply johnson seemed so jaded about everything that no matter what you said hed pick fault with it you married spence asked johnson no im not actually well actually said johnson its just as well no widow the cook shifted off the safety sleeve on the automatic meat slicer then swung it around johnsons grooved face distorted in its shining surface stow it said the cook he was the boss of the galley and preferred informal rules despite the british navys long tradition of tar and feathers but when yobbos like johnson started upsetting people unnecessarily then he was prepared to pull rank for a second johnson said nothing and in the uneasy silence the cook thought of his wife and two children teenagers in portsmouth and ruminated on the fact of how things had changed oh thered always been the shipboard whiners like johnson as long as hed been in the navy but he couldnt have imagined a rating daring to speak with such a defeatist streak in him since the first day out fortunately for every johnson out there he hoped believed there were two or three spences otherwise it was going to be a long grumpy business in peregrines crews mess it wasnt only johnson that he wondered about with nato there were foreigners you had to cater to a yank or two at the table usually one would like his meat rare and a sprinkling of scandinavians all blond and looking as if they had just been skiing and there were dutch hippies who smoked a lotnot always tobacco mateand had everybody wondering whether when push came to shove theyd be up to it democratic disease the chef had explained to young spence and the krauts of course always liked the british ships best more beer rations spence was too friendly too young really to be on a ship with all these other blokes and always asking questions what wine was best with this and that and the cook telling him no wine was any bloody good on ship because everything ended up getting sloshed and corked anyway wait till the wars over laddie the cook had finally told him get this lot down pat and next thing youll find yourself on some shore establishment doing the hors doeuvres for the admirals party but william spence had a theory that if he could learn to make dishes for everyone for all the sixteen nationalities in nato coming from all kinds of different backgrounds then hed have a head start when he was demobbed he had told the cook that hed started a list of what wines did travel best now that surely had to be of use if you were going into the cruise trade after the war sometimes spences zeal just plain wore the cook down but he tried not to dampen the kids enthusiasm hed seen too many go the other way maybe the kid had a point about the wines as nowadays they were trying all new bottling techniques anyway in any case the cook knew the boy had the gift of all great chefs organization being the cook of hms peregrine one of britains star hitech destroyers the chief petty officer had seen hundreds come and go through his charge and hed known many of them who could cook meals that youd never forget but he hadnt met many who could do that and who also possessed the ability to pace themselves never to have one dish rushing in the wake of another or too far apart but just to appear naturally and always but always at the right temperature thats where art came in now when youve finished with those spuds johnson said the cook i want you to put this vitamin c on them before you start the next lot stops them going brown said william the vitamin c i fucking know that said johnson he sprinkled the vitamin c around and tied the heavy plastic bag with double twist good as dead he said subs thats what we need this surface shit is a crock weve got subs said spence before the chef could tell johnson to shut up nine said johnson jesus christ the russians have hundreds so have the americans answered william right joined in the cook you know said johnson his hand grabbing the cold stove rail as peregrine climbed up out of a trough know what asked william spence feeling a little seasick in the closedoff and overheated air that was being recycled through the galley moscows only got to move all their crap down the road yanks have to move their shit across the whole friggin atlantic you should be in comedy johnson said the cook nonchalantly youve missed your vocation laddie we ought to send you round to the hospitals we ought they could do with a cheery bastard like you havent you heard of rollover asked spence challengingly oh cor spare me will you rollover yes said william spence we roll over them just push through johnson finished peeling the potato stared at it for a moment and let it crash to the bottom of the bucket rollover beethoven you sound like one of those fucking admirals they do the rolling we do the over what would you do then id leave it up to the yanks and the russians their war not ours but were part of nato said spence listen mate in this world its everyone for himself nato tato who gives a shit he was using the peeler as a pointer you dont look after number one sweetheart nobody will perhaps you should have gone to jail instead said spence the first time the cook had heard spence angry now that rejoined johnson is the first bright idea youve had sunshine then why didnt you because ducky johnson savagely extracted a rotten spot from the potato i didnt know some silly bastardd start shoving did i he moved the bucket of potatoes over toward the sink well now i know and im telling you mate any friggin thing hits this ship and im first off beaufort raft and all the cook heard the buzz on the bridgetomess intercom and as he picked it up wondered whether he should put johnson on report right yes sir right away sir he clipped the phone back on its cradle sandwiches and coffee to the bridge corned beef and lettuce for the old man no pickles he paused before giving spence the plastic tray checking that all the indents for cups plates and so forth were spotlessly clean sub pack ahead of us how far asked spence trying not to sound frightened a ways off yet said the cook but itll be a long night ahead of us boys what did i bloody tell you said johnson i thought our mob were supposed to knock em off up near fuckin greenland with all the superduper mines we planted down there christ now were in for it during the trawlers mine attack on r and rs defense ocean noise was such that it shook the fine instrumentation of sonar buoys and towed arrays for thousands of miles by sheer chance it provided a noise cover that seemed heavensent by the soviet sub pack approaching the giuk choke points in two groups the first group was heading for the greenlandiceland gap close in to the extended ice sheet using it as added protection against which asroc and other antisubmarine warfare missiles could not penetrate other than by blowing themselves up the second group of seventy subs using the static and a heavy sea for cover was going for the faeroeiceland gap natos mines in both the narrow greenlandiceland gap and the icelandfaeroe gap had been beaten by the soviet subs who with the help of the walker spy ring secrets had found out how to best baffleor alter their noise signaturessimilar to altering sounds from a car but once through the icefree icelandfaeroe gap the submarines were detected through thermal patching the soviets comones computercontrolled emission systems not being nearly as sophisticated as the americans here the russians luck ran out and there was a terrible slaughter prigotovitsya vsplytprepare for surfacing was one of the oftrepeated phrases that morning of the nato attack on the russian northern fleet protected by fiiias ravens from upper haywood and the norwegian bases natos nimrods came out of scotlands kinross air station with searchwater radar and aerialrelease depth bombs the american lockheed searchandattack vikings with infrared sensors magnetic anomaly detectors and homing torpedoes closed with thirty f sea eagles out of keflavik the attack spread out from the shallow milewide gap to wyville thomas ridge two hundred miles south where the water depth increased to two thousand meters it was the high as one of the viking pilots put it of all their years in nato as one soviet captain after another ordered prepare to surface nineteen subs eleven nuclear and four dieselelectrics were outright kills and four forced to the surface white smoke pouring out of them high into the pristine air their crews having no alternative but to ditch into the icecold arctic waters some managed to get rafts inflated in time to drag themselves halffrozen aboard but it was the first time since world war ii that the russian navy at least its submarine branch had come under such attack and proved so wanting the american vikings underwing ecm electronic countermeasures worked superbly well not only in jamming the russians snoop tray radars but also in feeding the submarine force and its russian battle group false overthehorizon echoes this caused two of the soviet asw helo carriers to fire cruise missiles at empty air and one of the tangoclass subs to send back an advisory burst message that was picked up by two of the vikings thus identified the submarine never stood a chance as a mark torpedo streaked through the water at twentyfive meters a second its explosion rupturing two of the tangos forward watertight compartments torpedo room and crews mess the sub driving nosefirst to the bottom its implosion registered by a sea king helo from hmas invincible like bloody clapham junction said one nimrod bombadier after the fourth sub had gone down neither the turkish nor greek nato radar operators two nationalities that normally would never share the same console had heard of the british rail choke point in london that was notorious for terrible train crashes but both turk and greek operators knew what he meant carnage it was on a scale predicted by only a few of the sonar experts who in the notsocold war had gone hunting pinging the russians until they withdrew in confusion because of inferior sonar the public relations assistant to cinchan commander in chief channel forces in northwood uk handed admiral newsome the information in a jubilant mood its all coming home to roost sir what is soviets deficiencies we knew their sonar was bad butwell no matter how many ssns they have subs arent much use to them if they dont know precisely where we are the admiral knew this and he also knew the other soviet deficiencies inferior repair facilities and not nearly the same number of overseas bases or coastal listening stations as the americans had the admiral also knew that the nato forces had been lucky the absence of large numbers of russian fighters due to soviet surge tactics now being used on germanys central front had allowed the british nimrods and american vikings to go about their sub killing unmolested the russians having concluded correctly that if they won western europe quickly enough the nato sea lines would be rendered useless consequently the admiral did not share his aides mood of exhilaration we can both see and detect one anothers battle groups from four hundred miles away the assistant was explaining to a member of the press admitted only on the understanding that all details of the battle would then be quashed the admirals assistant was explaining to the newspaperman that while both the soviets and americans at times did have comparable earlywarning radar on their fixedwing planes and helicopters the american carriers were so potent in terms of air cover that they could search four times the area as their soviet counterparts in any given time frame it was an enormous advantage and it now became clear to cinchan in northwood and acne allied commander northern europe in kolsas norway why in the prewar years the soviets developed an obsession with shadowing any allied ship they could often using their fishing trawlers it had been an attempt to make up for their lack of bases on the continental shelves which the americans possessed the soviets had been shadowing the nato ships in those years not just for information about size and armament but really operating as seaborne earlywarning stations in the event of war yes conceded the admiral looking over at the chart of the north atlantic theyve taken a drubbing all right but that doesnt preclude a trap they know they have inferior search capabilities question is gentlemen what do they have in mind to compensate for it what are they up to he reached over the broad map of the north atlantic his hand brushing the milewide icelandfaeroe gap had the russians feinted here on the western flank while using the unusually extended summer ice sheet as a roof to slip their best subs through the greenlandiceland gap to the west natos bombs and torpedoes couldnt penetrate the ice other than by blowing holes in it which pack ice quickly refilled using one choke point to take punishment one to slip their right flank past us dividing our force rather a bad mauling for a trap i should think suggested newsomes pr assistant a commander who rumor had it had risen very quickly because hed married another admirals daughter the commander glanced at the tally sheet of the eleven nuclear subs sunk nine were alfa iiclass nuclear attack boats out of leningrads sudomekh yard with titanium alloy hulls for deep water a submerged speed of over forty knots and fifteen thirtymile homing torpedoes the alfa ii was the rollsroyce of the russian attack boats the commander was telling the reporter that the alfa could dive below the crush depth of most other subs including many of the americans does the depth make that much difference to a torpedo asked the reporter i thought those marks could get anything they can old boy problem is if you get deep enough youre much safer at three thousand feet they can even beat our caesar network he meant the north atlantic section of the sosus network and admiral newsome was getting tired of him perhaps he was promoted because he was married to an admirals daughter god help us thought newsome if he gets to flag rank the officer of the day walked in and the pr commander gave him the tally sheet with the same bonhomie with which hed been nattering away to the reporter bloodied their nose a bit the admiral was frowning still looking worriedly at the giuk gap eyes flitting back between the shallow shelf about iceland and down toward the deeper labrador and newfoundland basins a lot of water to hide in there the ood looked down the score sheet letting out a low whistle joining the commanders spirit of celebration it was as if theyd both sunk the lot themselves seventeen he said i say freddie well done yes said the admiral without looking up that only leaves a hundred and thirtysix the two commanders looked at each other abashedly as the admiral continued you mustnt get caught up too much in the numbers freddie dont want to damper your enthusiasm i understand its a good start eleven nuclear subs would mean crippling the uk fleet or any other european power for that matter but remember the russians lost twenty million in world war two a colossal number of tanks and ships mainly given them by the americans of course point im making is its a big country an enormous country it can absorb big losses what we have to worry about is those blighters who got through here under the ice the admiral told the reporter hed have to excuse them when the reporter had gone newsome asked the ood to tap in the intercept vectors given the soviet subs average rate of speed fortytwo knots for the ssns seventeen for the diesels lets have a vector first for the nuclear subs alone nuclear subs the ood entered the information into the computer east of the labrador sea approaching the edge of the basin five hundred miles south of greenlands kap farvel english designations said admiral newsome he was a stickler for the use of english in nato some horrible mistakes had been made because of similarsounding names ah yes sorry sir thats five hundred miles southeast of cape farewell yes well i just hope it wont be farewell for our first convoy said the admiral lets have the vector for the diesels will you behind him he could hear the array of computers and telexes as the nato commands were feeding in not only results of the naval battle at the icelandfaeroe gap but the sitreps in western europe fourteen sovietwarsaw pact divisions had broken through on the north german plain and were now attacking the low countries into belgium toward the channel ports if they werent pushed back where the hell would the nato convoys from the united states dock france still hadnt come in dieselelectrics fiftyfive hours at least unless they run on the surface unlike the nuclear boats of course theyd pick up a few knots on surface anywhere from two to five knots that could put them ahead some i hardly think theyll risk open running proffered the commander i agree said admiral newsome theyll keep the diesels for a return convoy i suspect if we have any bloody ports left in europe by then well if they do sir said freddie id say theyre asking for trouble being diesels theyll need service boats and we could pick them off like ducks they have snorkels the admiral reminded him of course sir i wasnt thinking of the snorkels giving them away but refuelings another business then they really are sitting ducks sir twenty thousand miles on one tank freddy those chaps can go a long way before they need to come up for refueling whats this three lib asked newsome pointing to the printout well theyre too slow to hit convoy r sir if thats what youre worried about cant do much about the r now freddie too far south afraid its on its own chapter fortyone in the pentagon chief of staff general gray was on the telephone with the president the chief executives question was can we hold the taegu perimeter i honestly dont know mr president replied gray the seventh fleet is in a much better position now to strike the peninsula but the weathers not so good the next question was how did bad weather affect smart bombs infrared guided missiles and so forth theyre superb mr president but as yet we cant be sure were hitting enemy targets the nka are continuing to move rapidly and they have civilians on the munitions trains as well if we could restrain some of the television networks and press photographers from showing refugees holding up signs and i want uptodate contingency plans for withdrawal general as well as for reinforcement national security council meeting is at fourthirty very good sir general gray had a plan for both situations but each one as everything else depended on securing safety of movement between japan and korea and the seventh fleet was busy fending off incoming attacks from nka migs from fields so close to the yalu the chinese border that they might as well have been in china itself but the fighter pilots of the seventh fleet understood that to cross the yalu was to invade china grays aide a major from logistics and supply came in with more messages from the taegu perimeter till now theyd been decoded automatically and piped in onto the tv map screen overlay on his wall gray took the sheaf of paper president wants to know major if we should cut our losses and run or reinforce thats not the way he put it but thats what he means apart from the military position both gray and the major knew a lot of careers now hung in the balance gray was looking at the worldwide distribution of forces from fighter bases in japan to awacs with the us third fleet headquarters in hawaii from which he could move at least one carrier to subic bay in the philippines and guam where communist mortar attacks had wreaked havoc among the bs but there was no way he could tap any of the resources tagged for europe with the east german and russian divisions still pouring through the fulda gap and engaged in broad sweeping armored thrusts south and north he simply did not have the forces available from either third marine division in japan or from the third fleet to do a macarthur to buy time for the twenty thousand americans and fortysix thousand rok forces and many thousands more of refugees from yosu to taegu to buy time and to try another day that was his plan maybe doug freeman has some ideas suggested the major that letter that he sent you about predicting the sovietwarsaw pact breakout was right on the button gray grunted fighting his tendency to withhold praise from subordinates that might dim his own halo well they werent simultaneous breakouts yes well he had the general plan right i suppose no use to us now however the general was exhausted after having slept only two or three hours in the last twentyfour his petty reluctance to give credit to freeman for the spoton prediction about europe told gray he was more fatigued than usual doug freemans a good infantry and tank man airbornequalified to boot but hes still a colonel because he talks too much always telling people what he would do isnt freemans tank corps in new york asked the major waiting for the convoy to europe there was a pause you send for him asked gray not so tired he couldnt smell a setup hes at the washington hotel you think i should see him it wouldnt hurt general dougs record at the war college was outstanding yes i know thinks hes patton resurrected you know what hes got in his tank the major was tempted to answer a tiger but didnt risk it a onetwentymillimeter i hope he answered got a goddamned index card in the commanders cupola has you have three minutes to surrender in ten different languages yes i heard something about that conceded the major only i thought it was in every tank oh it is he does spot checks every loader and gunner in the battalion has to know them otherwise its a fiftydollar fine well hes confident all right funny thing is the general ruminated for a second ive seen him on social occasions with his wife when we were in california perfect gentleman wouldnt think he had an ego big as one of his ms when he came in the door at colonel freeman was carrying his map case of the european central front he had a plan for a counterattack from the jutland peninsula following an amphibious landing northwest of kiel supported by b bomber strikes out of southeast anglia he was shocked by general grays appearance the chief of staffs eyes so dark from fatigue it looked as if his nose had been broken as they shook hands and gray gave him a peremptory smile freeman thought the general needed a damned good tonic and he had it in his map case you know major wexler gray introduced him to his aide of course but there was more a professional than personal tone to freemans greeting and gray recalled freemans terse response to the circular sent out by wexler notifying officers of the possibility of the supreme court ruling in the near future that other than submarine duty women might be permitted a wider range of combat roles goddamn it freeman had written back no room to piss inside a tank except in your helmet let alone having a woman in there major wexler had responded that as women had been dealing with such problems for years he had no doubt that if as colonel freeman had put it his men werent allowed to stop to have a peethey just did it in their helmets threw it out and kept on fighting the female members of a tank crew would find this a great motivator to win battles quickly hes a smartass that wexler freeman had told his wife a washington smartass douglas continued general gray major wexler here was struck by your prescient abilities regarding the sovietwarsaw pact invasion of europe he pulled your file and suggested we call you in the change in freemans manner was dramatic the smile now genuine for a man who even if he didnt agree with freeman about not having women in tanks hadnt let it cloud his ability to see a brilliant tactical mind at work yes i remember the major well good to see you douglas gray informed him i read your letter and i must say i was a little surprised at it not coming through regular channels freeman grinned i didnt think that would surprise you at all sir after all you were the one who taught me about initiative i figured if i sent it by regular post last thing a commie agent would think of is trying to penetrate our mail service it being such a ballsup gray motioned him to a chair with men dying as he spoke he was in no mood for another one of freemans harangues about the mail service freeman had once suggested that the postal service be run along military lines any letter not delivered anywhere in the united states within four days would render all employees in the post office liable to a fiftydollar fine douglas i have to tell you up front your manner is considered extremely abrasive by many of your colleagues and especially by the state department by all accounts your record militarily speaking shows you should have had your first star two years ago freeman was wearing a scowl but nodding he could feel possibility in the air if he could only keep his cool yes sir i understand that but ive goddamn it douglas let me finish the figures on the tv screen of wounded and missing were changing getting worse especially on germanys central front in one hour continued gray i have to present a contingency plan to the president at that meeting there might well be several more members of the cabinet than usual transport and communications secretary included military needs their help if were to have these nato convoys loaded and shipped out on time so i dont want you getting anyones dander up unnecessarily youre a firstclass tank and infantryman douglas and god knows we need more like you im giving you a chance to show your stuff but if any questions are directed at you remember youre not randolph c scott i think you mean george c scott general what oh yes christ douglas thats precisely what i mean its not freeman affected a lot of people this way bringing out the fight in them at the drop of a hat it was precisely what was needed in battle wexler knew but deadly to smooth sailing in washington randolph scotts fine with me general said freeman flashing a smile the general was shaking his head surprised at his own reaction to freemans personality the tank commander seemed to carry a charge in the air about him that stirred up everything it passed what i need douglas in simple straightforward termsis a plan for a tactical withdrawal from at the word withdrawal freeman stiffened all sense of humor his earlier air of accommodation gone from europe general this would be catastrophic what no goddamn it korea grays aide looked quickly at freeman was he as good on his feet with an entirely new situation thrown at him freeman stared at general gray may i smoke no well freeman swung his hard gaze up to the green fluorescent map of korea as if it were an assassin towering over him daring him to risk a career gray was telling him the situation was much worse than the newspapers or anybody else outside the pentagon had presented it but whether freeman had heard him or not the general didnt know freeman taking out his bifocals leaning forward looking past the casualty figures at troop dispositions in the yosutaegu perimeter how uptodate is this intelligence sir satellite answered gray turning to wexler realtime or delayed realtime general air superiority asked freeman not as yet holding our own but thats about all hope to get better as the seventh fleet moves further north but europe gets first call on everything freeman was tapping the series of half dozen or so red lights flashing on the big screen on japans west coast from shikoku to hokkaido whats this air strikes yes japanese fighters are doing well but their main function is defense and they havent the carriers combat time off the north korean coast is very short now freeman pointed to the position of the seventh fleet steaming north midway between south korea and japans main island of honshu he zeroed in on the cluster of blips behind the seventh fleet reinforcements yes nine corps its based in japan hmm responded freeman soft in the belly too much sushi and pussy they wont last wexler looked across at the general who calmly responded well the third marine division is part of the reinforcements too well thats good news problem is we might not have any perimeter left by the time they get there those newspaper reports right about the nka using some of our captured m tanks afraid so goddamn it thats sacrilege freeman shook his head like a medieval bishop might upon hearing his church had been sacked by vandals course the trouble is were not up against hitler here this toad wont hold back the tanks hell drive us right into the sea if he can which i suspect hes close to doing right now well kims no fool said gray whatever else you might think of him george cahill found that out when freeman stood up his stature growing in the reflection of the big screen hell no general i didnt mean general kim hes runofthemill commie trash learned all he knows in beijing where its all numbers just keep pushing the bastards at you and in moscow echelon attack with the tanks no i mean kim il sungs progeny hes bloodcrazy killing all those people like that in rangoon civilians blowing up women and children in airliners we should have shot that bastard long time ago then you think withdrawals the best bet douglas dont be afraid to say so everyone else heres come to the same conclusion freeman stood back from the screen eyes moving quickly up to korea to japan to manchuria down to korea again no sir i do not concur then colonel youre a minority of one freeman took off his bifocals grinning broadly as he slipped them back into his top pocket i know general i know you seem pleased freemans smile was gone i dont like being beaten general not by anyone and specially not by that goddamned psycho little runt needs a good kick in the ass freeman held up his hand as if halting oncoming traffic general i dont mean to be disrespectful im sure you understand that but would it be too out of line to say that the policies of the majority of the general staff got us into this situation gray said nothing the screen flickered again and the perimeter had grown smaller the nka spearheads however reportedly stopping to draw breath before the final assault or was it freeman wondered that the hardpressed usrok headquarters in pusan had decided to give up a little territory in return for a smaller tighter perimeter either way it was shrinking dangerously freeman had his bifocals out again using them as a pointer on the screen kims supply line he announced pointing at taegu on the western side of the sobaek mountains which ran northsouth between taegu and seoul airborne attacks general here at taegu where they have to haul freight through high country and further up at taejon halfway down from seoul this toad has got too big a mouth and not enough belly general grabs more than he can hold hes overrun so much territory damn near two hundred miles in a little over ten days thats why hes cannibalizing everything he can thats why hes using the ms they cant maintain sophisticated equipment like that havent got our ground support technical backup theyre using oxen carts to move half how do you know that interjected general gray oxen carts new york times wexler looked out the window at the potomac and continued freeman thats why hes raping the goddamned countryside feed em as you go well hes getting a lot of civilian support id say put in gray dont buy it general well i do were not seeing any scorchedearth policy from the satellite photos all the fires are the result of military action hes getting help from south koreans douglas i know that mightnt be palatable but you of all people surely arent blind to the disagree general freemans bifocals were sweeping the air that fink is getting support because the son of a bitch has had over fifty years to plan underground networks right across the country all his goddamned spies doing the spade work hes getting food and water from those civilians same way as napoleon did in dubrovnik in the balkan campaign thats why other than uijongbu and seoul youre not seeing too many cities on fire in the satellite photos like napoleon sent his boys ahead infiltrated the city city fathers did a deal well feed you leave our city and us alone quid pro quo thats why you can still walk around the walls of dubrovnik message gets out fast but we hit him with those airborne attacks just when he least expects it and well get civilian support as well everyone knows the americans come back we didnt in vietnam put in wexler by christ began freeman thats because we put up with that fonda woman and all her cronies when she sat on that nva gun and told our boys they were war criminals for bombing those sons of bitches we shoulda dropped her from a b right in the middle of the goddamned as soon as the bs are patched up in guam interjected gray then we wont have to use any troops at all we can go in and bomb his supply lines and no time general thats what the board tells me thats what youre telling me isnt it no time nothing more we can scrounge from natodesignated supplies besides kims no dummy he might overextend his supply line almost everyone does when he gets the bit in his mouth sees the other side hightailing it but its my guesstimate general that hes just about shot his wad biggest mistake he made was destroying that oil pipeline outside of taegu caused us a lot of damage but now hes got no oil for a while at least oh hell hold but he wont be advancing for a week or two his supply lines are well over two hundred miles south of pyongyang now i say chop it in two at the places ive indicated and well stop him for a week or two instead of a few days give us time to rush troops into that perimeter is the strip at pusan operational he looked at wexler its rough but its operational hell even if it isnt we could ferry a lot of hercules across from southern japan under seventh fleet umbrella in twentyfour hours use pallet if they cant land around the clock christ thats what were best at but he held his finger up the coup de grace gentlemen clear an air corridor for me up here his hand shot north of the seventh fleets battle group beyond the brown spine of the taebaek range and ill turn this thing around christ ill take prisoners he was pointing deep into north korea at pyongyang general gray sat still for several seconds leaning forward in his chair you have any idea of the casualties douglas i mean what would you expect seventy eighty percent gray glanced quickly across at wexler then back at freeman douglas i think the seventh fleet could give you that corridor for five or six hours anyway enough time for your air jumps but to lose men at that rate is simply unacceptable general said freeman his voice even unhurried well lose sixty times that number if that perimeters punctured we general gray said we wont be losing our lives douglas itll be the men in those choppers and hercules that will freeman was stunned i assumed id be in command general freemans audacity left general gray speechless youre a colonel douglas this would be brigade sir said freeman i think we can solve that problem right here and now how promote me gray looked across at wexler who was biting his lip the president said wexler would have to authorize it freeman wasnt sure whether gray meant the promotion or the plan but quickly cut in im sure he will general gray shook his head and looked down at his watch douglas you wouldnt by any chance know the korean phrase for you have three minutes to surrender would you sampun inaeē hangpokhae chapter fortytwo in the rough ballet of the salt lake citys flight deck danger was everywhere the seventh fleets battle groups heart was the carrier itself and the heart would need protection from aerial and sub attack to provide early warning propdriven hawkeye awacs their rotodomes giving degree sixtytargetatonce capability were already in the air together with the relatively slow but longrange and effective grumman a intruders each of these armed with twentyeight fivehundredpound bombs and sophisticated antisubmarine detection and attack systems the intruders periscopic booms for inflight refueling glinted in the late afternoon sun as they passed over the advance screen of destroyers and frigates that surrounded the seventh fleet on its mission to secure the integrity of the sea lanes from japan to koreas east coast in other words to tell the soviet eastern fleet it came south at its peril aboard the carrier as one hawkeye awac was pushed off the elevator amid the scream of jets and hundreds of other pieces of equipment crewmen in padded brown vests were already unfolding the planes wings its pilot engaging the hydraulic line that lifted the twothousandpound pancake dome from flat storage to raised position in the cramped rear of the plane its three moles electronic warfare operators were already going through their preflight checks amid banks of consoles it all seemed chaotic to any new men on the ship but out of the six thousand sailors aboard the carrier those who worked the flight deck had of necessity to develop the ability to work calmly yet quickly in the sustained roar of sound yet stay attuned to alarms of their own equipment in conditions where one missed step or the slightest reduction in concentration could cost a man his life it was a world of screaming engines of planes taking off and coming in flashing lights rising steam from catapults hot stinking engine exhausts and a maze of hand signals from different colored jackets a world of hookup chains and mule tractors inside the carriers island to starboard it was less noisy but every bit as stressful as anticollision teams in primary flight control or prifly had to know where any plane on their computer screen was at any moment while staying in contact with the pilots as they were guided in by flight deck control as the pilot of one of the returning hawkeyes brought his aircraft down in the controlled crash the navy calls a landing its hook seeking the two wire or arrester cable the hawkeyes twin allison turboprops were roaring at full power the planes flaps down ready to lift off if his alignment or any one of a hundred other things was not right the pilots concentration was on centering his plane in the meatball the big orangelit mirror on the carrier if it came in sight he was halfway there if he saw the meatball arrangement of lights was too low he would have to ease the nose up to center and maybe go for the three wire he saw the meatball was askew a green jersey a on its back turned and waved a no go in a split second the lso landing signal officer pushed the button for vertical red cutting through the meatball sending the hawkeye screaming past the island as the pilot kicked in maximum power pulling the plane off the deck with only inches to spare the three wire was showing a stress split visible to only one of the catapult and arresting crew whose thick ear protectors and jersey disappeared momentarily in the cloud of kerosene exhaust and salt particles that flew up from the deck stinging his face the hawkeye climbing a blast deflector now going up on the starboard catapult in preparation to launch a jet fighter to begin its patrol even as the hawkeye was turning for the rerun as the hawkeye banked its rotodome a golden disc in the fading sunlight another awac its greenjerseyed catapult crew sliding under and attaching the restraining and launch bridle forward and aft of the fuselage before scrambling away readied for takeoff as more awacs bunched up behind it the control tower unforgiving in its insistence that at least three launches lead time had to be maintained the unlettered green jerseys of the specialist technicians or troubleshooters could be seen nearby through the quivering heat curtain in the event that any of the planes electronic components suddenly needed replacing by slidein slideout black box units the carriers commander seeing the fighter was ready and receiving confirmation of no obstacles on deck signaled clear deck landing light is red sir repeated the executive officer in the tower very well turning takeoff to green said the captain pushing the button for the harsh metallic tweedle sound warning takeoff is green captain very well now the captain pushed the backup horn whose sound was so powerful it blasted its way through the line of roaring waiting awacs above the whining elevator bringing up more planes and could even be heard by the fiveman crew of the orangesilver rescue helo the rotodome of the hawkeye about to be launched was a platinum disc under a partially cloudy sky its pilot showed two fingers signaling he was approaching full power the propellers made of fiberglass to protect the planes radar from metallicinduced doppler effect were now two black blurs the pilot his cockpit already splattered with sea spray saw the yellowclad catapult officers knee drop left hand tucked close in behind and against his back right leg low right arm thrust forward and seaward the catapult shooter pressed the button and one deck below the controller let her go the force of the release throwing the plane aloft and leaving a long trail of steam rolling back over the carriers deck the hawkeyes pilot was already flying his zigzag pattern at low level to prevent any enemy awacs detecting his takeoff and thereby pinpointing the carriers position down in the pilots ready room the tv monitors were giving the pilots of the tomcats uptotheminute weather information for the first of the patrols that would begin to clear the corridor for general freemans threepronged attack to be launched from the saipan and other lphs landing platform helicopters in salt lake citys battle group why the hell dont they just bomb the shit out of the supply lines asked one of the pilots get some of those bs up from guam thatll cut their supply line fast frank shirer one of the f tomcat leaders was idly flipping over old magazines glancing now and then at the monitors his would be one of the last of the patrols not due to go out until early next morning before dawn but often offduty pilots would sit in on another briefing merely to get the feel of the weather and bone up on any added information that might come in handy the weather was deteriorating visibility having dropped from thirtyfive to ten miles heavy cumulus in places freezing level twenty thousand so why dont we bomb the crap out of them with the bfus he meant the big fat uglies the bs shirer twentyseven but looking older dropped an old newsweek its cover bearing the promise of new peace initiatives in the middle east back into the magazine rack it struck him as one of the supreme ironies of this war that the middle east most volatile area of concern before the war was not yet involved at least not directly as it was generally believed that israel was doing what it could to help the west meanwhile it was surrounded by ever stronger arab states wait until we run out of north slope oil from the arctic thought shirer and have to tap the gulf hey major a lieutenant his tomcats rio radar intercept officer asked him again what do you think ever heard of the ho chi minh trail said shirer we dropped more ordnance on those gooks than we did in all of world war two the other pilots were now listening attentively shirer was held in high respect for despite his relatively young age he had been the pilot of one of the three big ton doomsday boeing s on constant alert at andrews air force base outside washington it was a doomsday plane that the president would issue his orders from in the event of a nuclear war shirer was called oneeyed jack aboard the carrier because of the requirement of the doomsday pilot to wear a patch on his left eye so that in the event of a nuclear flash blinding him he would still have one good eye to fly by but at the outbreak of war in korea shirer had immediately requested transfer to a combat wing the truth was that shirer after the initial excitement and prestige of being the presidents pilot had soon become tired of the routine and disillusioned with what he saw as a role of little more than highly paid chauffeur at twentyseven he craved some action and after a while washington had just gotten to be too small a town everybody there had sexint sex intelligence on everyone else not good for the presidents pilot and why he was careful to have it off away from gossip city trouble was that after more than three nights the women always started talking about serious relationships especially with the new aids strain on the march some of them were so businesslike about it in new york two beauties had asked him to have a blood test in their presence to see if he tested positive one of them even had an overthecounter test kit ready put him right off especially when he was prepared to take precautions anyhow so what about ho chi minh major oh supplies kept coming boat oxen you name it disassembled whole artillery pieces and transported them on bamboo poles four guys would carry a wheel for a howitzer air force always thinks you can bomb everything into submission its not just the gooks either more bombs hitler dropped on london more the brits dug in you saying they dont make a difference not saying that but bombers are only part of the triadsea land and air we bombed ho chi minhs city flat till it was nothing but rubble they lived underground you think this freeman guys planll work any better dont know but on the ground you can see more sometimes high techs good but hell you bomb out a bridge next day they float a pontoon link across right next to the old bustedup one sink the pontoon a foot or so and from the air looks like theres nothing there then they move stuff over at night our guysll be wiped out said the rio quite possible shrugged shirer but itll probably buy time thats what its all about anyway we can give em support we can make a difference jesus said another pilot opening a wellthumbed issue of people today flown in with fleet mail the evening before those poor bastards on the blaine the pilot showed the color shots of the frigate in nagasaki and the wounded being unloaded from hospital planes in san diego after the flight from tokyo old man alive asked another pilot stateside said the pilot reading the magazine burned up pretty badly according to this interviews some of his family hey says here his old man was in the navy admiral brothers on an ssn an rio was looking over the pilots shoulder whos the broad his sister man look at this would i like to get into her pants shirer glimpsed the photo and held his hand out for the magazine it looked like her the girl hed met at a washington ballsome military outfit had put it on he couldnt remember her last name though or whether shed said she had a brother on a us frigate taking the magazine he looked at the photo more closely it was her hair all different a more sophisticated look than he remembered the caption said mrs la roche for a moment he was back with her it had been one of the gentler nights she was beautiful and shy and not sure whether she wanted to do it or not but along with the shyness there was a grabbing hunger as if she couldnt wait wanting love but afraid holding back then she got all serious and he had her shed closed her eyes sighing deeply when he kissed her shivering with excitement and fear at the same time and need hed been as tender as he could but it wasnt very good it had soon become evident to shirer that it was her first time and it had turned into a production her grimacing trying not to show the pain but clearly hurting like hell hed eased off and shed been sorry apologetic how she hadnt been fair to him how she felt like a slut he tried fooling around a bit to lighten her up for a repeat run but shed almost freaked out when hed put on the patch theyd gone out a few more times but it didnt seem to work she was too highly strung anyway beautiful and innocent but her sensitivity was too fragile for him to handle now from the photos at least it looked like shed had a bit more experience knew who she was what she wanted shed be great whos this la roche joker he asked glancing through the article her husband some cosmetic poof well shirer answered thats that what dyou mean asked his rio shirer handed back the magazine i mean thats it for the skipper of that frigate oh yeah answered the rio yes sir hes down the toilet shirer was sitting back in the highbacked pilots seat trying to remember the last time hed had a woman felt a hardon coming tried to put her out of his mind but something about it bothered him completely irrational he told himself but somehow he felt as if she should have told him when shed decided to get married but why should she a short brief fling man said another navigator she could sit on my face anytime anywhere look at the board said shirer nodding toward the tv monitors visibility had been cut to near zero about the carrier one of the things that really spooked the pilots though they would never admit it the carrier was no bigger than a postage stamp when you were coming in to hook the wire at several hundred miles an hour it was nerveracking enough when you could see youd better get your minds out of your shorts advised shirer and think about charlie now hes got two things going for him distance and heavy cloud cover he turned to another pilot fisher that drop tank of yours got the release fixed yes sir good the briefing officer came in they stood up and he immediately waved for them to sit down its still on for tomorrow morning well be riding shotgun for the choppers and prowlers and the hercules drop tanks to give us extra time for strafing and rocket attacks the rio called fisher leaned over to his tomcats navigator how the hell did oneeyed jack know wed be using drop tanks the navigator shrugged it meant that they were going in deep a long way inland target sir youll be told later fisher meanwhile i suggest you get some rest with this noise someone asked as the ready room emptied fisher turned to major shirer sir howd you know about the drop tanks shirer looked around so as none of the others could hear i have the knowledge fisher he said tapping his head know what i mean chapter fortythree in western france autumn cast a russet spell over the countryside and poplars were turning halfgolden in the breeze the only sign of war being increased traffic on the road to coquettes as apprehensive frenchmen began lining up for hours waiting their turn in the creeping traffic line heading for england they were not going by rollon rolloff ferries as these had been stopped two days ago when an east german fighter out of control over holland had plummeted into the channel midway between dover and calais there were no injuries the pilot picked up by the calaistodover hovercraft he was not popular however and was roundly booed in several tongues as dripping wet he was fished out of the frigid water and taken to the bridge for safetys sake sitting wrapped in british sea link blankets he was a forlorn figure torn between gratitude for the british having picked him up and anxiety about what would happen to him later on the london tabloids gave prominence to the fighter attack overnight the ferry traffic from france dropped away to a trickle now the twin twentyfivefootdiameter undersea tunnels of the chunnel through which railborne cars passengers and freight trucks moved under the channel from coquelles outside calais to cheriton outside folkestone a distance of thirty miles became the preferred way of crossing it was shortly after am the following day at cheriton when a lorry driver having to leave his truck on the rail wagon because of a false fire alarm arrived in a foul mood at the cheriton terminal agitated and mumbling to himself after having to walk three hundred meters from inside the chunnel he complained bitterly to the british eurotunnel public relations officer on duty this was the third time the lorry driver told the official that thered been a false fire alarm in addition he protested that when he tried to call london on one of the emergency phones inside the chunnel to tell his employer that hed be late the bloody thing wouldnt work hed been jinxed he told them by inefficiency at the beginning of his journey in france his truck had broken down and hed been cursed to kingdom come by damned frogs who were backed up behind him and when hed tried to get help there was no one available at the french terminal if eurotunnel couldnt keep the phones working he charged and provide assistance when needed then they shouldnt have built the bloody chunnel in the first place the british public relations officer did not handle the criticism well insinuating that perhaps the truck shouldnt have been on the road in the first place if it was mechanically unsound this infuriated the driver and the official didnt improve matters by grudgingly telling the driver he could use the office phone but would have to pay for any trunklong distance call to london the driver stormed off saying that he wouldnt use eurotunnels damn phone and was last seen hailing a taxi five and a half minutes later one of the crossservice tunnels connecting the two main traffic tunnels under the channel began to shake as in an earthquake light fixtures popped cement debris began falling and there was an enormous rumbling seven seconds later a huge vomiting stream of rolling fire like a napalm bomb roared out of the chunnel at the cheriton end cars and trucks came spewing out like so many toys as centrex explosive together with the natoplaced wartime contingency explosives collapsed not only the crossservice and ventilation tunnel but the two main rail tunnels as well millions of tons of rock and water cascading in over eight hundred people were killed the newspapers reported that they had been drowned but department of defense coroners ascertained later that most victims had in fact died from the concussion of the explosion even before the tunnel had collapsed for days after bodies were still washing up on the beaches between folkestone and dover many children and pets among them the minister of transport resigned and had it not been for the war conditions in europe the whole government might have fallen following the informal yet traditional rule of ministerial responsibility but with the country at war it was considered essential for national security that the war cabinet stay intact in one blow englands and americas strategic land link with europe had been severed in moscow in stavka the soviet supreme high command former colonel now brigadier kiril marchenko at fiftyfive one of the youngest highranking officers was again receiving congratulations for it had been his plan for spets units to sabotage the chunnel using the lorry attack after marchenkos successful suggestion of putting the far east fleet to sea in order to stabilize the sinosoviet situation around vladivostok and to dissuade the taiwanese navy from adventurism marchenko had risen even higher in the premier suzlovs estimation the destruction of the chunnel would prevent us troops and supplies from disembarking in england and being shuttled to europe now that northern europes ports were being closed by the advancing sovietwarsaw pact shock troops which included marchenkos son sergei at fulda gap but much more important than cutting off the undersea link between britain and the continent the destruction of the chunnel meant that the vital british oil supplies particularly avgas following refinement of crude from the north sea would be cut the idea had first occurred to kiril marchenko when his son sergei who was still pressing for a chance to enter the air forces fighter academy had pointed out that the american ms proglotal guzzled as he put it two gallons of gasoline per mile the fs eight gallons a second and the b bombers burned off twentynine gallons every sixty seconds the us tanks and those of its nato allies would soon deplete their onemonth reserve stockpiles throughout western europe kiril marchenko passed sergeis figures though he knew his son was quite wrong about the bit used more than gallons a minute to a colleague in the soviet air force academy there was no overt pressure marchenko simply mentioning in a conversational tone to the air force academys general that his son sergei was particularly keen on the air force as a career the general said hed make a note of it and had sergeis initial application pulled from central data bank sergei marchenko it seemed had passed all entrance requirements with flying colors except one the vision in his left eye was slightly deficient and not quite up to the standard for fighter pilots but said kiril marchenko upon hearing the news why didnt the interviewing board mention this before he had a colleague who knew one of the top men in the moscow hospital where theyd pioneered laser spot surgery on a mass assembly line why the outpatients could even listen to tapes from beethoven to heavy rock as they were operated on i did not tell you comrade marchenko the general said without a trace of embarrassment because then you were only a major in the stavka if there is a possibility i will let you know in washington it was am and president mayne was in his smaller west wing office which he was using more than the oval office for the daytoday war conferences he refused to go down into the situation room anymore unless it was absolutely crucial for no matter how leakproof he thought his white house staff was the mere suggestion that the president was retiring to the situation room sent tremors through the country neither general gray nor trainor liked the room very much but the president noticed harry schuman looked rather comfortable in it but if so harry schumans contented air was about to be ruffled as the president told gray that although he had given presidential approval for the salt lake city battle group to provide air cover for the airborne attacks on the korean supply line under no circumstances was the battle group to support the taiwanese navy to the south of them general gray did not show it but he was shocked mr president the taiwanese are superbly equipped if they start shelling the mainland theyll have to protect themselves and that will bottle up the chinese nicely keep em off our seventh fleets back while we try to take the pressure off the yosupusan perimeter then mayne astonished not only gray and harry schuman but trainor as well when he announced ive put through a call to beijing this morning to premier lin zhou and i told him that despite any chinese logistical support for north korea i would not authorize an attack on chinese soil if he ceased such logistical support henceforth nor would i endorse or support any such attack on chinese soil by the taiwanese navy and we would actually oppose militarily if need by any such attack by the taiwanese gray could no longer maintain the pretense of calm mr president i must protest in the strongest possible terms in my view he paused sir this is militarily speaking extremely unsound believe me mr president general the soviet union has over a million crack firstline troops i repeat over a million crack troops all along the chinesesoviet border and ten squadrons of migs and migs right now thats just where i want them those jets could be in europe in four hours with or without air refueling and our boys only hope over there is to hang on until we can resupply he paused looking over at trainor how far back now bill ah a withdrawal bulge forty miles west at fulda mr president thirty miles into the ruhr and deep into western germany said mayne now if we cant stall them there general if we cant hold till our convoys start pouring in men and material then were up shit creek and weve lost europe i want you to tell admiral horton categorically that the seventh fleet must step in and if necessary attack any taiwanese incursion air sea or amphibious lin zhou has promised me hell hold back if we do he will not cease making public statements about imperialist aggression on our part but so far as supplies and men go he will not reinforce north korea so long as we hold the taiwanese in reign quid pro quo sir said gray the seventh fleet is about to launch the amphibious attacks on north korea it will soon be dusk in the south china sea what bearing does that have on the taiwanese mr president the fleets going to have its hands full clearing corridors for the airborne attacks without having to worry about general the president said leaning forward an edge to his voice when you people came to me with budgetary requests for updating the aegis system you told me it would be worth it because we could see everything that was going on within a radius of three to four hundred miles thats correct mr president all im saying is that at the moment our maximum concentration has to be on launching general i will not be deterred from this course of action the seventh fleets battle group was specifically designed to handle multiple targets and if necessary crossreferencing missions am i correct yes sir then lets not start making excuses and get on with it very good mr president jesus jesus railed gray to major wexler on his way back to the pentagon always the goddamned same isnt it you let a peace president in and they start thinking theyre goddamned general macarthur my god wexler did not dare remind the general that the president of the united states was after all commander in chief mr president trainor said have you ever read camuss the plague what the president was holding his head the fingers of his left hand strained as they massaged hard above his left eye i think so why theres a character who keeps writing an opening paragraph and in his mind he keeps envisaging the editor receiving his manuscript and being so overwhelmed by it the only thing the editor can do is stand up and say gentlemen hats off well its hats off to you this evening that bit about china its brilliant how did you ever i didnt cut in mayne senator leylands idea oh that make it less impressive said mayne looking up no no not at all i mean at least you made the decision you were for it dont worry about who gets the credit bill bring me a glass of water will you two empracet and two twotwentytwos lights out asked trainor please trainor turned off the light and walking over to the drapes shut out the dawn mayne was already seeing the aura steps covered in shimmering water like the water that used to run down fish shop windows and above it all the most beautiful emerald green hed ever seen it was a warning if he didnt hit it hard now with the codeine tylenol and aspirin the migraine could get a hold and put him out of action for hours sometimes he had nightmares of trainor giantlike looking down at him holding the pills threatening if you dont give me what i want ill leak it personally mayne believed that his determination the ability hed developed to work despite the fierce headaches made him capable of more endurance than most under stress marx had had the headaches so did ulysses s grant the general so sick with one he couldnt sleep while waiting for lees response to his surrender ultimatum mayne tried to remember the last time hed made love with his wife jean chapter fortyfour general kim his divisional headquarters now moved to seoul was pleased when major rhee the interrogation officer from uijongbu brought him the names of the kcias counterespionage chiefs in taegu and pusan which he had gotten from tae but most important of all rhee brought a summons from pyongyang for a personal conference between kim and the nkas dear and respected leader the problem was that some rok bandits had managed to cut communications between kims divisional headquarters and pyongyang since the major had arrived by blowing up one of the microwave relay discs on one of the hills leading down the uijongbu corridor this would soon be remedied of course but kim was in a quandary he had been summoned to pyongyang and it was essential he told the major that our great and respected leader be apprised of the situation in particular the rapid rate of advance if pyongyang does not hear from us they will be concerned that our advance has been halted it is necessary that they hear firsthand that all is proceeding as planned kim did not tell major rhee his secret hope that whenever he returned to pyongyang he would not only be greeted as a national hero even greater perhaps than admiral yi but he would also receive from the leader himself the coveted kim ii sung medal for valor i will unleash the final assault on pusan in fortyeight hours he informed rhee by then all supplies will be in place it is essential i be here however i would also like to explain to the leader himself how taegu will be completely overrun from where we will move quickly to crush pusan kim put another sobrainie into the bone cigarette holder when pusan has fallen he told the major then you will have some mopping up to do as it has developed the names of the counterinsurgency chiefs may pose no more man an academic question after all for i foresee a massive american surrender there will be great honor for the fourth division major rhee said nothing he was sure of the military victory to come but under no circumstances would he be drawn into advising the general on whether or not he should go to pyongyang not to go would be to disappoint their leader it would only take a day there and back but then again kim should be at divisional headquarters when the final drive for pusan began it was a difficult question chapter fortyfive the trawlers had done more damage than admiral woodall or anyone else had realized as before laying the signature mines in the way of the approaching convoy the trawlers had sown a line of pressure and magnetic mines behind them these mines didnt stop r but caused a great deal of confusion as woodall after losing another merchantman retraced his course trying to find a gate in what seemed a moat of mines four attempts and eighteen hours later with three more ships including a destroyer sunk by the mines woodall decided the only way out was to form a long line and plow ahead as would a line of soldiers walking through a minefield following the lead ship as it were conscious that if they kept to the same path the risk of being blown up by a mine would be minimized and that sooner or later the minefield must peter out the dutch glassplastic minesweeper led the file but its magnetic anomaly detectors powerful enough to detect the positions of the magnetic mines were unable to protect against the pressure type which reacted to changes in water pressure caused by the heavier merchantmen passing over soon the minefield designed by the technical experts of the soviet northern fleet merely to delay a convoy long enough for their subs to break out through the greenlandiceland gap ended up destroying almost a third of r including half of the twenty fifteenthousandton container cargo ships by the time r was well out of the mined area they were still thirteen hundred miles north of newfoundlands cape race soviet hunterkillers closing two hundred miles west of the convoy at the same time american relief ships and subs were miles to the south of the convoy heading toward it to take over escort duties for the remaining half of the convoys journey to halifax one of the subs that was heading north but not assigned escort duties was the uss roosevelt robert brentwood was bringing his sub up from a thousand feet to trail his vlf antennae for a burst message which lasting only milliseconds was designed for a position verification for saclant and also for passing on any new instructions to the submarine around the raised periscope island in the combat control center the highly polished brass rail was a ruby sheen the sub rigged for red brentwood listened carefully to the depth readout from the planesman three hundred feettwo fiftytwo hundred one hundred steady at one hundred the subs props were now stilled the roosevelt suspended a hundred feet below the surface very well said brentwood stand by to extend vlf standing by with vlf sir extend three hundred extending three hundred sir ten twenty thirty forty brentwood was watching the sonar blips from the roosevelts builtin hydrophones the noise of the oilsmooth vlf aerial extending out from behind the sub was audible to the hydrophones but the operator was classifying it as soft meaning there was only low risk of enemy subs picking it up unless they were closer in than fifty miles which robert brentwood figured he should know about the roosevelt having dragged its towed array less than an hour before even so the sheathing on the russian mikeclass was extraordinarily good at dampening prop noise vlf at three hundred sir the vlf would stay out for five minutes exactly during which the millisecond burst should be received updating instructions five minutes later the vlf automatic override began winding in the aerial six minutes later the ood reported vlf in it was not unknown for a sub not to receive its vlf burst during the prearranged time slots but it had never happened aboard the roosevelt four misses and the sub captains had been ordered contrary to persistent and vigorous denial by both the administration and the pentagon to use their initiative after the fourth miss or zippo as the noburst was known the captains of american subs entered into the world of tki or twokey initiative this meant the captain could upon reasonable and repeated confirmations take it as given that the united states of america was under nuclear attack hq unable to transmit in such a situation the sub commander was free to fire his nuclear missiles at predesignated targets or at his discretion in the case of the tenthousandton sea wolf ii it would involve firing nucleartipped cruise missiles from torpedo tubes and the six trident ballistic missiles in two rows of three aft of the sail the killer word was reasonable what was reasonable if you couldnt get confirmation it was a lawyers delight the reason for no message being received of course could be that there was some malfunction in one of the huge and elaborate vlf signaling and relay aerials on the east and west coasts of the united states the other aerial farm for the roosevelt and the other subs in the atlantic fleet being in wisconsin but washington knew this and allowed for four attempts at tenhour intervals ample time it was thought to work out any problems on the aerial farms if these could not be worked out however after twenty hours tacamostake charge and move out signal planes would be ordered to fly over and beam down the bursts at the prearranged times what happens if were out of tacamos an offduty submariner asked his friend then where are we in the control center brentwood ordered the diving planesman to take her to one thousand and turning to the ood instructed him to resume patrol there was no point in making any comment about not receiving a message the thing was to not make a big deal of it among the crew start them worrying unnecessarily during the resume patrol mode the rules of operation were as carefully spelled out as any other mode including an informal one that said if any member of the crew made a noise above detectable decibel level the old man would personally stuff him into one of the eight forward torpedo tubes and blow him out to the sharks chapter fortysix in the sea of japan aboard the us carrier salt lake city there was a half hour to go pilots advised there would be a briefing in ten minutes fisher frank shirers radar interference officer knocked and came into shirers cabin scuttlebutt from prifly says we might have to go north of the parallel for a while mig alley havent heard said shirer he tore half a dozen tissues from the kleenex box forming them into a cuplike shape which he put in a small plastic baggie reached into his underpants put the cupped kleenex over his penis then reached for his gravity suit ill bet they want us to hit some of the bridges over the han said the navigator maybe said shirer you might get an oet bonus over enemy territory hell the whole of koreas enemy territory just about only kidding said shirer slipping on the gsuit youll get a thankyou from the old man and a cup of coffee no bonuses yeah said the rio yknow this friggin gsuit of mine is too damned tight supposed to be stop the the blood from pooling the rio cut in i know i think its worth shit just a goddamned girdle ever been up without one asked shirer yeah said the rio shirer looked across at him surprised the hell you have i have pan am flight out to the coast stupid bastard shirer grinned the rio playfully punching die others shoulder patch salt lake citys shooting stars the sun a red ball that had burned off low cloud cast long shadows along the flight deck three moles from the most recent awac to land were being led like a column of blind men their polarized visors down each mans arm on the mans in front of him as a member of the flight deck crew led them through the hectic noisefilled activity of prelaunch the three moles eyesight not yet adjusted to any kind of daylight after spending four to six hours straight in the windowless twilight in the rear of the awac in the ready room the monitors were giving all pilots the good news that the soviet fleet was not proceeding farther south intelligence reports indicating all available jets were being thrown into the european theater the bad news was a front was moving south into the sea of japan and was bringing more low stratus reducing visibility again and even possibly interfering with some of the infrared systems because of percent moisture there will be three predawn attacks said the briefing officer two companies of heloferried second airborne at taegu and two at taejon preceded by hawkeyes with fighter cover ill get to the third target in a few minutes first targets one and two he called up the computer image of the milewide milelong peninsula phantoms will be riding shotgun for taegu and taejon troop choppers will be preceded by apache attack helos and huey gunships from the helo carrier iwo jima north of us theyll be laying eggs by which the briefing officer meant laying mines around the landing zones remember the chain guns on the gunship helos are mounted left so theyll be going in counterclockwise when they start their attack by then of course it will have hit the fan and the migsll come in trying to chop them up its your job to break up the mig attack and take out as many as you can all right said fisher first wave of airborne will go in via iwo jimas super stallion helos thirtyfive men apiece ten helos to secure the airstrips perimeter and then the hercules out of japan will land if possible theyre checking satellite photos now if they cant do that cargo will be palletized just so you know whats going on it meant that if the airstrip was secured by the troops the millimeter howitzers strapped tightly to wooden and metal frames would slide out over the rear ramp of the big aircraft as they thundered in at less than a hundred feet above the ground the equipmentfilled pallets of guns ammunition and other supplies braked by the simultaneous deployment behind the pallet of three drag chutes if the iwo jima can spare them it will also launch a dozen verticaltakeoff harriers to act as gun platforms in case charlie starts bringing up artillery around the airfields sir wouldnt they already have the strips zeroed in not from the intelligence photos we have it would appear theyre racing like hell to the south for a final push against pusan and that theyve decided to put all the heavy guns down there to open up a gap through the perimeter hopefully well be able to take them by surprise the distances arent that long nothing further than about a hundred and forty miles in if we can secure one of those two airfields for a few days to fly more of our boys in we can buy time for the guys trapped in that jammed perimeter and hopefully segment their supply line thats what its all about the briefing officer took a sip of water also weve received news that weve got nine bs at guam patched up and ready to go in about a week ground crews down there have been doing an outstanding job getting them ready if we can buy our guys a few extra days in that perimeter pretty soon the bs will be able to pound the shit out of the gooks supply line whatever happens we cant let them push our guys into the sea that happens it may be years maybe never before we get it back after nam thatd be two losses in a row he paused third target weve been charged with shirer youll lead a second wave of tomcats to fly cover for a combined heloborne infantry and magtaf strike from the helo carrier saipan against pyongyang there was a low whistle from one of the navigators and several pilots looked over at one another a few in silent sympathy for the marines and other infantry who would be going in deep behind enemy lines the psychological significance of this mission if successful will be tremendous gentlemen our problem however is to get through their radar screen now we can go in low as far as the coast and they wont pick us up but once we climb over the taebek range well be on their radar immediately from the coast itll be a hundred and twenty miles in the helos from the iwo will be following ravine contours as far as possible and discharging flares against heat seekers but the migs are sure to come in before we get halfway there shirer you deal with them and remember pyongyang is surrounded with sams well proceed with the flyin no matter what happens allowing for ten minutes of fuel for low groundsupport attacks the north koreans had air supremacy when they first crossed the dmz but now our fleets moved up we hope to even the score they intend getting those marines back sir asked shirers rio its been carefully thought out thats all thats no answer said fisher that its all been thought out so was carters attack on iran doolittle said shirer what doolittles attack on tokyo not long after pearl harbor gave the allies one hell of a lift yeah but it wont be much of a lift for those marines and other poor slobs well answered shirer all i know is that if i was in that yosu corner and i heard a commie capital had been hit itd boost my morale cant underestimate morale fish sometimes its almost as good as live ammo think they can do it think you can do it what piece of cake im worried about the guys wholl be on the ground you worry about the damn radar chapter fortyseven nova scotia the old town clock in halifax began its quarterhour peals as lana and three other waves on their first day off walked along the treearched trails in mount pleasant park out on the harbor the replica of the famous bluenose ii her sharp classic lines undiminished by time was cutting spritely through the cobalt water the grace of her design which had won so many international trophies in the first part of the twentieth century a striking contrast to the gathering fleet of us and canadian ships the smell of the sea was on the east breeze and had it not been for the dozens of gray shapes dotted about the harbor north of them the light invigorating wind coming off the north atlantic could have convinced lana all was right with the world as yet the only casualties they had had to deal with had been a few broken legs and arms and one man badly injured after being struck by a sailboats boom while assigned to help crew a visiting admiral in one of halifaxs many yachts his injury had been entered as da by the head nurse a stout nononsense englishwoman whom the canadians called matron no not dead on arrival matron had said humorlessly demonstrating how such things had to be handled if one was to work ones way through the bureaucracy da means dockyard accident she explained brusquely it was a small enough incident but it meant that responsibility and costs would be entered against the dockyard rather than the canadian navy and it told lana something about matron and the bureaucratic system theyd have to contend with even in a harbor that in wartime became one of the busiest and most strategically important in the world the start of the long convoy runs across the atlantic and a port that during the second world war had repaired more than six thousand allied ships lana had been asked out several times by young doctors at the hospital but declined her experience with jay having been so traumatic that while it didnt sour her against men in general it made her wary and the very thought of having to fend off the uninvited and inevitable sexual advances was too much to contemplate for now it was all she could handle to pass the examinations in a punishingly more concentrated training period than was normal because both washington and ottawa had advised halifax that a substantial number of casualties could be expected the scuttlebutt had it that a convoy from england was already en route and in the pubs around the old cobbled streets of the historic properties where press gangs had once roamed shanghaiing volunteers for her majestys navy there was a rumor claiming empty container ships had been sent first so as not to risk any vital cargo a guinea pig run for the british and americans the halifax chronicle printed the story within three hours saclant in virginia and cfb canadian forces base halifax flatly denied the assertion pointing out that container ships were now in the process of loading some of the millions of tons of materiel that would be needed to reinforce europe the chronicles publisher was invited to the admirals house for tea it was brief polite and during the conversation the admiral asked the publishers advice on whether or not he thought it would be worth in the public interest running a story on the canadian war measures act he reminded the publisher that the last time it had been used was in when the then liberal prime minister trudeau had deployed armed soldiers on the steps of parliament and during which time the admiral noted newspapers along with everyone else were forbidden under the emergency powers to discuss the flq front liberation du quebec the terrorist organization that had kidnapped labour minister pierre laporte shot him dead and dumped him in the trunk of a car the reporter for the chronicle who had broken the empty cargo story was reassigned to the obituaries to the other three nurses with her lanas personality was something of an enigma an odd mixture of shyness and assertiveness in her job and working with the patients in an oddly detached way she wasnt unpleasant but rather distanced as if somehow nursing for her was less a vocation than a refuge it was several weeks before one of them discovered from an american newspaper that she had been the mrs j t la roche and sister of the naval officer who if he survived looked like he was going to be courtmartialed this news only confirmed lanas fellow nurses in their intuitive belief that she was running away but to a hospital one of them had put to the others why not after a rotten marriage a hospitals as good a place as any to lose yourself for a while get a new perspective they were right and wrong right in that lana had found a place to retreat where other peoples needs forced her to leave her troubles for a while but wrong in thinking it gave her a new perspective the outbreak of war to lana was but another example of peoples inhumanity to others something she had experienced in her marriage and she made the depressing discovery that no amount of work no amount of depressing news from the war in europe and in korea could take herself out of herself long enough to rid her of the feeling that inside she was somehow permanently contaminated dirty that in succumbing to jays sexual demands shed sullied herself more than anyone could ever know the very thought of it would start her throat constricting as if she were being suffocated nowhere to hide no one to help a heartthumping terror of suddenly losing control in those moments she was secretly but deeply depressed and despite the veneer of selfassurance she realized that not even the cataclysmic possibility of nuclear war could erase an individuals guilt it didnt take lana long to fall afoul of matron on one of their few days off after lana and a black girl from boston had discovered their us dollars were worth at least fifteen percent more in the canadian port the four nurses had taken a cab around to see some of the sights one of the girls wanted to go to fairview cemetery on the citys west side where people who had died on the titanic were interred and where more than some of them unrecognizable after the blast had been killed on december when a french munitions ship the mont blanc on convoy to europe had struck a norwegian merchantman and exploded razing most of the buildings on the citys northern side killing over fifteen hundred men women and children and permanently injuring thousands of others to lanas surprise she found the cemetery peculiarly comfortingwhy she didnt know when they returned to the nurses quarters they were summoned by matron i dont want my nurses tearing around town waving dollar bills about like tarts the nurses were taken aback and angry but none of them stood up to her except lana matron i dont know who could have told you that but we were on our own time and own asked matron malevolently no one has their own time in a war lana didnt answer that as yet they had seen nothing of the war intuitively she sensed matron hated her for her good looks well matron continued youll soon be too busy for any nonsense she paused for a moment was about to turn her back on them when she cast a steely gaze on lana mrs la roche you may not be aware of it but a great deal of unnecessary resentment can be caused by people with more money flashing it about in front of others who go without canadian nurses earn far less in real terms than you americans not nearly enough to hire taxis to roam at leisure but matron interjected one of the two canadian nurses we didnt mind spending the point im making is that therell be enough for people to gripe about once these wards start to fill and believe me they will well have enough to deal with without petty squabbling breaking out between canadian and american and british servicemen about whose girl is whose and who has the most money dont tell me ive seen it before in she decided not to reveal her age i merely want you to act responsibly thats all elizabeth the black girl from boston shook her head as they watched matron walk away heels clicking on the hard linoleum floor even the echoes of her sharp footsteps on the immaculately clean floor had the very sound of cold efficiency ive been told about people like that but i never believed they actually existed old bitch they exist all right said one of the canadian girls cant bear to see anyone else happy i think she likes the war gives purpose to her miserable existence lana felt herself going red with embarrassment yes said the other canadian they should put her on a sub down and out of sight maybe if we get lucky shell get torpedoed with what asked the girl from maine they were all laughing except lana elizabeth suddenly bit her lip turned and consolingly put her arm about lana hey i m sorry lana that was some dumb thing to say the others had to wait for elizabeth to explain that one of lanas brothers was a sub captain in the atlantic fleet but lana hadnt been bothered by the reference to either subs or torpedoes she was far more worried about the way she had stiffened when elizabeth had put her arm around her now even the tough of another human being trying to comfort her only raised her defenses had jay destroyed her that much she wondered in which case her days of comforting as a nurse were surely numbered chapter fortyeight via the armed services radio in japan news had reached the lph saipan that in new york a drug ring had been discovered by military police overseeing the loading of nato supplies among the drugs stolen were substantial quantities of demerol and morphine destined for the us forces fighting in europe the news item had so upset general douglas freeman that he had been unable to complete his meal with the usual light banter of the officers mess the general was now looking out into the darkness from the flight deck of the saipan its destroyers and forward asw helos invisible about the eighteenthousandton ship know what they ought to do with them al he asked his aide all those junkies whats that sir the generals voice was made sharper by the salty wind whipping it away shoot them like the chinks do he was looking up through scattered stratus at a spill of stars twinkling over the sea of japan by god i dont like that zhou bastard but one thing those commies know how to do is to deal with pushers and all the other scum i find any in this outfit with glue up their goddamned nose ill throw em overboard pity you havent had time to get to know them general im well aware of that deficiency al theyll get a chance to size me up when i talk with them tonight and ill get to know them well enough tomorrow if we can hold past noonwell well make history in bang and out thats the ticket freeman was about to go down to the troop deck when al banks decided to get something off his chest sir i havent had time really to get to know you yet you resent me having command dont think ive earned it too fast a promotion that it no sir not at all its casualties im concerned about i know soldiers marines airborne or otherwise know they might be called in to do their job anywhere at any time and theyve had sudden changes in command before but the scuttlebutt aboard this ship is that casualties are going to be exceptionally heavy theyve seen the projected figures or theyve seen figures leaked by someone to discredit my plan of attack al banks began to object doesnt matter how they found out cut in freeman even if they hadnt seen the figures theyve been studying the satellite photos and mockups until they know every square inch hell theyd be dummies if they didnt what do you expect me to do about it theyre saying the projection is higher than seventy percent general way above any casualties that we would normally normally freeman seized the word now listen to me al as a stiff northerly was blowing across the darkened ships flight deck al banks was unable to hear everything the general was saying but could feel freemans eyes boring into him this isnt a normal time this isnt a normal war besides which following normal rules is a recipe for disaster for any dumb son of a bitch without imagination normal rules wont win the goddamned thing commanders are changed all the time in battle because they followed normal rules my god the general paused like an engine building up more steam turning to go back inside the ship weve got to get this thing sewn up so we can go over and kill those russians im not sure the men share your optimism general taebek mountains look pretty formidable even on a map and theyre wondering all right ill speak to them about that too by god i tell you al i smell a big washington rat around here trying to undermine my authority i just think theyre scared general none of them has been in action before except on one or two missions during the invasion of grenada grenada the generals face was now visible in the dim light of the ships interior they were walking down toward the helo deck lights ablaze all solid metal portholes sealed shut as the mechanics performed lastminute checks on the big threeengined super stallions and chinooks which carrying fortyfive and thirtythree men respectively would be carrying half the fifteenhundredman force into pyongyang the other half coming in on the hercules right on the airport if possible if not circling and making the jump grenada was a shambles said the general sustained more injuries there from our own foulups than from any resistance we encountered either side of them down the cavernous hangar deck scores of technicians and ordnance men were now bombing up the smaller apache attack helos each apache receiving two aa sidewinder missiles one on the edge of each stubby wing two pods each carrying nineteen seventymillimeter rockets and four hellfire antitank missiles loaders were also laying the belts of highexplosive thirtymillimeter for the unmanned chain gun in the chin turret which would be slaved to the gunners integrated helmet and display sight system or ihadss the general stepped aside to let a small forklift truck pass by loaded with armorpiercing trays for the portside chain guns of the black hawk hueys the prototypes having proved themselves in vietnam here and there the sharp angular shapes of the fiftyninefoot apaches and several smaller cobras were broken by raised engine cowlings laser sensor boxes halfout and thermal imager sensors being tested by army and navy electronic technicians farther down they passed tightly stowed threeinone offtheshoulder antitank starstreak missiles which would be used by the marine air ground task force units to stop any tanks that might be brought to bear if the enemy tanks got through the airdropped minefields as he entered the huge area of the troop deck one below the hangar where rows upon rows of concertina bunks were drawn up to the ceiling while not in use revealing an area half the size of a football field freeman looked out upon a sea of over a thousand faces in less than ten hours if the weather held just before dawn they would leave and those who survived and were lifted out would probably number no more than two or three hundred the very idea of the desperate gamble to strike an unsuspecting blow at the enemy and to rejuvenate americas confidence in herself as doolittles raid on tokyo had done so many years before filled freeman with such pride and expectation he felt his whole body gripped with excitement however he knew the men before him didnt share in his happy anticipation it was something a commander had to change he would he knew be relying on that rare ability of his and a few others like him to convey a sense of immediacy of intimacy with the person whom they have just met as if they had known him all their lives he carried with him an intensity and aura of tough trust and above all the deepseated fanaticism that other americans he knew would not call fanaticism the rocksolid belief that you could fix anything that god willing you could put it right going up on the small rostrum made up of aircraft packing cases the marine corps and infantry flags behind him old glory higher than the others freeman knew this was the most important speech he had ever made in the front row sat his company commanders five in all and the padre assigned to the uss saipan hed heard freeman was a cowboy freeman glanced down at the padre at the company commanders then up at the waiting faces he was immediately struck by their youth most he guessed no more than twenty maybe twentyfive chapter fortynine in the mid north atlantic the sea was turning angry the northward flow of the gulf stream running up against a cold arctic front it was a mixed blessing for convoy r for on the one hand it meant that enemy subs sonar would have a harder time separating ships engines from the turmoil of the airsea interface where hollows had become deeper troughs more frequent it was however also more difficult for the convoy escorts or rather those that were left to detect the noise of submarine props in the turbulence as increasingly heavy seas crashed against the ships distorting the noise patterns even further it wasnt impossible for the operators to work but it made them much more tense than usual conscious of how false echoes or blips wrongly interpreted could cause the launching of a subroc missile from the convoys escorts into its own sea king helo screen as happened earlier an equal possibility hms peregrines captain realized was to mistake one of your screen subs as an enemy sub or to throw it into the suspicious unknown category accordingly at hours he ordered mirror semaphore to signal all destroyers and frigates to be especially alert to this danger lest they prematurely launch a torpedo or depth charge attack the situations complicated number one the captain added because none of our sub screen will of course come up and radio their position to us for fear of revealing themselves to ivan for this reason the captain reminded all those on the bridge and in the combat control room that they had to be particularly cautious if one of their own trafalgar subs from rs screen picked up an enemy sub the trafalgars skippers plan of attack would more likely than not mean hed have to take the trafalgar out of the fanshaped sub screen and in order not to reveal its position to the enemy would be unable to notify the convoy this could result in electronic misidentification of the kind that had caused a uss guided missile cruiser vincennes to shoot down a commercial air bus in further down the line in hms peregrines mess william spence was witnessing one of the strangest sights of r s voyage so far indeed one of the strangest sights in the whole british navy leading seaman carswell with a full cup of coffee placed carefully atop a small silver salver proceeded to carry out the first steps in the dance that had won him fame throughout the fleet as the only steward in the fleet who leaving the galley with a full cup of coffee could deliver it to the bridge unspilled no matter how rough the weather in the worst storms with the litheness of a prima ballerina fighting gravity against impossible angles he was a sight to behold as he began his trip toward the stairwells his legs seemingly made of rubber sometimes walking back giving a few paces then recovering the lost distance the next second with a short fast run the cup held aloft as if he himself were in a gimbals mounting more than once new lieutenants had lost a days pay by having an unofficial wager with another officer waiting impatiently upon the news that carswell had left the galley and was now on his way up expecting the seaman would trip at least once on the way but so far it had not happened leaving carswell with what the ships company called an unbroken number of fcdsfull cups delivered several crew had already written inquiring whether carswells feat qualified for mention in the guiness book of records they hoped a reply would be waiting for them when they returned to their home base at plymouth the peregrine leaned hard aport as a starboard wave struck her the well deck awash athwartships the bursting white cloud of spray enveloping the bridge with a sound like hail it would soon be a force eight the bollards already covered in foam water rushing down the decks like a spring runoff spilling out through the stern scuppers and swirling about the aft twin sea dart launcher the flow broken but not stopped by the limbo mortar before pouring back into the sea visibility was now down to two miles more whitecaps evident as r continued to plow ahead only time id like being in a submarine johnson said in the galley he and spence having left spreading the marmite sandwiches till last all this bloody rockin and rollin is for the action stations came the voice over the tannoy the pa system and before johnson could pick up another slice of bread he spence and the cook could hear the sound of running feet in the passageway outside the crews mess spence had expected a lot of shouting from petty officers and the like but what struck him was the lack of any harshly shouted orders the ships crew reacting more like a welltrained sports team than men at war on the bridge the sonar operator calmly reported contact bearing two oh five degrees half speed ordered the peregrines captain reducing the noise of his own ships prop to help avoid giving away peregrines position her sonar was on passive and so no range could be registered but the captain knew that a good operator knowing his own set and ship often developed a reasonably good guesstimate can you give me a distance sonar id say five thousand yards sir quickly peregrines captain looked up at the computer board comparing the vector plot of rs course and his present position it put the noise about two miles away at a wide angle from where the convoys screen subs should be contact gone sir completely yes sir odd the captain said turning to his number one damned odd any thoughts he looked about the bridgeit was no time for pride anyone wreck sir old oil drum or something moving i mean sir he continued something hitting it you know rock slide or something could be chief contact bearing two six one go active commanded the captain all round sweep aye sir on active all around sweep now the inside of the peregrines bow began to twang as its hullseated transducer in effect two metal plates buckling under electric charge sent the distinctive sonar pinging noise into the oceans depths the operator turning the echo onto the bridges tannoy the sonar sweeping from zero degrees to every two minutes contact bearing two six one range eight hundred yards moving fast contact bearing two six oh range seven six oh yards no props noise sir id say a mine torpedo motor no sir no beat count without taking his eyes from the sonar screen the captain waited for the two seconds as the computer digitized all incoming information telling him that whatever it was was coming at them at forty miles per hour impact in minutes on the starboard side and countermeasures giving him the iavs impact avoidance vector and speed notify all ships steering by iav unhappily he knew that none of the merchantmen had iav capability by voice to transports plain language aye sir to transports in plain follow the ship in front of them aye aye sir the computer iavs were entered into the peregrines memory and she swung hard aport her type eight steamgascombinationdriven prop driving her at twentyfour knots her decks now constantly awash as she heeled sharply to avoid impact same contact one one seven degrees one thousand yards identify negative but different from the other by the time the new iavs had been spat out by the computer it was too late for the peregrine the captain realizing it was not an isolated mine coming for them but a series probably combination pressurenoise triggered by the active pulse the peregrine had just sent out like a man trapped in an evershrinking room the iavs were now seemingly accessories to the fact for wherever the ship moved there was another ping carswell had just placed the coffee in the captains special gimbalsmounting cup holder when peregrine was hit the second mine she had picked up on sonar was the first to explode as she turned into its path the mine homing in on the keel at the forward end of the engine room the second blast cleaving her well below her waterline at the stern and buckling the prop lifting the destroyers stern completely out of the water as her bow rose high then fell a breaker came rolling down under her like a leaden gray wall all main fuses gone the ship was in total darkness for several seconds before the auxiliary battery lights kicked in in the galley the plastic crates of sandwiches slid en masse but none were lost as the three men were thrown against the cold ovens and one of the huge shining mixing bowls as part of a standby fire team william spence and more reluctantly johnson moved to their station aft by the hangar door where the battery charge lights had ruptured in the stern explosion they heard a noise coming from outside an enormous gushing sound like so many fire hydrants turned on crashing in a sustained crescendo against the bulkhead and felt the ship jerking starboard then port and back to starboard her motion so violent it seemed nothing less in the dim passageway than the enraged effort of some great leviathan caught in an iron trap thrashing to be free what the bloody hell began johnson shut your face ordered a cpo sternly young william spence already putting on his asbestos suit and helmet with breathing apparatus looked up at the cpo a man hed never seen before and in that second the unfamiliarity of the mans face and the noise were so disorientating that for spence it momentarily took on the aspect of a nightmare get on your caspers pack like spence here the cpo said to johnson and follow me spence was surprised the man knew his name until he remembered they all had their names on their shirts come on johnson between spence and me move all right all right moaned johnson pulling on the fireretardant suit and tightening his head gear as the chief petty officer opened the hatch leading down to the engine room they were enveloped in clouds of steam that instantly fogged their masks they could hear men screaming and the rushing bubbling sound of the water we should abandon ship shouted johnson his voice nasal in his suit buckets going to sink shine your light over there the cpo ordered spence port side one of the big gas turbines was still going despite the captain ringing the telegraph to stop all engines the torque on the prop enough to keep it turning but jerking the ship pushing and pulling it like an animal still moving though braindead they couldnt hear any more screaming johnson urging them to get out of it while they could then just as suddenly as the explosion the turbine stopped telling the cpo that someone in the engine room had managed to reach the controls of the manual override after the automatic controls had been severed or perhaps the turbine had cut out of its own accord spence thought he heard a faint cry above the rushing water and the now creaking sound of the ship but it was difficult to be certain when one wanted so much to help spence saw a subby or junior lieutenant walking up the incline of the slanting passageway blowing high and low on his whistle telling everyone to report to their boat stations immediately see i bloody told you began johnson spence had never been so petrified in all his life but he could hear a voice here chief he said to the petty officer his voice dry with an almost squeaky quality to it in his fear ill have a gander all right lad here loop this about you ill take up the slack the cpo started feeding out the yellow nylon rope taking a turn around one of the ladders rungs too short tugs from you he called out to spence and ill haul make it snappy as you can righto chief righto my arse said johnson spence was now up to his chest in surprisingly warm water the icecold atlantic momentarily heated by the dying gas steam turbines listen mate yelled johnson you want to play bloody hero you go ahead but i think there was another explosion this time the ship pushed hard aport fifteen degrees its whole structure shuddering spence was off the last rung underwater the cpo and johnson sucked off the ladder as well the cpo barely managing to hold on to the rung around which hed taken a turn with the nylon rope in the thick fog that now filled the rapidly flooding engine room spence glimpsed johnsons firered air tank going past him johnson screaming spence made a grab felt a boot and hung on with his right arm his left groping for a hold any hold as he felt his air supply cease his mouth full of salt water and oil he felt a violent wrenching his shoulder driven so hard into a stanchion that putting his left arm out to grab it before he was swept away again he felt his hold on johnson weakening the seaman not helping by panicking and thrashing about but with all his will spence held fast to his shipmate his left boot touched something and he let it take all his weight it was one of the upper rungs on a stairway thirty feet farther down the engine room from where theyd entered as he hauled himself up not yet realizing he had been driven so far down the engine room thinking he had somehow been hauled back to the first ladder entrance spence straining to hold johnsons head above looked about in the fog for the cpo he was gone the yellow nylon rope floating now about him and johnson like some great water snake in a lake that had only minutes before been peregrines engine room the petty officers single turn about the rung on the first stairwell had saved spence who in turn had saved johnson from being sucked out like the cpo through the gash in the engine rooms side johnson already had his helmet and air tank off as he lumbered up the last dozen rungs to the top water rising quickly behind them he swore violently at the inner tie of the asbestos trousers which his fingers were plucking at frantically his words a torrent of frenzied invective spence was now out of his suit but was still looking back to see if there was any sign of the cpo a body washed past them its face puffy purple and badly lacerated an engineering officer by his arm stripes the facial wounds remarkably clean my gawd said johnson taking the last steps in twos spinning open the ring lock door stumbling out as the ship leaned farther to port the door slamming shut opening on the rebound revealing a new hissing surge of water rising in the engine room spence still inside tripped on the second to top rung a foot from the doors sill and instead of catching hold of the ring handle at the doors center his fall meant that he just managed to grab the sill hang on he called to johnson johnson paused for a second heard the hiss of more water slammed the hatch shut spun the wheel and bolted knocking down an artificer on the now sharply inclined passageway dazed lifting himself up the artificer saw the door of the engine room move its high mouselike squeal audible amid the deeper rumble of the ship that was now sinking as millions of gallons sought to fill every possible space ironically bringing the ship back to a stable position before it began listing again this time to starboard the artificer saw the wheel move again and was about to reach for it when the door flew open on the downward incline and a seaman came tumbling out slamming against the opposite bulkhead for a moment as the artificer leaned on the door pushing it shut and spinning the wheel water bubbling out about his feet like an overflowing toilet he thought the seaman was wearing red dayglo gloves coming up splashing behind them was a cpo from the combat control center come on you two topside old girls had he saw spence collapse onto the deck and now the artificer saw what he had thought were red gloves on the deck they laid william spence down on a net stretcher the roaring light above him so bright it seemed he was entering the sun a sick bay attendant struggled for several minutes beneath the downblast of the helicopters blades and in the spray it was whipping up about them before he managed to give spence a shot of morphine the ood his face bleeding the cuts superficial looking more serious than they were cast a glance down at spence he thought hed seen him in the galley once he saw the seamans eyes open briefly then shut all about him there were men calling for help some quietly moaning as the fury of the sea continued unabatedly indifferently to batter the dying ship the ood was trying to decide the priority cases for the choppers first run amid the noise of the chopper shouts of men dying around him some washed overboard and lost already the other ships unable to stop the sick bay attendant realized that the officers glance at spence was a silent question but the attendants grimace was one of agonized indecision as he shouted above the roar of the helo wouldnt put money on it sir then again the officer looked helplessly around but there was no one to help him decide he knelt down in the wind that was whistling wildly through sheared metal and over the bodies littered all around and placed his hand on the boys forehead making the sign of the cross trying to remember the words of the lords prayer trying to decide whether the boy should be a priority case or not i cant move my legs sir i cant feel nothin sir nothin at all it was johnson lying on a stretcher near a starboard davit i cant its all right old chap said the gunnery officer you just lie there well get you off on the next chopper nearby a bosun overhearing the conversation turned to his mate dont see much wrong with im shock i expect said his mate poor buggers spine probably crushed paralyzed from the waist down thats why he dont feel anything thought i saw him walking out on deck said the bosun a wave smacked the starboard side of the peregrine a black wave suddenly incandescent angelic in the cone of the choppers belly light water streaming frothily through the scuppers the ship rolling very slowly now the water sloshing back and forth gurgling through buckled decking least i thought it was him said the bosun still looking at johnson nah said his mate must have been another bloke christ i ope they send more helos i dont fancy this lot next to him the bosun was zipping up the body bag in which theyd laid the cook chapter fifty the cavernous troop deck aboard the lph saipan rang with the generals voice my name is douglas freeman and im here because like you i was considered the best for the job first thing i want to tell you tonight is that i have no intention of dying there was a ripple of strained laughter neither i trust do you more laughter secondly the generals eyes were taking in the whole hangar with such intensity that every private section platoon and company commander thought the general was staring at him im not about to lead any dopeheads into battle i dont give a goddamn what the doctors say or the surgeon general says there isnt such a thing as a goddamned calming pill thatll let you go into battle like you were going to church which looking at you sons of bitches i seriously doubt youve ever done anyway in the first row al banks arms folded was looking at his shoes he had personally authorized the issue of mg sublingual lorazepam before it was known who would be commanding the hastily assembled mobile force now continued freeman walking hands on hips across the small podium stopping facing the men his voice reaching every corner of the hangar deck i know youve all been through the drills the maps the platoon assignments he paused but theres something else you should know when you go into battle i want you to know who you are where you are and what the hell youre doing i want you shooting gooks not one another so before you disembark indeed before you dismiss this evening you will dispense with any pills you were issued with and any other pills you may have in your possession depositing them with the padre the padre in the front row looked up surprised if he runs out of pockets put them in his helmet i dont want any spacehead shooting up his section because he popped a pill too many and thought you were all gooks even though youre betterdressed than any gooks ive ever seen and that includes that runt kim jong ii who the troops were loosening up the laughter coming more easily now an evil piece of shit continued the general who by the way when you were trying to get your first piece of ass was trying to figure out how to murder innocent civilians and who is as evil a bastard as qaddafi hitler that shit pol pot or any other son of a bitch ever hoped to be the anger in freemans eyes was so intense al thought the general was about to jump right off the stage his forefinger sweeping across his audience his lone star glinting in the hangar light it is our duty to go in and give that son of a bitch such a shakeup and hopefully kill the bastard so that his henchmen will think twice about ever attacking the united states of america again the general paused again and glancing along the front rows saw the padre was not at all fazed by the profanity to teach them a lesson freeman went on namely that theyve bitten off more than they can chew because the united states of america will not i repeat not give up the ghost in korea and that if they persist in their butchery well get tougher still and nuke the sons of bitches into oblivion there was a roar of approval the padre freeman noticed with satisfaction was distinctly uncomfortable the generals voice dropped now ive heard that someone says this is a hopeless mission a suicide mission politically motivated well i dont lead suicide attacks and i wont give you any bs about minimum casualties were going into the enemys belly and i expect casualties to be heavy but well be coming out there was still silence as for it being politically motivated hell said the general shaking his head i dont know what that means all i know is anything we dont like dont care for becomes politically motivated we are instruments of national policy our profession is not peace its war thats what were paid for to go in there not to walk softly and carry a big stick but to give em the stick right up their heathen ass some whistles and a smattering of laughter the padre was clearly angry another thing freemen continued i know some of you have been wondering why an airborne assault when we could launch bombing runs two good reasons one pyongyang which here on out will be referred to in all directives and communications as crap city is festooned with surfacetoair missiles and migs on alert our choppers will be going in low and the sams which are most effective at high altitude will have extreme difficulty discriminating among lowflying aircraft with ground clutter thrown in and well be hillhopping all the way furthermore well have fighter cover from salt lake city to help confuse the sams when they scramble their migs to meet our boys but the most important reason for sending in this force is that we have learned contrary to all the armchair experts think tanks and god knows what else that bombing fails to cut the head from the snake including miss jane fonda give it to her general no comment a roar of laughter the padres face had now turned from anger to disgust what we have repeatedly found out and here i dont wish to malign our comrades in arms in the air force they do a damned fine job but we have repeatedly found most spectacularly with that dung heap qaddafi that you can send in the whole damned air force with smart bombs to boot kill everyone and miss the son of a bitch in his tent that is why the prime target of this foray is to take that runt out of circulation permanently the soldiers were clapping and stomping now so that your families your children no longer have to live in a world where slimeballs rule the roost there was thunderous applause the general held up his hand youre scared so are the boys wholl go into taegu and chongju i understand that he waited but you keep your powder dry pass the ammunition as your forebears did and youll be all right above all remember this is no mixedup slugfest inhibited by peace pansies and fondas running riot in your country this is a war which all true americans together with our allies know is right beyond the shadow of a doubt that monkey cross the line he has no honor no decency no conscience this isnt a mission its a crusade and youre the bearers of the flag god bless you as the general walked down from the podium there was the sound of over a thousand men rising forming lines according to company and platoon before freeman left the deck al banks introduced him to the padre assigned to the saipan pleased to meet you general but you didnt like my speech the padre hesitated ah no general i didnt quite all right padre said freeman pulling on his leather gloves tightly difference of opinion was there anything in particular you objected to i thought your remarks about the north koreans though i understand your intention were i mean categorizing a whole race in padre were not going up against the sisters of charity were going to do battle with the philistines nka special forces their best militia best home guard topoftheline killers i mean nka special forces boobytrap their own kin if they thought it would kill americans they hate us more than any people on earth i understand your position padre and its admirable in its place but these jokers my boysll be fighting have never heard of any commandment let alone ten of them and i dont want any of my men thinking about loving their neighbors when they file out of those whirlybirds freeman moved so close to the padre that the latter felt distinctly uncomfortable freeman was pulling his gloves on tighter ive seen the devil padre and the son of a bitch lives in pyongyang and im going after him im putting a bounty on his head the general looked quickly at the other officers in line i want it known gentlemen that anyone who brings me the head of kim jong suck will personally get a field citation and ten thousand dollars the padres eyes widened general none of us have the authority padre i need you in the field a lot of my boys are going to die are you coming along or going to rest your butt in the officers lounge the padres already volunteered put in captain al banks freeman murmured nodding approvingly but the fierceness was still in his eyes good i need brave men that padre said freeman as he left the hangar with his aide hes a good man yes general i think he is i say he is only one thing wrong with him they were walking back past the helicopter crews in the forward hangar area whats that general didnt you see it stood out a mile im not sure egg on his vest i wont tolerate that al you get the word out yes sir i ever tell you my father was a keen sportsman not that i baseball football of course golf god he even liked tennis i like tennis general you do yes sir well cant be helped never took to it myself son of a bitch sitting

training now that padre you see he thinks hell get closer to the men more laidback more slovenly he appears doesnt work it was only a very small piece of egg general freeman ignored the captains comment you play baseball yes sir i notice youre a sou paw lefthander yes sir good well make a good team al the captain was nonplussed freeman stepped out into the cold night air the blackness all around them like a great velvet blanket not a light could be seen you on my left me on the right its my intention to be in the first chopper i dont want anyone saying freeman freeloaded took the last chopper in i dont think anyone would general ive got enemies al say im too flamboyant too full of myself waiting for me to take a fall you think that im a windbag no siri yes you do you son of a bitch well al tomorrow at cockcrow well find out above them they could hear a faint squeaking as the concave dish on the main radar mast passed through a degree sweep its signal pulsing out into the darkness toward the enemys shore inside the hangar in the long line of soldiers approaching the padre who had now commandeered a second helmet a private first class a helo side gunner who like most of the soldiers in the hangar had never been in combat before was veering between sheer fright and the bravado instilled by the generals speech asking his comrades imploringly whether a packet of nasal decongestant capsules qualified as a pill he should surrender whats it do to you asked a corporal from one of the saipans medevac choppers slow you down or jack you up the worried private nipped over the packet says might cause drowsiness not to operate machinery aw shit said the medic take the fucking lot any luck youll sleep through it all whats your helo number asked a marine twentysix why good number to stay away from the marine said chapter fiftyone in germany the british army of the rhine was fighting for its life in the fiftyfivemilewide pocket between bielefeld and dortmund where swarms of sukhoi fencer groundattack fighters were wreaking havoc on the british tanks the sukhois chosen in part for the relatively narrow swept wing width and painted in greenbrown blotch camouflage had been crated by rail through poland and the gdr weeks before reassembled parked and maintained in the vast nordhausen tunnel complex in the eastern part of the harz mountains where hitler had made his vis and vs out of range of allied bombers rising swiftly behind a semicircular screen of sam sites in the harz foothills between nordhausen and what had been the west german frontier the fencers streamed northeast over stolberg swooping down through cloud over the tranquil bluish green of the harz they reached the british armys defensive position a hundred miles west along the bielefelddortmund line in less than nine seconds their terrainavoidance radar and laser targetseekers cutting through the battlefields smoke cover setting the challenger tanks ablaze when the challengers fired their aim was deadly and they fought hard even as they fell back northward behind the weser and mittelland canal the british were taking terrible punishment as well on their southern flank where east german motorized shock troops were now crossing in force so that in the depression between bielefeld and dortmund what had been a fiftyfivemilewide defense base now shrank to thirtyfive miles as the russian fighterinterceptors streaked down pouring a deadly hail from twinbarreled twentythreemillimeter cannons a british commander watched his battalion of forty tanks and support infantry being systematically destroyed here unlike fulda where american and russian tanks were too close the soviets gasoline bombs tumbled down and with such apparent aimlessness it seemed they could do no harm then the big silver jelly beans would burst the saffron fireballs rolling over the velvet green hills to the men inside the challenger tanks whose reactive armor had worked so efficiently in blowing up the soviets earlier highexplosive antitank bullets the napalm was an agony worse than any gunfire their bodies becoming torches all but impossible to extinguish as one man would try to smother a comrade to snuff out the flame the jellied gasoline would fly onto the wouldbe rescuer the droplets of redhot mercury sticking to flesh and clothing often as not killing two men instead of one on many occasions british infantry caught by the napalm not only died a screaming death themselves but proved deadly to comrades as the heat from their burning bodies set off their own ammunition the soviet fencers supporting the gdr advance did not have it all their own way as the nato air forces rose to meet them but the overwhelming numbers of soviet and warsaw pact fighters meant that the nato fighters trying to contain breakthroughs on the northern plain in the center along the fulda axis and in the south on the alluvial flats of the danube were stretched too thinly the nato commander not knowing where the twenty russian divisions held in reserve would be thrown in therefore unable to concentrate wholly on any one sector it was a sovietwarsaw pact strategy designed for the quick win to push nato so far so quickly that in the case of a ceasefire ranovatoearly in the gamethe sovietwarsaw pact would have in its possession at least a third of west germany and a sizable strip of holland miles wide and miles long north of natos aircontrol center at gelsenkirchen the nato pilots were exacting a high price but against all the other intangibles of battle was the stark mathematical fact known for years before the war that nato could not outlast sheer quantity even with a kill ratio in the air of two to one in the first seventysix hours on the ground the situation was worse the tank commanders facing sergei marchenko and the other ten thousand soviet tanks having had to maintain a fourtoone kill ratio merely to hold ground in the wake of the sovietwarsaw pact threepronged attack the old confident air among nato commanders about western quality versus russian quantity took on a decidedly hollow ring leading three other fs one of the nato pilots colonel delcorte his f still climbing though getting low on fuel was in his fourth sortie within seven hours based in hahn with the us tenth tactical wing delcorte now had only fourteen of his twentysixplane squadron left ten were downed outright two had managed to return to hahn but were badly shot up of the ten downed planes three reported bailouts ones chute was seen high above fulda gap presumably drifting down over east germany the other two pilots picked up southwest of the bielefelddortmund basin in a heavily wooded section serving as revetment areas for the battered chieftains the britishmade battle tanks which though firstrate and well armed with millimeter cannons and assisted by crack british infantry regiments from the army of the rhine were doomed because of their slower speed compared to the russian t as seventyfive kilometers per hour had the chieftains more time to dig in it might have been a different story for as sergei marchenko and fellow swp tank commanders quickly realized the breakdown rate of the soviet tanks was much higher than for those of the allies but though the british chieftains were well served by their appliqué chobham armor packs and firstrate crews they could not overcome the russians threetoone superiority in tanks at fulda gap where the russians had been unable to use their jellied gas bombs the latest british challengers german leopard iis and american ms lasted much longer in battles where foamfilled selfsealing rubber fuel tanks took many direct hits from armorpiercing shots without exploding in the bielefelddortmund area the russian ts built to accommodate the shortest russian tank crews and so presenting the lowest silhouette of any main battle tank swung out wide through the british chieftains heavily laid white smoke screens and regrouped in ambush isolating several chieftains at a time in the process the smoke and dustfilled battleground confused the pilots of the american thunderbolts who had to make splitsecond differentiation between russian and british tanks this becoming increasingly difficult in the dense smoke as the day wore on it was delcorte thought his f leveling out high above the smoke as terrible or from the russian point of view as good an example of using superior numbers as you could get quite literally mugging the opposition with sheer brute force and size the only hope delcorte knew was to keep going up keep engaging them until the juggernauts attack was blunted when finally there would be so many tanks off tread so many automatic shell extractors in the ts out of alignment due to overheating and crews fatigue that the wests overall superiority in technology including more tank transports would start to pay off delcorte took some hope from the fact that natos medevac and air crew rescue units were of uniform high quality this was a crucial factor if nato pilots were to fly and fight again delcorte and the other three fs in the finger four formation resembling the spacing of a right hands four fingertips the little finger farther back entered heavy cloud at six thousand delcorte was still in it the other three pilots in the clear the wingman on his left advising him there were bogeys six of them at one oclock seven thousand keep going for the top delcorte instructed the prearranged ceiling having been ten thousand feet from which they hoped they could dive down upon the funnel leading to the fulda gap bogeys below nine oclock came the next report go for the top delcorte repeated evenly though in fact he had a multiplicity of incoming messages and warning signals all of them conflicting during his effort to outclimb the bogeys coming in from the east ignoring those passing below en route to shoot up the withdrawing americans of the black horse division it was tempting to delcorte to break the fourplane formation and go into two fighting pairs a leader and wingman the latter watching the leaders cov cone of vulnerability this would leave him as the flight leader free from blind side attack if he dove in to break up the enemy formation he was also tempted to go to a fluid four formation having two of the fs a thousand feet abreast in front the other two ten thousand feet apart behind all these options sped through delcortes head in a split second then seeing the soviet fighters still climbing trying to get an advantage over the americans he forgot fulda gap and decided to attack once the combat began the geometry of flight formations was lost two soviet foxbats winking orange then gone in cloud the airtoair acrid missiles streaking toward the american falcons in excess of fourteen hundred meters a second the faster fs already breaking their pilots hitting the superchargers climbing fast trying to expose only their cold side to the foxbats to deny their afterburners exhaust to the heatseeking acrids one american turned too late and a dirty orange burst lit up inside a cloud followed by broken thunder the other three falcons were on the northern flank of the foxbats who now had separated three going ahead to fulda gap three remaining to engage watching his hud headup display afterburners on full going air to air delcorte saw the green impact line on the hud where graphics condensed a thousand variables to a single display the target vector was arcing right cutting through three parallel lines there was such a jumble of chatter radio cuts from the technicolor spread of the tank battles far below him fragments of other nato feedins aerial and ground control a smattering of russian that delcorte feeling he was oding on noise shut them all down except for that of his own formation he rolled the falcon tried for a scissors turning hard left and was on a foxbats tail one hundredth of a second later the huds three green horizontals were cut by a green arc ending in a dot delcorte flicked the stick again the dot moved toward center the foxbat banked hard left delcortes lines altered the dot slipping below the line delcorte cursing flicking the stick again not worrying about sighting the russians afterburner sliding in with the cannon he flicked one twice more but held his fire at this angle the foxbat could outrun his bullets the green dot shifted centered he pressed the red themillimeter cannon sounding like a rip in the fuselage he saw parts of the foxbat breaking off pulled away before any more came at him three foxbats had been destroyed by the three falcons but the nato air forces problem here as elsewhere was starkly evidenced by the encounter the american falcons had killed the three russian migs but with the sovietwarsaw pacts plus fighters against natos not counting the soviet fighters in russia the deadly equation was still there since the first sortie at dawn delcorte had lost sixteen pounds but now once more he like the other three americans felt exhilarated by the kill as they now headed down to bomb and strafe the long supply columns stretching out across east germany the enemys breakout all along natos front from austria to the baltic continuing unabated delcortes right wingman fired a sparrow from twenty miles at a soviet swing wing he d mistaken a flogger mig equipped with a high lark fiftymile range nose radar for a flogger d save the heavy stuff delcorte cut in only when we need it he was reminding the pilot but not saying it on open channel of what theyd been told in the ready room that morning that natos supply of all aa and as missiles was dwindling until the convoys got through the mig at the end of the sparrows maximum range dropped a pod of flares or highballs as the americans called them the mig rolling away at relatively low speed reducing the temperature of its exhaust while the mig pilot hoped to obmanutto suckerthe american missile to one of the flares if it was a heat seeker he momentarily disengaged his radar as an added precaution just in case the missile wasnt a heat seeker it saved him die sparrow made to home in on radar signals not infrared im gonna get me a phoenix complained the wingman in disappointment no evading that baby delcorte said nothing other than to tell the others to follow peeling off to attack a goods train winding through the foothills of the eastern harz mountains note for debriefing delcorte told the others it was the first train theyd seen moving in broad daylight so close to what had been the border between the two germanys running trains in the daytime was dangerous in any war even though contrary to public belief a rail link was extremely hard to put out of action for long even with stateoftheart jets a daylight run might mean however that supplies at the front were running dangerously low if this could be confirmed by allied intelligence pilots in other sectors it could be important for nato to launch counterattacks with fewer nato troops now rather than waiting later for a buildup whos got the brownie asked delcorte i have answered his left wingman delcorte knew he should have known who was on camera but after three sorties today five the day before twelve no thirteen planes down the detail of who was designated recon duty had escaped him get a shot of that no problem for a moment as they went below ten thousand for the attack run delcorte saw the humps of mountains where there was no evidence of fighting even though he knew that on the other side of the range there was the beleaguered british army of the rhine dutch troops trapped with them farther down more nato divisions primarily americans and west germans were trying to hold ground on the central and southern front so that to anyone west of the harz the whole planet must seem afire with war only here high above could one appreciate the fact that there were areas that the war had not yet touched on the first run in the train mostly boxcars rounded fuel wagons interspersed with quads of antiaircraft guns was going into a long slow turn over a canal bingo called one of the other pilots signaling his fuel warning light was on and that he was breaking formation heading back to base delcorte centered his two fivehundredpounders released them felt the plane buffeted by wind sheer as he climbed the bombs bursting either side of the line but close enough that their craters tore out rail lengths the train wobbled for a second beautiful colonel came another pilots congratulation as he too headed back to base the train now looked like a choppedup worm the rear section thrown helterskelter off the rails only the front cars about thirty still upright but off track one its side split spilling a load of sulfur the yellow in stark contrast to the green fields by the track but delcorte knew that derailing the train would delay it only a matter of hours and so he and the remaining fs came in again delcorte leading he never saw the missile only felt a thump somewhere on the fuselage and the f shaking violently he pulled the stick back and gave her full power he was climbing but barely and it felt like a hearttesting machine that no matter what he did would not allow him to go faster sweat pouring from him instruments jiggling fuel warning light on a pinsandneedles sensation in his right leg he was at three thousand quickly he tightened his harness pulled his legs hard together reached up overhead gripped the two ejector rings and pulled them down over his front with the sound of a pistol shot the cockpit was gone the ejection the most violent shock hed ever felt and all he could think about was whether the pins and needles in his right leg meant he was shot up the walls of blue sky spinning cloud and green fields the brown of a farmhouse coming up at him for a second he was convinced the chute hadnt opened but then quite suddenly he seemed still in the air the drag weight growing heavier under his arms and he had the sensation of actually moving upward though he was still drifting down a good seven miles from the train now a thin black line in the harzs purple foothills when he landed there was still not much feeling in his leg but he could see he wasnt shot he made no attempt to hide the parachute as it was inconceivable to him that though he was in the countryside anyone would have failed to see him land but when he spotted the truck greenuniformed troops standing in the back against the wooden slat side he began pulling the parachute in feeling oddly enough that hed be in trouble if he didnt littering he knelt down by the camouflagepatterned chute took out his standardissue placed it on the chute felt for the emergency ration pack slipped the packet in his flying suit and stood up hands held high walking well away from the sidearm so theres be no possible misunderstanding the truck stopped ten feet from him and a stout gdr home force officer came out pistol drawn looking grumpily at him and walking over with the exaggerated stride of a minor official peering at the chute and the but touching neither as if there might be some booby trap then he started shouting at delcorte pointing in the distance to what presumably was the train wreck the other door slammed and a woman in khaki came bustling out yelling at the man in what delcorte was pretty sure was russian the man tried to cut in several times but she wouldnt let him and kept shouting at him delcorte felt ridiculous but didnt figure this was the time to grin let alone laugh but for some inexplicable reason perhaps because of his fatigue he began hiccupping he thought of emily his fifteenyearold who had given him her recipe for curing the hiccups swallow a glass of water hands up high and hold your breath thats crazy no truly daddy try it delcorte heard the russian woman walk to the parachute then she was beside him cupping her hand over thes hammer she fired once the hole was very round and she was relieved nothing had spat back on her uniform as the american flyer staggered legs crumpling like a rag doll the east german said the american was still looking at them but the russian officer told him that was nonsense he couldnt possibly be alive in any case it was quite clear to the east german that she wasnt going to waste another bullet as she walked over and put the in the americans right hand she went back to the truck and returned with an old voigtlander camera there was a loud argument about the correct exposure as it was getting dark and the old vito b camera didnt have a light meter f said one of the soldiers no no for it will be washed out youll see the russian woman said theyd better make up their minds because soon there wouldnt be enough light left and berlin wanted just such a photo to show the world how the american terrorist bombers so shamed by what theyd done preferred to commit suicide than answer to the people no one will believe that one of the younger soldiers said scornfully thats not the point comrade the russian told him it will tell the people what to do with american pilots she went to click the camera and discovered the film hadnt been advanced there was a murmured insult about moscow knowitalls she ignored it hes still moving said one of the soldiers suicides dont shoot themselves twice comrade said the russian what do you mean comrade lieutenant the soldier asked her think it out for yourself she said put him in the trunk he was so heavy it took four of them to hoist him aboard his head lolling completely lifeless now in the lavender light of autumn sky two of them turning their heads away in disgust the other two in their late teens laughing hysterically what is so amusing asked the russian officer she was from the political corps whose members were stationed in every warsaw pact village and town to help render fraternal assistance to russias allies he is making a bad smell said one of the giggling youths it is quite natural she said earlier that day in southwestern germany miles away a twentysixyearold american lieutenant and a lance missiles crew of three had readied their truck under camouflage netting they were in a clearing deep in the heavily wooded area on the german side of the frenchgerman border over ninety miles west of the confluence of the isar and danube in the pinescented air mixed with the acrid odors of the battle raging barely fifty miles east of them the first of the conventional warhead mobile launch batteries to fire in world war iii was in the countdown five four three two the american lieutenant turned the switch and with a feral roar the twentyfoot lance streaked up the ramp on its fortymile journey eastward toward the czechoslovakian and russianled tank divisions pouring through and over the alluvial flats of the danube the moment she had closed the circuit lt margaret ford snapped closed the lid of the khaki shoot and scoot box okay lets go the threeman crew needed no encouragement for all of them knew that within five minutes of the rockets firing the sovietwp detection units on the czechgerman border would have them vectored in and theyd be under counter battery fire chapter fiftytwo general freeman was dreaming it was long ago and in the dream he was gazing down through the shotdirtied air as french cannonades steadily walking toward his lines their noise stunning many a soldier by freemans side continued their deadly fire and the muskets of his own infantry squares steamed in the rain from countless volleys and still napoleons infantry advanced smoke from their cannons rolling in front of the big guns like fog now and then the sound of a french musket ball striking his swords scabbard gave off the strange eerie sound of someone rubbing his fingers about the rim of a champagne glass and all around him like an errant ghost was the sweet smell of wheat trampled under the boots of napoleons army his horse strained at the bridle and through a gap in the smoke freeman saw the first line of french cuirassiers the squadrons second line of cavalry advancing at the walk some twenty yards behind freeman doubted theyd begin the swinging gallop as yet the slippery ground littered with dead soldiers and mounts if indeed they began it at all it was late in the day at waterloo europe held its breath and still the prussian reinforcements had not appeared there was no time left he drew his sword he awoke in pitch darkness heard voices unsure of where he was then felt the yaw of the ship his eyes sandpaperdry from the heat of the recycled air freeman glanced at his watch three am someone was knocking on his cabin door he flicked on the reading light swung his legs off the bunk and was pulling on his boots as the knocking continued from long habit and in one fluid motion his left hand reached out took the ninemillimeter beretta revolver and placed it firmly in the left shoulder holster he stood buttoning up his tunic come in the moment he saw al bankss face he knew something was wrong a small worriedlooking rok army captain was with him general said banks washingtons cabled us were to put the operation on hold what goddamn it why banks handed freeman the decoded transcript international situation demands you postpone operation trojan stopthe rest of the message was merely an advisory of the cnos order to the lph saipans skipper to withdraw fifty miles from her present position which would place her a hundred miles east of the interdiction of the thirtyeighth parallel and the korean coast by god said freeman jaw clenching crumpling the message in his right hand and turning to the map of korea taped to the bulkhead above his desk theyre in bed with the communists he looked quickly from banks to the hapless rok officer who was swallowing hard this is a goddamned plot said freeman the rok officer looking nervously at banks who knew better than to try to assuage the severity of the shock the general was now pacing between the desk and the blackedout porthole by god i smell state department all over this those bastards in foggy bottom are in bed with the communists the rok officer was clearly alarmed dont worry captain freeman told him im not mad mad im just plain mad those pansies back there in foggy gulch are doing a deal with those chinks its tit for tit freeman stopped stared up at the brownspined green of korea his fingers running through his gray hair then turned slowly to the other two he appeared slightly dazed recovered his composure and spoke slowly without anger but with the tone of the betrayed a betrayal so deep it was only now fully registering theyre giving up korea he said beijings putting on the pressure and those yellowbellies at the state department are telling the president to lay off give up korea for a promise of nonintervention by china elsewhere he paused the tendons in his neck tight as cables we gentlemen are being sold down the river maybe youre right general al banks replied but well have to tell the men right away most of the choppers are on the flight deck yes freeman agreed pass the word as banks left the cabin freeman put his arm round the rok officers shoulder looking down at the mans name tag kim dae there were more kims in korea than smiths in america youre no relation to that nka bastard are you no sir kim replied hastily well dae let me tell you one of the worst moments in a commanders life is having all your men pumped up ready to go and then nothing orders canceled like theyre all ready to sit their final examinations and you have to tell them its off only postponed said dae encouragingly the general sighed his hand dropping from the koreans shoulder exhaling audibly in the small cabin that he knew was but a pinpoint in the darkness temporarily postponed said kim trying again freeman hands on hips looked up again at the map and shook his head in disbelief by god to think that all those brave men in that perimeter might be sacrificial lambs its unforgivable he paused for a few seconds and my speech kim was nonplussed about the speech one of the best i ever made said freeman his gaze so fixed it seemed as if he could see straight through the bulkhead by god those men were ready for it i cannot believe the american president would do this proffered kim freeman said nothing i am sure he will not abandon us general well see captain well see the canberra bombers were now over west germany in high cloud that extended all the way back from the harz below sixtythree miles south of hanover and outflanked by the soviets fortyseventh tank and th motorized infantry divisions pressing home the attack to secure the port of rotterdam one of the west german aa battery commanders requested an iff friend or foeidentification code from the planes the canberras responded but their radio beams were scrambled by migs patrolling out of rostock miles northwest of bremen the migs were jamming nato ground control as they came round over lübecker bay to attack the besieged us third corps who in an unexpected counterattack had destroyed three sovietwp pontoon bridges over the weser thus delaying the fall of bremen the west germany battery commander glimpsed an aircrafts lizard patch underside for only a fraction of a second but it was all he needed to convince the sturmbannführer to unleash his mobile batteries of allweather rolands three minutes later his crews reported that fifteen of the twentyfour missiles had found their mark three of the nine misses being due to circuit malfunction a graball soldiers phrase covering everything from a slight wobble of the launch sleeve to a problem with the rolands oxidizer sometimes the soft ground gave way beneath the trucks under the impact of the backblast and this could throw the rocket off course a short while later the rolands crews noticed that some of the debris coming down wing segments bore the distinctive red white and blue ball of the royal air force it was not long after this that the commander realized he had destroyed fifteen of twentyfour canberra bombers chapter fiftythree north atlantic the big chinooks making the distinctive wokka wokka sound that gave them their nickname lived up to their reputation as one of the most reliable helicopters ever made for william spence however slipping between consciousness and blackouts from the pain the noise of the rotors slicing their way over the heaving darkness of the atlantic was a torture the promise of deliverance fading by the second as he lay strapped into one of the six stretchers how long he had been in the helicopter minutes or hours he did not know at times the pain was merely a sore heaviness in his extremities at others so stilettolike that his body involuntarily heaved and jerked violently against the restraint straps and always added to the buffeting in gusts of foul weather there was the oppressive stifling smell of oil lost in his delirium he thought it was the smell of the chinooks fuel causing his nose to feel as if it were plugged with cotton wool sinuses so blocked that all his breathing was by mouth his lips cracked dry by the time the chopper was approaching the tiny slice of light that was the natodesignated hospital ship uss bahama queen four hundred miles northeast of newfoundland the redcrosspainted landing pad was the stern platform of the twentythousandtonner a converted cruise ship or love boat as they were called which had quickly been pressed into service as a hospital relay ship by the us government so hasty was the conversion that many of the plush luxury fittings were still aboard and while nurses like lana la roche and her three colleagues had enjoyed walking on shag carpets down the passageways where private and semiprivate rooms now served as wards and a series of operating rooms the senior surgeon had ordered all such carpets drapes and so forth removed in order to create a more aseptic environment normally it was a job that would have been done in the halifax yards but war and the fate of convoy r had meant making do with what was available which for matron given the perennial shortage of nurses meant having to tolerate the eager beavers as she called lana and what she saw as lanas clique there was no clique but matron was convinced as she told a disinterested nurses aide that the younger nurses congregated about the la roche girl no doubt because of her connections lanas and the other girls bravery in volunteering for sea duty was not in matrons view anything to be lauded it was a nurses duty to be where she should be in times of need and she remained convinced that the la roche girl was merely grandstanding shell be gone in six months matron declared confidently to those few she had selected as her chums in the head nurses mess that type never stays she pronounced sipping her tea from one of the bahama queens royal doulton cups unlike the thick institutional mugs she was used to here one minute girls like that gone the next novelty wears off i wouldve thought dared one of her chums that shed be much better off with her husband i mean all that money servants probably matron put her cup down shaking her head at the others naïveté thats just it dont you see those kind of people with too much money get bored simply run out of things to do dont you know she said affecting an upperclass condescension i would have thought she could have chosen something a bit less dangerous another contested tosh said matron russians wouldnt dare attack a hospital ship oh no she went on seeing one of her chums about to interject i dont think its because they wouldnt like to that theyre humane certainly not people are capable of anything i know that but they wont because the brouhaha internationally would be very bad publicity not good propaganda at all ms brentwood as she prefers to be called knows that very well the red barshaped light came on they were bringing in the first wounded the most serious ones from the convoy others less seriously hurt had been lifted to the nearest ships in the convoy to have their wounds attended to later in halifax as the nurses hurried to the emergency bays rubber soles squeaking along carpetless passageways it struck lana how well insulated the ship was for the big chinook was almost upon them and yet the sound of both its rotors was barely audible until she reached the floodlit stern opening the last door she saw rain pelting through the air above the landing platform a platform that only weeks before had been a swimming pool tourists languidly drowsing their hours away en route to where it didnt matter the journey itself being the occasion she bowed her head in the face of the driving noise and spray then withdrew as ordered by the deck officer to what had been a pub aboard the cruise liner at least she thought there was no doubt about the destination of this ship the purpose of ones life aboard her as stretcher after stretcher was lowered and unloaded by seamen straining and slipping on the weatherwild deck despite the stabilizers of the bahama queen the ship was rising and falling enough to make unloading the chinooks a precarious business as they hovered twenty feet above the deck like some great insects in the night intravenous bottles swinging with even the slightest roll in the choppy sea everyone anxious for the ship to be under way so she could get her nose into the wind and reduce the yaw refusing the bright yellow wetweather gear available to her matron was the first nurse to meet the incoming wounded on the blustery deck she like the officer of the deck had ordered the others to wait inside and watching her several of the nurses warned that shed catch her death of a cold but lana doubted it the cold would be too afraid she told her friends yet lana admired battleax as matron had become known among the junior nurses and when one of them commented its a grandstand play thats all wants to show how macho she is lana looking out at the matrons stout frame no more than a white woolen cardigan over her uniform and rubber boots which matron insisted on calling gum boots to protect her from the elements disagreed i dont think she wants to look tough said lana well then whats she doing it for asked elizabeth she got a death wish i think she wants to be the first one the men see when they come aboard lordy said elizabeth that face aint gonna cheer them up honey one look at her theyll want to head back to war the other nurses laughed except for lana her arms crossed mood pensive as her group of four waited to be assigned one of the wounded no i think its important to her lana continued that the wounded see a nurses uniform know theyre going to be looked after straightaway lana paused for a moment trying to recall the words from one of the halifax lectures remember emotional first aid in the first few hours is psychologically elizabeth chimed in as important to recovery as handson medical treatment very good liz clapped one of the others elizabeth was nodding toward the deck as the last two stretchers were lowered ropes on either end held taut by deck crew to stop them from spinning talking bout handson treatment children id like to get my hands on that bosun id give that sweetheart all the first aid he wanted elizabeth said lana thats disgusting elizabeth smiled across at her friend lana this wars just startin honey and its gonna get a whole lot worse fore it gets better if it can get better put in one of the two canadian nurses exactly said elizabeth so get it when you can babe before the mushrooms start sproutin my god said the other canadian girl you really think some crazyll push the button elizabeth watching matron trailing the last casualty into the reception area on the starboard side where seamen were unbuckling the wounded replied some crazy started that honey all ten casualties now unloaded the staff in the reception room once the ships stern deck casino were now quickly returning the stretchers to the chopper the matron entered soaking wet la roche your charge is spence first name william she looked at the other two canadian nurses you two prep him i want a full sheet on him as soon as possible la roche matron lana had given up on getting her to call her miss brentwood before he goes into surgery check his tags for allergies said matron yes matron the matron paused have any of you seen an amputation before i mean in theater not in the training films none of them had well nows your chance my guess is youll be seeing lots of them but theres no time like the present there is no observation theater aboard of course but i could ask the surgeon i wouldnt mind matron said elizabeth very well she looked challengingly at the other nurses her eyes settling on lana i think you should more experience you get more use youll be if of course you want to be useful they were all shamed into it good matron said theater two in she lifted the watch that was resting on her ample bosomoh four fifteen she said and let the watch go the captain will be heading into the wind to give us as much stability as possible but there will of course be sliding from time to time thats where you can be of some help pick the instrument up and into the sterilizer straightaway is it a bullet wound asked elizabeth in a tone that told them all shed seen plenty of those were not sure but both hands will have to come off hanging by mere threads oh matron one of the canadian nurses turned the color of chalk she had been feeling a little seasick since the ship had stopped wallowing more at the mercy of the sea than when under way if only someone had packed them in ice said the matron matteroffactly but the helo had to pick up another four casualties lana was struck by the fact that the matrons british turn of speech became decidedly americanized when referring to military matters such as calling the choppers helos rather than helicopters as the two canadian nurses did my god said the other canadian are there any ships left in that convoy ive no idea ours is not to reason why all right enough chatter to work she paused oh one more thing after you scrub up be sure not to use your hands to maintain your balance its the natural thing to do aboard ship and its very unhygienic as they undressed the wounded englishman lana carefully avoided looking anywhere else but at the mans face it was the first shock she was to receive that night he looked so young as to be no more than fifteen or sixteen never mind that the id tags said he was nineteen there was no allergy code on the tags as they cut away the young sailors oil and watersodden blue shirt woolen sweater and trousers careful not to touch the raw lumps of mangled bone and flesh that had been his hands the strong smell of oil persisted and lana bending down sniffing unselfconsciously like a bloodhound over a corpse discovered that the oil smell seemed to be coming from his hair and made a note of it elizabeth smelled it too they start that bone saw up in there they could have a fire sometimes elizabeths callousness or was it simply forthrightness or insensitivity shocked the other nurses but after jay la roche it rarely bothered lana what did bother her in the or was the surgeons knife severing the tendons she passed out and ended up with what elizabeth called a kingsized lump on her forehead which matron pronounced was la roches own silly fault when she had revived enough for two of the other nurses to walk her out of the theater matron had assailed her with the comment you almost struck the surgeon how many times do i have to tell you if youre going to pass out please do so away from the table will the boy live lana asked later hes young someone said yes thought lana praying for him as fervently as she had once prayed for herself in her war with jay oh lord she asked as outside the atlantic gale howled unabated about the lighted ship let him live chapter fiftyfour north atlantic in the clear cold dawn bluewhite bergs calved by the land ice of the greenland mass and floating south beyond cape farewell into the labrador current now approached newfoundland with ominous majesty towers of purest white as the sun climbed higher above a dark blue sea and against the aquamarine sky the chop of the previous night had now abated over the grand banks and the bahama queen sliced through the big swells as if the urgent nocturnal activity just hours before had never happened as if thought lana the world were at peace she was sitting in the intensive care unit referred to as the deluxe suite which it had been in its prewar days the intravenous drip was regular william spences heartbeat a little weak but all other vital signs were indicating the nineteenyearold had pulled through the double amputation the young mend fast the surgeon had said his scalpel indicating the severed hands which unknown to the ships crew would soon be dumped over the side with the other parts and garbage healthy tissue the surgeon had proclaimed as one might refer to a horse worth buying if wed gotten to him earlier still lucky to be alive luckylana wasnt so sure about that maybe ones future was written in the stars and we called it luck but she still harbored the conviction that you made your own luck but if so had it been preordained that her marriage was to be a disaster was god then darkness as well as light if so why had she prayed so fervently for this young englishmans life did she really believe she wondered or was she a fairweather believer had her prayer accomplished anything or was prayer simply another way of so channeling so concentrating your psychic energy that you did more than you normally would to help the situation to a successful conclusion especially when a young life hung by a thread as she watched the pristine beauty of the icebergs and the vastness of the sea she thought of her brother ray who their mother had written was now entering yet another series of plastic surgery operations and she realized that though shed been unable to help her brother in the purposeless and directionless vacuum following her marriage the young english sailor had become for her a kind of surrogate for her wanting to help to do something anything and an escape from her personal ordeal a chance to look after another victim of cruel circumstance alone as she had been alone she took a lemonglycerol swab from the kidney basin and gently daubed his lips he was conscious now mumbling what must have been a dozen questions his eyes opening for a fraction of a second then closing the mumbling ceasing replaced by a guttural rumbling snore elizabeth offered to sit with the wounded man to give lana a break but lana said shed stay on and besides there were more than enough nurses for the fiftythree cases now aboard all right honey said elizabeth but dont you go getting attached hear you know what happens elizabeth smiled lana you can rest easy on my account besides she said sardonically im a married woman remember thats what i mean said elizabeth in her usual forthright tone hes just a boy lana replied and youve got a soft streak in you a mile wide said elizabeth youre not his mama you start with that and youll be all burnedout fore christmas lana smiled touched as always by elizabeths concern how come you know all about it miss ryan she asked elizabeth with mock formality elizabeth looked down at her friend you always xray people not if i can help it lana replied goodnaturedly i just think this is the case of the pot calling the kettle they cracked up both laughing at the appropriateness or was it the inappropriateness of the cliche lana dropping her head against elizabeths stomach still giggling there was a sharp tapping noise on one of the glazed windows of the deluxe suite that looked out on the gigantic berg outside on the promenade deck glaring at them through the glass with illconcealed annoyance was matron she was obviously saying something sharp to them but the double glazing made it impossible to hear matrons voice coming out from the red face in a series of barklike sounds was quickly whipped away by the wind her blue cape ballooning quivering violently about her in the stiff atlantic wind both lana and elizabeth tried their best to look properly contrite but elizabeth a look of abject apology on her face murmured watch out you dont take off you silly old bitch that did it they both doubled up laughing the blue balloon was now moving down the deck against the roll of the ship heading for the nearest door im gone said elizabeth elizabeth lana shouted dont you leave your shift honey im just visiting a minute later the whirlwind came in hair wild if theres one thing i will not tolerate miss brentwood its flagrant disregard for a patients wellbeing we were only sharing a joke matron a joke so you think wars a joke lana simply refused to be baited excuse me she said and moved to check the iv drip a joke repeated matron louder this time the drip was a little slow and lana unscrewed the clamp a touch i fail to see began matron but then the pa system crackled to life a mans voice matron please report to or two matron to or two ill deal with you later she said to lana her hair still windstrewn looking like the wreck of the hesperus as she bustled off with an air of officious efficiency when she entered the prep room for or two matron was still angry and realized shed gowned up before she knew it hands held high she backed through the swing doors into the or there was no one there she accused elizabeth ryan outright matron i dont know a thing about it honest ill find out matron declared ill find out i wont be made a fool of by anyone no one would own up to the false call despite the captain initiating his own informal investigation enjoying the joke as much as anyone as bahama queen continued down newfoundlands coast passing three more bergs the dark line of newfoundlands cliffs far off to starboard matron continued her investigation her dislike for ryan and la roche having curdled to childish absurdity in its intensity and would have been dismissed as such later on had it not been for its dire consequences which like the bulk of the icebergs lay hidden far beneath the surface for the first groggy day william spence thought his hands must be badly damaged the phantom feeling that he still had his appendages persisting until the doctor had told him what theyd had to do when the reality hit when his mind grasped what sensation still denied lana touching his shoulder gently try as he might he could not stop crying his humiliation made worse by the mundane fact that unlike anyone else in the world he couldnt wipe his tears away his cumbersome attempt to do so with the bandaged stumps was at once grotesquely comic and awful to watch his bumbling effort reflected in his sickroom mirror lana knew she was caring too much but couldnt help it for in return for her kindness her attention to the smallest detail william spence she knew was falling in love with her once before there was a brief sojourn in boston general during her six months stint as a student nurse and she had seen it many times and knew it was a common enough phenomenon the rapidity with which young men especially fell for the angels of mercy but here far from his home the intensity of feeling for someone tending his every need from a sip of water to a bedpan who touched him held his wrist gently for a minute taking the beat of his heart meant more than home and for a young man experiencing his first time at sea his first time away lana became mother and sweetheart so loved so passionately desired that the very hint of her perfume filled him with life those first few days and when the coughing began lana held him during the violent episodes mat would go on for minutes at a time until the stumps of his arms throbbing with pain he would collapse back onto the pile of pillows ironically during these episodes his face flushed by the coughing would take on a healthylooking pink compared to the drained postoperative face of a few days before and she was with him as he talked with the intimacy that only patients and airline passengers do telling her of how different he was from his father for whom everything had to be explained in terms of rational behavior how they had difficulty in getting close to each other though he clearly admired and loved his father a great deal i suppose said william tiredly his mouth dry the morphine barely holding the pain at bay all fathers are like that and all sons not all lana replied struck by the fact that he had so shyly avoided calling her by her first name no one had told him she was separated and in his naïveté not seeing a wedding band or engagement ring it hadnt occurred to him that she might have been married a belief that only made his dreams of making love to her as the untouched she all the more erotic and insistent normally in the other hospitals it was the practice to assign male nurses to assist the incapacitated male patients in bathing shaving and so forth but with most eligible males being called up for what some generals were now secretly saying would be a longer war the overwhelming bulk of the nursing jobs fell to the female nurses and the nurses aides the first morning after they had sailed past the icebergs north of newfoundland and were heading along the islands western coastline lana bathed him he had been too groggy to notice and had kept falling back to sleep the second morning however he was as aware of his erection as she his face turning beetred she simply put a warm washcloth over it saying its what we in the trade call a tent means youre getting better he tried to think of anything else cold showers long walks but nothing worked the astonishing sexiness of her uniform that was not supposed to be sexy was too much for him and he grew harder lana returned to the subject of his family asking about his mother anne wasnt it his sisters rosemary and georgina i think you said rosemary was a teacher she said beginning to make the bed giving him an excuse to turn away ah yes he said so tense so ill at ease he imagined that being interviewed for assistant chef at the savoy couldnt be more anxietyproducing yes he answered ah rosemarys a teacher english shakespeare uhhuh replied lana in london yes er i mean no ah she teaches in a public school ah what youd call a lana gently raised his right arm a private school he raced on i dont think you have them in america private schools oh yes i went to one before college oh i mean you dont call them public schools you call them private we call private public he was in a torture of embarrassment and lust its all very confusing im afraid not really she said smiling youre just all mixedup over there yes he admitted freely yes we are rather there was an awkward silence as she fluffed the pillows behind him her perfume washed over him lana gently moved his arm would you like me to bring a tape recorder for you immediately he thought of a tape measure maybe his wasnt as big as others shed seen how many had she the filthy bastards tape he asked his voice raspy cracking as if shed said snake to send home to your family she removed the facecloth softly swiftly pulling up the sheet as it touched his loins he was terrified hed have an orgasm right there it would be sheer bliss then he realized what she was telling him ever so nicely no more than nicely wonderfully he smelled her perfume again drinking it in he loved her the thought of doing it with her hed never had any woman suddenly seemed rather dirty unbecoming of her beauty her goodness she had he now realized really been telling him ever so gently that while he could never write again he could and should start thinking about other people how his parents would be sick with worry after the rather brief message that had been sent to inform the war office of his whereabouts and condition it was her thoughtfulness that touched him now and stoked his need for her as mother and lover but he could see no chance of the dream materializing while he was waiting for the tape william spences brain raced with the things he had to tell his parents for despite a persistent weakness and the exhausting episodes of coughing his spirits were buoyed by lanas presence when she brought the tape it was as if hed suddenly developed stage fright couldnt think of a single thing to say ever considerate lana had started the recorder and left but the tape in motion only made it more difficult for him to think of something to say though hed tried clumsily to push the stop button with his elbows he sent the machine instead crashing to the deck he was in such an agitated state that tears of exhaustion and rage streamed down his face and he started another bout of coughing humiliation heaped on top of his frustration with his inability to perform such an elementary task when she returned lana interpreted the signs at first as evidence of indescribable pain but if he had such difficulty why hadnt he pushed the buzzer his elbow would easily then she saw that the cord with its emergency push button had swung away down the side of the cot as hed made a grab for the recorder which now lay on the deck its plastic case cracked the tape unraveling she eased him back on the pillows and taking a moistened towel wiped his face her voice as soothing as her touch she told him not to worry about it she would bring another and would think of something so that he could stop and start a recorder by himself as she leaned over him tucking in the bedclothes her breasts touched his chest and he wanted to hold her kiss her it was an ache inside of him i love you he said simply she said nothing for a moment or two straightening up the bedclothes then stopped i know she said softly and bent down to collect the broken pieces of the tape recorder when she brought him a second recorder the talking came easily as now that hed declared himself to her all things were possible he spoke of his older sister rosemary with whom he shared a fond affection he was not anywhere as intellectual or trained in the classics as she was he told lana but rosemary had never made him feel that not going on to university was a shame unlike georgina who as fiery as she was young and beautiful had castigated him soundly for not having a social conscience and planning to do something with your life georgina was in her third year at london school of economics and political science and her social conscience had embraced the left of the political spectrum a born protester her father often lamented claiming not too far from the truth that she seemed to have more causes then courses it was still difficult for william to speak to his father even on the tape he reminisced about the walks up on the chalk downs the small winding treeshaded lanes and the holidays they had spent cruising the canals once so awfully neglected but now largely restored like the twobargewide lock at stoke bruerne where all the people had lined the canal to watch them squeeze through petrol must be rationed now when it came to the double amputation he spoke quickly about the wonders of modern technology how nurse brentwood had told him of the fantastic things they were doing with computercontrolled limbs these days and how things you never realized tape for example were a darn sight easier than having to write a long letter never was much of a speller anyway was i he asked his father but he could not tell his father he loved him no matter how much banter or reminiscence might have provided the opportunity to say it he tried to say it outright near the tapes end but the words choked and he ended with a cheery love to all not realizing how many times hed mentioned how kind and what a wonderful person nurse brentwood was not using her first name as for him to have done this would have somehow constituted an invasion of his love for her cheapened it in some way the name lana had become something intensely private to him something he carried with him by the time he had finished the tape he was coughing again from the exertion this time so badly that lana took it upon herself to go and suggest to the senior medical officer that he authorize an x ray that your boyfriend in two oh one the young medical captain asked the patient said lana icily in two oh one yes why the captain pressed reverting to rank after her rebuff well im used to patients having that acetonelike breath with a bad cold flu or something on top of what theyve got already but his breath smells of oil i think he must have inhaled some quite possible but we should have noticed if there was a problem before this its difficult to sometimes proffered lana every man that came aboard i mean thats been in the water lately had it on him hair fingernails lipid pneumonia said the doctor his tone more reasonable now possible sometimes doesnt show up for twentyfour hours or so lana also remembered that it only needed a few milliliters of oil in the lungs for it to be fatal in some cases all right said the doctor lets have a look at him i wouldnt mention why though no of course said lana nurse yes she turned the doctor was taking off his stethoscope slipping it into his white coat sorry about that boyfriend crack uncalled for im glad weve got nurses like you thank you she said and as she walked away the captain watched her for a long time his fingers drumming on the stethoscope coming into the room matron saw him watching lana brentwood as against regulations lana went down the stairs between upper and main deck facing forward instead of backward for safetys sake the captain was watching her backside through the very proper starch of her uniform doctor he jumped yes matron one oh eight i think you should see him i think hes a malingerer evidence oh all vital signs are normal thats what first aroused my suspicion hmm still the captain countered never quite know with these possible neuro cases weve done the pointed stick bit on him let me check the doctor scanned the list of thirtyseven cases far as i remember he didnt feel a thing he said replied matron that he didnt feel a thing im not so sure in any event ive seen some you could stick a hat pin in and they wouldnt flinch not if it meant they could get out of the fighting all right said the mo any suggestions id wait till he was asleep my god youre a sly one matron i could be sued in private practice yes said matron evenly but not in the navy doctor were here to insure yes yes all right ill have a look at he took the chart from matronjohnson now is he asleep im afraid not perhaps said the captain he needs a sedative settle him down a mite matron said nothing she didnt believe in unnecessary medication well when do you suggest pressed the doctor perhaps later this evening the doctor sighed all right but i would have thought weve got better things to do than weed out doctor if i might remind you we have a very specific directive about this from both ottawa and washington we must weed them out set an example besides once they get ashore that type is quite likely to pack up and yes yes all right matron ill jab him in the butt at midnight hows that i dont enjoy this any more than you do doctor no of course not he replied but believing she did as she walked along the deck on her rounds matron saw the line far to the west that marked newfoundland and the tiny dots out from it that were the fishing boats of the grand banks and on the deck below she could see the la roche girl pushing the spence boy to x ray chapter fiftyfive though it was the mass of soviet and warsaw pact armor together with soviet yak groundattack aircraft that had pressed home the first attacks on the nato positions in southern central and northern europe once the battle was joined soviet and nato tanks mixing it up together in the massive confusion of dust smoke and darkness it was the awesome and concentrated fire of the soviet artillery that drove home the breakthroughs while the allies had expected the twentythreemilerange eightypound shells from the soviets selfpropelled bms to precede any soviet breakthrough it was an entirely new development that was now turning some nato withdrawals into routes this was especially true along the alluvial flats of the danube all the way from the austrianczech border in the east westward deep into southern germany for soviet artillery commanders the most impressive and dangerous aspect of american arms was the ability of the americans to move artillery batteries quickly and to reengage within minutes up until the late eighties the us army had also possessed the most accurate millimeter in the world the reason was political in a move that the south african ambassador in ottawa had reported to pretoria as being typically canadian and a move pretoria took immediate advantage of the canadian government had expressed no interest in a new artillery piece designed by a canadian the canadianinvented gun was then built by the south africans a fact that made it ineligible for purchase by the us army whose procurement was closely monitored by antiapartheid lobbies the g as the south africans called the new millimeter gun was a selfpropelled howitzer capable of firing a hundredpound he bagcartridgepropelled shell a distance of fortytwo miles it was the batteries of the sovietpurchased gs that systematically destroyed the american and west german defensive lines and attacks the only comparable guns had been the enormous railmounted weapons of nazi germany the g however was much lighter mounted on a highly mobile vehicle which also carried fortyfour rounds it was not simply that the g batteries with their eightydegree arc of fire and extraordinarily long range could outreach the other allied guns but that the gs accuracy was such that the swp forward observers could see it tearing apart not only the big concentrations of leopards and ms as if they were metal shacks but individual tanks as well not only this but the fortytwomile range of the g meant that the soviet guns were reaching beyond us first and second armored and the west german twelfth armored severing their vital supply lines allowing the bulbouseyed soviet hind choppers to be whisked forward cutting off the trapped american and west german columns picking them off with laser and infrared antitank missiles after ten days of savage fighting the sovietwarsaw pacts thrust along the danube was beginning to pivot northward to join up with those forces that had broken through at fulda and were now separating out into a breaststroke pincer in which the left flank was to drive south to meet up with those coming via the danube the northern prong to meet up with those forces who had smashed through the north german plain to bremen the only real danger to the soviet thrust remained allied air superiority and the possibility albeit a slim one that austria would throw its lot in with nato to thwart this the soviet commander of southern forces europe marshal gordayev had spets teams ready near all river crossings from innsbruck in austrias southwest through salzberg and from austrias northwestern region all the way east to the carpathians on the austroczech border by now nato intelligence was as stunned as seoul had been by the extent of the sabotage by soviettrained sleepers put in place during the detente of the gorbachevreaganbush years as a result nato intelligence teams were as one british foreign office official put it swarming all over the place like a plague of locusts with the result he reported that our chaps by which he meant mi are finding the situation terribly confusing amateurs are tripping all over one another during the night in vienna on the reichsbroche bridge us and british agents even exchanged shots each believing the others were russian operatives about to place an explosive charge midspan the charge turned out to be a rather sturdy soapbox reported the foreign office left by some untidy fishermen of course the foreign office official an under secretary went on to explain to his vexed minister in whitehall no one was hurt our chaps from mi were using revolvers which hadnt been fired i daresay since world war two and the americans getting dangerously close from all accounts luckily heard one of our chaps swearing so vociferously in fact that the american recognized him as british theres no need for that said the minister sternly absolutely no call for profanity i thought we were recruiting a little higher off the shelf than that quite minister but im afraid you see redbrick all over these days different class of people altogether my god you ought to see the written reports dangling participles positively litter the page the minister sighed the trouble was that this egalitarian notion that you were as good as any other man was too entrenched it was enough to make one yearn nostalgically for the dom days of maggie to return but while the vienna mixup was symptomatic of the early days of confusion there was already a recognition by some of the allied heads of stations in austria that if chocolate eclair as the austrian president was known did fall off the fence to the allied side then one of the ideal ways of sabotaging the bridges would be from one of the many barges plying the overtwothousandmile river accordingly mi and cia agents all along the eastwest viennapassau sector on the austrian side were noting the large white numbers on the backs of the barge wheelhouses any barge that proceeded back and forth too often within a twentyfourhour period became marked as a potential target a potential spets sabotage platform the austrian river police worried about offending either side nevertheless inspected many of the barges for explosives for while frightened of offending the soviet union austria was equally concerned about the financial ramifications following an argument with the united states no explosives had been found well of course not said the minister of war dropping the mi report from his hand glancing down at the traffic along whitehall these days you only need a satchel of explosives dont you he asked his secretary the secretary knew it wasnt as easy as that charges had to be placed precisely i think were ready in any case minister replied the secretary if a barge so much as pauses longer than thirty seconds under any of the crossings from austria into czechoslovakia we have informed the austrians they can expect to be fired upon and what if our austrian friends dont turn to us but decide to run with ivan he certainly has the best of the field so far then of course minister said the official smiling we will blow the bridges ourselves hmm the minister was still looking out his window the first time he had done so for twentyfour hours a camping cot having been set up in the office annex as hed stayed behind working hard on the problem of transporting the oil to the continent now that the chunnel had been blocked he was surprised to find it was already dusk as a flock of pigeons dived and whirled in unison toward the stately houses of parliament in a gloomy moment he wondered whether the mother of parliaments would survive he suspected not ive only one problem with your bridge readiness plan hoskins whats that sir the minister a cup and saucer in hand was looking at the distant smudge marks against the sky vapor trails crisscrossing as the royal air force fought for supremacy over the channel perhaps it had been a strategic error to bomb berlin but for the moment retaliation from the sovietwarsaw pact air forces seemed out of the question at least on any large scale the aa defenses in southern england being equipped with american radarinked missile systems that some said were more sophisticated than the aegis system aboard the most advanced american cruisers sir what oh yes said the minister taking a sip of his tea dont you think the russians have already thought of bridge patrols barge spotting and all that unquestionably sir but one can only the minister lurched forward there was a clatter of broken china tea splashing over the desk blotter and hoskins lapel was warm a mixture of blood and tea staring at the dead minister fitz backed away from the shattered window the bullet holes spiderweb radiating from its center bbc and itn were instructed under threat of d notice to report the ministers death as heart attack superintendent favisham pointed out however that this might be a little thin as the minister was known as a physical jerks man jogging and all that i suggest a stroke burst blood vessel can happen to any of us anytime thank you superintendent said the ministers secretary a stroke will do nicely man under enormous pressure he flashed a smile but arent we all the superintendent didnt like him thought he was fruit tread carefully superintendent said the secretary with ballistics and all that you know what these reporters are like theres enough anxiety already he paused any idea who it might be no sir said the super interpol has a long list of potential head cases ready to pop any member indeed then i need hardly tell you superintendent that this will chill every member of cabinet despite the present security theyll want to know whether weve taken all the appropriate precautions theyll certainly be asking how it is that a minister of the crown can be assassinated in broad daylight from government offices on the other side of the street the superintendent shook his head unconsciously dropping his top denture at the same time a habit the under secretary found as irritating as it was vulgar i dont think so sir from across the street i mean acute angle top of his head you see blown right out more like it came up from the street i expect in any case ill need a full report by the telephone light was blinking pms office yes prime minister yes sir of course the secretary put the phone down slowly trying to put on as brave a face as possible were withdrawing along the danube new defense line is from regensburg south to the black forest the superintendents geography was a little rusty he hadnt made it to redbrick let alone oxford or cambridge the best he had was criminology at the polytechnic the secretary explained a withdrawal of some eighty miles were trying to consolidatei think thats what were calling it from regensburg down to switzerland russians have some huge bloody guns up against us apparently trouble is its as far as we can go im afraid with the french right behind us but not behind us if you follow my meaning the superintendent was trying to follow it on the map of europe above the carpet stained where the minister had fallen it was foggy and nearing dawn in the sea of japan ive told the troops captain al banks informed the general howd they take it asked freeman who was sitting at his desk surrounded by maps of the operation washington had called off tell you the truth general said banks i think some of them were pretty relieved freeman nodded natural but it takes the edge off of em al weve got to keep them wound up stop them moping about home girlfriends wives rome burns and we wait said freeman disgustedly we could show them movies sir got lots of them or go over the rehearsals again no not the rehearsals hell we dont know yet whether weve got anything to attack no theyve been over it enough times any more they start thinking they know it all get stale thats dangerous no your idea about movies is a good one al keep morale up the general sat down pulled out his bifocals as discreetly as possible and peered up at the map toward pyongyang several firebird highaltitude photographs showing thered been no substantive changes in the aa positions around the north korean capital in the last twentyfour hours ah i dont know al maybe theyre just sending us this stuff to keep us quiet while they squash the whole idea in washington goddamn it the plans right all we need is the weather to hold and we could give em such a kick in the ass he took off the glasses and dropped them on the desk map i ever tell you about that airplane in canada no general the general rubbed his forehead and sat back left montreal for a place on the prairies ran out of gas halfway there at forty thousand feet air canada it was one of the best safety records in the world then how metric explained freeman smiling sardonically up at the captain took off in montreal checked the goddamn tanks twice converted liters to gallons multiplied by the wrong conversion factor did it twice once when it left montreal second time after it landed in ottawa then bang no gas jesus what happened started to fall like a goddamn rock thats what happened said freeman only thing they had in their favor was the pilotand here the general was pointing at al to drive home the pointone in a million had been trained in gliders was able to manhandle that brute and slide it toward an abandoned airstrip only problem is he was headed for the wrong airstrip until his copilot who happened to have lived in the area years before knew where the right strip was they brought it down undercarriage had no power so failed to lock that saved them otherwise theyd have mowed down about fifty people who used the airstrip as a sunday runaround only casualties occurred when they started going down the escape chutes two rear ones were too high off the ground lot of people got hurt no fatalities and all because of metric al metric ive been triplechecking all of these figures for the attack less gasoline we have to carry more men and ammunition there a problem freeman handed him a xerox of a logistics and supply sheet some ass in washington did a metric on us here look at this nato liaison you see liters instead of gallons would have put all the chinooks into crap city on empty how do you like them apples for cry in out loud im going to stay here until all these figures are checked just in case washington deigns to let us know what the hell theyre doing are they fighting a war or are we going dancing with these bastards i think you could do with a movie yourself general no but you go ahead al and al yes general we have any movies with that fonda dame in em i think so sir throw em overboard sir i i mean it goddamn it said freeman using his folded bifocals as a pointer his frustration at waiting for word from washington bubbling to the surface i wont have that female on my ship in any shape or form whatsoever that understood yes sir al banks didnt think it prudent to remind the general that though he was in command of the possible invasion force it was not his ship to dispose of ships property movies or otherwise but it did occur to banks that perhaps he should advise the general of something else that females three in fact had been in the audience last night as hed delivered his salty and somewhat profane speech to the troops freeman was appalled my god thats terrible women in the audience yes sir freemans right hand ran through the graying hair his left hand with the folded bifocals spreading out in a gesture of utter surprise id no more swear in front of ladies than his head shot up at al banks what the hell were they doing there combat roles general navy choppers mgus whats that mixedgender units supreme court decision that by god freeman said shaking his head those old farts have got a lot to answer for al yes sir the general was pacing again hitching up his belt now and then what kind of woman would want to fight i dont understand it delicate creatures that i dont understand it either general but some of them arent so delicate huh well i suppose you and i qualify as cavemen he paused well as long as theyre in support roles suppose we have to accept the fact long as i dont have to put up with them in tanks there was silence the vibrations of the ship noticeable now the lphs roll increasing by god said freeman his eyes narrowing at banks youre not going to tell me we lost that one too the tanks not in the goddamned tanks afraid so general supreme court previously backed off on some combat roles but they said in a time of national emergency good christ bellowed freeman i told wexler i dont want my men riding around with pussy in the front seat theyve got enough to look after i dont think we have too much to worry about general it just came through in the last week armored units havent got no said freeman and ill tell you what they wont have now i want you to find out who those females were that i unknowingly addressed last night and tell them to come to my cabin freeman grabbed his cap on second thought ill go to them probably a goddamned supreme court decision about them reporting to their commanders cabin ill be charged with molesting pussy on the high seas ladies began freeman ive come here this evening to apologize for any profanity i might have used i ah certainly hope i never made any disparaging remarks about your the opposite sex women in general all of them could have been his daughters for the first time in years he was tonguetied i uh that is to say i never have never will support the use of uh inappropriate language in front of uh women or seek to embarrass uh i m sorry thats all with that freeman turned leaving al banks who barely managed to get in a wink at one of the women before he too was gone trying to catch up to the general inside the three women were looking at one another in astonishment what the fuck was that all about one of them asked dont ask me said another i think hes just oldfashioned a commander chauvinist pig oh put in the third chopper pilot a young sandyheaded girl with a bachelor of science degree out of penn state i think hes kinda cute besides i prefer oldfashioned men cute said one of the other girls after his speech nothing cute about that sweetie hes probably one

men who have values its one way you could get promoted i suppose or get the clap well im glad hes in command they say hes a stickler for details said sandy turning and looking at the barometer still falling and i dont like the thought of driving through this lot with some young whiz kid directing me from back on ship ill be quite happy to have freeman up front if were lucky honey you wont have to drive anywhere washingtonll kill it before it kills us i joined to see the world this is the world i dont like it not this part anyhow who does asked sandy freeman for one hes busting to go you really think washingtonll cancel it i dont know said one of the others were just the gofers around here in schönbühel austria the danube rarely blue more often green with pollution was winding its way slowly along its twothousandmile course through some of the most beautiful country in europe by castles and patchwork fields on through vienna to bratislava in czechoslovakia beneath the ultramodern span of the bridge of the slovak national uprising past the great spires of buda and pest over the great hungarian plain down through yugoslavia to belgrade and on through bulgaria to the rivers great delta in the black sea if you had to bail out the nato pilots said it was best along the danube but not on ulms spire hundreds of pilots did bail out in the first few weeks a third of them falling into enemy hands but the rest except for a dozen or so who met with misadventure hung up in the woods or drowned before they could break free or reach shore found their way back to their units within three or four days along the verdant plain it wasnt simply a matter of friendly populations not yet overrun by the swp juggernaut helping so many fliers but the superb rescue facilities of the nato units who even under the severest weather conditions sweeping down from the carpathians and the bavarian alps would do everything possible to pick up a downed flier for the civilians in southern germany caught between the two sides it was a dangerous business for the advance units of the sovietwarsaw pact attack were almost exclusively russian the latter holding the czech brigade only as support their fighting ability held in contempt by the soviets this meant that if a nato flier was caught by the enemy it would most likely be a russian unit which had a clear and brutal rule anyone having helped the flier was executed along with his or her entire family and the nearest village razed to the ground the girls and women delivered to the soviet troops despite this terror nato fliers still came back aided by civilians who understood that if the cost to the russians of advancing every mile in germany was not maintained the great rollover convoys now en route from new york boston and halifax trying to learn from the experience of convoy rmight well arrive to find nothing to reinforce chapter fiftysix of all the surface ships operating in the north atlantic the minesweeper was now king due to the experience of convoy r wood and fiberglasshulled vessels suddenly emerged from dull mundane and in many cases outright pitied existence in the backwaters of the navy into the exalted ranks of leaders in the age of nuclearpowered missile ships the admiral in command of the hitherto ugly duckling minesweeper fleet of forty ships that were to accompany the first three convoys was told not to gloat but merely to do the job and to do it quickly the minesweepers did the job as quickly as conditions in the atlantic allowed approaching it with the zeal of newfound importance they also gloated oh how they gloated flagging as it was a courtmartial offense to break radio silence the warships behind them with messages such as follow the leader compliments of ms or well tell you when its safe it became an unofficial competition between british and american sweepers as to who could be the most insolent and get away with it the hmas gordon will be happy to show you the way by god fumed a royal navy destroyer captain theyre cheeky bastards to make it worse the canadian and us minesweepers were among those combat support ships allowed to have women aboard one of the american ships uss twin forks was skippered by a woman and on the third day out for one of the massive fourhundred shipconvoys on rollover to europe a pair of womens lacy briefs was hoisted to the masthead compliments of rollover leader this moved a us admiral to issue a firm rebuke by semaphore to the minesweeper but as the message came through the panties were gone the minesweepers captain nonplussed and assured by the crew that the lookouts on the other ship must have been seeing things it was a brief light relief in what was otherwise a grim business four hundred and seventy miles north of newfoundland another convoy was attacked by ten soviet hunterkiller subs all but two of the nuclear subs were destroyed but not before there had been a rununder torpedo assault by all ten subs resulting in thirtyseven allied ships twentyeight of these merchantmen sunk when the convoy had reformed in a defensive diamond east of the sub it found itself unwittingly driven or bloody well herded as one british frigate captain put it into a minefield laid about them by six backfire bombers three of the backfires were shot down on their way into egg laying but their deadly cargoes landed intact here once again the russian numbers pointed to only one conclusion that if the allies could not reduce the rate of loss whatever supplies and men did arrive in europe would be insufficient to replace the men and materiel already lost let alone to reinforce nato in this case the unrelenting sovietwarsaw pact land offense would decide the issue a further complication for nato was the fact that with so many towns and cities in the russians path the swp attacks sent millions of civilians fleeing westward tying up the vitally needed west european road and rail systems by now the uss snbn roosevelt was going up for its second attempt at receiving a vlf burst message this time additional aerial was extruded from the stern like some great worm from the belly of a whale start the count ordered robert brentwood counting five minutes at the threeminute mark brentwood knew he was not going to get a message okay he said evenly at the fiveminute mark reel her in reeling in sir very well mr zeldman resume zigzag pattern for holy loch eta the first officer glanced at the computer as brentwood on the periscope island ordered up search scope up search there was a quiet hum as the oilmirrored scope slid up inside the master sheath housing several other periscopes as well eta holy loch zeldman reported six hours approximate exactly ex six hours three minutes forty seconds sir very well brentwood knew that if the wisconsin aerial farm was out and tacamo aircraft had failed to overlap sufficiently to contact the roosevelt then the united states would have notified uk control to beam out a vlf signal if not it meant the soviets were jamming satellite bounceoff signals between the states and britain or the british aerials at holy loch were knocked out or holy loch itself was in the hands of the soviets brentwood knew he had only three choices stay where he was head for holy loch and risk a trap of acousticpressure mines at the entrance some keyed to roosevelts specific signature or run for cover and head back to the united states he reversed his cap eye glued to the scope he flicked on the control room monitor relay so the men on watch could see the same infrared images he saw nothing but gray waves stacked all about them creased with white lines of bioluminescence moss in tubes one and two moss in tubes one and two sir very well eta holy loch eta five hours fiftyseven minutes speed thirty knots increase to fortyfive increasing to fortyfive one of the planesmen glanced over from his steering column at the operator on trim rolling his eyes heavenward watch the dials sailor said zeldman sharply yes sir revised eta holy loch asked robert brentwood four hours answered zeldman including corrections for currents plus or minus fifteen minutes very well no active sonar passive only passive only call me when were ten miles off yes sir as brentwood left the reddedout control center zeldman heard one of the sailors whisper to another whats bing up to zeldman let it go as if the scratchy noise of the ocean had drowned out the whisper dont know answered another of the men on watch probably wants to get his book zeldman still held off saying anything now and then you had to let the rein loose a tad up too tight they were as apt to make a mistake as they were when too relaxed chapter fiftyseven the midnight moon was bright and a mile or so beyond the bahama queen one of the bergs a silver tower in the moon glow split its cracking sending hundreds of birds rising above it in panic like falling confetti the wave running toward the hospital ship as the main berg and its calf righted themselves for a moment broadside to the moon they looked dazzling white on the gunmetal sea when will i know william spence had asked her and she had to wait until he had finished coughing before she replied asking know about what she knew what he meant but didnt want him to worry unnecessarily the x rays oh tomorrow morning i guess im coming apart he said the violent coughing starting up again so that she got up and slipped the elastic about his head placing the plastic mask over his nose and mouth altering the rate of oxygen flow until the small black plastic marble was unseated jumping up and down inside the flow indicator spence was perspiring so much the sheet was clammy about his chest and lana could tell the other pain from the amputations was also tormenting him the medication wearing off again the pain boring into him again but she knew she couldnt give him any more morphine for half an hour if it were up to her she would have given it to him now it wasnt going to make much difference the lungs in the x rays had been a diaphanous white he was so weak that his socalled walk to the washroom had degenerated during the last twelve hours to nothing more than a shuffle they had performed a miracle of modern surgery in keeping him alive after the trauma of the evacuation from the peregrine but now the killer of more shipwrecked sailors than torpedoes or shells oil had lain in wait in the lungs threatening to drown him slowly with only a cough to announce it the lipid pneumonia had come upon him swiftly the final quietude of pneumonic death in any hospital called the old persons friend while holding his coughwracked body lana recalled the xray technician as he had stood looking gloomily at the film watching it rock to and fro with the action of the ship the very motion somehow an obscene mockery of real life there will matron had told her matteroffactly be moments of serenity even reverie in the end theyre quite content with a double amputation lana had asked tartly youd be surprised my dear matron had replied no thought lana youll be surprised this boy is going to fight with everything hes got the x ray doesnt tell us the whole story nurse the mo had advised her in a more understanding tone even so im surprised the prednisone didnt help id thought there was definitely an allergic component that the prednisone would deal with well all we can do now is watch him could be a turnaround before we reach halifax she had been with him eight hours straight and now in the calm following the wracking coughs every one of which she had felt like a blow to her own body lana leaned over him and with a cool white facecloth as white as the ice he thought she dabbed his body cool gently patting him dry she saw him smile or rather his eyes moving suddenly full of life the rest of his face covered by the semitransparent green mask what are you grinning about mr spence she asked with playful severity i cant help it he said his voice sounding nasal from behind the mask i dont need this mask anymore you sure yes closing his eyes he lifted his left arm and lowered it gently onto her hand she did not take it away but reached up with her left hand to turn off the oxygen flow its soft hiss fading the sound of the waves from the calved berg still slapping the ships flanks she was standing by him her right hand still beneath his bandaged arm he looked up at her and wordlessly she sat down by him her hand still beneath his arm her other hand gently stroking him and seeing the miracle of the pain not gone but momentarily defeated by her gift of touch she raised her left hand higher kissed her finger and gently stroked him again he groaned in ecstasy his head beginning to move slowly joyously from side to side and in that moment out of all the pain and the evil of jay la roche lana emerged as gentle as a virgin but knowing much more lowering her head her long soft hair falling on him then she kissed him there the firm but pliant wetness of her lips encasing him drawing him into her her tongue sliding hard and fast and then slowly lovingly as he groaned his whole body beginning to arch and rock arching again then arched as if frozen in time shuddering before he collapsed against the bed bathed in sweat his eyes glistening with life looking at her then slowly filling with such calm that they said nothing until the pain like a vindictive husband wanting to kill attacked again quickly alarmed she looked at the clock rearranging her clothes and hair it was still ten minutes to go before the next injection now the flush of love in his face left him like a red curtain torn aside his face stunned with ferocious pain white as pale as moonlight she took the hypodermic injected him and knelt by him ready with the mask should the coughing return it never did and as she told him she loved him he went into a deep sleep a tiny spot of blood seeping through on the stump of his right hand as scarlet against the bandages she thought as a rose against hard snow she pressed the buzzer and the cardiac arrest team arrived he revived on the second jump but later that night the oscilloscopes hiccuping green sine wave went flat and in place of the lively bips there was a long steady tone in all my career matron fumed before the chief surgeon and the ships chief medical officer i have never seen such a flagrant violation of procedure the mo the young captain who had referred to spence as lanas boyfriend a couple of days ago could see the pain in lanas face and for his part the morphine shot shed given the patient too early would hardly have made any difference he told the chief surgeon so and in his view it certainly didnt warrant a courtmartial as matron was pressing for the matrons head shot up looking over at the surgeon its hardly the morphine i m concerned about mr reilly even now she insisted on the british convention of referring to chief surgeons as mister its usage conveying a higher status than doctor though giving the patient the injection earlier is in my professional opinion also thoroughly reprehensible then what is this all about asked the surgeon nonplussed ah perhaps the mo interjected ms la roche would care to step out for no said lana all right then matron i think youd better go ahead said the mo the sheet sir its its filthy filthy sheets said the surgeon pushing the question back at her and looking at the mo for clarification she began matron archly did things to him oh said the surgeon oh he paused they could hear the ships foghorn as it entered the area off cape race this is a very severe charge matron i would advise you i dont deny it said lana matron glanced quickly at the surgeon making it quite plain she expected the maximum punishment for such unprofessional conduct and would not rest until she got it ms la roche the chief surgeon began you must realize how serious this is yes sir now there was a silence in which the captain noticed for the first time that he could hear the clock in the cabin ticking very distinctly he shifted a few pens on his desk pad im afraid ill have to refer this to hq are there any mitigating circumstances youd like to add the boy was dying said lana there was silence again matron staring at her finally the surgeon doodling uncomfortably on the blotter said that doesnt excuse it exactly said the matron all right said the surgeon thats all out on the deck where the chilly fog now came tumbling through in gusts matron paused before taking the steps down to her cabin deck if you think ive done it because i dont like you thats not true oh really said lana the point is my girl that we have to set an example for the others who come after us yes said lana imagine if every nurse did it and she added sarcastically right in the middle of a war dont be insolent you dont seem to have realized something young lady and whats that the matron stood very close to her and lana could smell her bad breath as she began to speak you might have killed him a shock to the heart like that he was dying you dont know that didnt you see the x rays matron ive seen more x rays and more deaths than you young lady he might well have recoveredif he had been left alone i dont think so replied lana but matron thought she saw a glimpse of fear in the young womans eyes and she pressed home her advantage youll never know will you the temptation of guilt of a hundred letters to ann landers about unprofessional conduct of nurses flashed through lanas mind doubt flickering in her eyes for a moment and then it was all gone rejected utterly as if her whole being had irrevocably changed at that precise moment in her life i gave the boy love is that what you call it sneered matron yes said lana and im sorry for you you sorry for me yes lana said softly pulling her cape tightly about her the fog from the grand banks colder by the moment enveloping them both and hiding the bergs im sorry for anyone said lana who hasnt had love it shrivels your heart to nothing lana turned and walked slowly away along the deck past the dim outlines of the lifeboats the young medical officer managed to get matron to strike out some of the more hostile adjectives in her report about lana la roche and while informally he convinced the surgeon not to recommend a courtmartial he could not prevent transfer to the matrons delight to a forward hospital in what the nurses called americas siberia the aleutians as godforsaken a place on this earth as you could imagine the medical officer informed matron in return for her retraction of the prejudicial adjectives and he added hastily under strict supervision she should be drummed out of the service matron retorted she has no place absolutely no place in well matron you wont be bothered by her anymore the matron however was barely appeased shes a bad penny that one mark my words captain shell turn up again the mo made no comment on her prediction but did tell matron it was the best he could do before she packed the bahama queen passing by mcnabs island through the narrows past the imperial oil refinery into canadian forces base halifax lana sat down and wrote a letter to mr and mrs richard spence in oxshott england trusting the highly reliable fleet mail service much of it sent electronically from base to base more than she trusted the civilian post lana addressed the letter care of her brother at holy loch with a covering note to him just as she had done with the tape that william spence had made a few days before dear mr and mrs spence my name is lana la roche and i was a nurse on your sons ward aboard the hospital ship bahama queen although weve never met i feel i know something about you as william talked quite a lot about his family i know he sent a tape and though of course i dont know what he said about his wounds and the major surgery he had im guessing he didnt say much at all about this and so i thought it might be of some help if i could tell you a little about the circumstances as i know that by now you will have received official notification from the dod of his death and that after what appeared to be the chance of a good recovery his passing must be a terrible shock it was a combination of things mostly the fact that he had contracted pneumonia from oil he had inhaled while trying to rescue shipmates trapped in the engine room of his ship and while we were concentrating so much on the severe wounds to both arms the wretched pneumonia as it so often does was already forming in his lungs by the time it was detected im afraid that plus the amputation proved too much he was a wonderful young man and though weakened by his ordeal quietly brave not only on the peregrine but on the bahama queen as well where i think he knew the end was near all i can say is that he clearly loved you all very much and told me so and that helped him a great deal we buried him at sea yesterday as regulations call for it was a very simple but moving ceremony i asked the ships first mate to mark the spot as near as he could on a chart of the area a copy of which ive enclosed i will keep the original for another time to send as im forwarding this by fleet sat post electronic mail i dont know if this will help any but the first officer told me the location of the burial is remarkably exact as they take bearings from loran and satellite ive addressed this letter care of my brother robert as i did the tape i sent on for william asking robert to pass it on also i hope we can meet someday please dont bother to reply but if you wish to write sometime and i can tell you any more about williams time on the ship please write me care of the address in virginia on the envelope and theyll relay the letter to me sincerely yours lana la roche in the covering note to robert she told him he could read the letter as it would fill him in on the news if thats what you can call it and also reminded him that as shed mentioned in her earlier note whenever he got back to base and received the tape and the letter she sent him he should advance the tape for a minute or two until william started talkingotherwise the boys parents might think there was something wrong with it the censor patched out bahama queen and went over it again making sure there was no mention of the uss roosevelt on which her brother robert brentwood served and whited out the time and place of the burial giving another point hundreds of miles away so as not to give away any more information about the hospital ships location chapter fiftyeight standing at the bow his tank commanders collar pulled up hands gripping the rail like a roman tribune aboard his chariot douglas freeman went up to the saipans starboard flying bridge as the lph headed north in the sea of japan having reduced her speed from fifteen to a mere five knots when al banks found the general he immediately told him he had good news and bad news and asked him which he wanted to hear first both barrels said freeman adding grumpily theyve turned it down no sir freeman pushed himself back from the rail dont say theyve approved hold on a minute general good news is the taiwanese have told washington theyll back off for the moment theyre reinforcing the offshore islands of matsu and quemoy thats provocative but as long as they dont start shelling the mainland or launch an amphibious assault washington believes china will stay out of it they havent withdrawn all the way to taiwan but at least theyve withdrawn to their side of the dividing line in the taiwan strait all right so chinas off our back quid pro quo they wont resupply the nka in return for us keeping the kuomintang on a leash i dont like it but right now i dont care what those lilylivered bastards in foggy bottom have arranged whats the bad news have we got the go signal or not monsoon general moving down from the sea of okhotsk it figures said freeman there was disgust in his voice but it was a calm disgust at receiving the news of yet another delay and the blowup that banks had expected never materialized now said the general calmly gods on their side he turned back to face the sea when will it hit us ten hours maybe less the met boys say why asked the general slowly darkly in a tone so controlled so ominous that banks would have preferred some of the generals feigned shortfuse rhetoric why is he doing this to me repeated the general freeman leaned against the rail one foot up on the lower rung all right al he said wearily without looking around at his aide let me know when the monsoons expected to be over course he sighed by that time washingtonll probably have changed their minds now he turned around from the rail the yosu perimeter half what it was general intelligence estimates it can hold four days at most freeman had turned away again looking up this time at the starless sky god i hate nights like this there was a long silence uncomfortable for banks anything else general no al keep me updated on that damned monsoon yes sir goodnight as impatient as general freeman was alone on the upper deck of lph saipan below in the oilsmelling belly of the lphs hangars david brentwood one of the two thousand marines and airborne troops still waiting put his camouflage pack against the bulkhead as a pillow loosening his loadbearing vest and taking off the kevlar helmet placing his protective eyeglasses inside it and unsnapping his belt he was reading the note on the postcard again hey stumbleass dont worry about it said thelman shell be there when you get back then said another marine keep off twentysix gunner kept those cold pills hell be about as fast as tim conway the thing david couldnt work out was why on earth melissa had sent a postcard of herself one of those camera machine shots without an envelope it was the flirt in her he thought shed know very well all the other guys would see it and there was nothing really in the note just a wish you were here scrawl a faint tropic isle background and stacy the note said had passed his friggin ir major with straight as got a deferment from the national callup because ir was hot right now hey man said thelman taint a dear john david wasnt so sure across the world an ocean and continent away the mood in the control room of the uss roosevelt was as tense as first officer peter zeldman could remember it what would bing robert brentwood do they were going up to a hundred feet for the third attempt to receive a burst message five hundred four fifty four hundred three fifty robert brentwood stood on the raised periscope island both hands behind him on the guard rail legs crossed looking with quiet confidence across at the sonar a lot of fresh sea noise coming in but nothing that stood out in the clutter one hundred sir very well roll out vlf aerial sixteen fifty vlf to sixteen fifty they watched the vlf registering on the stern monitor relay screen as a white trace as the aerial ready to receive anything on the threetothirty kilohertz band extruded from roosevelts stern pod the long wire rising on buoys until it lay extended approximately eighteen to twenty feet below the surface of the sea begin the count ordered brentwood five minutes and counting four minutes thirty seconds at ten seconds to go the tense mood in control and throughout the sub had changed to a palpable gloom brentwood and his crew knew that in five or six hours they would be no more than sixty to eighty miles out of holy loch and would have to go up for a burst message if none was received then they would have to stay out with the assumption that the war had gone nuclear and that the roosevelt on brentwoods authority alone would launch its six eightwarheadtipped mx missiles aft of the sail at its preselected fortyeight targets in the soviet union wind her in said brentwood calmly sir proffered zeldman should we try hf negative brentwood had already figured that one out using the highfrequency aerial would mean taking the sub up farther so it could literally poke its stick hf aerial above the surface the chance of receiving messages being much greater but more dangerous as one penetration of the seaair interface by the aerial could be recognized by soviet satellite intelligence if not intercepted by another soviet sub sticking your head out the front door is what the crew called it whereas with vlf you stayed submerged not letting the enemy know where you were the only potential giveaway a noisy vlf reel retraction or any other noise on the sub that might be picked up by the russian subs or by their sosus networks for this reason no radios were allowed without headphone attachments and the cook could not even chop onions during silent running take her down to one thousand ordered robert brentwood one thousand sir carry on ex resume zigzag resume zigzag yes sir brentwood asked the electronics officer if the failure to receive a vlf burst message could have anything to do with their own vlf aerial ive checked it out sir its fine brentwood thanked him and quietly calmly addressed the whole watch not using the pa system so as not to risk the slightest hull reverberation the sound of the aerial retraction was risk enough right you all know the situation brentwood began next attempt to receive burst message verification will be our last if we do not receive any if it has been a case of land farm knockout we should be close enough to the scottish coast on the final bmv station to elicit tacamo recognition signals but if not then we must assume the soviets have taken out both holy loch and wisconsin transmitters and possibly the floating dry dock in the loch itself if we do not receive tacamo we will proceed north get as close to kola peninsula as we can and unload any questions in the red glow a blue denim sleeve looking darker than it was rose it was one of the operators on planes control turbulence during aerial layout indicates bad weather topside skipper tacamo aircraft might be grounded or being jammed believe we would have picked up jamming said brentwood turning to sonar for confirmation that right yes sir no jamming apparent all right continued brentwood well be close enough in so that even a relatively weak tacamo signal or farm transmission should reach us we might risk a quick hf exposure but if we do not receive any signal then our course of action is set yes sir said the planesman but his face told robert brentwood he wasnt happy no one was the salt night wind was stiff in his face the smell of monsoon rain approaching a peculiarly clean smell that hed never experienced before as douglas freeman started to berate himself talking as if he were dressing down a besieged prizefighter between rounds well you saying gods on their side thats as selfpitying a piece of shit as ive heard in a long time freeman you need a good kick in the ass he gripped the railing which narrowed sharply at the bow the sea splitting open beneath him god helps those he told himself who help themselves general when he reached bankss cabin his aide saw the sparkling impishness of a child in the generals eyes banks god helps those who help themselves yes sir al said the general a mood of such excitement coming over him that the tenor of his voice grew more stentorian by the moment as he invited his aide out on the deck the sea was becoming rougher all the time but freeman seemed oblivious to all around him as leaning into the wind he recalled what he termed the fields of honor agincourt the first english conquest of normandy in the early fourteen hundreds waterloo gettysburg the somme normandy stirlings brilliance with the longrange desert group the eccentricity of wingate patton heinz guderian liddell hart lawrence napoleon mountbatten he mentioned mountbatten and burma several times and each war he told banks was different though the terror just the same worst mistake you can make al he told banks is to seduce yourself with history technology changes everything only the men are the same and with new technology even they change you realize in the first two hours of the arabisraeli tank battles in sinai over ten percent were disabled men have never before been under such strain not even in trench warfare the sheer hitting power mobility means theres nowhere to hide no time for respite you have to fight or die come with me ive got something to show you captain al banks listened to the generals plan carefully before he spoke after hearing it he thought that either general freeman had a screw loose or was some kind of genius you seem to know a lot about pyongyang general yes i do said freeman in no mood for false modesty blindfolded i could take you through pyongyang he paused you think im nuts general i just hope youre right freeman was grimacing as a huge cloud of spray enveloped the ship so do i al so do i chapter fiftynine sonar contact roosevelts operator said good bubbles sir by which he meant the cavitation of the unidentified ships prop was very definite on the sound graph trawler suggested brentwood as he grabbed the extra set of earphones there was no reply from the operator closing asked brentwood think so sir slowly think they might be trawlers brentwood turned to zeldman one of the burst messages they had received before the zippos had started was about the trawlers whod attacked r cut to onethird onethird sir now the sonar hydrophones would have reduced interference from the roosevelt itself soon as you can sonar brentwood enjoined yes sir zeldman his face in the light of the control room taking on a deep sunburned color asked herring boats possibly answered brentwood closing sir came sonars voice fifteen knots tad high for a fish boat isnt it put in brentwood sonar made a face that said six of one and half a dozen of the other bout right if theyre hurrying to close in a net sir or attacking said zeldman doing a norwegian torpedo status report all eight loaded sir one to six inclusive marks seven and eight moss very well lock in seven and eight to sonar feed two seconds elapsed seven and eight moss locked to sonar sir very well brentwood said speaking on the intercom to the lieutenant in charge of the torpedo room up forward stand by brentwood now switched his attention to the screen readout have we got a signature match for friendly negative answered sonar in his minds eye brentwood could see the convoys of well over three hundred ships en route to europe behind him sir two other contacts coming in id say range six miles and closing signatures none of ours but trawler class very well designate targets alfa bravo charlie designated alfa bravo charlie sir very well alfa bearing zero seven four said sonar mark fire seven seven fired and running zeldman instinctively looked above as if trying to see through the subs pressure hull as the torpedo running at fortyfive knots the subs attack speed streamed away from the sub giving off the signature of the roosevelt at seventysix seconds after release of the torpedo sonar reported alfa violent pulse all faces in the roosevelts control room were locked on to the dials the loudest sound the mens breathing all knowing that bing had elected to roll dice with the moss to fire another moss now or another torpedo might give the deception away the price for firing the moss was you had to stay absolutely still or you might end up being hit instead of or as well as the moss zeldman and brentwood watched the sonar screen intently seeing the luminescent dot on the top of the green screen signifying that something had been fired from the first trawler track the splash ordered brentwood dispassionately designation tango so designated answered sonar ah sir bravo charlie fading frightened them off wondered zeldman his tone half wishful thinking half doubt brentwood said nothing target designated alfa was also turning now its echo fading but whatever it had dumped was still falling and worse spreading mines proffered zeldman sonar asked brentwood lending his authority to the question the operator looked puzzled whats up asked brentwood dont know sir fuzzy brentwood held up the earpiece it was fuzzy a soft sound like milk simmering men more diffuse the one big chunk of sound definitely broken up as a pile of mines would bearing zero eight niner mark fire one and two the sub felt a gentle push one and two fired and running sir again zeldman looked up the mks running off to his right from the subs bow at ninety miles an hour uncoiling their thin guide wire until the torpedo would be close enough for the targets sound to activate the mks own sound sensors which would then cut off from their wire feed control and home in by themselves at four minutes plus three seconds the sonar screen went into what looked like power failure whiteout as a screen goes blank when hit by a high voltage without a surge control bar the screen about to die but the green and amber tints started to bleed back there were loud cheers and excited congratulations all around shut up it was brentwood as sharp as theyd ever heard him sonar readout on alfa bravo charlie still fading sir the control room remained quiet no one moving waiting to see if the alfa bravo or charlie fish boats were returning or whether passive was picking up anything on them at all distance to holy loch brentwood asked zeldman a hundred miles sir very well well wait ten minutes then proceed plot a new course to the loch yes sir brentwood glanced around at one of the spare watchstanders another bugs bunny or sonar operator with whom he could replace the present sonar operator whom brentwood now asked to report to his cabin in fifteen minutes the sound wave from the mk explosions now hit them the sub rolling slightly then righting itself the sonar operator didnt know what to make of it but took his leave to go down in his slippered feet toward the gallery for a muchneeded coffee with liberal helpings of sugar two of the other watchstanders in control out of brentwoods view because of the scope island made whats with him faces at each other after ten minutes brentwood turned over the watch to zeldman but before he brushed the heavy green curtains of the combat control center aside he looked around at the men on watch from sonar to planesmen if i ever hear an outburst like that again ill cancel all liberty on this pig boat that clear muffled acknowledgment brentwood did not raise his voice indeed it was softer than the usual tone he used issuing orders but the repetition of his question now took on a more clipped tone is that clear everyone yes sir came back the affirmation in the two seconds it took you to sound off an enemy surface ship could have fired an asrocsn which travels at what speed wilkes the planesman frowned the glistening worry lines emphasized by the red glow cant say exactly sir ex brentwood didnt want to show any favorites eight hundred meters a second sir answered zeldman correct twice as fast as our best asroc gentlemen and sixteen times faster than our torpedoes message received loud and clear sir said the trim petty officer very well carry on ex aye aye sir after brentwood left control there was a sigh of relief in the room and zeldmans presence though clearly felt was more like that of an assistant coach the big tension was off which brentwood could feel as he stepped out of the control room and which is what made him worried the most difficult thing at sea on such long sixmonth patrols was to keep the men on the razors edge a second or two had always been important in war but never so much as now whats bugging bing brentwood heard a seaman ask as he passed the galley his antistatic moccasins moving noiselessly on the shiny spill of red light bouncing off the polished decks and bulkheads his books probably out of print answered someone else and brentwood heard them laughing when he got to his cabin the sonar operator was waiting outside apprehensively brentwood took off his cap pulled the narrow green drapes across the cabin entrance and waved the operator into his cabin come in burns yes sir robert brentwood yawned excused himself and motioned the seaman to a chair but the seaman declined you did well up there burns thankyou sir brentwood noticed the boy had a prominent adams apple just like his kid brother ray but theres something you did i dont want you to repeat sir brentwood pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger the tiredness in his eyes now more pronounced under the regular cabin lighting you hesitated on giving me two readings ah something i dont want any ah somethings its at least a seconds delay and it could be enough for a target designation of us by an enemy sub weve got enough acronyms letters for symbols as it is forget about ahsounds like r yes sir one more thing burns what the heck you think we blew up i would have expected more of a bang ive heard fortyeights go off against targets usually make a lot more noise than that we might have hit fish sir brentwood looked up fish yes sir the way i figure it the splash from alfa we got could have been them ditching their catch to get away brentwood sat back against the bulkhead thinking about it when they heard our torpedoes yes sir coming in on their fish sonar or fathometers as the brits call them okay burns you can go you did a good job sorry about the slipup just chalk it up said brentwood we learn from the mistakes or we should yes sir robert brentwood thought about it for a few seconds after burns had left but then rang control yes sir answered zeldman pete why do they call me bing sir they call me bing dont know sir maybe you mentioned him once or twice im sure i didnt that woman at the admiralty party last time at holy loch she asked wait a minute i asked you about this bing character ah yes sir believe you did you son of a bitch ill get you for this yes sir carry on call me half an hour before our last i mean our next scheduled bmvtacamo station will do captain robert brentwood lay back on his bunk his gaze focusing on the pacific northwest calendar hed taped up on the bulkhead showing a radiantly pink mount shasta its volcanic cone rising majestically into the sky half the days were crossed out by black marker pen the rest after the hump of the patrol in red the book on crosby should be at marriages by now waiting for him was there something wrong with crosby not liking women or something he pulled out the stores card as he couldnt remember its address but soon he was wondering about what he would do if roosevelt didnt receive a burst message from either land farm or tacamo aerials he might never see a book again he loved reading could never understand people who were retired saying they got bored there was so much yet to do so much to learn it was something that became more and more apparent after a long sixmonth patrol around the atlantic and all the time on radio silence one thing you realized was how people ashore took their luxuries for granted everything from a daily newspaper a tv or radio report that told them what was going on in the world to their freedom to go and do as they pleased on radio silence ever since theyd received the first few bursts alerting them to the fact that the united states was at war with the soviets they had no idea of the extent and beyond the convoys the intensity of the war and knew next to nothing about the titanic land battle that must now be under way in europe unless it had already gone nuclear which would explain why roosevelt hadnt received burst messages as scheduled in the last three listening slots he thought about the family lana whether she and her husband had sorted things out or had she gone ahead and joined the waves and he wondered if young david had been caught up in the war but soon his sense of isolation that is the submariners lot in time of war gave way to concern about how he was going to fill out the required firing report to explain to comsub ant commander subatlantic pacific why he had just fired off two million dollars worth of the american taxpayers money at fish the truth was that sometimes with all the electronic gadgetry you still didnt know you had to make a judgment call he hated doing the paperwork but dutifully started all the while however he was aware of a growing sense of unease if he received no message on the next tacamo station it would be up to him his decision and his alone whether or not to go to the nuclear mode to attack his predesignated targets in the ussr might mean turning what probably up to now had been a more or less conventional war into a nuclear one if so would his men be ready he believed they were if he had to do it speed and smooth operation would be everything before the enemy could get a fix on him he finished with his paperwork and lay down on the bunk clipped on his walkman earphones and hands behind his head thought of london and new york and the trips hed thought of taking on the long furlough as this time they would be in dry dock in holy loch for a new coat of anechoic paint if holy loch was still there but something told him he would not be going to holy loch or was his natural sense of caution giving way to an uncharacteristic strain of morbidity at the end of the long war patrol he closed his eyes and tried not to think about it tried not to dwell on the fact that the roosevelt alone carried more explosive power than all the wars in history combined he switched off the lamp his right foot tapping to the deep authoritative lament of johnny cash and sunday mornin comin down chapter sixty in the sea of japan it was the middle of the night and al banks had grave doubts about the generals plan i dont know general its unprecedented al said freeman looking up at his aide youre a fine officer youve got initiative too i dont know of any staff officer that could have coordinated the logistics of this operation on such short notice youve done a superb job but interjected banks philosophically whats the qualifier general you know squatall about history hell the general pushed back in his chair holding the bunk edge to stop it rolling hard forward again his right hand smacking the operational map of korea draped over his desk hannibal didnt let a bit of bad weather stop him going over the alps he had elephants general if i remember my history we only have choppers we flew night missions in nam gunships were one of the success stories al yes sir but not in monsoons thats like flying into a car wash its not that tough said the general tapping the map now with his bifocals pretty tough general freeman was up pacing again legs bracing against the increasing roll and pitch you know when the japanese drove south in world war two everything fell before them singapore hong kong philippines dutch east indies god they were on australias doorstep before you could say uncle they were good damned good he paused and looked over at banks hope they still are al how many have we got two support companies yes sir washington thought that if they could be brought onto our side in some kind of support role it would give an international flavor to the attack would make my god scoffed freeman international flavoris that what they actually said yes sir well anyway point im making is that those japanese in ww two were only stopped when the british and us and the aussies finally stopped pissing ourselves from fright now mountbatten told em the super japanese were no more super or natural jungle fighters than anyone else hell theyre still the most urban country in the world trainings what did it al training training and morale and thats how we beat them in the end but before that we had to have a success to break the aura of invincibility they were gathering about themselves thats what this missions all about to go in and break the goddamned mold of invincibility these jokers are being cast in even i might add by our own newspapers his hand flew out toward the big wall map striking east of korea in the middle of the sea of japan then moved quickly left toward the north korean capital ill tell you another thing ive been reading the intelligence reports from way back on this runt kim jong ii theres one hell of a lot of dissent in that country under cover of course they shoot you in that place for smiling the general got up walking over to one of the manila folders hed spread out across his bunk and picked up one with a red secret diagonal stripe across it take a look at this he instructed banks his old man not much secret about that general thats not the point those fools in washington would classify their laundry lists if they could here freemans eyes narrowed like an infantry squad leader under attack voice lowered whispering to his men about the best way through the wire you know what daddy did built a gold statue of himself sixtysix feet high egomaniac everyones scared shitless of him but look at him a pudgyfaced dictator no courage no vision except a squinteyed commie view of the world that not even the russians or chinese believe in anymore freeman walked over to the wall map al ive got a gut feeling that if we can nail this bunch if we can catch em with their pants down he swung about at banks well not only do a doolittle give everybody at home something to yell and whoop about we might just pull the whole rug from under him im not so sure general first we have to get there thats why i called you here i want to see all chopper pilots now now general said banks looking at his watch it was just after am theyll all be sacked out you get them up and ready in the dungeon back there im going to tell them about mountbatten came the monsoon every son of a bitch used to dig in till spring including the nips mountbatten turned it around had our side attacking in the monsoon but our troops would be in the air general taebek range is over five thousand feet high freemans variation well call it said freeman smiling sir can i speak frankly only way al shoot general ordering your men to deliberately fly into a hurricane well sir nobody and i mean nobodys going to like it what the hells the matter with you i dont want them to like it i want them to do it he paused i know what im asking these men but al if i didnt think that god willing we could do it i wouldnt be pressing ahead with it freeman paused for a moment staring back at the map dont worry al everyones going to volunteer i wouldnt bet on that general i would answered freeman turning grinning and taking als shoulder steering his aide toward the door you go and get all those sky jockeys in that briefing area back there and ill show you by the way he asked al you think those young ladies were appeased by my apology for my er the language i used goddamn said the general shaking his head the very thought of using foul language in front of the fair sex fills me im sure theyre not losing sleep over it general tell you the truth i think they were rather flattered think so from what ive heard word is they think youre cute cute ill settle for that at least not everybody hates my guts for this operation the day is young general said banks freeman grunted banks was running his eyes down the list of chopper pilots and cabin numbers on the roster if i could suggest general it might be as well to remember theyll be called to this impromptu meeting as well so with all due respect sir i d watch my i will appreciate the advice al ill speak to them first itll be clean as a bible meeting as al banks closed the door to the generals cabin and made his way forward along the seemingly neverending cream passageway with aquamarine trim some psychologist at the pentagon had said pastels increased morale banks knew it was going to take a lot more than pastels to get the chopper pilots to go along with the generals dangerous plan he made a bet with himself that theyd object loud and clear the marines of course werent included in the bet they would fly into hell if ordered they thought a request was some kind of fatal disease no it would definitely be the helo pilots whod balk after all theyd be the ones who would have to navigate and fly through it then freeman would be forced to either order them aloft into the monsoons fury or wait till it had passed the forty chopper pilots filed in sleepyeyed resentful at being turned out at such an hour attenhun called banks there was scraping of chairs and banks saluted as the general cleanshaven immaculately trimmed his generals star bright on the drab camouflage background of his battle dress uniform took the podium be seated said the general it was easy for the audience to do most of the fortyodd pilots still halfasleep we are going into battle at last added freeman dramatically it had its intended effect waking up any of those in danger of nodding off washingtons given us the green light as you know theres a storm monsoon heading our way now i dont know about you but im tired of sitting around on this bucket freeman seeing the look of alarm sweeping across al bankss face quickly held up his hand no offense to a worthy ship or those who sail aboard her fine ship now said the general arms akimbo left hand resting on the holster a pugnacious set of his chin telling everyone that he was ready i hear the calmest place in the world is in the eye of the storm he flashed a grin how bout getting out again general banks turned his head frowning reproachfully at the interjection had to be a regular army jockey a marine pilot would never have interrupted an officer like this but surprisingly to banks freeman with his fastspreading reputation aboard saipan as a stickler for discipline didnt seem to mind the question the generals camouflage kevlar helmet its wider much less rounded contour so different from the old steel us helmet rose slightly as freemans eyes sought out the questioner way in the back you fly out son same way as you go in many of the pilots were shifting uneasily in their chairs of course continued freeman it will be strictly voluntary no one will think any worse of you except me if you dont then in a flash of an eye freeman fixed his gaze on the three women pilots in the front row mcmurtry how about you game for it ah ah yes sir outstanding answered freeman ill fly in with you chopper one anybody else he looked up smiling as if getting ready for a picnic wondering whod volunteer to bring the hot dogs the two other women were putting up their hands followed by every pilot including the driver of he who was shaking his head even as he was volunteering that son of a bitch he whispered to his copilot fuck weve got a mad general a fucking monsoon and fucking dopey on the chain gun what more could you ask for hey buddy if you cant take a joke hes pilot noddedyeah yeah i shouldna joined i didnt i was drafted this gung ho son of a bitch is gonna get us all killed you volunteered my friend said a tall negro pilot to his left the lphs resident slamdunker at the basket well said he whatcha gonna do three pussies put up their mittyes sir ill go and get killed with you he turned to the basketball player whatcha gonna do he repeated then said the basketball player all smiles he isnt such a dumb son of a bitch after all well hes a son of a bitch that goes with the star said basketball i guess jesus i could do with a bud down below in what the marines had dubbed the dungeon the assembly deck marines were buckling up getting ready to go after hearing the first news of the pilots volunteering the marines were glad to be on their feet at least they were doing something the regular army platoons drafted from freemans infantry support company were grouching tabbing the three women pilots who had started the mass hysteria as they called it lippy hippy and titty despite the grumbling most of them like the marines were glad to be heading off shortly from the rolling vomitstinking lph quite a few of the men having been sickened by the constant yawing and dipping of the ship and by breathing in fuel exhaust as choppers were warmed up the wind gusting so badly that often fumes were driven back down the stacks wait until you get airborne said one of the marines clicking on his kevlar flak vest make this rockin and rollin down here seems like kids stuff bullshit said one of the regulars taking his place on the parallel chalk lines his platoon assembling ive been in a chopper before think im green or something a mite green about the gills id say said the marine bullshit the man repeated ive been airborne before in a monsoon asked the marine now checking his mire freezedried readytoeat meal pack care for some beef stew animals said the regular theyre animals those marines he told his buddy yeah said the other regular have to be where were goin suddenly they heard a boom like some huge doors on a warehouse opening and a klaxon alarm the elevator warning the ships platform ready to take up the first load of apache gunships the transporter choppers would follow chapter sixtyone the twinengined prowlers six of them with tomcats covering were now crossing the north korean coast their ecm jammers in the wing pods and in bulging rear fin tips ready to do battle with charliesin this case the north koreansbeams airborne or ground it was hoped that by the time the subsonic twoseater prowlers with their tomcats cover were approaching pyongyang pulsing down their countermeasure beams from the alq jammers shirers wave of tomcats would be ready to clear the lanes of any migs that might try to intercept saipans chopper force hauling fieldpack howitzers two ton galaxies were being escorted across the sea of japan by six phantoms each carrying a buddy refueling pod at sixteen thousand feet above the weather the first diamond of tomcats riding shotgun for the unarmed prowlers at nine thousand feet were on radio silence seventyone miles in from the north korean coast over changdori the tomcat leader saw a blip one of the twelve prowlers dribbling to the right off his nepra his nonemitting passivemode radar screen there was no call for help from any of the twelve electronic countermeasures aircrafts for that would have meant breaking the radio silence and the tomcat leader assumed correctly that the lone prowler in the monsoon was experiencing mechanical difficulties its gap in the prowler wedge was filled the rest of the prowlers closing up as if guided by some invisible hand it gave the tomcat leader a quiet sense of pride in the professionalism of the carriers family of pilots the prowler might be forced to ditch but rather than emit a giveaway signal it had simply turned off into the monsoontorn night alone any call for help calmly stifled until the plane returned to the carriers patrol zone if it got that far despite all the alarms aboard his f the tomcat pilots eyes kept monitoring the instruments moving from altimeter bottom left of the hud assembly to the banks of dials below the compass on his right aboard the prowlers it was rough going the black torrential downpour shot through with pockets of less dense air the unarmed planes having a bumpy ride that irritated the two ecm officers in the rear compartment for as good as the alq jammers were the turbulence didnt help a hundred miles behind them coming westward over the sea of japan was the small armada of forty chinook choppers led by an arrowhead formation of five fierceeyed apache helos each of the helos sprouted wing pods of nineteen inch rockets apiece an infrared tv masthead sight and laser range finder for eight hellfire missiles and the hughes chain gun as the lead apache rose from a thousand feet above sea level its copilot saw the red light go on above the check on systems display and heard the accompanying buzzer warning them they had insufficient power for the steep climb over the taebek mountain range invisible in the rain but not more than five miles away the pilot glanced across at the terraincontouringmap video display confirming they were getting too close to the peaks around konjin to make any shallowerangled approach which in any case would require breaking formation lose the port sidewinder ordered the pilot done replied the copilot that was quick red lights still on lose the other one said the pilot the light went off the choppers rate of climb increasing you were next he told the copilot thanks they had just sacrificed their two best antiaircraft defenses in order to better protect the troops following them in the chinooks ten minutes from pyongyang on the tomcats nepra screen a blip was appearing on the far right very fast then another three more the dots heading for the eleven prowlers the tomcat leader switched on his airtoair sidewinders heard their growl and called to the flight tomcat leader five bogeys maybe more one oclock twelve thousand strikers go these were the six tomcats in front of the diamond now going down behind the prowlers who were already starting to pour down their rain of powerful beams to overwhelm the sam radars and dropping chaff as well in the semicircle of twelve threemissileapiece sam sites east of the city nka operators hit the siren buttons as their radars suddenly turned to snow the eleven prowlers coming down guided by their red tercom terraincontourguided radars with a constant video feed of mountains dips and rivers flashing by the pilots and crew in their blinkered canopies windshield wipers on overtime and no use at all the planes effectively flew themselves this allowed the two ewos in the rear section of the plane to direct their jamming beams at any energy source distinct enough to look as if it might be trying to burn its way through the heavyduty beam screen of the prowlers three of the prowlers were destroyed in twelve seconds balls of curling orange as the migs now twenty in all screamed in from the west another seven from the north the squadron of migs on the ground at pyongyang airport all but wiped out by three of the tomcats striking with twothousandpound laser slide walleye bombs a mig unable to come out of the turn smashed into the flatland west of turu islet on the bottom lefthand stretch of the s made up of the potong river and the much wider taedong halfway up the s where the river straightened between two islands and flowed under taedong and okryu bridges it passed kim il sung square beyond the square was the wingtipped grand peoples study house and near the riverbank framing the square the korean art gallery to the south the history museum to the north but now none of this was visible except as sharp angular shapes on the helos video displays several sam sites sprang to life firing blindly radars jammed but hoping to bring down the american pirates as a hysterical pyongyang polly was describing them on state radio before it too went dead think theyll expect troops general lt sandy mcmurtry asked freeman in the lead chinook freeman tightened his helmets chin strap smacking her affectionately on the shoulder its all right lieutenant they just think its a bombing mission he pointed at the chinooks radar moment those helo gunships break for perimeter defense you take me right on down where i told you mcmurtry had already keyed in the square that she and the others had gone over so often in their minds during the preop discussions on the lph while washington had whiled away the time or so it seemed to them making up its mind for a second mcmurtry saw the distinctive shape of the ninetyfoothigh arch of triumph a slavishly brutal imitation of the parisian original and south of it the outline of the chollima the famed winged horse of korean legend then momentarily everything was lost as stalks of searchlights exploded from the defensive circle ringing the city and now crisscrossed the sky reaching up feeling the rainy darkness for the enemy bombers who pyongyang polly had said were trying to pollute the sacred birthplace of our dear beloved leader amid the chaotic sound of rain intermixed with antiaircraft fire and the neverending electronic beeping of warning and centering indicators mcmurtrys earphones were nothing but a garble of noise as prowlers and the nka aa batteries engaged in a war of the beams for without targets the huge twelvefinned soviet sams were useless in the torrential downpour of the monsoon which lowered visibility to zero it was all instrument flying and landing for the helos and here the american knowhow was overwhelmingly superior the prowlers frying the nkas radar screens clean of any targetable image allowing the tomcats streaking in behind to drop their fivehundredpounders with a devastating accuracy not seen since the vietnam war bogey on your tail yelled a wingman the striker leader his bomb gone hitting the button going from airtoground to airtoair in milliseconds screaming up deep into the monsoon and gone in a crimson flash a collision with a mig on the cross vector aw shit said the wingman going into a roll locking on to a migs afterburner and engaging his own his tomcat now on full war power its fuel consumption ten times its preafterburner phase heading into the threeminute zone in which hed use up a third of his total fuel his wing automatically sweeping back now that the bomb load had been dropped from the more stable wingsout position he saw the mig in his sights pressed the cannon the mig was gone not hit quickly reducing speed the american overflying him so that now he was up again behind the american his airtoair aphid waiting for the growl not sure whether he heard it in the confusion waiting for the light the american broke so did he both into scissors at the same time their reaction times to this point exactly on par the american popped four incendiary flares and dropped the aphid catching one of the flares exploding the wingman looked for the mig but hed vanished another missile american or russian he couldnt tell passing well ahead as the prowlers completed their turn south one of the citys searchlights having given them up lucked out on one of the apaches suddenly all the searchlights converged on the apache the helo pilot tapped down his sun visor put the apaches nose down and fired both pods thirtyeight inch rockets four of the beams died to pale yellow then nothing the apache was still coming down fast in the strange whiteblack river of night and searchlights the copilot picking up a sam site in a searchlights spill let em go said the chopper pilot the copilot firing all eight hellfires the helos underchin chain gun spitting a long bluishwhite tongue down at the nkas sam site the sam site exploded the chopper its rear rotors pitchchange spider damaged by aa fire canting crazily to seventy degrees the small blades chopping into the tail drive gearbox the pilot glanced across at the copilot he was dead head slumped lolling in the turbulence of low air currents the rain so hard it sounded like a hose on the fuselage as the apaches pilot braced for the crash the helo smashed into the dark blanket that was changsan park on the citys northern outskirts its explosion terrified the welltodo party administrators celebrating the imminent victory in a day or so at the most when general kims komtbt bear trapwould clang shut on the yosupusan pocket they had just drunk to the extermination of the mikuk chapnomtul american bastardsand their rok lackeys the thirtyseven remaining troop transports three taken out by migs were now chopping air settling down on the big square using infrared freeman having already selected the huge concrete bulks of the art gallery and history museum as flank protection as well as the thickly treed parks about the square which would give added protection from the smallarms fire that was bound to open up though he would never know it the pilot of the downed apache in panicking the second and third searchlight batteries allowed fourteen of the thirtyseven big chinooks following freemans to land in kim ii sung square virtually unseen the american troops to the utter astonishment of only a few janitors and museum night watchmen poured out from the long black shapes in a circle of machinegun rifle and other smallarms fire that was quite audible even over the rolling thunder of the aerial combat high above and it was at that moment with the sam sites impotent because of the stillfalling parachute chaff from the striker tomcats and the city militia excited and startled that freemans plan saw its first success an unopposed landing of his troops many of his men were busy pushing the big chinooks clear of the central area so that others could come down to unload for a totally unexpected and eerie moment all the streetlights came on as one of the tomcats fivehundredpounders hit the pyongyang thermal power plant ironically switching on lights that were meant to be off during the curfew but the surge of power was too much and the next moment the plant and city were once again in darkness in those fleeting seconds almost every man had frozen or dropped to the ground in kim ii sung square three of the halfdozen cameramen freeman had insisted accompany him recording the moment on tape getting three of the chinooks in the process of unloading their troops the cameramen not realizing its significance until much later after the chinooks had unloaded they moved off with others as part of the twenty freeman had detailed to proceed across the city to the pyongyang airport here they would hopefully be met by the airborne regiment in the two galaxies with the four selfpropelled millimeter howitzers despite the blackout of the city some of the sam sites did receive the extra surges of electricity from emergency generators but it was not enough it was as if the americans had drawn an impenetrable canopy through the rainladen sky over the entire city a canopy in which signals were either soaked up or bounced back as chapsori rubbish and when fourteen sams were fired their long red tails and backblast illuminating the immaculately clean and deserted streets around potonggang station what their jubilant ground crews didnt realize was that the blips they had momentarily picked up and fired upon were not fs at all but f simulators of the box of tricks as the tomcat pilots called them which fell through the sky steadied by springloaded fins eight of the sams hit the decoys exploding turning the rain to vapor in the immediate area debris falling down to the elated nka crews it was not until an hour or so later that they discovered their error when puzzled party officials racing out for propaganda displays of shotdown american wreckage could find the remains of only one f amid the litter of sam casings the top floor of the grand peoples study house freeman had told the marines would command a sweeping panorama of the city through infrared binoculars and it was taken by a squad of marines without opposition as the helos kept landing and the remaining apaches loaded with antitank and thousands of small antipersonnel mines made what they called in general freemans lexicon a ring around the craphouse using kim ii sung square as the center aim point from the twentytwostoried kim ii sung university on the northern outskirts to pyongyang station on the south side through the victorious fatherland liberation war museum far to the west of kim il sung square and back around east pyongyang stadium the apaches led two of the big chinooks which laid a string of explosives while in the square four of the eight american motors hummers or humvees as the troops called them came down slung under the last xc chinooks once unhooked the humvees equipped with a machine gun and infrared swivel antitank launcher in the back were quickly manned by driver codriver and six men armed with saws squad automatic weapons and demolition charges two of the four hummers that had not made it to the square were totaled their parent chinook striking a tree and overhead wires near the history museum sliding and tumbling down the embankment into the taedong river the other two hummers had been aboard a chinook when only forty feet above the ground in front of the grand peoples study house it collapsed in a sudden wind shear in the occasionally flarelit air it looked like some great exotic brown cucumber broken in the middle its quiet poof of flame starting to spread quickly a marine sergeant thrust his m at the nearest man went in under the wreckage crawling into the hummers cabin slithering across the rainslicked vinyl seat he was unable to raise his head any higher than the steering wheel because of some part of the choppers fuselage sticking in through the drivers window wheres he goin shouted another marine fishing another shouted his mood of bonhomie the result of having passed from sheer bowelfreezing terror into a reverie of relief at still being alive the humvee came to life jerking out from the wreckage dragging pieces of fuselage with it on his honeymoon someone else shouted the buoyed mood of the men was caused not simply by the lack of any determined resistance on the ground evidence of the fact that so far freemans gamble of surprise had paid off but because of the absence of any vehicular traffic that might be bearing nka the magnificently spacious streets around the square were deserted a possibility that freeman had privately entertained from the satint hed studied so closely aboard the saipan but it was a hope that he knew could be ended any moment by a sudden convoy of infantry coming up from the south or if the chinese were still supplying the nka through manchuria troops from the north nevertheless for the moment it was a surprise that helped mitigate the loss of the three hummers and the crews of the downed chinooks once he was sure the perimeter from the river up past the museum around the peoples study house and back to the art gallery was secure freeman sent out three humvees to complete the next phase of operation trojan one of the humvees its nine men all wearing infrared goggles and hunkering down except for the machine gunner and the atgm operator headed north from the square along sungni street swinging left on mansudae street in the last of the flares dropped by the tomcats who were low on fuel and returning to sea their position taken up by shirer and the second wave the marines could see the dim outline of the arch of triumph half a mile or so away but their interest centered on the sixtysixfoothigh brown statue of kim ii sung in front of the museum of the korean revolution off to their right they could see chollima statue the winged black horse peasants joyously riding it marxist holy book held aloft the book invisible in the rain it took the demolition team four and a half minutes to place the plastic hose cylinders around the dear and respected leader in front of the museum of the korean revolution and another two minutes to insert the wire and run it back off the spool several hundred yards to where the humvee had been stationed as an advance guard i dont like this said one marine too fucking quiet wherere all the people inside you dummy where would you be come on hurry it up cut in the corporal as they hoisted the spool aboard the hummer and drove slowly in the direction of the trees that hid the grecian facade of the pyongyang art troupe theatre across the wide boulevard okay said the corporal lets do it there was a dull thud the ground trembled and the blast rustled the wet ginkgo trees water coming off them in a spray and the air filled with dust that quickly fell in the rain kim ii sung was no more the driver of the second hummer lost his way his navigator rifleman giving wrong directions so that now they were headed toward the pyongyang seafood direct sales shop several blocks up from the square by the river where the fuck are we someone shouted gooks dead ahead a police car its klaxon squawking its blue light flashing urgently was tearing down okryu street wet leaves flying up behind it orange sparks seeming to come from its interior smallarms fire the humvees browning stuttered hot casings steaming through the rain the police car wobbled then careered wildly ran across the street struck the curb rolled ending up on its side wheels still spinning a man came scurrying up from the cabin like someone trying to escape from a submarine the browning stuttered again and he slumped back arms caught in the door in a v the fire licking at the rear wheels the marines had another look at the map christ youre nowhere near it smithy it was a gross exaggeration in fact the driver had only overshot a right turn past the seafood building by less than a hundred yards back er up the corporal ordered and after thirty seconds ordered now turn right and straight ahead it was another couple of minutes and they were on the western side of the eastwest okryu bridge which spanned the wide taedong river and was one of the two main bridges by which any counterattack from the east would most likely come the driver still felt spooked by the apparently deserted city which till now had not offered any resistance on the ground to the landings in its main core even though the sound and fury of the air battle was enough to awaken the dead sonic booms rolling overhead at times so loud they were mistaken for the monsoons crashes of thunder to the north the marines could see forked lightning reaching right down to the hills the third humvee had already reached taedong bridge half a dozen blocks or so to the south of kim d sung square and the demolition team had started laying their charges when the first of three nka armored cars started across me old wide span the armored vehicles ghostly outline visible for only a second in the light of a flare the antitank rocket fired from atop the hummer the distance to the armored cars no more than three hundred yards exploded against the bridge railing the armored cars kept coming their machine guns now spitting fire and finding their mark the marine driver and machine gunner thrown back hard against the canopy dead the antitank missile operator behind them taking second aim the lead armored cars machine gun opened up again and the at operator fired the lead armored car burst into flame followed by a sound like falling pots and pans as the vehicle stopped without hesitation the second armored car behind the first broke out and took up the attack the third armored car braked using the first cars wreckage as good cover barely showing its main gun the new lead car fired its main gun and the hummer leapt into the air the at man dead beneath the bridge which lead onto mansudae street the demo team kept working along the slippery embankment with the extraordinary concentration of sappers whom freeman had always held to be among the bravest of the brave the rain was still heavy and the lone american marine on the bridge took cover behind the burning us truck not seeing the cupola of the lead car open until its topmounted began raking the humvee pieces of metal and upholstery flying through the air how long the marine called to the sappers two minutes max theyre on top of us hold em arnie arnie dashed from the big stanchion near the end of the bridge across the traffic lanes behind the burning wreckage of the hummer hearing a faint gurgling sound coming from it going low catching a quick look at the armored car he saw the nka car commander his leather worldwariitype helmet striking the marine as oldfashioned as hell the marine gave him a full burst the man flung his arms back before he slumped over the right side of the cupola the marine heard a lot of shouting coming from inside the armored car but still it kept coming turning now to ram the hummer arnie dropped his heavy automatic squad gun ran left to a gap of about three feet between the hummers rear wheels and bridge rail saw the armored car now only six feet away going straight for the front of the american truck it took him one two three steps up on the wheel guard flange and two grenades down the cupola conscious of a stringent unpleasant odor the dead mans breath as he lolled on the cupola the second car veered and hit arnie so hard the demolition team running the wire back and slipping on the grass heard their buddys ribs snap like sticks now the second nka car was blocked by the v formed by the wreckage of the humvee and the other armored car it backed up and suddenly its searchlight penciled out along the embankment the cupola opened and the gunner the coaxial slaved to the searchlight sprayed straight down the approach to the bridge out of nowhere a mig flashed low canisters falling the armored truck enveloped in napalm the pilot having mistaken the three armored vehicles in radar clutter as american one of the demolition team cranked and the other pushed the plunger they felt a slight tremor heard a thud then a louder claplike noise the approach to the bridge had collapsed only six or seven feet but until it was fixed nothing would be coming across to mansudae street by now the unarmed prowlers had been gone from pyongyang twenty minutes though it seemed much longer to some of the men on the ground still the possibility loomed was it possible that freeman could make his doolittle hitandrun and get out virtually unscathed shirer told half of his remaining twelve fs who had made up the second wave to drop chaff and go for railyards on the citys south side and he designated three strikers to take out the six bridges across the potong particularly chungsong bridge on the southwest side where reinforcements might be rushed from the port of nampo twenty miles to the south laserguided bombs took out three of the bridges but chungsong in particular was an elusive target its span running over the island of suksom pleasure ground bisecting the target making it more difficult to get at what made the situation worse all of a sudden was that the chaff jamming over the city was now coming to an end even as shirer could see migs at least twenty of them coming from the west another seven from northern airfields perhaps in manchuria until the tomcats were relieved in five minutes they would have to leave the ground force to its own devices the aa batteries were opening up again now that the jamming was weakening shirer half hoped the migs would reach them before his and other tomcats fuel dictated a withdrawal for in the mixedup blips of tomcats and migs in aerial combat on their screens the nka batteries including the remaining sams would be more discerning lest they hit one of their own outstanding excellent were repeated so often in the first half hour by douglas freeman as he saw the thousand men secure the perimeter around the square that he began worrying it was all going too well a suspicion now reinforced by the tomcats leader telling him that though the next wave of tomcats hadnt arrived he would have to take his flight back for refueling then on the psc manpak satellitebounce radio he was using freeman heard the eight hundred airborne troops from the two galaxies were pinned down at the airport one of the big planes was forced to stand soaking up smallarms fire as its men unloaded and one of the phantoms that had escorted it was shot down as low on fuel it turned back with the second galaxy which had delivered its load of four howitzers the howitzers and their ammunition had come in on pallets from the galaxy now heading back but one of the drag chutes had failed to open so that the guns were now at the outer flooded edge of the airport rather than on it and in the darkness a fight raged between the us airborne and nka militia for possession of the guns freeman knew it would all come apart if the six tanks that the airbornes colonel menzies was now sighting managed to reach the airport before the airborne could get the millimeters into action you can take care of them rick freeman told his airborne commander their goddamned rattletraps come apart if you fart over theyre our tanks general captured ms the general paused then knock em off with the howitzers when we get there was an explosion in the background drowning menzies voice when he came back on the radio he told freeman general theres a good chance were going to lose the galaxy its one mother of a target even in the dark i m concerned about my men general if that big bird goes then our empty cargo chinooks can take you out how long do you think you can hold not a matter of holding general we can hold all day but its no good if we cant get out an hours all i need rick you hold yes sir a minute later the sky over the airport went yellow followed by an explosion the galaxy going up in flames illuminating the airborne better than any flare freeman turned to al banks and a marine major im going on to mansudae hall he said it as if he were going over to the px for a moment perhaps thought the major the generals enormous selfconfidence came from the long hours of preparation of poring over the satint and japanese intelligence reports but then anyone could read a map there was more to it freemans élan had spread through all the men now digging in around kim ii sung square readying for the inevitable nka counterattack with three of the bridges on the west side still intact by god said freeman what i wouldnt give for an m hey general you dont need a tank sir you got us they were hunkering down close to the hummer where you from son brooklyn sir you stay by me i need a man like you where we goin general were going to start a fire son right in that runts seat of government by god those commies talk about ten days that shook the world well do it in ten minutes there was a shuffling sound the boys buddy hitting the cement down bellowed freeman there was another shot but they couldnt see where the sniper was medic called the boy from brooklyn the stretcher bearers ran over crouching there was a flash in the darkness south of the square from the haebangsan hotel the humvees machine gun roared to life illuminating the rain and several marines nearby got him shouted the gunner as the medevac team were lifting the downed marine onto a stretcher freeman touched brooklyns arm cmon son work to do yes sir but now the boys voice was cracked with emotion as one of the medics seeing his colleague was stripping open an emergency field dressing reached over and stopped him then pulled the marines poncho over his face the rain bouncing off it with a drumming sound lets go said freeman leaping into the humvee a squad automatic weapon with him and grenade vest packs in his right hand he turned to the marine major in charge of holding the square give us fortyfive minutes major were not back you go ahead with the withdrawal well stay as long as we can sir youll stay fortyfive minutes and get your ass out of here second tomcat wingll have enough to do with those migs without babysitting us that means i want choppers in the air at oh six thirty you hear me loud and clear sir the majors biggest worry wasnt whether the general would get back or not but how best to protect the chinooks scattered all around so far the generals plan was working well despite the airport and the sporadic fire of some home guard and militia troops working their way up sunji street the marines now in the process of blocking it off while this was happening the major saw that the men from freemans infantry were pushing more of the chinooks to the west end of the square between the big protective blocks of the art gallery on the squares south side the history museum on the north and the river directly behind them to the east meanwhile on the top floor of the sixstoried grand peoples study house marines with spotting scopes took up positions whats your name son freeman asked the humvees marksmansquad leader next to him in the cabin brentwood sir all right brentwood were going to visit mansudae hall ever heard of it on the map sir aboard the lph when we were going over the well son youre going to see it up close you ready yes sir said brentwood the general knew he wasnt no one was before their baptism of fire so far freeman had told al banks back at the square on the ground weve only had chickenshit resistance i think thats about to change banks had cautioned by god its the curfew freeman had proclaimed in a moment of revelation standing in the pouring rain arms akimbo thought everyone was staying inside from fright in the hummer freeman could hardly breathe so excited was he by the prospect a vision of glory so powerful heaven so clearly on his side with the curfew and the rain and the monsoon together with his douglas freemans idea to attack when no one else would that the general found it impossible to contain his exhilaration hot damn he smacked the dash the startled driver almost driving into the curb and having to hastily readjust his infrared goggles as they swung right at the grand peoples study house rushing the four blocks to the mansudae assembly hall in the icecold depths of the north atlantic eightythree miles west of scotland the uss roosevelts executive officer peter zeldman gave the skipper his wakeup call captain message station coming up okay pete be right there robert brentwood pressed the stop button on johnny cashs dont take your guns to town swung his feet off the bunk and made his way over to the washbasin to wake himself fully his eyes and throat dry as parchment he made a mental note to tell the chief engineer to turn the switch up on the airwater content control brushing his teeth his mirrored image looking better than he felt he was struck by how the public face the face of duty so often and so convincingly hid the deepest fears of the inner shadows he glanced at his watch threetwelve pm back home that other planet his mom would most likely be having her morning coffee his father at the new york port authority pushing paper and moving ships cutting corners where he could and sucking tums where he couldnt and what about lana had she and la roche patched it up for the life of him he couldnt think why a man would want to break with a beautiful girl like that maybe it wasnt all la roches fault it took two to tango as his mother never tired of saying anyway hopefully if the burst message did come in hed be in holy loch tied up within two to three hours and thered be lots of mail for everyone maybe a letter from young david though that was too much to hope for knowing his younger brothers allergy to writing anyone well hell thought robert replacing the toothbrush youre no letter writer yourself pal you ready brentwood he asked himself ready and willing no but ready the moment he began the walk toward the control room brentwood felt every sailor he passed watching him wondering he nodded to most and stopped at the galley whats on cook roast lamb and mint sauce sir gravy yes sir trying to make me fat no sir ill have to start training like wilson the cook grinned hoping the skipper wouldnt notice he wasnt wearing his chefs hat wilsons down there now sir he nodded back toward the missile bays doing his laps hope hes wearing sneakers brentwood said half in jest half seriously the on station behavior code forbidding anything that would make a noise loud enough to be picked up by an enemys towed array good said brentwood about to move on and cook sir get that hat on yes sir stepping into control the sub still rigged for red brentwood could feel the tension depth he asked zeldman five hundred sir very well take her to one hundred to one hundred confirmed the diving officer standing behind the plane and trim operators their halfwheel steering columns moving gently with hydraulic grace four fifty three hundred three fifty brentwood pressed the intercom for all sections from torpedo room up forward through sherwood forest the missile bays to the reactor to call in for status reports three hundred one fifty one hundred sir very well roll out vlf roll vlf the sub shifted slightly upwelling sir commented the diving officer noting the sudden change in salinity and water temperature stop vlf commanded brentwood stop vlf brentwood watched the depth gauge its needle moving slightly up again then down the sub shifted a little more last thing he needed was an inversion layer a sudden change in water density that could suck the sub down before enough ballast could be blown to regain neutral boyancy driving the boat down hitting the bottom at miles per hour the needle moved down again and back retract vlf retracting sir brentwood was now receiving status reports from all the sections everything a pete lets take her on a mile or so get her away from this upwelling nonsense yes sir robert brentwood looked at the steering computers clock at an easy twentyfive knots they should reach a new position in plus or minus four minutes depending on local sea current salinitytemperature variations it would mean running out the vlf a little faster and risking a little more noise for roosevelt to hopefully clear the upwelling and still have time for a tenminute wait but this should be no problem in itself the fact that the old cold war rule of sovietwarsaw pact armies forbade anyone under the rank of lieutenant to possess military maps did not seem particularly significant while it was something that had astonished the americans and british in the longgone days when nato had invited sovietwarsaw pact officers to observe nato maneuvers it had not occurred to anyone that the antiquated rule buried in the bureaucracy of the soviet army would have much significance after all even platoon officers didnt require maps their particular tasks such as taking a farmhouse a ditch or a hill microrated in the jargon of the strategists and tactical warfare experts a small piece in the vast jigsaw of war most combat troops only percent of any army doing the actual fighting rarely knew or cared about the wider battles all that mattered was for them to survive to take the particular objective on any given day with minimum casualties not knowing till it was over sometimes for months even years what part they might have played in the overall scheme of things whether they had won or lost or had merely come to a bloody draw but on this october day while the uss snbn roosevelt approached message station and another brentwood half a world away was running up the stairs of the granite and marble mansudae assembly hall now quickly having been reinforced by north korean regulars and the blackpajamaed militia of pyongyang something decisive was about to happen on natos central front in the southwestern corner of west germany a weary margaret ford the young lieutenant of twentysix and her crew of three were about to launch another lance missile with conventional warhead fords crew was one of twelve out of the original twentythree that had been located for shoot and scoot counterbattery fire in the german black forest a light shower had fallen but now the sun was trying to come out as the rain clouds passed over the forest into france and margaret ford though she did not know it was about to change the course of history an advance soviet mobile observation post a camouflagepainted fourteenton russian bmp armored personnel carrier traveling at thirty miles per hour carrying ten troops and armed with the standard millimeter machine gun and antitank missiles stopped on a side road twenty miles from the black forest now a blue smudge through the hazy autumn mist the greenishyellow poplars were turning and flickering in the midafternoon sun and the sudden warmth made the fields steam for miles around the men aboard the bmp had been on hard rations for fortyeight hours with little sleep nerves jangled by a brief but spirited american counterattack which had taken place behind them on the big bend in the danube as it curved south from regensburg and when they had lost their officer whom they all liked during the fierce american millimeter barrage of high explosives and armorpiercing shells the russian crews morale had taken a bad body blow had it not been for the sergeants initiative in keeping the men going they would probably have called for a break earlier on but now the sergeant didnt have a choice as one of the men ema stalo plokho was feeling carsick in the personnel carrier not surprising in the suffocating heat from the engine and the sun combining in the coffinlike interior the jolting jarring and lack of any sense of direction for the men inside was guaranteed to leave even the toughest reeling after three or four hours in battle conditions the sergeant had yelled for the driver to stop earlier but the bmp was so noisy he couldnt be heard but with the smell of the mans vomit filling the already dirty and stale air inside the driver finally got the message as the sick man rested with a few comrades the sergeant and four others took the bmp over to a green hill nearby from which they could see a farm about two or three kilometers away and had a good view of the retreating american s their flashers like pieces of a shattered orange mirror visible at the edge of the dense forest the sergeant and his comrades could also see that the shells from their own guns roaring away five miles behind them were falling short of the west german and american batteries suddenly a lance missile could be seen streaking from the blur of the woods twenty miles away but the elevation of the russian guns was still obviously too acute and the sergeant was reporting on his radio too short too short until the soviet battery commander in an effort to save valuable rounds at the end of the already overextended supply lines from czechoslovakia and poland and russia ordered the fifty big gs to down new salvos came screaming lower over the crew of the bmp the gs twentyfivemile range six miles longer than the american s the russian shells not only tore into the american and west german positions in the black forest but over four hundred of the he shells crashed into the forest on the french side several of the allied tv print and radio reporters covering the war from the rhineland on the supposedly safe french side were hit two of them both french were killed another british from itn badly wounded a shell or two amiss was to be expected inevitable perhaps but not salvo after salvo and all because the russian sergeant not knowing precisely where he was only in front of american and west german guns had simply done his job when west german tv and british networks bounced the signals via satellite throughout europe particularly into the homes throughout france the balloon as the newly swornin british minister of war said with barely concealed satisfaction went up vive la france gentlemen he said she is now in the war which means gentlemen we have our ports so far said an assistant who foresaw something in gallic disposition within nato that either the minister did not want to admit to or did not appreciate being referred to especially not by a junior member of his department so far will do quite nicely said the minister icily if it wont do parks the minister continued holding his glass out for a refill without looking at the steward i suspect you could be called up yes the nka militia approaching the dark fourstoried monolith of concrete and granite that was the mansudae assembly hall were terrified when they saw the americans it wasnt merely the rolling thunder of the overhead battle amid the monsoon that so unnerved them it was the americans goggles freeman and the nine men in the humvee having taken infrared and starlite goggle training in stride could not know that for all the wrong reasons they conformed to everything the militia had been told about the us imperialist warmongers like the banner of the sinchon museum of american imperialist atrocities which depicted socialist toddlers joyously shooting the us monster in the form of a wickedeyed uncle sam it was part illusion reinforced by the reality of the size of the marines packs the big saws squad automatic weapons and the hideouslooking robotic eyes of the infrared and starlite goggles the gray plastic lenses protruding from a base the size of a quarter tapering to a dimesized lens giving the americans an even more terrifying unblinking appearance to the heavily armed nka militia and police now defending the north korean assembly hall the two men on the humvees atgmmount and machine gun created a murderous firefront the remaining seven including freeman split into two teams freeman with his saw leading the three in front the probe team while the four others all equipped with saws in support were moving in reaction to the lead teams situation the big doors were closing as freeman brentwood and brooklyn started up the stairs a burst of fire from about twenty feet away to their left clipping brentwoods helmet the three of them going down hard on the cold marble steps freeman yelling back at the humvee to take out that there was a whoosh of flame only feet above their heads and the loudest explosion david brentwood had ever heard as if someone had let off two massive firecrackers strapped to his head the noise added to by the reverberations of the huge door now agape not unhinged but licked by the yellow flame of the antitank rocket that left a large jagged section blown out from the doors right panel smoke bleeding from it like dry ice and part of the lower hinge torn curled back as neatly as a pop can tab two dead nka militiamen another crawling away from the door lets go freeman shouted got up and led the probe team brentwood on his left brooklyn to his right up the remainder of the long wide marble stairs from the sides of the building and from two thirdfloor offices either side of the draped nka flag from where the dear and beloved leader had issued some of his most famous edicts flashlights winked in the power outage then went out themselves almost to the door night became day and the three americans saw two groups of blacktrousered militia coming from both corners of the building david brentwood to freemans left returned the fire come on yelled the general were in the sack it didnt make any sense to david but he was only too happy to obey the order once inside the door his ears still ringing from the noise of the antitank missile hitting the big doors together with the din of the machine gun raking the militia outside he realized what the general had meant the two groups of militia coming from either side of the building couldnt fire at the americans without fear of hitting one another in a fire sackthe realization bringing a flashback to david of his instructors at camp lejeune inside the building an emergency battery light created monstrous shadows the infrared goggles proved to be of limited use and the three men quickly took them off while the goggles had allowed them a clear picture of the enormous spotted marble columns with massive sculptures of revolutionary workers and peasants clustered about their bases looking heavenward they robbed the three americans of peripheral vision it was a tradeoff wider vision but less distinct images david could smell strong wax polish and hear the tinkling of chandeliers then echoes of boots coming up the marble steps outside the door one burst and general freeman had taken out the emergency light the foyer plunged into darkness illuminated only by the eerie light of the nka flares going up outside over the assembly hall and kim il sung square there were two muffled explosions and the general knew two of his chinooks had gone crimson flames leaping high in the rain as they advanced down either side of the foyer brentwood taking the inside of the left column freeman fired a draw burst there was no response bastards are upstairs he said in a hoarse whisper how he wished hed been able to bring in a dozen trucks or even the three other hummers that had been destroyed for this place freeman knew better than any of his troops and even fewer of his officers sustained the power and majesty of communist north korean power the runts brandenburg gate as he had called it there was a loud shout from somewhere upstairs though he knew no korean to freeman it sounded more like a revolutionary slogan than an order the general knelt and unclipped his prc satbounce walkietalkie radio freeman to square you reading al yes sir loud and clear those two hummers back from the bridges yet only one sir replied banks get an hm squad up here fast al start firing two hundred yards back and lay em right on the top synchronizing go general freeman flicked the cover of his watch dial up oh five thirtyseven now got it ten minutes affirmative there was an orange flash and a sound hitting iron the atgm launcher on the humvee outside had been hit the machine gun kept going defying all logic in a continual burst then through the warped rectangle of the door david brentwood saw the soft glow of the burning hummer the two americans slumped over the canopy the machine gun still firing as at least twenty blackpajamaed militia appeared about the flames the machine gun stopped the gunners body collapsing into the pyre david could now hear someone on one of the twin staircases that descended either side of the foyer freeman was on his prc again there was a crackle of static banks sir you left the square with that hm yet negative then pack your humvee with every man you can get in mortar crews going to need as much covering fire as we are the bastards are all round the building and banks freemans voice faded for a moment then came back i want a photographer and a flamethrower there was another surge of static on the line and banks needed to confirm photographer flamethrower sir fast as you can we freeman didnt hear the rest young brentwood had opened up with his saw taking out the first two militia to make it through the door a third tripping over them the rest breaking either side lost to the darkness behind the huge marble columns brentwood brooklyn freemans voice took on the tone of a basso profundo its echo bouncing off the nearest statue of a hero worker alternate fire ill start the next one brentwood sir you got a prc yes sir suddenly the darkness was split by the flash and telltale staccato of aks glass breaking behind freeman and brentwood bullets singing as they struck marble brentwood squeezed off a burst quickly moving to the next column every nerve raw not knowing how far up the hall theyd gone when our boys start moving up those steps freeman yelled moving toward the balustrade we go up to the first floor got it yes sir brooklyn there was a squeaky reply brooklyn so terrified he could hardly find voice more gooks general brentwood called out and fired at the door seeing there were too many for alternate fire if they were to stop them he thought he got one or two but the rest had disappeared like the first group left and right of the cavernous foyer behind the columns his ears still ringing heart thumping david crossed the hall letting off another burst as he reached a marble column close to the balustrade he felt something stinging him his left legmomentarily wondering whether or not it was a bullet but having no time to dwell on it soon he knew the enemy now over the initial surprise must figure out a rough plan of fire without hitting one another now the koreans were shouting instructions to one another adding to the sense of increasing chaos a second later two grenades shattered the air with purplish white there was a scream and in the flash freeman glimpsed three militia coming up his side rolled a fragmentation grenade turned about the nearest column and let off a quick burst from the saw next instant he was on his back kevlar helmet hitting the marble floor a needlelike pain down his neck the nka troops shooting wildly hitting windows and turning the waterslicked floor that had caused freeman to fall into a gallery of elusive running shadows the moment he saw the brilliant light david his training overcoming instinct froze as another militiaman fifty feet away fired a second flare inside the building david knew what they were looking for would be movement not shapes as he pressed himself hard against the pedestal of a peasant woman at harvest brooklyn forgot his training swung out between the columns with his saw and crashed to the ground as a dozen militia cut him down the flare now fizzing in the far corner brentwood snapped into the prone position and swept the floor with a full magazine hitting four of the militia sending the others racing back behind the columns toward the door the general getting one man silhouetted in the penumbra of the flares light brentwood he yelled go for the balustrade back of it theres the auditorium give em a burst and head back as the general fired the covering burst up the stairs david ran between the columns heading beyond the foyer toward the faint outline of the auditorium door plate glass collapsing from the windows either side of the assembly hall from ricochets when he reached the auditorium he turned hard right inside sweeping the saw in front of him astonished to see the emergency lights down by the stage were on casting a soft glow over the two thousand seats that smelled like a new cars upholstery the door burst open and the general came in almost taking brentwood with him the hot barrel of the gun striking davids flak vest the general swearing his saws sling having got caught in the breech jamming the gun he yanked hard at it but it wouldnt budge his prc surged to life freeman still uttering oaths cursing himself now for having left the volume switch up fortydollar fine he said to brentwood who tried to smile but couldnt it was all he could do to get enough saliva to swallow freeman turned the volume down and heard banks general this is square one reading you said the general he was disappointed it wasnt his mortar crew outside general banks went on in an excited voice one of our rok interpreters has plugged into charlie traffic seems bankss voice rose and fell in waves of interference and freeman could hear the gunfire around the square seems general the runts in mansudae hall for christs sake hissed the general why the fuck you think were here intelligence confirmed hes been holed up here since there was more static but this time it seemed like the tearing sound of a machine gun in the background that all said the general yes sir mortar crew should be there soon the general turned the volume switch off it had suddenly become very quiet they heard the patter of sandaled feet he yanked at the saw strap again but it wouldnt come free as david drew his bayonet from its scabbard handing it to the general to cut the strap loose freeman saw the boys hands were shaking uncontrollably dont you worry about it son the general said in a barely audible voice his breathing slowing for the first time since theyd entered the great hall youre doing just fine well get the son of a bitch brentwood began to speak but freeman held up his hand motioning above with his thumb some of the monkeys are going up the stairs good david guessed thered been about half a dozen or so and when they didnt find any americans upstairs theyd be coming back down his apprehensive gaze upward conveyed his fear to the general dont worry said freeman smiling well be all right he nodded his head down toward the stage you like the front seats or the mezzanine david couldnt think straight let alone respond to a joke all he knew for certain was that he was down to his second to last clip and that whenever anyone told him everything was going to be all right it never was at latitude fiftysix degrees north and longitude seven degrees ten minutes west a hundred feet below the seas hard blue uss roosevelt was eighty miles west of scotland and thirty miles north of ireland any upwelling here the captain asked no sir salinity temperature look fine look or are theyre normal sir very well ahead five knots roll out vlf to two thousand vlf rolling sir at the sorbonne in paris over five thousand leftist students some of them anarchists were rioting fighting police protesting frances decision to defend the borders in whitehall the new minister of war was on the scrambler to downing street agreed prime minister its not a declaration of war per se but i should have thought that a defense of ones borders means the minister grimaced no prime minister yes it is possible very well yes right away prime minister when the minister of war put down the phone his hand went to his forehead in an effort to remember what hed been saying to under secretary hoskins but his mind was still on the prime ministers unsettling reservation about the french action pms office cant seem to understand began the minister that while the french response means we cant use their rapid deployment force in nato as yet we will be able to the moment any foreign troops violate french soil and he looked across at his secretary that has to happen otherwise whats the bloody point of the russians fighting the bloody war if we have the french ports for resupply we still stand a chance we dont have the chunnel and if we dont have the ports and the bolshies continue to hold holland hamburg and bremen and take rotterdam then i should think were in very deep wouldnt you agree hoskins yes sir i mean to say the ministers right hand reached out for an elusive word as if he were answering an opposition question in the house the bloody french have to come in he paused for a moment thinking hands behind his back moving toward the now armorplated window i mean all that lovely wine its unthinkable yes minister but the reports from jib joint intelligence bureau indicated that the russian surge had lost much of its wallop there had been early snow and the war of mobility was grinding down it didnt go nuclear as all the experts had told the minister it would and pray god it wont said the minister adding but i think hoskins contrary to what we all thought i should say what all the experts thought that were in for a long war no vlf signal zeldman reported to the captain captain robert brentwood nodded and gave orders to the executive officer of the uss roosevelt to map a course for the next twentyfour hours that would place them in the deepest part of the norwegian sea within comfortable launching range of targets on the kola peninsula and beyond guaranteeing the roosevelts missiles the minimum possible cep circular error of probability when striking all twentyfour of the subs designated targets in sherwood forest aft of the subs sail where the six missiles in two rows of three stood ready in their gleaming fortyfoothigh sevenfootwide tubes raymond wilson one of the offduty rcos or reactor control operators was jogging the steady hum of the fortyton ventilators washing comfortably overhead like the pleasantly reassuring noise of a summer breeze in high timber wilson the man whom captain brentwood and the cook had been joking about earlier was in his workaday blue cotton and polyester jumpsuit and quiet matching canvassole shoes the blue in stark contrast to the smooth creamy white color of the missile tubes he sat on one of the narrow flipdown benches near the bulkhead taking his pulse his breathing slowing whole body relaxed yet his senses acute missing nothing the odor of the sub like that of a sparkling clean showroom a world away from what hed been told were the stinkholes of the old world war ii diesels he felt goodfit confident hed live to be a hundred the second wave of refueled tomcats had now penetrated north korean airspace once again and a swarm of thirty migs attacked the tomcats breaking fifteen to do battle with the migs the other fourteen strikers racing for pyongyang then everything happened astonishingly fast in the mansudae hall general freeman and david brentwood ducked automatically for no amount of training could steel a mans nerves against the instinctive reaction to seek cover from high explosive there was a high whistling noise then the next explosion shaking the building plaster flaking off the auditoriums walls another crash more plaster a lot of yelling from the floor above the mortar crews were doing their job freeman and brentwood heard confused firing upstairs then shouting as the north koreans started back down the stairs brentwood and freeman stepped out firing two long bursts into the bunch of figures killing several sending the rest scuttling back up the stairs freeman was calling the mortar crew on the prc cease firing there was one more explosion lets go said freeman you take the left stairs they made it up to the second floor without incident but on the third they saw a small group of nka who suddenly retreated their silhouettes clearly outlined in the fires that had been started by the mortar shelling toxic smoke already rising from the burning red carpets the nka squad could now be heard above on the fourth floor and brentwood and freeman followed the din of firing beneath them on the ground floor telling them the marine reinforcements from the humvee were coming in on the fourth floor the nka unable to go farther the exit door stairwell filled with smoke suddenly split into two groups three of them or so it looked to brentwood melting into an office on the left the others disappearing through a door on the right side of the hallway theyve got the runt yelled freeman thats why theyre trying to hightail it you take the left david brentwood stood back against the hallway wall his saw pointed at the office door the general doing the same across the hall raising their guns butts positioned for eye protection blowing out the locks then spraying the doors there was return fire on brentwoods side hitting his kevlar vest slamming him across the hallway bullet holes peppering the stonefinished walls high above the opposite door sending bits of marble flake whistling through the air as brentwood down on the floor emptied the rest of the magazine into the door there had been no return fire from the generals side he went to fire again but the saw jammed he threw it down pulled a grenade kicked the door in his hand a blur in and out the grenades explosion sending a cloud of dust and paper floating gently to the red carpet he went in low with his beretta right hand arcing his left cupping for support there was silence a lot of paper still falling the room thick with plaster dust by now david brentwood was back on his feet saw blazing going into the room from which hed taken fire in the office across the hall freeman debris still settling about him saw four figures two stunned officials in green mao suits one of them a small pudgy man with glasses the other covered in fallen plaster a streak of blood on his face and two nka officers one of whom a lieutenant was dead in front of the desk the other a major on the floor to the right his uniform in tatters from the explosion moaning and clutching his stomach rolling in debris beneath a picture of the dear and respected leader the picture was amazingly intact not even its glass broken but the grenade the general had thrown in was meant mainly to terrify and stun which it had clearly done inside the other office brentwood saw that both men militia were dead one still holding his ak staring up through the light given off by the advancing flames david whipped about as he heard heavy firing down on the main floor sounding like marine saws he saw his magazine was empty and reached for the last one the general waved the two officials away from the desk with his beretta over there comrades brentwood was walking over having taken the finished magazine out and seeing the toxic smoke that was billowing at the blocked end of the hallway and moving quickly toward them general wed better he saw the one groaning on the ground rolling a grenade at the generals feet knocking the general farther into the room brentwood scooped the grenade up throwing it down the hallway its blast took out three neon light fixtures and blew a door in the nkas major rhee coming at them a knife in his hand the general fired four times and now the picture of the dear and respected leader tilted sharply its frame shattered the leader solemn at a ridiculous angle move yelled freeman at the other two before i shoot you too you goddamned commie rats a marine at the far end almost fired a burst before he saw the other marine brentwood and general freeman the general tore off the nka soldiers dog tags at the same time trying to apply pressure on where the knife had cut him on the left arm the tomcats were again too good for the migs the american jets flybywire technology far superior to the russian and chinesemade controls when it came to using circuits instead of ailerons and while the monsoon was abating the rain was still so heavy that flying by instrumentation alone put the americans still further ahead the final toll in this sortie four tomcats lost to fifteen migs and what freeman had expected to be the worst of it the fighting withdrawal went far better than expected ironically his decision to attack in the monsoon when flying by instrument was the only way had been the best decision about the use of an air force since the world war had begun within hours its implications were revolutionizing nato strategy giving new hope to the exhausted and outnumbered nato pilots in the european theater that the bad weather of winter might promise to give them a decided edge against the soviet and warsaw pact planes success on the ground at pyongyang where freemans chopper had been the last to leave was not due solely to the tomcats superb ability to keep the migs off the chinooks but was largely due to the three remaining apache helos which rearmed from three supply chinooks and lighter because of the jettisoned extra fuel pods they had had coming in rose from the square like angry gnats and attacked the nka armored column approaching from nampo able to come down directly above the tanks turret tops the latter being the most vulnerable armored section of any battle tank the hellfire missiles set the first six pts afire the bigger heavier tanks including most of the captured american ms having already been sent south days before for kims final push on the yosu perimeter even so when freeman returned to the saipan he was a disappointed man the little pudgy official with the glasses interrogated aboard the lph was not the runt after all but a senior official with the nkas ministry of supply merely working late at mansudae hall where the hell is he then thundered freeman drained and tired they say hes well outside the city in a bunker al banks informed the general apparently first radar alert they had or rather when our prowlers started scrambling they got him out by god freeman said disgustedly hes a goddamned coward as well general sir you did a magnificent job washington expected us to take sixty eighty percent casualties we got out with less than fourteen percent well al said the general who kept moving around in the sick bay the sb attendant trying to clean the deep knife wound fourteen percent is two hundred and eighty men al and not to get that commie bastard is a its general interjected banks his relief at getting back alive infusing him with the same excitement as it had the media types now filing their stories via the fleet communications center aboard the salt lake city south of them we you got into the north korean capital in the worst weather imaginable shook the hell out of them and came out general our boys in the yosu perimeter are counterattacking like you wouldnt believe the general started to simmer down the other two attacks on taegu and taejon how are they doing proceeding as planned general knocking the hell out of their supply line and the nka air force has shot its wad salt lake city tells us our attack sucked up most of the migs from the south away from the perimeter our reinforcements are unloading at pusan now well said the general grumpily but clearly bolstered by the news that was worth it but it sticks in my craw that we never got that turd his arm was still the sick bay attendant working fast but there was a lot of dirt in the wound and grease around it and the attendant was wondering whether he should remind the general or not about the importance of cleaning a wound in combat or anywhere else as quickly as possible he decided to take the plunge sir you should get a tetanus booster what oh all right son if you say so the general turned to banks again who was looking a bit out of it thrown off balance by the lphs sharp turn and a long roll that sent the medics kidney dish clanking on the steel deck youd better sit down al ill be okay general sorry i forgot what we were that other bozo in the mao suit whos he ministry of supplys secretary or so he says we could run it through the pentagon computer link if you like no waste of time the dog tags you got general both nka officers one a lieutenant the other was a major rhee intelligence he yes the son of a bitch tried to kill me sneaky bastard well that young marine brentwood and i we put pay to that damn knife wound the general held his arm up looks like ive been in a whorehouse brawl well general you did better with that major than you think banks turned to the rok captain who had been sitting quietly by the sick bays centrifuge that right dae asked banks the rok captain turned to freeman sir the major was from general kims personal staff intelligence we found these on him the rok officer handed freeman a bunch of creased papers a lot of korean characters on them that the general didnt understand but recognized as the outline of military areas v and vii it was the yosupusan perimeter the rok officer leaned forward pointing to various korean markings outside the perimeter on the nam river which flowed down from taegu breaching the perimeter at chinju fifteen miles north of sachon disposition of usrok forces general he pointed next to the cluster of korean characters above the arc of the perimeter next to each character were rectangles and squares of nka troop and all battery dispositions kims strategy for his attack on yosu day after next general what dont worry sir banks quickly interjected we had the information coded and satbounced to pusan hq washington and tokyo before your chopper and the last tomcats crossed the coast hot damn said freeman we didnt do so bad after all al thats what ive been trying to tell you general dumb bastards shouldve burned em said freeman we didnt give them much time general responded banks sharing the generals excitement we were in and out of crap city under two hours seemed like two days confessed freeman most of the men feel the same sir suddenly freeman fell silent we get all our dead out no sir airborne over at the airfield took the worst of it it was the howitzers that the nka were really after thought it was a major breakthrough from the south they wanted rick menzies big guns rick get out no sir he was spiking the guns last i heard but thats only hearsay until we get confirmation from his two ic lph got a bit overcrowded here with everybody coming in some of the choppers went on to the carrier we dont need to get it straight from anyone said freeman he was a pro to the core the general winced as the medic touched his arm with the alcohol then seeing what it was only cotton batting looked embarrassed talking of pros i want that brentwood boy and that other man the general tried to remember his name boy from brooklyn well trace him sir the general was still avoiding the sight of the tetanus needle owe my life to that brentwood make a note of it al silver star happy to sir the general grimaced as the cold steel pushed into his arm and he felt the antitetanus serum injected into him al our photographers did they get out four of the six general freeman nodded they get pictures of us all over crap city banks was so tired that for a second he thought freeman meant pictures somehow being spread all over pyongyang like propaganda leaflets they get shots of us pressed the general the first time the rok officer had seen anything like apprehensiveness even fear in the generals eyes oh yes general answered banks two of them were up on the peoples study house top floor infrared shots mostly around the square and of the howitzers firing i think they got most of it far as i know you havent seen any yet asked the general no sir i by god al weve got to get those pictures stateside right away the presidentll want to see them american people need to know banks began to tell him that the news of the american raid via sat signals was already burning the wires hot to half a dozen news agencies throughout the world itll be headline news all around the world general pictures al goddamn it we need to get the pictures out know what the chinese say picture is worth a thousand words ill check it out sir do it now yes general said banks wearily getting up and feeling a little lightheaded making toward the sick bay door ill get right onto it al banks turned slowly trying not to look as fatigued as he felt yes general al theres only one son of a bitch in this world with a bigger ego than that runt banks looked puzzled me the general said and winked banks was correct dawn now pm the night before in washington and pm in london too late for the early evening news in america and pushing it for the midnight bbc broadcast the news nevertheless took the world by storm all programs in progress were put on hold as announcers cut in with the news flash of the american attack the video pictures showing kim il sungs enormous statue now a rubble on the ground his body badly cracked yet clearly recognizable the head split and nothing left standing but the hump of the pedestal then came the biggest shock of all cuts of pyongyang polly picked up by satellite announcing to the slow accompaniment of funereal music that our dear and respected leader had been killed in the american raid and that the new peoples provisional revolutionary government was being led by our dearly revered president choi yunshik formerly a vice martial in the democratic peoples republic of korea the cia at langley knew nothing more about choi than that he was a middleoftheroader who had opposed the hitherto unheardof communist succession of kim jong il taking over his fathers title general kim it was announced by pyongyang polly was being relieved due to ill health with the precious time and intelligence gained by freemans attack the pressure on the yosupusan perimeter was immediately reduced kims overextended supply line severed by the freemanstyle attacks as the press was calling them on taejon and taegu had only added to general kims problems everything had come unglued for kim due in no small measure to the capture of kims plan of attack on pusan from major rhee who after interrogating tae at uijongbu had been given the plan by kim to take to pyongyang for the blessing of the nkas general staff in beijing behind the highly lacquered bloodred gates of zhongnanhai compound on changan avenue the north korean ambassador reported that pyongyang wished to discuss the situation with the united states and as there was no official representative of the democratic peoples republic of north korea in the imperialist warmongers capital the government in pyongyang representing the freedomloving people of north korea requested that their comrades of the peoples republic of china might intercede on their behalf the ambassadors request was not well received by premier lin who reminded the korean that their late dear leader kim ii sung father of kim jong d whom chinese intelligence knew was not dead but under house arrest had once referred to the chinese as american puppets the ambassador was shocked and said with great respect that he did not recall this it was said premier lin coldly in february with that lin rose indicating the meeting was at an end pyongyang would be informed of the central committees decision the ambassador of the democratic peoples republic of korea bowed as low as his back condition would permit in three days pyongyang seeing their exhausted troops now reeling back from the yosupusan perimeter as far as taegu saw what president mayne referred to rather mundanely as the writing on the wall at least as far as the korean theater was concerned the cia was receiving messages from beijings bureau of public safety the chinese equivalent of the fbi that certain overtures had been made from pyongyang these confirmed the cias suspicion gained from japanese businessmen who had visited north korea prior to the war that despite the loyal public displays of affection the wearing of sixteen different pins of their dear and respected leader the most secretive dictatorship on earth had within it a boiling discontent the people in consequence of the economic cost of kim ii sungs lavish selfidolatry and that of his son were experiencing the lowest standard of living in the communist world it being estimated that over percent of the countrys gnp was going to the military general freeman did not know any of this as he was in the throes of a violent allergic reaction to the tetanus shot nothing on his record sheet indicated any such reaction it being hypothesized that the original vaccination given him years before had been made from a different serum the knife wound had become badly infected and in tokyos us military hospital to which he was transferred surgeons were discussing the possibility that they might have to amputate at the moment the united states congress rose in unison upon hearing that the heretofore littleknown general douglas freeman us army was to be the recipient fo the first congressional medal of honor in the asian theater captain robert brentwood us navy was in the reddedout control room on the top level of the fourtiered sub off the kola peninsula he was about to take the uss roosevelt up for a last attempt to receive a burst message via the vlf no message came retract vlf he ordered ready hf this was a whip aerial that would slide up from the periscope cluster to receive on the higherfrequency channels but its appearance above the seas surface could prove fatal if picked up by enemy satrecon satellite reconnaissance five minutes only pete instructed brentwood then retract understood five minutes counting at three minutes fiftyseven seconds there was an electronic burp the receiving screen registering digitized transmission from a tacamo aircraft out of reykjavik iceland there was a collective sigh jesus said one of the planesmen too relieved not to break the silence order brentwood let it pass relieved himself from the computer room an operator handed him the computerconverted numberforword message to uss roosevelt battle stations missiles there was no klaxon or alarm chime as following strict procedure executive officer peter zeldman calmly announced on the mike now hear this as he stood on the attack centers raised podium about the searchandattack periscopes next captain brentwood ordered set condition one sqthe nuclear subs highest alert set condition one sq aye aye sir repeated zeldman then with all compartments punching in on the electronic stateofreadiness board zeldman confirmed condition one sq all set very well acknowledged brentwood the uss roosevelt containing more explosive power than all the wars in history each of its missiles forty times more powerful than the bombs dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki was ready leaving the attack center brentwood walked briskly forward of the bbq sonar console nicknamed barbecue by the crew past the navstar navigation console to the radio room where he was joined by zeldman and two other officers as brentwood and zeldman watched the other two officers from the subs strategic missile division opened the two small green combination safes extracting a black plastic capsule from both the code phrase in each was the same in this case anna belle the fact that both capsules contained the same name confirming the pentagons order for roosevelt to fire all missiles neutral trim ordered brentwood solemnly in neutral trim now sir very well prepare to spin stand by to flood outer tubes standing by very well flood tubes one two three and four the outer doors of the torpedo tubes opened followed by the hissing sound of air under pressure expelling water from the tubes the four mk torpedoes sliding forward from their railtracked dollies into the tubes ready to fire at any enemy sub or ship that might try to run interference with the missile launch in missile control the weapons officer his gold submariners dolphins insignia a bloody red in the light began feeding the local orientating corrections for kola peninsula into the warheads computers aligning them to true north insuring bullseye trajectories for the fortyeight reentry vehicle warheads atop the six missiles spinup complete he announced inserting and turning the circuit key he carried at all times on a lanyard about his neck his assistant a junior officer walked headphone wire trailing along the narrow blood alley the reddedout corridor of tall lean computers ticking off each missiles status verifying for the weapons officer that every one of the tridentcs was ready to pass through the last of its four prelaunch modes prepare for ripple fire instructed brentwood his order calmly informing the weapons officer that all missiles were to be fired the roosevelt now hovering in neutral buoyancy at launch depth a hundred feet below the surface in ripple fire sequence each of the six thirtyton eightwarhead tridents could be launched with enough water above the sub to prevent serious blastoff damage to the hulls carbon steel fairing aft of the sail it would also allow the missile to obtain optional launch from the moment steam pressure blasted each sixthousandmilerange missile from its fourstory silo to thwart the danger of the sub yawing violently each time it lost the sixtyseven thousand pounds of each missile the emptied tube immediately replaced by rushing water the firing sequence would be staggered in ripple fire so that missile one would be followed by missile six and so on maintaining the subs trim his hands holding the highly polished brass rail that girded the control rooms attack center robert brentwoods lean frame bent forward his deepset brown eyes concentrating on the computer screen directly in front of him checking that all missiles were ready for launch he held his key ready to click into the mk firing control system the weapons officer waiting below the black flexihose trailing snakelike behind him from the plastic red firing grip in his hand his thumb now on the transparent protector cap ready to flip it up and depress the red button six times only brentwood his executive officer weapons officer and three vitally positioned crewmen could now tell from the last numberforletter variation in the code that this time brentwood would not have to insert the key and complete the circuits it being judged absolutely imperative by the president and the chief of naval operations that a crew should not know when it was a wsrt weapons systems readiness test drill until the final seconds if they were to maintain the razoredge efficiency needed to defend their country in the time of maximum peril the trouble with this as robert brentwood had often discussed with his younger brother ray was that after a high alert the natural reaction for the crew was to relax this could be the greatest danger of all chapter sixtytwo the red row houses flashing by their brick a contrasting blur against autumnstripped trees and fields of englands farmland combined with the rolling rhythm of the glasgowlondon express lulled robert brentwood to sleep after the tensionfilled months of war he found it a joy to simply sit back and watch the countryside and the towns of england passing by there was the everpresent danger of a russian fighterbomber surge trying to break through the british and american circle but their main targets were the big ports down on the channel coast if the russians did break through the royal air forces inner defenses were augmented like the us marine corps with the harrier originally built as a closesupport and reconnaissance aircraft but which since the first few weeks of war had played such a vital role as defender and ground support in europe that its status had now gone beyond its postfalklands reputation as a good allaround aircraft its very name now elicited nearawed response from pilots and civilians alike a status that had been accorded only the spitfire and hurricane in world war ii and in the s the american sabre in korea but while the success of the harrier against the russianwarsaw pact air forces was now being discovered and talked about by the british public during a period in which both sides were digging in and resupplying the planes success had long been predicted by a difficult by which the english mean eccentric fiftyyearold classics teacher guy knowlton phd of balliol college oxford had also predicted after his excavations during the summer hols before the war that the probability of a modern war going on longer than anyone had predicted was indeed very high masses of men their psyches savaged by the speed and devastation of hightech mobile war said dr knowlton would simply be unable to sustain the momentum as they dug in waiting for overextended supply lines to catch up with them the trenches said knowlton would become a coveted place the soldiers as soldiers had done since the beginning of time would discover anew that a trench quite apart from being far more preferable than openground warfare was a place where the hitherto unobtainable luxury of a hot meal instead of c rations on the move settled into a predictable routine it was something the generals abhorred for wherever men began putting up signs such as no vacancy petes place and mile markers to their homes from scotland to new york troops became increasingly reluctant to get up and leave no nato commander was foolish enough to think the war would remain static very long that there could be any return to the kind of massive wasteful trench warfare of the first world war but the longer the trenches remained livedin the more difficult it would be to move men quickly when the present falloff in hostilities heated up again it was rumored as robert brentwood had heard in holy loch that a deal had been struck through swiss mediators between the ussr and nato to the effect that no nuclear weapons would be used whether this was true or wishful thinking no one was sure if it was true then given the enormous gain in territory by the russians at natos expense almost all of germany northern holland and the low countries it was inconceivable that nato would now simply return to a ceasefire if the russians did not agree to give the captured territories back chapter sixtythree anyone who believes the communists will let us have any of that territory back is a dreamer general freeman proclaimed to the clutch of white house press photographers and reporters crowding around him after the president had pinned on the generals medal of honor the general saluted solemnly then raised both arms in a victory sign to show his wellwishers that his wounded arm was back in service harold schuman as the presidents national security adviser was not pleased with freemans offthecuff remarks the medal of honor in his view brought you respect it didnt make you an authority on the delicate matter of diplomatic maneuvering especially when moscow and beijing might interpret the generals words at such a highprofile event with the president as official us policy but it is our policy isnt it the president challenged schuman when the general had left i certainly dont intend spilling american blood to defend germany then turn around and tell moscow it can have whatever it overruns im certainly in no mood to stabilize the position as is as someone at state said last night the united states alone mayne reminded schuman has lost twentyfive thousand troops in this war the very worst thing to do in my view is to give any impression to the russians or anyone else for that matter that were about to seriously consider redrawing the map of europe on their terms why it would make a mockery of what weve been through those boys would haunt us from their graves i couldnt agree more put in trainor these are bullyboy tactics from beginning to end carve up half of europe and then say youre willing to talk personally id tell them to shove it ive no doubt you would said schuman tartly but we must never close the door to negotiations agreed said the president but this isnt the time harry first we want the nka north of the old dmz where they belong and we need the european border where it was well mused schuman as far as korea goes it seems now were in better shape than anyone had a right to expect because interjected trainor we gave freeman if youll pardon the pun a free hand there mr schuman and state ought to realize that only thing those jokers understand in the kremlin is the fist youre beginning to sound like general freeman said schuman in a slightly disapproving tone i hope it isnt contagious well he did one hell of a job over there mr schuman you cant deny that we could do with a few more like him in europe its a much different war in europe said schuman how trainor challenged him suspecting that the national security advisers comments about freeman were motivated more from envy of the generals sudden celebrity than from any sound military consideration we dont need cowboys in europe mr trainor the president held up his hand for an end to the disagreement he was due for a meeting with the joint chiefs and he intended to bring the matter of freeman up there formerly the presidents title of commander in chief was viewed by the vast majority of american people as a more or less honorary title until he was actually involved in the direction of some military action in having taken the responsibility of giving the green light for the pyongyang raid his stocks were now high and he intended using them as bargaining chips with the joint chiefs in the presidents view freemans raid had done infinitely more than turn around the position in korea and raise american morale and status all around the world in perhaps its darkest time since the cuban crisis freeman as far as the president was concerned had overnight established a new battlefield code of conduct showing what mayne called armchair video commanders that in a rapid and highly fluid hightech mobile war perhaps more than ever a commanding officer needed humint human intelligence to get away from hq and go on the point precisely because of all the gizmology available a commander ought to get out of the claustrophobic noisy pushbutton world of divisional hq tents and get into the thick of the fighting himself just as some of the fighter pilots had found out that for all the benefits of instrument flying sometimes it was necessary to simply shut off all the incoming buzz and use their eyes on this october day however with southern england flashing by robert brentwood was one commanding officer who wanted to forget the war and had it not been for lanas letters and the tape she had sent to him from the spence boy he might have succeeded he certainly would not have been on the am glasgow to victoria station had he not read her letters beginning with the last one she had posted now she had been posted to some godforsaken rock as she called it the name of the rock carefully erased by the censor it could have been anywhere from gibraltar to the galapagos robert was struck by the change in her tone the selfcenteredness of the beautiful coed and the bitterness of her failed marriage alike were conspicuous now by their absence instead she talked to her older brother about the terrible ordeal of ray of the spence boy and how it had brought her closer to her three brothers the war she wrote had not diminished her own worries which shed hoped it would for despite common wisdom shed found that other peoples troubles worse though they may be had not helped put her own into perspective that kind of thing she discovered was only a short fix talking of fixes she asked robert whether it was true that many of the pilots were being given the censor had crossed the word out but she obviously meant amphetamines yes they are would have been his answer after a long letter about ray her next had been almost exclusively about the spence boy not as a lover robert could see though in matters of the heart he regarded himself as woefully deficient she went on to tell him that if the war had taught her anything it was that morale was often more potent than penicillin that with a purpose before you you could brave all kinds of horrors that normally would prove too much which is what had surprised her so much about william spences death unlike some of the smartass profs who were against the war and were fs and knew they wouldnt be called up the young sailor had recognized that this was a war nato and the united states had to win that at the very best it was good against evil at the very worst no matter what the deficiencies of nato countries there was a vast difference between a regime that could knock your door down and take you away in the early hours of the morning and a regime that was required to show good cause which was why she told robert she had thought that william spence filled with oldfashioned love of country family would pull through but then no one including herself had seen that old hag pneumonia creeping up just sitting there knitting patiendy rocking in the savage corner waiting it had made her even more worried about ray apparently hed gone into a funk until some admiral from la jolla had visited him and told him straight that if he was going to go into a damn sulk over it and not see his kids he might as well make himself useful od and clear the bed for somebody who needed it some of the fighter pilots she said who were coming in were experiencing what they call electronics burn the result of an intense spitting kind of fire that came from all the hightech lightweight but highly inflammable consoles theyd stuffed into the cockpits anyway apparently ray had had his sixth plastic surgery operation and had seen the kids everyone had a good cry according to mom and ray had started to make noises about sea duty though that would certainly be a long way off if not out of the question maybe some form of support ship a tender spare parts or something mom was all in a flap because shed just heard that young david was in for some kind of decoration lana didnt know though whether it was such a good idea for ray to try and get back in the navy knowing ray shed written hell probably be worse than she couldnt think of the name the man played by james cagney in mr robertsyou know the old grump who kept losing his palm trees anyway bob she ended if theres one thing ive learned in the last two years from hong kong to this godforsaken rock its that love is all that matters and you should give it wherever you can hopefully youll get some back before were all blown to kingdom come robert brentwood had read all the letters at holy loch and as per her instructions had run the tape forward a little so mr and mrs spence wouldnt fret about not hearing anything for the first few minutes robert had waited to push the stop button not wanting to intrude in any way on the boys private thoughts to his family but the tape was silent it had come via fleet mail quickly enough and brentwood guessed the security and bomb people had done their job the package going through x ray and with it the dead boys last message to his folks under the circumstances and seeing that he had two weeks to fill robert thought that the least he could do was visit the boys folks before going to waterloo and catching a train down to surrey he had called into marriages bookstore the same manager in harris tweed who had taken his order several months before had just finished serving a customer when he looked up and saw brentwood walking in the manager beamed welcome back captain suddenly throughout the whole store from the paperback section atop the old spiral iron staircase down to the hardcovers on the main floor the staff and customers broke into applause brentwood looked around to see who they were all clapping for and blushed like an afterburner when he realized it was him it was the convoys they were starting to get through the convoys without which the british would die let alone europe and the guardians of the convoys were in good standing with the people of britain the manager mr harris was quite definite about refusing payment handing brentwood a mintnew copy of bing no look id like to protested brentwood no old man least we can do everyone from assistants to the unloading clerk had gathered to welcome the american captain have you time for tea captain someone asked why er ive got to be getting up to oxshott the manager was so tickled by the occasion he couldnt bring himself to correct the american but he did ring british rail and ask them what time the next train down to oxshott was eleven pm while they were having tea and biscuits someone brought in a dolly with a carton of at least fifty paperbacks for the officers and crew of brentwoods ship the manager saw the captain of the most deadly armed ship in history looking rather nonplussed not to worry captain well have them sent to your ship you wont have to carry them about there were a few giggles and polite laughs if youll just give me an address robert as security demanded gave him the us naval po box in glasgow overcome by the warmth especially after hed been told so much about the reserved british manner brentwood almost forgot to take bing with him after tea there was a pub dinner pickles scotch eggs and several pints of black guiness their brown creamy heads flowing like velvet down the captains dry throat another pint later brentwood asked mr harris can i ask you a straight question fire away old boy this gal young lady young british lady was rather upset with me at a party said i was worse than bing crosby you know what she meant hmm said harris who was swirling the final ration of guiness werent singing were you no answered robert no i wasnt romancing then was it no well i mean she was kind of annoyed that i wouldnt ah harris leaned over to the barman fred havent any of the rough red left have you fraid not mrarris ive got a liter of old espagnol though dry is it harris inquired about the sherry brentwood thinking hed forgotten completely about his question mr arris said the barman if this stuff was any drier itd make your air fall out eyebrows too most likely how much asked harris forehead furrowed ready for a shock he got it a century oooh said harris his head coming back from the bar oh dear best i can do squire said the barman rationing and all oh quite quite quite all right fred youre welcome mr harris brentwood lifted the last of his guiness and savored it as it went down i like that he said i think old man she was saying you were rather bourgeois straitlaced cut in the barman his hand rocking from side to side you knowlong the straight and narrow no ankypanky well said harris i have to spend a penny then i m off im afraid ill take you to the station going to the loo explained the barman as harris made off a little unsteadily through the grayblue haze of cigarette smoke something you saw much more often these days since the war had begun straitlaced eh brentwood said to the barman yeah cor my dad e loved crosby bit of a crooner himself always hummin round the ouse then id be on listenin to the who drive me mum nuts battle royal over that i can tell you uhhuh said brentwood it was like listening to a new code when harris returned they walked out into the chilly night air they could see the searchlights all around london in constant crisscrossing interplaying patterns reaching thousands of feet and reflecting off the stratus do no good at all im told said harris looking up at them is that true more or less agreed robert a cold bracing breeze coming up from the embankment its a war of invisible beams he explained to harris but i guess searchlights give comfort to a lot of folks something you can see harris had hailed a cab for waterloo station its headlights two yellow slits what you think our chances are look here i dont want to pry classified stuff or anything like that i dont know said brentwood far as i can tell the experts dont know either they got into the back of the taxi how long do you think it will last pressed harris longer than anyone expected thats rather grim yes there was a long silence until they entered waterloo and robert brentwood alighted turning to pay the cabbie harris waved the money away all right said brentwood you can put off some of the people some of the time but you cant put off all of the people all of the time and with that he handed the bookshop manager the liter of old espagnol that hed been hiding under his coat harris was agape thanks for everything mr harris i really appreciate harris cut in im really this is quite wonderful between allies said brentwood smiling allies indeed harris put out his hand he made to say something hesitated then dared to go on anyway captain you might be right it might last longer than any of us imagined but if youll accept a piece of advice certainly harris lowered his head that gal any port in a storm old boy then he sat back in the cab chuckling shaking his head any port my god captain dont you tell anyone i told you that so banal theyd have me thrown out of the club i wont said brentwood goodbye tata when he got to oxshott a wind had come up the oaks and big elms around the station blowing hard a smell so fresh and clean that despite the distant thudding of antiaircraft guns and the orange scratches against the sky that were the surfacetoair missiles along the coast from east anglia down robert had the sense that he had been to this place before but not being a superstitious man and trained in the cold logic of launch mode attack he decided that it must be the invigorating force of the wind that had cleared the guiness heightened his senses giving him the feeling of déjà vu the spence house however looked familiar too like the one his parents had in new jersey doublestoried semimodern brick all the lights were out but flower beds were dimly visible beneath the high silver moon a dog barking from somewhere behind the house and a run of big bushes possibly rhododendrons giving the whole garden a casually ordered appearance he rang the bell realizing that hed planned this operation badly but there had been no hotel rooms left in oxshott so it was either this or back to the train station to wait until am a light came on then another when the front door opened he saw a woman her hair in curlers long padded dressing gown held tightly by her hand at the throat he guessed it was the dead boys mother he took off his cap mrs spence no is there something im captain brentwood maam us navy robert brentwood my sister is a nurse she was williams nurse and she wrote me with oh oh he heard the door chain rattling oh do come in ah oh please come in she switched on the kitchen and living room lights she switched them off again explaining quickly i havent drawn the blackout drapes whatsrosemary a man in his sixties tousled head of sparse brown hair in a tartan nightrobe was coming down from the upstairs bedroom peering shortsightedly oh father this is captain brentwood nurse brentwoods brother hes richard spence tightened the belt on his robe and put out his hand how kind of you my goodness where have you come from at this hour london sir i m afraid i left it a bit late and when i reached oxshott there were no bedandbreakfast places hotels or anything else im sorry to bother you bother no bother rose get mother quickly he turned back to brentwood tying his robe tighter about his thin frame would you like a cup of tea yes sir thatd be nice robert brentwood decided there and then not to tell them about the damaged tape in his kit if they asked hed say it never arrived it would be heartbreak for them when mrs spence came down slowly a short frail lady with soft white hair she looked dazed richard spence said softly my wifes been on medication captain ever since of course sir i understand robert brentwood rose to his feet to greet mrs spence richard spence left the room hurriedly the americans manners his thoughtfulness in coming this far all the way from scotland to bring something of their sons last hours in a foreign place filled richard spence with such gratitude he had to excuse himself in order to regain his composure when he reappeared he was in command of the situation i hope youll be staying if it wouldnt be too much trouble sir a bed for the night would be more than tonight when are you due back ten days sir of course he must stay put in anne spence the hot steaming tea rosemary had made reviving her williams room there was a quick glance between rosemary and her father it was the first time anne spence had even considered the idea of anyone entering williams room perhaps said rosemary who robert now saw had taken off her scarf and hair rollers her hair warm and golden perhaps the captain has other plans mother im sure he has friends no i dont he had said it without thinking why he couldnt fathom first law of defense never betray your most vulnerable angle of attack it was rosemary her eyes she was not especially beautiful but there was a kindness devoid of any cunning and in that moment he remembered lanas injuction about giving love he had been trained for splitsecond decisions his kind of war did not permit anything else a second lost was a ship lost he wanted to stay the house astonishingly to him did not have a different smell from his own home perhaps it was a spice something as mundane as a rug cleaner his mother had used with the same odor or perhaps hed been at sea so long he could no longer tell the difference in ambience between one house and another whatever the reason he felt he was in a home he knew and understood here there was loyalty and affection and there was love id like to stay he said bravo said richard spence brightening you hungry brentwood thought about it for a moment why yes sir i believe i am they all laughed even mrs spence showed the trace of a smile now then what do you americans like asked richard wish georgina was here he looked over at brentwood shes our younger daughter up at lse london school of economics political science what on earth has that got to do with what americans eat asked the fraillooking mrs spence havent the foggiest replied richard rolling up the sleeves of his robe so they wouldnt touch the element well georgina thinks she knows everything i suppose thats why americans like hamburgers said mrs spence eggs said richard whats that expression easy up easy over daddy said rosemary chuckling she shook her head at robert dont mind us she said i expect were bombarding you awfully perhaps you hate eggs no maam i love them brentwood also knew that eggs were the leastrationed of foods much easier to get than meat you see cut in richard happily i told you rose how about a welsh rarebit sounds fine said brentwood oh said rosemary how rude we are she walked over and took roberts cap call me rose she said quietly and robert brentwood did something he normally never did he looked at her fingers no rings as anne spence and her husband busied themselves in the kitchen mrs spence giving quiet directions richard assuring her he knew exactly what to do rosemary took robert brentwood into the dining room now she said you must tell me all about yourself id rather know all about you im a schoolteacher shakespeare he said she brightened how oh she said william i expect yes my sister told me he talked quite a lot about you and the family yes we miss him very much there was an awkward silence can i ask you about your work rosemary asked i mean they wont put me in prison or anything no he laughed ask away this is going to sound awfully silly but ive never understood why people always say how dreadful it must be on submarines i mean i know theyre rather crowded or at least i imagine they are even the latest ones but from the looks of them i think i should feel much more claustrophobic on the tube the tube the underground she said smiling it was an easy smile utterly devoid of any pretense their banter about the sub and everything else they discussed came as easily to them as if they were old friends the kind whom one hasnt seen for twenty years or more and yet whose conversation is taken up as if space and time had never existed he couldnt remember when he had felt more relaxed in the company of anyone outside his family the house like that of his parents was neat but not obsessively so comfortable but not ostentatiously indulgent and though he knew nothing much about art the paintings he saw gave him special pleasure one in particular la gare du nord had such vibrant colors that at times it seemed to fill the spences living room with a sense of life and light the whole house seemed warm and robert felt that ironically it was the death of their youngest that like the death of a crewman aboard a ship drew the others closer together and with rosemary he felt he had to be honest even confessing to her that hed never read much shakespeare most people havent she said laughing not really read him and those who do always try to make him so dramatic and all those flourishes his language is really very quick alive you know the quick and the dead robert shook his head afraid youve lost me there she paused they looked at each other i dont think so she said and they both knew that it was beginning will you go away soon she asked quietly well be casting off in ten days i meant how long will you stay here as long as i possibly can good she said her father was coming into the dining room with the tray i noticed you have a biography of bing crosby with you he said yes one of my favorites too robert brentwood was about to say that hed bought it for richard spence but it would be a lie oh a harmless one but there was something about this whole family something good that made him want to speak only the truth ten days might be all that they had id be happy for you to read it while im here oh no i dont want to no sir please i dont think ill be doing much reading id like to do a bit of walking stretch my legs for a change rose richard spence said looking over his cup of steaming darjeeling youre the trail person over to the downs down to martin then over yes yes said his wife but first where did you put the toast by the time theyd finished the impromptu meal it was near as richard and anne retired rosemary showing robert williams room it was a neat room in what robert thought was a very navy way small writing desk and chair a bed a clean uncluttered victorian dresser with minor and a picture of a young seaman winter uniform ill see you in the morning she said robert brentwood was tired but he could not sleep for thinking of her it was already quite clear to him that theyd be married but he decided not to rush it hed ask her father tomorrow in the morning a saturday robert was surprised to discover they all enjoyed a late brunch and afterward newspapers all round in the sun room being the guest robert got to take his pick and while a scantily clad chorus girl under the screaming headline doing her bit for the war effort caught his eye he played safe and took the sunday telegraph it was a mixed read for on the one hand it was clear that the tide had turned in korea the nka in disarray editorials understanding the american desire to push as far as the yalu but cautioning against it as part of any longrange solution to the upheavals on the asian front who is this awful freeman man asked rosemary the american general said richard theres talk of them sending him over to europe jolly good thing too he looked over at robert sorry captain brentwood call me robert please yes certainly well robert you must forgive rosemarys disapproval of this freeman chap oh its not that i disapprove daddy said rose ive no doubt hes a very good soldier but he says such awful things about them thats because theyre awful people said richard they blatantly attack south korea and then expect mrs spence excused herself from the table and they tried to steer conversation in other directions but inevitably it seemed to come back to the war simply because it was worldwide and day by day was affecting more and more people the telegraph reporting for example how so many of the russian minority groups from the georgians to the estonians to the mongols were demanding greater independence from russian domination and how the russian tanks had quickly put down any such aspirations which solved nothing but merely postponed the inevitable bloodshed and in china the martyrs of were commemorated by students in a silent vigil in tiananmen square watched from a ring of olivegreen tanks by steelhelmeted troops of the peoples liberation army thats why said richard things have quieted down a bit in western europe for the moment the bolshies want to make sure their backyards secure before they move into france you think they will asked robert richard spence was stirring the tea bag in the pot and squeezing it on the side something he would never have done were it not for the rationing that was getting more severe all the time attack france its inevitable im no strategist but if you chaps keep doing your job and more of those convoys get through ivans going to have to do something robert nodded the french ports exactly im afraid what were seeing here in europe right now is a lull before the next storm it was when mrs spence reentered the room and richard quickly turned over the war news pages that showed the map of europe with the three great russian prongs deep into germany that he came across the advertisement that had been running for several days and which like so many in his opinion made absolutely no sense he pounced on it as a diversionary tactic to shift his wifes attention away from all the battlefront news heres this madman again rosemary leaned over to robert this is daddys favorite hobbyhorse be warned richard spence was reading it aloud it is vital to the national defense that you surrender immediately all your portable hair dryers to the following address whats it mean laughed robert it means said richard spence that some damned old fool called dr guy knowlton is allowed to indulge his eccentricity despite the fact that this country is in a state of national crisis theyre always going on about shortages paper especially and here they go allowing it is a private ad daddy said rosemary not the governments mrs spence excused herself from the table again sorry mother robert forgot all about the man and the portable hair dryers and everything else about the war as he and rosemary walked hand in hand across the downs cycled through the treearched byways around martin and fell more deeply in love robert had chickened out from asking either rosemary or her parents about marrying her but gathered his forces and did so on the second to last day of his leave richard spence was stunned as he confessed later it had really been anne who to use his potential soninlaws idiom carried the ball she hadnt seemed surprised at all but anne spence had already lost one child and might lose more if the russians managed to drive through in the next great offensive and take the french ports england would be next they gave their blessing to robert and rosemary but richard was still fretting on the last night before robert would have to leave and go north to holy loch in their bedroom richard was pacing back and forth anne having already taken her pill trying despite her jangled nerves to get some sleep will you stop she said finally too fast said richard its all too fast for my liking too fast perhaps not fast enough his wife said quietly what do you mean he shot back none of us knows whether well be here tomorrow they might as well richard didnt speak for a long time and not until he was in bed did he concede the point perhaps youre right in the blackedout living room robert and rosemary held each other not saying much neither wanting to talk about the cold fact that tomorrow he would be off again to war if you want she began no he said though i suppose you think im nuts i think youre wonderful and i love you and im so afraid for you maybe we should put it off then until she placed her finger on his lips no she said softly shaking her head resolute in her decision no well get married as soon as you come back as we planned there was a taping on the front door and from the living room robert could see the small red light that came on as whoever was outside also tried the chime bell chime doesnt work said rosemary getting up and brushing herself down looking presentable as she walked toward the door outside a policeman was standing beneath the porch light rain glistening on his cape yes constable rosemary came back her shapely figure outlined in the spillover of the kitchen light one hand on her chest in relief whats up robert asked the drapes apparently theres a slit of light from mummy and daddys room as she walked down from her parents room and he saw her silhouetted again this time in the faint hallway light he didnt think he could control it any longer nor could she he took her by the hand and in the darkness of the living room they made love tell me she said promise me youll come back from the coast came the dull thudding of antiaircraft fire and the high swishing noise of missile salvos and he remembered lanas premonition of danger her counsel to give love to have love while one still could ill comeback
