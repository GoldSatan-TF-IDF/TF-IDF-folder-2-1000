the darkest road guy gavriel kay summary of books one and two in the summer tree it was told how loren silvercloak and matt sören a mage and his magical source from the high kingdom of brennin in the world of fionavar induced five people from our own world to cross with them to fionavar their ostensible purpose was to have the five participate in the festivities attendant on the celebration of the fiftieth year of the reign of ailell the high king in fact there were darker premonitions underlying the mages actions in brennin a brutal drought was afflicting the kingdom ailells older son aileron had already been exiled for cursing his fathers refusal to allow him to sacrifice himself on the summer tree in an effort to end the drought in fionavar the five strangers quickly found themselves drawn into the complex tapestry of events kim ford was recognized by the aged seer ysanne as the successor she had prophetically dreamt kim was initiated into the knowledge of the seers by the water spirit eilathen and presented with the baelrath the warstone that ysanne had been guarding kim was also shown the circlet of lisen a gem that shone with its own light the beautiful lisen a power of pendaran wood had been the magical source and the beloved companion of amairgen whitebranch the first of the mages she had killed herself leaping into the sea from her tower upon learning that amairgen had died ysanne told kim the prophecy that accompanied the circlet who shall wear this next after lisen shall have the darkest road to walk of any child of earth or stars later as a last gesture of ultimate sacrifice on the eve of war ysanne knowing kim would have need of the old seers power in the days to come used lokdal the magic dagger of the dwarves to kill herselfbut not before tracing a symbol on the brow of the sleeping kim which action enabled her to make of her own soul a gift for kimberly meanwhile paul schafer and kevin laine were initiated in quite a different way paul playedand losta night game of chess with the high king in the palace of paras derval during which an unexpected bond of sympathy was forged between the two the next morning he and kevin joined the band of the reckless prince diarmuid ailells younger son in a raid across the river saeren to cathal the garden country there diarmuid achieved his intended seduction of sharra the princess of cathal after the companys return to brennin they passed a wild night in the black boar tavern late at night a song kevin sang reminded paul too acutely of the death in a car accident of rachel kincaid the woman he had loved paul blaming himself for the accident which had occurred moments after rachel had announced she was going to wed someone else took a drastic step he approached the high king and received ailells sanction to sacrifice himself in the kings stead on the summer tree the next night the glade of the summer tree in the godwood saw an epic battle as paul bound on the tree watched helplessly galadan the wolflord who had come to claim pauls life was opposed and driven back by a mysterious grey dog the following nightpauls third on the treea red full moon shone in the sky on a new moon night as dana the mother goddess granted paul release from his guilt by showing that he had not in fact subconsciously willed the accident that had killed rachel as paul wept rain finally fell over brennin paul though did not die he was taken down from the tree alive by jaelle the high priestess of dana henceforth paul would carry another name pwyll twiceborn lord of the summer tree by now it was clear that an epochal confrontation was at hand rakoth maugrim the unraveller defeated a thousand years before and bound under the great mountain rangat had freed himself and had caused the mountain to explode with a hand of fire to proclaim that fact his freedom was to have immediate consequences for jennifer lowell the fourth of the strangers in paras derval she had witnessed an unsettling incident during a childrens counting game a young girl leila had called a boy named finn to take the longest road for the third time that summer no one not even jaelle who had also been watching knew exactly what that meant though jaelle was quick to enlist leila as an acolyte in the temple the next day riding outside the town walls jennifer met brendel of the lios alfarthe children of lightand a party of his people she spent the night in the woods with them and in the darkness they were attacked concerned about the arrival of the five strangers rakoth maugrim had galadan and metranthe traitorous first mage of brenninabduct jennifer she was bound to the back of the black swan avaia and borne north to rakoths fortress of starkadh meanwhile the terrifying explosion of the mountain had caused the death of the aged high king this led to a tense confrontation between diarmuid and his brother aileronwho had been disguised as ysannes servant since his exile the potentially violent situation was ended by diarmuids voluntarily relinquishing his claim to the throne but not before hed received a knife in the shoulder courtesy of sharra of cathal who had come to brennin to seek vengeance on him for the deception that had led to her seduction in the meantime dave martyniuk the last of the five strangers had been separated from the others in the crossing to fionavar he ended up far to the north among the dalrei the riders on the plain and found himself drawn into the life of the third tribe led by ivor their chieftain ivors young son tabor fasting in the forest for a vision of his totem animal dreamt a seemingly impossible creature a winged chestnut unicorn three nights later at the edge of the great wood pendaran he met and flew upon this creature of his fast imraithnimphaisa doubleedged gift of the goddess born of the red full moon meanwhile dave was escorted toward brennin by a party of dalrei led by ivors older son levon the company was ambushed by a great number of the evil svart alfar and only dave levon and a third dalrei tore survived by riding into the darkness of pendaran wood the trees and spirits of pendaran hating all men since the loss of the beautiful lisen of the wood a thousand years before plotted the death of the three men but they were saved by the intervention of flidais a diminutive forest power who claimed among other things to know the answers to all the riddles in all the worlds save one the name by which the warrior could be summoned as it happened the search for this name was one of the tasks ysanne had left with kimberly flidais sent word to ceinwen the capricious greenclad goddess of the hunt who had taken a special liking to dave the goddess arranged for the three friends to awaken safely on the southern edge of the great wood in the morning she did more she also caused dave to find a longlost object of power oweins horn levon who had been taught by wise old gereint the blind shaman of his tribe then found the cave of the sleepers nearbya cave wherein owein and the kings of the wild hunt lay asleep the three friends rode south with this knowledge to paras derval in time to arrive for the first council of ailerons reign the council was interrupted twice the first time by the arrival of brock a dwarf from banir tal who knelt before matt sörenonce king of the dwarvesand proffered the terrible tidings that the dwarves under the leadership of two brothers kaen and blod had helped the unraveller to free himself by treacherously breaking the wardstone of eridu thus preventing any warning of rakoths stirring under the mountain they had also found and delivered to rakoth the cauldron of khath meigol which had the power to raise the newly dead in the midst of this terrifying recitation kimberly suddenly sawin a vision shaped by the baelrathjennifer being raped and tortured by rakoth in his fortress of starkadh she gathered dave paul and kevin around her reached out for jennifer with the wild power of her ring and drew the five of them out of fionavar back to their own world and so ended the summer tree the wandering fire picked up the story some six months later in november and back in toronto with kimberly waiting for the dream that would give her the warriors summoning name jennifer badly scarred in her soul and carrying the child of rakoth maugrimhaving vowed to give birth to that child as her answer to the darkwas brought early to her time by a sudden crossing back to fionavar the crossing was achieved by paul when the two of them were threatened by galadan who had crossed to their world in pursuit of paul in fionavar jennifers child darien was left to be secretly fostered in the house of vae and shahar the parents of finnthe boy called by the childrens counting game to take the longest road the only persons informed of the secret were the priestesses of dana because paul and jennifer needed jaelles magic to send them home the following spring kim finally had the dream for which she had been waiting as a result the five traveled to stonehenge where kim raised the spirit of uther pendragon by the power of the baelrath and compelled him to name his sons resting place kim then went alone by the magic she carried to glastonbury tor and therehaving first sent the others ahead to fionavarshe drew the warrior arthur from his rest by the summoning name childslayer the name was an echo of the sin arthur had committed in his youth after discovering his inadvertent incest with his sister kim and the warrior followed the others to paras derval an icy winter gripped fionavar even as midsummer approacheda winter so terrible that fordaetha the ice queen of rük was able to come as far south as paras derval she almost killed paul in the black boar tavern before he succeeded in driving her back north it was decided in council that jaelle and the mages and kimberly would join with gereint the old shaman in an attempt to magically probe the source of the killing wintera necessary prelude to trying to end it in the meantime the dimensions of arthur pendragons tragedy were beginning to take shape as it became clear to brendel of the lios alfar first of everyone who jennifer lowell really was guinevere beloved of arthur and of lancelot marred by her suffering in starkadh jennifer withdrew to the sanctuary of dana with jaelle it was jaelle who explained that vae and finn had taken darien who was growing with the unnatural rapidity of all the andainchildren of mortals and gods to ysannes cottage by the lake there darien seeming now to be a child of five years old was growing up in the loving care of his foster mother and brother who were troubled by two things a power which caused his blue eyes to flash red and an awareness that the child was drawn by voices in the storms of winter on the plain the dalrei were hardpressed the winter had rendered the graceful eltorthe creatures the dalrei hunted and depended uponawkward and ungainly in the snow which made them easy prey for galadans wolves ivornow aven or father of all the dalrei had herded the eltor down to the southeastern corner of the vast plain and there the gathered tribes guarded them as best they could until one attack included great numbers of the hideous urgach mounted upon sixlegged monsters called slaug only the intervention of diarmuid of brennin with dave and kevin in his company saved the dalrei from the first wave of the mounted urgach and only the appearance of ivors son tabor riding imraithnimphais his deadly winged mount with the shining horn saved them from the second larger wave ivor was painfully aware of the effect such flight had on tabor drawing him ever farther from the world of men shortly after back in brennin another new strand entered the tapestry at the urging of levon ivors older sonand having the reluctant agreement of lorenkim and dave the bearers of what levon thought to be the elements of an ancient verse that spoke of the waking of the wild hunt went with a number of companions to the place at the edge of pendaran wood where the cave of the sleepers lay the baelrath shattered the stone at the cave mouth and then daves horn summoned forth owein and the seven kings of the hunt with the shadowy sky kings wailing where is the child a child did indeed step forth to become one of the wild hunt it was finn and this was the longest road to which he had been called most of the company including shalhassan the supreme lord of cathal and sharra his daughter who had arrived from the south with reinforcements made their way the next morning to gwen ystrat the province of the goddess partly to meet gereint the shaman there partly in response to a report from audiart jaelles second in command that the province was being beset by wolves the company was led by the grey dog that had saved paul on the summer tree and who turned out to be cavall arthurs hunting dog they passed into the province of the mother amid ice and snow on the day before maidaladanmidsummers evewith all the ancient erotic blood magic such a night implied that evening with the aid of the other magic wielders kim descended into the designs of maugrim and found a clue that enabled loren to deduce that the winter was being shaped by metran the treacherous mage using the cauldron of khath meigol and basing himself on the unholy island of cader sedat kim herself would have died in her quest had she not been saved by an unexpected source ruana of the paraiko one of the giants the people who had shaped the cauldron in the first place they were a race long thought to be dead and haunting the mountain passes with their blood curse ruana reached kim telepathically and told her that his people were alive but were slowly being put to deathbloodlesslyby the urgach and svart alfar the next day during the wolf hunt kevinwho had been feeling useless through all the combatshad nearly fatal injury added to insult when he was gored by a white boar he was saved by the healing magic of the mages but this last symbolic portent finally brought home to him what his own fate and task were to be amid the unbridled eroticism of midsummers eve in gwen ystrat on a night when prince diarmuid told sharra of cathal that he loved her kevin slipped away alone to the east and guided by cavall in the snow came to the cave of dun maura where he sacrificed his life to the goddess that she might intercede and break the winterthus enabling the others to sail to cader sedat and battle with metran in the meantime paul had remained behind with vae and darien earlier that same day he had taken darien to the summer tree his plan was to summon cernan the staghorned god of the forests and galadans father to help accelerate dariens progression to his maturity a maturity desperately needed for the ambivalent child was growing steadily in power as it happened darien needed no such aid in an oak grove on midsummers eve he propelled himself forward in years to much the same age as his brother finn had been before he left having overheard cernan ask paul why the child had even been allowed to live darien departed vowing to seek out his father rakoth maugrim not long after it was decided that diarmuids men with loren and arthur and paul would sail for cader sedat kimberly had remained in the east with only brock the dwarf as her companion on a journey to the mountain pass where the paraiko were being slain the two of them had scarcely entered the mountains however when they were attacked and captured by a band of brigands with kevins sacrifice ending the winter war became a reality from the borders of daniloth the shadowland where dwelt the lios alfar an army of the dark was seen sweeping south toward the plain ratenniel lord of the lios alfar sent warning to the dalrei in response ivor led his whole armysave for tabor left behind to guard the campin a wild fulltilt ride across half the length of the plain to meet the enemy by the banks of the adein river the battle that followed was on the verge of being lostdespite the appearance of ratenniel and the lios alfarwhen dave martyniuk sounded oweins horn to summon the wild hunt the kings of the hunt led by the child who had once been finn began slaughtering the forces of the darkand then without discrimination those of the light as well they were only diverted from their kill by the intercession of the goddess ceinwen much later dave awoke in the darkness on the mount beneath which ceinwen had gathered the dead and she made love with him on the grass that night back in brennin on the morning before the voyage to cader sedat jennifer emerged from the temple at the urging of matt sören for the space of a single day she was reunited with arthur then after the ship sailed she set out in turn with only brendel of the lios alfar to accompany her to watch for its return from the anor lisen the tower at the westernmost edge of pendaran wood where lisen a thousand years ago had waited for amairgen at sea the ship prydwen was attacked by a monstrous creature the soulmonger of maugrim amid the sound of unearthly music loren and matt defended the ship while paul desperately sought the power to summon liranan the god of the sea to battle the monster at the last instant he was reached by gereint the shaman who had sent his soul traveling out to sea in search of paul to give him the aid that would make the summoning possible thus compelled the sea god came and drove the monster into the deeps killing itbut not before diarmuid had leaped to the soulmongers enormous head and plucked the white staff of amairgen whitebranch from where it was embedded between its eyes and so two tragic mysteries were made clear amairgen who had disappeared after sailing for cader sedat a thousand years ago had evidently been slain by this creature even worse the music they had heard was the glorious singing of all the lios alfar who had set sail west toward the hidden island the weaver had shaped for them alone not one of them had reached it in a thousand years all had been slain in this place with arthurs guidance and lorens power the ship came to cader sedat there they discovered that metran had been using his mages power augmented by the cauldron to shape a death rain over the eastern land of eridu and was preparing to bring the rain westward over the mountains on that island a titanic mages battle was fought by loren and matt against metran who was sourced in the power of a myriad of svart alfar whodrained to death by the power he sucked from themwere being revived by the cauldron of khath meigol in the end loren prevailed killing metran and shattering the cauldron but only by drawing upon a depth of power that also killed his source matt sören in the aftermath of that duel paul and diarmuid followed arthur into the chamber of the dead beneath cader sedat there they watched the warrior wake lancelot du lac from his bed of stone to join in the war against the dark and so all three members of that triangle were now in fionavar back in the shattered hall of cader sedat lancelots first action was to use his own particular gifts exercised once before in camelot to bring matt sören back to life unfortunately during the brief time that matt had lain lifeless the bond of mage and source had been irrevocably broken and loren silvercloak had lost his magical powers the wandering fire ended as the company prepared to leave the island and sail back to war part ithe lost kanior chapter do you know the wish of your heart once when kim ford was an undergraduate young for university and young for her age someone had asked her that question over cappuccino on a first date shed been very impressed later rather less young shed often smiled at the memory of how close hed come to getting her into bed on the strength of a good line and a way with waiters in a chic restaurant the question though had stayed with her and now not so much older but whitehaired nonetheless and as far away from home as she could imagine being kim had an answer to that question the wish of her heart was that the bearded man standing over her with the green tattoos on his forehead and cheeks should die an immediate and painful death her side ached where he had kicked her and every shallow breath was a lancing pain crumpled beside her blood seeping from the side of his head lay brock of banir tal from where kim lay she couldnt tell if the dwarf was alive or not and if she could have killed in that moment the tattooed man would be dead through a haze of pain she looked around there were about fifty men surrounding them on the high plateau and most of them bore the green tattoos of eridu glancing down at her own hand she saw that the baelrath lay quiescent no more than a red stone set in a ring no power for her to draw upon no access to her desire it didnt really surprise her the warstone had never from the first brought anything but pain with its power and how could it have been otherwise do you know the bearded eridun above her said with harsh mockery what the dalrei have done down below what what have they done ceriog another man asked moving forward a little from the circle of men he was older than most of them kim saw there was grey in his dark hair and he bore no sign of the green tattoo markings i thought you might be interested the one named ceriog said and laughed there was something wild in the sound very near to pain kim tried not to hear it but she was a seer more than she was anything else and a premonition came to her with that laughter she looked at brock again he had not moved blood was still welling slowly from the wound at the side of his head i am interested the other man said mildly ceriogs laughter ended they rode north last night he said every man among them except the blind ones they have left the women and children undefended in the camp east of the latham just below us there was a murmur among the listening men kim closed her eyes what had happened what could have driven ivor to do such a thing what the older man asked still quietly does any of that have to do with us ceriog moved a step toward him you he said contemptuously are more than a fool you are an outlaw even among outlaws why should any of us answer questions of yours when you wont even give us your name the other man raised his voice very slightly on the windless plateau it carried i have been in the foothills and the mountains he said for more years than i care to remember for all of those years dalreidan is what i have offered as my name riders son is what i choose to call myself and until this day no man has seen fit to question it why should it matter to you ceriog if i choose not to shame my fathers grave by keeping his name as part of my own ceriog snorted derisively there is no one here who has not committed a crime old man why should you be different because said dalreidan i killed a mother and child opening her eyes kim looked at him in the afternoon sunlight there was a stillness on the plateaubroken by ceriogs laughter again kim heard the twisting note in it halfway between madness and grief surely ceriog mocked that should have given you a taste for more he flung his arms wide surely we should all have a taste for death by now i had come back to tell you of women and boys for sport down below i had not thought to see a dwarf delivered into my hands so soon he did not laugh again instead he turned to look down on the figure of brock sprawled unconscious on the sunbaked stone of the plateau a sick foreboding swept over kimberly a recollection though not her own ysannes whose soul was a part of her now a memory of a legend a nightmare tale from childhood of very great evil done very long ago what happened she cried wincing with pain desperate to know what did they do ceriog looked at her they all did for the first time she met his eyes and flinched away from the raw grief she read in them his head jerked up and down convulsively faebur he cried suddenly a younger lightbearded eridun stepped forward play messenger again faebur tell the story one more time see if it improves with age she wants to know what the dwarves have done tell her she was a seer the threads of the timeloom shuttled for her even as faebur began his flatvoiced recitation kim cut straight past his words to the images behind them and found horror the background of the tale was known to her though not less bitter for that the story of kaen and blod the brothers who had led the dwarves in search forty years ago of the lost cauldron of khath meigol when the dwarfmoot had voted to aid them matt sören the young king had thrown down his scepter and removed the diamond crown and left the twin mountains to find another fate entirely as source to loren silvercloak then a year ago the dwarf now lying beside her had come to paras derval with tidings of great evil done kaen and blod unable to find the cauldron on their own and driven near to madness by forty years of failure had entered into an unholy alliance with the aid of metran the treacherous mage they had finally unearthed the cauldron of the giantsand had paid the price it had been twofold the dwarves had broken the wardstone of eridu thus severing the warning link of the five stones and then they had delivered the cauldron itself into the hands of their new master the one whose binding under rangat was to have been ensured by the linked wardstonesrakoth maugrim the unraveller all this she had known had known too that metran had used the cauldron to lock in the killing winter that had ended five mornings ago after the night kevin laine had sacrificed himself to bring it to a close what she hadnt known was what had happened since what she now read in faeburs face and heard him tell feeling the images like lashes in her soul the death rain of eridu when the snow began to melt faebur was saying we rejoiced i heard the bells ring in walled larak though i could not return there exiled in the hills by my father i too gave thanks for the end of the killing cold so had she kim remembered she had given thanks even as she mourned hearing the wailing of the priestesses at dawn outside the dark cave of dun maura oh my darling man for three days faebur went on in the same detached numb tones the sun shone the grass returned overnight and the flowers when the rain came on the fourth day that too seemed natural and cause for joy until looking down from the high hills west of larak i heard the screaming begin the rain did not reach the hills but i could see herdsmen not far away on the slopes below with their goats and kere and i heard them scream when the rain fell and i saw huge black blisters form and break on animals and men as they died seers could gowere forced by their gift to gobehind the words to the images suspended in the coils of time try as she might kims second inner sight would not let her look away from the vision caught in faeburs words and being what she was twinned soul with two sets of memories she knew more even than faebur knew for ysannes childhood memories were hers and clearer now and she knew the rain had been shaped once before in a distant time of dark and that the dead were deadly to those who touched them and so could not be buried which meant plague even after the rain stopped how long did it last she asked suddenly ceriogs harsh laughter told her her mistake and opened a new deeper vein of terror even before he spoke how long he snapped his voice swirling erratically white hair should bring more wisdom look east foolish woman up the valley of the kharn look past khath meigol and tell me how long it lasted she looked the mountain air was thin and clear the summer sun bright overhead she could see a long way from that high plateau almost to eridu itself she could see the rain clouds piled high east of the mountains the rain hadnt ended and she knew as surely as she knew anything at all that if unchecked it would be coming their way over the carnevon range and the skeledarak to brennin cathal the wide plain of the dalrei and then of course to the place where undying rakoths most undying hatred layto daniloth where dwelt the lios alfar her thoughts shrouded in dread winged away west far past the end of land out over the sea where a ship was sailing to a place of death it was named prydwen she knew she knew the names of many things but not all knowledge was power not in the face of what was falling from that dark sky east of them feeling helpless and afraid kim turned back to ceriog as she did she saw that the baelrath was flickering on her hand that too she understood the rain she had just been shown was an act of war and the warstone was responding unobtrusively she turned the ring inward and closed her palm so it would not be seen you wanted to know what the dwarves had done and now you know ceriog said his voice low and menacing not all the dwarves she said struggling to a sitting position gasping with the pain that caused listen to me i know more of this than you i doubtless you know more traveling with one of them and you shall tell me before we are done with you but the dwarf is first i am very pleased said ceriog to see he is not dead kim whipped her head around a cry escaped her brock moaned his hands moved slightly heedless of risk she crawled over to help him i need clean cloths and hot water she shouted quickly no one moved ceriog laughed it seems he said that you havent understood me i am pleased to see him alive because i intend to kill him with great care she did understand and understanding could no longer hateit seemed that clear uncomplicated wishes of the heart were not allowed for her which wasnt all that surprising given who she was and what she carried she could no longer hate nor could she hold back her pity for one whose people were being so completely destroyed but neither could she allow him to proceed he had come nearer had drawn a blade she heard a soft almost delicate rustle of anticipation among the watching outlaws most of whom were from eridu no mercy to be expected there she twisted the ring back outward on her finger and thrust her hand high in the air harm him not she cried as sternly as she could i am the seer of brennin i carry the baelrath on my hand and a magegift vellin stone about my wrist she was also hellishly weak with a brutal pain in her side and no idea whatsoever of how she could hold them off ceriog seemed to have an intuition about that or else was so goaded by the presence of the dwarf that he was beyond deterrence he smiled thinly through his tattoos and his dark beard i like that he said gazing at the baelrath it will be a pretty toy to carry for the hours we have left before the rains come west and we all turn black and die first though he murmured i am going to kill the dwarf very slowly while you watch she wasnt going to be able to stop him she was a seer a summoner a storm crow on the winds of war she could wake power and gather it and sometimes to do so she could flame red and fly between places between worlds she had two souls within her and she carried the burden of the baelrath on her finger and in her heart but she could not stop a man with a blade let alone fifty of them driven mad by grief and fury and awareness of coming death brock moaned kim felt his lifes blood soaking through her clothing as she held his head in her lap she glared up at ceriog tried one last time listen to me she began while you watch he repeated ignoring her i think not said dalreidan leave them alone ceriog the eridun wheeled a twisted light of pleasure shone in his dark face you will stop me old man i shouldnt have to dalreidan said calmly you are no fool you heard what she said the seer of brennin with whom else and how else will we stop what is coming the other man seemed scarcely to have heard for a dwarf he snarled you would intercede now for a dwarf his voice skirled upward with growing incredulity dalreidan this has been coming between us for a long time it need not come only hear reason i seek no leadership ceriog only to only to tell the leader what he may or may not do said ceriog viciously there was a frozen half second of stillness then ceriogs arm whipped forward and his dagger flew over the shoulder of dalreidan who had dived and rolled and was up again in a move the plain had seen rehearsed from horseback for past a thousand years no one had seen his own blade drawn nor had they seen it thrown they did see it all of them buried in ceriogs heart and an instant later after the shock had passed they saw also that the dead eridun was smiling as might one who has found release from overmastering pain kim was suddenly aware of the silence of the sun overhead the finger of the breeze the weight of brocks head in her lapdetails of time and place made unnaturally vivid by the explosion of violence which had come and was gone leaving this stillness of fifty people in a high place dalreidan walked over to retrieve his blade his steps were loud on the rocks no one spoke dalreidan knelt and pulling the dagger free cleaned it of blood on the dead mans sleeve slowly he rose again and looked around the ring of faces first blade was his he said there was a stir a loosening of strain as if every man there had been holding his breath it was said an eridun quietly a man older even than dalreidan himself with his green tattoos sunken deep in the wrinkles of his face revenge lies not in such a cause neither by the laws of the lion nor the code of the mountains slowly dalreidan nodded his head i know nothing of the former and too much of the latter he said but i think you will know that i had no desire for ceriogs death and none at all to take his place i will be gone from this place i will be gone from this place within the hour there was another stir at that does it matter young faebur asked you need not go not with the rain coming so soon and that kim realized brought things back round to her she had recovered from the shockceriogs was not the first violent death shed seen in fionavarand she was ready when all their eyes swung to where she sat it may not come she said looking at faebur the baelrath was still alive flickering but not intensely so you are truly the seer of brennin he asked she nodded on a journey for the high king with this dwarf brock of banir tal who fled the twin mountains to bring us tidings of the treachery of others a dwarf in the service of ailell dalreidan asked she shook her head of his son ailell died more than a year ago the day the mountain flamed aileron rules in paras derval dalreidans mouth crooked wryly news he said is woven slowly in the mountains aileron faebur interjected we heard a tale of him in larak he was an exile wasnt he kim heard the hope in his voice the unspoken thought he was very young the beard concealed it only partially he was she said gently sometimes they go back home if the older eridun interposed there is a home to go back to seer can you stop the rain she hesitated looking beyond him east to where the clouds were piled high she said i cannot not directly but the high king has others in his service and by the sight i have i know that some of them are sailing even now to the place where the death rain is being shaped just as the winter was and if we stopped the winter then then we can end the rain a deep voice rumbled low and fierce she looked down his eyes were open oh brock she cried aboard that ship the dwarf went on speaking slowly but with clarity will be loren silvercloak and my lord matt sören true king of the dwarves if any people alive can save us it is the two of them he stopped breathing heavily kim held him close overwhelmed for an instant with relief careful she said try not to talk he looked up at her dont worry so much he said your forehead will set in a crease she gave a little gasp of laughter it takes a great deal he went on to kill a dwarf i need a bandage to keep the blood out of my eyes and a good deal of water to drink then if i can have an hours rest in the shade we can go on he was still bleeding kim found that she was crying and clutching his burly chest far too hard she loosened her grip and opened her mouth to say the obvious thing where go where it was faebur what journey takes you into the carnevon range seer of brennin he was trying to sound stern but the effect was otherwise she looked at him a long moment then buying time asked faebur why are you here why are you exiled he flushed but after a pause answered in a low voice my father unhoused me as all fathers in eridu have the right to do why she asked why did he do that seer dalreidan began no said faebur gesturing at him you told us your reason a moment ago dalreidan it hardly matters anymore i will answer the question there is no blood on the loomweft with my name only a betrayal of my city which in eridu is said to be red on the loom and so the same as blood it is simply told competing at the tasirona the summer games at teg veirene a year ago i saw and loved a girl from highwalled akkaize in the north and she saw and loved me as well in larak again in the fall of the year my father named to me his choice for my wife and i refused him and told him why kim heard sympathetic sounds from the other eriduns and realized they hadnt known why faebur was in the mountains nor dalreidan either for that matter until just now hed told of his murders the code of the mountains she guessed you didnt ask but she had and faebur was answering when i did that my father put on his white robe and went into the lions square of larak and he called the four heralds to witness and cursed me west to carnevon and skeledarak unhoused from eridu which meansand there was bitterness nowthat my father saved my life that is if your mage and dwarf king can stop rakoths rain you cannot seer you have told us so let me ask you again where are you going in the mountains he had answered her and with his hearts truth there were reasons not to reply but none seemed compelling where they were with the knowledge of that rain falling east of them to khath meigol she said and watched the mountain outlaws freeze into silence many of them made reflexive signs against evil even dalreidan seemed shaken she could see that he had paled he crouched down on his haunches in front of her and spent a moment gathering and dispersing pebbles on the rocks at length he said you will not be a fool to be what you are so i will say none of what first comes to me to say but i do have a question he waited for her to nod permission then went on how are you to be of service in this war to your high king or anyone else if you are bloodcursed by the spirits of the paraiko again kim saw them making the sign against evil all around her even brock had to suppress a gesture she shook her head it is a fair question she began hear me dalreidan interrupted unable to wait for her answer the bloodcurse is no idle tale i know it is not once years ago i was hunting a wild kere east and north of here and so intent on my quarry that i lost track of how far i had gone then the twilight came and i realized i was on the borders of khath meigol seer of brennin i am no longer young nor am i a talespinning elder by a winter fire stretching truth like bad wool i was there and so i can tell you there is a curse on all who go into that place of ill fortune and death and souls lost to time it is true seer it is not a tale i felt it myself on the borders of khath meigol she closed her eyes save us she heard ruana she opened her eyes and said i know it is not a tale there is a curse i do not think it is what it is believed to be you do not think seer do you know did she know the truth was she didnt the giants went back beyond ysannes learning or lorens or that of the priestesses of dana beyond even the lore of the dwarves or the lios alfar all she had was her own knowledge from the time in gwen ystrat when shed made that terrible voyage into the designs of the unraveller shielded by the powers of her friends and then the shields had fallen she had gone too far has lost them and was lost burning until another one had come far down in the dark and had sheltered her the other mind had named himself as ruana of the paraiko in khath meigol and had begged for aid they were alive not ghosts not dead yet and this was what she knew and all she knew on the plateau she shook her head meeting the troubled gaze of the man who called himself dalreidan no she said i know nothing with certainty save one thing i may not tell you and one thing i may he waited she said i have a debt to pay in khath meigol there was a real anguish in his voice she nodded a personal debt he asked straining to deal with this she thought about that about the image of the cauldron she had found with ruanas aid the image that had told loren where the winter was coming from and now the death rain not just me she said he drew a breath a tension seemed to ease from within him very well he said you speak as do the shamans on the plain i believe you are what you tell me you are if we are to die in a few days or hours i would rather do so in the service of light than otherwise i know you have a guide but i have been in the mountains for ten years now and have stood on the borders of the place you seek will you accept an outlaw as companion for this last stage of your journey it was the diffidence that moved her as much as anything else he had just saved their lives at risk of his own do you know what you are getting into do you she stopped aware of the irony none of them knew what they were getting into but his offer was freely made and handsome for once she had not summoned nor was she compelled by the power she bore she blinked back tears i would be honored she said we both would she heard brock murmur his agreement a shadow fell on the stone in front of her the three of them looked up faebur was there his face white but his voice was manfully controlled in the tasirona the games at teg veirene before my father exiled me i came i placed third of everyone in the archery could you would you allow he stopped the knuckles of the hand holding his bow were as white as his face there was a lump in her throat and she could not speak she let brock answer this time yes said the dwarf gently if you want to come we will be grateful for it a bowman is never a wasted thread and so in the end there were four of them later that day a long way west jennifer lowell who was guinevere came to the anor lisen as twilight fell with brendel of the lios alfar as her only companion she had sailed from taerlindel the morning before in a small boat not long after prydwen herself had dipped out of sight in the wide curving sea she had bidden farewell to aileron the high king to sharra of cathal and jaelle the priestess she had set out with the lios alfar that she might come to the tower built so long ago for lisen and so that coming there she might climb the spiraling stone stairs to the one high room with its broad seaward balcony and as lisen had done walk upon that balcony gazing out to sea waiting for her heart to come home handling the boat easily in the mild seas of that first afternoon sailing past aeven island where the eagles were brendel marveled and sorrowed both at the expressionless beauty of his companions face she was as fair as were the lios with fingers as long and slender and her awakened memories he knew went back almost as far were she not so tall her eyes not held to green she might have been one of his people which led him to a strange reflection out among the slap of waves and the billow of the single sail he had not made or found this boat which would ultimately be required when his time came but it was a trim craft made with pride and not unlike what he would have wanted and so it was easy to imagine that they had just departed not from taerlindel but from daniloth itself to be sailing west and beyond west toward that place made by the weaver for the children of light alone strange thoughts he knew born of sun and sea he was not ready for that final journey he had sworn an oath of vengeance that bound him to this woman in the boat and to fionavar and the war against maugrim he had not heard his song he did not knowno one didthe bitter truth prydwen had just set sail she was two nights and a dawn yet from the sound of singing in the sea from the place where the sea stars of liranan did not shine and had not shone since the bael rangat from the soulmonger as darkness came on that first night brendel guided their small craft toward the sandy shore west of aeven and the llychlyn marshes and beached it in the gentle evening as the first stars appeared with the provisions the high king had given them they made camp and took an evening meal later he laid out a sleeping roll for each of them and they lay down close to each other between the water and the woods he did not make a fire being too wise to burn even fallen driftwood from pendaran they didnt need one in any case it was a beautiful night in the summer shaped by kevin laine they spoke of him for a time as the night deepened and the stars grew more bright they spoke softly of the mornings departures and where the next evening would see them land looking at the night sky glorying in it he spoke to her of the beauty and the peace of daniloth and lamented that the dazzle of the stars was so muted there since lathen mistweaver in defense of his people had made their home into the shadowland after that they fell silent as the moon rose a shared memory came to both of them of the last time they had lain beside each other under the sky are you immortal she had asked before drifting to sleep no lady he had answered and had watched her for a time before falling asleep himself beside his brothers and sisters to wake amid wolves and svart alfar and red mortality in the presence of galadan wolflord of the andain dark thoughts and too heavy a silence for the quicksilver leader of the kestrel mark he lifted his voice again to sing her to sleep as one might a cherished child of seafaring he sang a very old song then one of his own about aum trees in leaf and sylvain flowering in spring and then as her breathing began to slow his voice rode her to rest with the words of what was always the last song of a night ratermaines lament for all those who had been lost when he finished she was asleep he remained awake though listening to the tide going out never again would he fall asleep while she was in his care not ever again he sat up all night watching watching over her others watched as well from the dark edgings of pendaran eyes not welcoming but not yet malevolent for the two on the sands had not entered the forest nor burned wood of the wood they were very near though and so were closely observed for pendaran guarded itself and nurtured its long hate they were overheard as well however low their voices for the listening ears were not human and could discern speech at the very edge of unspoken thought so their names became known and then a drumming sound ran through that part of the wood for the two of them had named their destination and that place had been built for the one who had been most loved and then most bitterly lost lisen who would never have died had she not loved a mortal and been drawn into war outside the shelter of the wood an urgent message went forth in the wordless rustle of leaves the shadowed flicker of forms half seen in a vibration quick as a running pulse of the forest floor and the message came in very little time as such things are measured to the ears of the only one of all the ancient powers of the wood who wholly grasped what was at work for he had moved through many of the weavers worlds and had played a part in this story when it first was spun he took thought deliberate and unhurriedthough there was a surge in his blood at the tidings and a waking of old desireand sent word back through the forest by leaf and quick brown messenger and by die pulse that threaded through the roots of the trees be easy he sent cahning the agitation of the wood lisen herself would have made this one welcome in the tower though with sorrow she has earned her place by the parapet the other is of the lios alfar and they built the anor forget it not we forget nothing nothing rustled the leaves coldly nothing throbbed the ancient roots twisted by long hate she is dead she need never have died in the end though he put his will upon them he had not the power to compel them all but he could persuade sometimes and this night and for this one he did then he went out from the doors of his house and he traveled at speed by ways he knew and so came to the anor just as the moon rose and he set about making ready a place that had stood empty for all the years since lisen had seen a ghost ship passing and had leaped from her high balcony into the darkness of the sea there was less to be done than might have been supposed for that tower had been raised with love and very great art and magic had been bound into its stones that they should not fall he had never been there before it was a place too sharp with pain he hesitated on the threshold for a moment remembering many things then the door swung open to his touch by moonlight he looked at the rooms on the lower level made for those who had stood guard he left them as they were and passed upward with the sound of the sea always in his ears he climbed the unworn stone stairs following their spiral up the single turret of the tower and so he came to the room that had been lisens the furnishings were sparse but exquisite and strange grafted in daniloth the room was wide and bright for along the western curve of it there was no wall instead made with the artifice of ginserat of brennin a window of glass stretched from floor to ceiling showing the moonlit sea there was salt staining the outside of the glass he walked forward and slid the window open the two halves rolled easily apart along their tracks into recesses hidden in the curving wall he stepped out on the balcony the sea sound was loud waves crashed at the foot of the tower he remained there a long time claimed by griefs too numerous to be isolated or addressed he looked to his left and saw the river it had run red past the anor for a year from the day she had died and it did so yet every year when the day came around again it had had a name once that river not any more he shook his head and began to busy himself he pulled the windows closed and having more than power enough to deal with this made them clean again he slid them open a second time and left them so that the night air might come into a room that had been closed a thousand years he found candles in a drawer and then torches at the bottom of the stairswood of the wood vouchsafed for burning in this place he lit the torches in the brackets set into the wall along the stairwell and then placed the candles about the one high room and lit them all by their light he saw that there was a layer of dust on the floor though not curiously on the bed and then he saw something else something that chilled even his wise knowing blood there were footsteps in the dust not his own and they led over to that bed and on the coverletwoven he knew by masters of the art in sereshlay a mass of flowers roses sylvain corandiel but it was not the flowers that held his gaze the candles flickered in the salt breeze off the sea but they were steady enough for him to clearly see his own small footprints in the dust and beside them those of the man who had walked into the room to lay those flowers on the coverlet and those of the giant wolf that had walked away his heart beating rapidly fear shadowed by pity within him he walked over to that bright profusion of flowers there was no scent he realized he reached out a hand as soon as he touched them they crumbled to dust on the coverlet very gently he brushed the dust away he could have made the floor shine with a trace assertion of his power he did not he never did in his own rooms under the forest floor going down the stairs one more time he found a sturdy broom in one of the lower chambers and then with strong domestic motions proof of long habit flidais swept out lisens chamber by candlelight and moonlight to make it ready for guinevere in time for his was a spirit of play and laughter even in darkest times he began to sing it was a song of his own weaving shaped of ancient riddles and the answers he had learned for them and he sang because he was filled with hope that nighthope of the one who was coming that she might have the answer to his hearts desire he was a strong presence and a bright one and there were torches and candles burning all through the anor the spirit of gereint could not fail to sense him singing sweeping the dust with wide motions of the broom as the shamans soul went past overhead leaving the known truths of the land to go spinning and tumbling out over the neverseen sea in search of a single ship among all the waves as the sun went down on their left the following evening brendel guided the boat across the bay and past the river mouth toward the small dock at the foot of the tower they had seen the upper lights come on as they swung into the bay now drawing near the lios alfar saw a portly whitebearded balding figure smaller even than a dwarf waiting on the dock for them and being of the lios alfar and more than six hundred years old himself he had an idea who this might be gentling the small craft up to the dock he threw a rope as they approached the small figure caught it neatly and tied the end to a peg set in the stone dock they rested there in silence a moment bobbing with the waves jennifer brendel saw was looking up at the tower following her gaze he saw the reflection of the sunset sparkle off the curved glass beyond the parapet be welcome said the figure on the dock in a voice unexpectedly deep bright be the thread of your days and of yours forest one said the lios alfar i am brendel of the kestrel mark the woman with me i know who she is the other said and bowed very low by what name shall we call you brendel asked the other straightened i am pied for protection dappled for deception he said reflexively then flidais will do it has for this long while jennifer turned at that and fixed him with a curious scrutiny youre the one dave met in the woods she said he nodded the tall one with the axe yes i did meet him green ceinwen gave him a horn after i know she said oweins horn to the east just then under a darkening sky a battle was raging along the bloodied banks of the adein a battle that would end with the blowing of that horn on the dock flidais looked up at the tall woman with the green eyes that he alone in fionavar had cause to remember from long ago is that the only knowledge you have of me he asked softly as having saved your friend in the boat brendel kept silent he watched the woman reach for a memory she shook her head should i know you she asked flidais smiled perhaps not in this form his voice went even deeper and suddenly he chanted i have been in many shapes i have been the blade of a sword a star a lantern light a harp and a harper both he paused saw something spark in her eyes ended diffidently i have fought though small in battle before the ruler of britain i remember she said laughing now wise child spoiled child you liked riddles didnt you i remember you taliesin she stood up brendel leaped to the dock and helped her alight i have been in many shapes flidais said again but i was his harper once she nodded very tall on the stone dock looking down at him memory playing in her eyes and about her mouth then there came a change both men saw it and were suddenly still you sailed with him didnt you said guinevere you sailed in the first prydwen flidais smile faded i did lady he said i went with the warrior to caer sidi which is cader sedat here i wrote of it of that voyage you will remember he drew breath and recited thrice the fullness of prydwen we went with arthur except seven none returned from he stopped abruptly at her gesture they stood so a moment the sun sank into the sea with the dark a finger of wind arose brendel watching only half understanding felt a nameless sorrow come over him as the light faded in the shadows jennifers face seemed to grow colder more austere she said you were there so you knew the way did you sail with amairgen flidais flinched as from an actual blow he drew a shaken breath and he who was half a god and could induce the powers of pendaran to accede to his will said in a voice of humble supplication i have never been a coward lady in any guise i sailed to that accursed place once in another form but this is my truest shape and this wood my true home in this first world of all how should a forest warden go to sea lady what good would i have done i told him i told amairgen what i knew that he would have to sail north into a north windand he said he would know where to do so and when i did that lady and the weaver knows that the andain seldom do so much for men he fell silent her regard was unresponsive remote the suddenly she said i will not allow praise to the men with trailing shields they know not on what day the chief arose when we went with arthur of mournful memory i wrote that flidais protested my lady guinevere i wrote that it was quite dark now on the path but with the keen sight of the lios alfar brendel saw the coldness leave her face voice gentle now she said i know taliesin flidais i know you did and i know you were there with him forgive me none of this makes for easy memory on the words she brushed past both of them and went up the pathway toward the tower over the darkened sea the evening star now shone the one named for lauriel the white he had done it completely wrong flidais realized watching her walk away he had meant to turn the conversation to the name the summoning name of the warrior the one riddle left in all the worlds for which he had no answer he was clever enough and to spare to have led the talk anywhere he wanted and the weaver knew how deep his desire for that answer was the thing he had forgotten though was what happened in the presence of guinevere even though the andain cared little for the troubles of mortal men how could one be sly in the face of so ancient a sorrow the lios alfar and the andain each with his own thoughts gathered the gear from the boat and followed her into the anor and up the winding stair it was strange thought jaelle to feel so uneasy in the place of her own power she was in her rooms in the temple in paras derval surrounded by the priestesses of the sanctuary and by the brownrobed acolytes she could mindlink at a moments need or desire with the mormae in gwen ystrat she even had a guestfriend in the temple sharra of cathal escorted to the doors but not beyond by the amusing tegid of rhodenwho it seemed was taking his duties as intercedent for diarmuid with unwonted seriousness it was a time for seriousness though and for disquiet none of the familiar things not even the bells ringing to summon the grey ones to sunset invocation were enough to ease the thoughts of the high priestess nothing was as clear as it once had been she was here and she belonged here would probably have scorned any request let alone command to be anywhere else hers was the duty and the power both to shape the spun webs of danas will and to do so in this place even so nothing felt the same for one thing hers also as of yesterday was half the governing of brennin since the high king had gone north the summonglass of daniloth had blazed yestereve two nights ago in truth but they had only learned of it on their return from taerlindel she had seen with aileron the imperative coiling of light in the scepter the lios alfar had given to ailell the king had paused only long enough to snatch a meal as he gave terse commands in the garrisons the captains of the guard were mobilizing every man it took very little time aileron had been preparing for this moment since the day she had crowned him he had done everything properly had appointed her with gorlaes the chancellor to govern the realm while he was away at war he had even paused beside her in front of the palace gates and quickly but not without dignity besought her to guard their people as best her powers allowed then he had been up on his black charger and galloping away with an army first to north keep to collect the garrison there and then north at night over the plain toward daniloth and dana alone knew what leaving her in this most familiar of places where nothing seemed familiar at all she had hated him once she remembered hated them all aileron and his father and diarmuid his brother the one she called the princeling in response to his mocking corrosive tongue faintly to her ears came the chanting from the domed chamber it was not the usual twilight invocation for eight more nights until midsummers moon was gone the evening chants would begin and end with the lament for liadon and so much power lay in this so magnificent a triumph for the goddess and thereby for herself as first high priestess in uncounted unknowable years to have heard the voice from dun maura cry out on maidaladan in mourning for the sacrifice come freely and with that her thoughts circled back to the one who had become liadon kevin laine brought from another world by silvercloak to a destiny both dark and dazzlingly bright one that not even the seer could have foreknown for all jaelles knowledge all her immersion in the nature of the goddess kevins had been an act so overwhelming so consummately gallant it had irrevocably blurred the clarity with which once shed viewed the world he was a man and yet he had done this thing it was since maidaladan so much harder to summon the old anger and bitterness the hate or more truly so much harder to summon them for anything and anyone but rakoth the winter was over the summonglass had blazed there was war somewhere north in the dark and there was a ship sailing west that thought carried her back to a strand of beach north of taerlindel where she had watched the other stranger pwyll summon and speak to the sea god by the waters edge in an inhuman light nothing was easy for any of them dana and the weaver knew but pywlls seemed such a harsh demanding power taking so much out of him and not giving so far as she could see a great deal back him too she remembered hating with a cold unforgiving fury when she had taken him from the summer tree to this very room this bed knowing that the goddess had spoken to him not knowing what she had said she had struck him she remembered drawing the blood all men should give but hardly in the manner prescribed rahod hedai liadon the priestesses sang under the dome ending the lament on the last long keening note and after a moment she heard shiels clear voice begin the antiphonal verses of the evening invocation there was some peace there jaelle thought some comfort to be found in the rituals even now even in time of darkness her chamber door burst open leila stood in the doorway what are you doing jaelle exclaimed leila you should be in the dome with she stopped the girls eyes were wide staring focused on nothingness leila spoke in a voice tranced and uninflected they have blown the horn she said in the battle he is in the sky now above the river finn and the kings i see owein in the sky he is drawing a sword finn is drawing a sword they arethey are her face was chalk white her fingers splayed at her sides she made a thin sound they are killing she said they are killing the svarts and the urgach finn is covered in blood so much blood and now owein ishe is jaelle saw the girls eyes flare even wider then and go wild with terror and her heart lurched leila screamed finn no stop him they are killing us she screamed again wordlessly and stumbling forward falling buried her head in jaelles lap her arms clutching the priestess her body racked convulsively the chanting stopped under the dome there were footsteps running along the corridors jaelle held the girl as tightly as she could leila was thrashing so hard the high priestess was genuinely afraid she would hurt herself what is it what has happened she looked up and saw sharra of cathal in the doorway the battle she gasped fighting to hold leila her own body rocking with the force of the girls weeping the hunt owein she is tuned to and then they heard the voice sky king sheath your sword i put my will upon you it seemed to come from nowhere and from everywhere in the room clear cold utterly imperative leilas violent movements stopped she lay still in jaelles arms they were all still the three in the room and those gathered in the corridor they waited jaelle found it difficult to breathe her hands were blindly reflexively stroking leilas hair the girls robe was soaked through with perspiration what is it whispered sharra of cathal it sounded loud in the silence who said that jaelle felt leila draw a shuddering breath the girlfifteen jaelle thought only thatlifted her head again her face was splotchy her hair tangled hopelessly she said it was ceinwen it was ceinwen high priestess there was wonder in her voice a childs wonder herself directly sharra again jaelle looked at the princess who despite her own youth had been trained in power and so evidently knew the constraints laid by the weaver on the gods leila turned to sharra her eyes were normal again and very young she nodded it was her own voice jaelle shook her head there would be a price demanded for that she knew among the jealous pantheon of goddesses and gods that of course was far beyond her something else though was not she said leila you are in danger from this the hunt is too wild it is the wildest power of all you must try to break this link with finn child there is death in it she had powers of her own knew when her voice was more than merely hers she was high priestess and in the temple of dana leila looked up at her kneeling still on the floor automatically jaelle reached out to push a snarl of hair back from the girls white face i cant leila said quietly only sharra nearest to them heard i cant break it but it doesnt matter anymore they will never call them again they dare not there will be no way to bind them if they do ceinwen will not intercede twice he is gone high priestess out among the stars on the longest road jaelle looked at her for a long time sharra came up and laid a hand on leilas shoulder the tangle of hair fell down again and once more the priestess pushed it back someone had returned to the dome the bells were ringing jaelle stood up let us go she said the invocations are not finished we will all do them come she led them along the curving corridors to the place of the axe all through the evening chants though she was hearing a different voice in her mind there is death in it it was her own voice and more than her own hers and the goddesss which meant always that what she said was true chapter the next morning at the greyest hour just before dawn prydwen met the soulmonger far out at sea at the same time on the plain dave martyniuk woke alone on the mound of the dead near celidon he was not never had been a subtle man but one did not need deep reserves of subtlety to apprehend the significance of ceinwens presence beneath him and above him on the green grass tinted silver in the night just past there had been awe at first and a stunned humility but only at first and not for very long in the blind instinctive assertion of his own lovemaking dave had sought and found an affirmation of life of the living after the terrible carnage by the river he remembered vividly a moonlit pool in faelinn grove a year ago how the stag slain by green ceinwens arrow had split itself in two and had risen and bowed its head to the huntress and walked away from its own death now he had another memory he sensed that the goddess had sharedhad engendered evenhis own compelling desire last night to reaffirm the absolute presence of the living in a world so beleaguered by the dark and this he suspected was the reason for the gift she had given him the third gift in fact his life in faelinn that first time then oweins horn and now this offering of herself to take away the pain he was not wrong in any of this but there was a great deal more to what ceinwen had done though not even the most subtle of mortal minds could have apprehended it which was as it should be as indeed it had always been macha knew however and red nemain and dana the mother most surely of all the gods might guess and some of the andain but the goddesses would know the sun rose dave stood up and looked around him under a brightening sky no clouds it was a beautiful morning about a mile north of him the adein sparkled and there were men and horses stirring along its bank east somewhat farther off he could make out the standing stones that surrounded and defined celidon the midplain home of the first tribe of the dalrei and gathering place of all the tribes there were signs of motion of life there as well who though and how many not all need die ceinwen had said to him a year ago and again last night not all perhaps but the battle had been brutal and very bad and a great many had died he had been changed by the events of the evening and night before but in most ways dave was exactly what he had always been and so there was a sick knot of fear in his stomach as he strode off the mound and began walking swiftly toward the activity by the riverbank who and how many there had been such chaos such muddy bloodbespattered confusion the wolves the lios arriving avaias brood in the darkening sky and then after hed blown the horn something else in the sky something wild owein and the kings and the child carrying death manifesting it he quickened his pace almost to a run who then he had part of an answer and he stopped abruptly a little weak with relief from the cluster of men by the adein two horses one dark grey the other brown almost golden had suddenly wheeled free racing toward him and he recognized them both their riders too the horses thundered up to him the two riders leaping off almost before stopping with the unconscious inbred ease of the dalrei and dave stood facing the men whod become his brothers on a night in pendaran wood there was joy and relief and all three showed it in their own ways but they did not embrace ivor dave asked only the name he is all right levon said quietly some wounds none serious levon himself dave saw had a short deep scar on his temple running up into the line of his yellow hair we found your axe levon explained by the riverbank but no one had seen you after after you blew the horn davor and this morning tore continued all the dead were gone and we could not find you he left the thought unfinished dave drew a breath and let it out slowly ceinwen he said did you hear her voice the two dalrei nodded without speaking she stopped the hunt dave said and then she took me away when i awoke she was with me and she said that she had gathered the dead he said nothing more the rest was his own not for the telling he saw levon quick as ever glance past him at the mound and then tore did the same there was a long silence dave could feel the freshness of the morning breeze could see it moving the tall grass of the plain then with a twist of his heart he saw that tore always so selfcontained was weeping soundlessly as he gazed at the mound of the dead so many tore murmured they killed so many of us of the lios mabon of rhoden took a bad shoulder wound levon said one of the swans came down on him mabon dave remembered had saved his life only two days before when avaia herself had descended in a blur of death from a clear sky he swallowed and said with difficulty tore i saw barth and navon both of them they were tore nodded stiffly i know i saw it too both of them the babies in the wood dave was thinking barth and navon barely fourteen when they died had been the ones that he and tore had guarded in faelinn grove on daves first night in fionavar guarded and saved from an urgach only to have them it was the urgach in white dave said bitterness like gall in his mouth the really big one he killed them both with the same stroke uathach levon almost spat the name i heard the others calling him i tried to go after him but i couldnt get no not that one levon tore interrupted his voice fiercely intense not alone we will defeat them because we must but promise me now that you will not go after him alone ever he is more than an urgach levon was silent promise me tore repeated turning to stand squarely before the avens son disregarded tears still bright in his eyes he is too big levon and too quick and something more than both of those promise me another moment passed before levon spoke only to the two of you would i say this understand that but you have my word his yellow hair was very bright in the sun he tossed it back with a stiff twist of his head and spun sharply to return to the horses over his shoulder not breaking stride he snapped come there is a council of the tribes in celidon this morning without waiting for them he mounted and rode dave and tore exchanged a glance then mounted up themselves double on the grey and set out after him halfway to the standing stones they caught up because levon had stopped and was waiting they halted beside him forgive me he said i am a fool and a fool and a fool at least two of those tore agreed gravely dave laughed after a moment so did levon ivors son held out his hand tore clasped it they looked at dave wordlessly he placed his own right hand over both of theirs they rode the rest of the way together weaver be praised and the bright threads of the loom venerable dhira chieftain of the first tribe said for the third time he was beginning to get on daves nerves they were in a gathering hall at celidon not the largest hall for it was not a very large assembly the aven looking alert and controlled despite a bandaged arm and a cut much like levons above one eye the chieftains of the other eight tribes with their advisers mabon duke of rhoden lying on a pallet obviously in pain as obviously determined to be present and ratenniel the lord of the lios alfar to whom all eyes continually returned in wonder and awe there were people absent dave knew people sorely missed two of the chieftains damach of the second tribe and berlan of the fifth were new to their titles the son and brother respectively of men who had died by the river ivor had to daves surprise left control of the gathering to dhira tore whispered a terse explanation the first tribe was the only one that never traveled the plain celidon was their permanent home they remained here at the midplain receiving and relaying messages through the auberei of all the tribes preserving the records of the dalrei providing the tribes with their shamans and always taking command of the gatherings here at celidon alwayseven in the presence of an aven so it had been in revors time and so it was now checks and balances dave thought it made some sense in the abstract but did little to reconcile him now in the aftermath of battle to dhiras quavering voice and laggard pace he had made a rambling discursive speech half mournful half in praise before finally calling upon ivor levons father had then risen to tell for the benefit of ratenniel the story of their wild improbable ridea night and a day across half the length of the plainto just beat the forces of maugrim to the river he had then deferred with grace to the lord of daniloth who in turn told of how he had seen the army of the dark crossing andarien how he had set his summonglass alight on atronel that it might flare a warning in paras derval had sent two messengers on the magnificent raithen to alert the dalrei and finally and most gallantly had led his own army out of the protected shadowland to battle by the adein his voice carried music but the notes were shaped by sorrow as he spoke a very great many from daniloth had died and from the plain and brennin as well for mabons five hundred men from rhoden had fought their way to the thick of the battle a battle that had seemed lost utterly for all the courage on profligate display until a horn had sounded and so dave who was davor here on the plain rose at ivors request and told his own story of hearing a voice in his mind reminding him of what he carried and in his memory it still sounded like kevin laine chiding him for being so slow and then blowing oweins horn with all the strength he had left in that hour they all knew what had happened had seen the shadowy figures in the sky owein and the kings and the child on the palest horse had seen them descend from a great height killing the black swans of avaias brood the svart alfar the urgach the wolves of galadan and then without pause or discrimination without mercy or respite turning on the lios alfar and the men of the plain and brennin until a goddess had come to cry sky king sheath your sword and after that only davor who had blown the horn knew anything more until dawn he told of waking on the mound and learning what it was and hearing ceinwen warn him that she could not intercede another time if he blew oweins horn again that was all he told them he sat down he had he realized just made a speech once he would have been paralyzed by the very thought now now not here there was too much at stake weaver be praised and the bright threads of the loom dhira intoned once more raising both his wrinkled hands before his face i proclaim now before all of this company that it shall henceforth be the duty and the honor of the first tribe to tend that mound of the dead with fullest rites that it remain forever green and that dave had had more than enough of this dont you think he interrupted that if ceinwen can raise the mound and gather the dead she can keep it green if she wants he winced as tore landed a punishing kick on his shin there was a small awkward silence dhira fixed dave with a suddenly acute glance i know not how these matters are dealt with in the world from which you come davor and i would not presume to comment dhira paused to let the point register in the same way he went on it ill behooves you to advise us about one of our own goddesses dave could feel himself flushing and an angry retort rose to his lips he bit it back with an effort of will and was rewarded by hearing the avens voice he has seen her dhira he has spoken to ceinwen twice and received a gift of her you have not nor have i he is entitled and more than that to speak dhira considered it then nodded it is so he admitted quietly to daves surprise i will unsay what last i said davor but know this if i speak of tending the mound it is as a gesture of homage and thanksgiving not to cause the goddess to do anything but to acknowledge what she has done is that inappropriate which left dave feeling sorry in the extreme for having opened his mouth forgive me chieftain he managed to say of course it is appropriate i am anxious and impatient and and with cause mabon of rhoden growled raising himself on his cot we have decisions to make and had best get to them silvery laughter ran through the chamber i had heard ratenniel said amused of the urgency of mankind but now i hear it for myself the tenor of his voice shaded downward they all listened entranced by his very presence among them all men are impatient it is woven into the way time runs for you into the shortness of your threads on the loom in daniloth we say it is a curse and a blessing both are there not times when urgency is demanded mabon asked levelly surely dhira cut in as ratenniel paused surely there are but this must before all else be a time of mourning for the dead or else their loss goes unremembered ungrieved and no said ivor one word only but everyone present heard the longsuppressed note of command the aven rose to his feet no dhira he repeated softly he had no need to raise his voice the focus of the room was his mabon is right and davor and i do not think our friend from daniloth will disagree not one man who died last night not one of the brothers and sisters of the lios who have lost their song will lie ungrieved beneath ceinwens mound the danger he said and his voice grew stern implacable is that they may yet have died to no purpose this must not while we live while we can ride and carry weapons be suffered to come to pass dhira we are at war and the dark is all about us there may be time for mourning but only if we fight through to light there was nothing even slightly prepossessing about ivor dave was thinking not beside ratenniels incandescence or dhiras slow dignity or even levons unconscious animal grace there were far more imposing men in the room with voices more compelling eyes more commanding but in ivor dan banor there was a fire and it was matched with a will and a love of his people that together were more than any and all of these other things dave looked at the aven and knew that he would follow this man wherever ivor asked him to go dhira had bowed his head as if under the conjoined weight of the words and his long years it is so aven he said and dave was suddenly moved by the weariness in his voice weaver grant we see our way through to that light he lifted his head and looked at ivor father of the plain he said this is no time for me to cling to pride of place will you allow me to yield to you and to your warriors and sit down ivors mouth tightened dave knew that he was fighting the quick tears for which he took so much abuse from his family dhira the aven said pride of place is always always yours you cannot relinquish it to me or anyone else but dhira you are chieftain of the first tribe of the children of peacethe tribe of the shamans the teachers loremasters my friend how should such a one be asked to guide a council of war incongruous sunshine streamed through the open windows the avens pained question hung in the room clear as the motes of dust where the slanting sunlight fell it is so said dhira a second time he stumbled toward an empty chair near mabons pallet obscurely moved dave began rising to offer his arm as aid but then he saw that ratenniel with a floating grace was already at dhiras side guiding the aged chieftain to his seat when the lord of the lios alfar straightened up though his gaze went out the western window of the room he stood very still a moment concentrating then said listen they are coming dave felt a quick stab of fear but the tone had not been one of warning and a moment later he too heard sounds from the western edge of celidonand the sounds were cries of welcome ratenniel turned smiling a little to ivor i doubt the raithen of daniloth could ever come among your people without causing a stir ivors eyes were very bright i know they could not he said levon will you have their riders brought here they were on their way in any case moments later levon returned and with him were two morea man and a womanof the lios alfar the air in the room seemed brighter for their presence as they bowed to their lord for all that they were hardly noticed it was the third of the new arrivals who claimed the absolute attention of every person in the room even in the company of the lios alfar dave was suddenly on his feet they all were brightly woven aven said aileron dan ailell his brown clothing was stained and dusty his hair tousled and his dark eyes lay sunken in deep pools of weariness he held himself very straight though and his voice was level and clear they are making songs outside even now about the ride of ivor who raced the army of the dark to celidon and beat them there and drove them back ivor said we had aid high king the lios alfar came out from daniloth and then owein came to the horn that davor carries and at the last green ceinwen was with us or we would all have died so i have just been told said aileron he fixed dave with a brief keen glance then turned to ratenniel bright the hour of our meeting my lord if loren silvercloak who taught me as a child said true no lord of daniloth has ventured so far from the shadowland since ralathen wove the mist a thousand years ago ratenniels expression was grave his eyes a neutral grey he said true he replied calmly there was a little silence then ailerons dark bearded face was lit by the brightness of his smile welcome back then lord of the lios alfar ratenniel returned the smile but not with his eyes dave saw we were welcomed back last night he murmured by svart alfar and urgach by wolves and avaias brood i know it said aileron swiftly changing mood and there is more of that welcome to come i think we all know it ratenniel nodded without speaking i came as soon as i saw the summonglass aileron went on after a pause there is an army behind me they will be here tomorrow evening i was in taerlindel the night the message was sent to us we know ivor said levon explained has prydwen sailed aileron nodded she has for cader sedat with my brother and the warrior and loren and matt and pwyll also and nabrendel surely ratenniel asked quickly or is he following with your army no said aileron as the two lios alfar behind him stirred something else has happened he turned then surprisingly to dave and told of what jennifer had said when prydwen was out of sight and what brendel had said and done and where the two of them had gone in the silence that followed they could hear the sounds of the camp through the windows there were still cries of wonder and admiration from the dalrei gathered about the raithen the sounds seemed to be coming from far away daves thoughts were with jennifer and with whatand whoshe seemed to have become ratenniels voice slid into the silence of the room his eyes were violet now as he said it is well or as well as could be in such a time as this brendels weaving was twined with hers since the night galadan took her from him we may have greater need of him in the anor than anywhere else only half understanding dave saw the diamondbright lios alfar woman let slip a sigh of relief niavin of seresh and teyrnon the mage are bringing up the army aileron said crisply coming back to solid facts i brought almost all of my forces including the contingent from cathal shalhassan is levying more men in his country even now i have left word that those should remain in brennin as a rear guard i came here alone riding through the night with galen and lydan because i had to let the army have some rest they had been riding for more than twentyfour hours and you high king ivor asked have you rested aileron shrugged there may be time after this meeting he said almost indifferently it doesnt matter dave looking at him thought otherwise but he was impressed all the same whom did you ride behind ratenniel asked suddenly an unexpected slyness in his voice do you think galen answered before aileron could speak that i would let a man so beautiful ride with anyone else she smiled aileron flushed red beneath his beard as the dalrei burst into sudden tensionbreaking laughter dave laughing too met ratenniels eyessilver nowand caught a quick wink from the lios alfar kevin laine he thought would have appreciated what ratenniel had just done a sorrow there the deepest among many he realized with a twist of surprise there was no time to even try to deal with the complexities of that sort of thought it was probably just as well dave knew emotions on that scale running so deep were dangerous for him they had been all his life and he had no room now for the paralysis they caused or the pain that would follow ivor was speaking dave forced his thoughts sharply outward again i was about to initiate a council of war high king will it please you to take charge now not in celidon aileron said with unexpected courtesy he had recovered from his momentary embarrassment and was once again controlled and direct not entirely without tact however dave out of the corner of his eye saw mabon of rhoden nod quiet approval and a look of gratitude suffused the features of old dhira sitting beside the duke dhira dave decided was all right after all he wondered if hed have a chance to apologize later and if hed be able to handle it i have my own thoughts the high king said but i would hear the counsel of the dalrei and of daniloth before i speak very well said ivor with a crispness that matched ailerons my counsel is this the army of brennin and cathal is on the plain we have daniloth here with us and every fit dalrei of fighting age except for one dave thought involuntarily but kept silence we are missing the warrior and silvercloak and have no word from eridu ivor continued we know that there will be no aid for us from the dwarves we do not know what has happened or will happen at sea i do not think we can wait to find out my counsel is to linger here only so long as it takes niavin and teyrnon to arrive and then to ride north through gwynir into andarien and force maugrim into battle there again there was a little silence then ruined andarien murmured lydan galens brother always and ever the battleground there was a bittersweet sadness in his voice echoes of music memories aileron said nothing waiting it was mabon of rhoden who spoke up raising himself on his one good arm there is good sense in what you say aven as much good sense as we are likely to find in any plan today though i would dearly love to have lorens counsel here or gereints or our own seers where are they gereint and the seer can we not bring them here nowwith the raithen perhaps it was tulger of the eighth tribe ivor looked at his old friend worry deep in his eyes gereint has left his body he is soultraveling he did not say why the seer went into the mountains from gwen ystrat again i know not why he looked at aileron the high king hesitated if i tell you it must not leave this chamber we have fear enough without summoning more and into the stillness he said she went to free the paraiko in khath meigol there was a babble of sound one man made the sign against evil but only one these were chieftains and their hunt leaders and this was a time of war they live ratenniel whispered softly she tells me so aileron replied weaver at the loom dhira murmured from the heart this time it didnt sound inappropriate dave comprehending little felt tension in the room like an enveloping presence so we have no access to the seer either mabon continued grimly and we must accept given what you have said that we may never have her or gereint or loren again we will have to decide this using what wisdom we have among ourselves and so i have one question for you aven he paused what assurance do we have that maugrim will fight us in andarien when we get there could his army not sweep around us among the evergreens of gwynir and so run south to destroy what we have left behind the midplain here the dalrei women and children gwen ystrat all of brennin and cathal open to him with our army so far away could he not do that there was total silence in the room after a moment mabon went on almost whispering maugrim is outside of time not spun on the loom he cannot be killed and he has shown with the long winter that he is in no hurry this time to bring us to battle would he not glory and his lieutenants exult to watch our army waiting uselessly before impregnable starkadh while the svarts and urgach and galadans wolves were ravaging all we loved he stopped dave felt a weight like an anvil hanging from his heart it was painful to draw breath he looked at tore for reassurance and saw anguish in his face saw it mirrored deeply in ivors and somehow most frighteningly in the normally unreadable features of aileron fear not that said ratenniel a voice so very clear blurring forever ivor dan banor thought the borders between sound and light between music and spoken word the aven turned to the lord of the lios alfar as might one desperate for water in a rainless land fear maugrim said ratenniel as must any who name themselves wise fear defeat and the dominion of the dark fear also the annihilation that galadan purposes and strives for ever water ivor was thinking as the measured words flowed over him water with sorrow like a stone at the bottom of the cup fear any and all of these things ratenniel said the tearing of our threads from the loom the unsaying of our histories the unraveling of the weavers design he paused water in time of drought music and light but do not fear said the lord of the lios alfar that he will avoid a battle with us should we march to andarien i am your surety for that i and my people the lios alfar are out from daniloth for the first time in a thousand years he can see us he can reach us we are no longer hidden in the shadowland he will not pass us by it lies not in his nature to pass us by rakoth maugrim will meet this army if the lios alfar go into andarien it was true ivor knew that as soon as he heard the words and he knew it as deeply as he had known any single thing in all his life it reinforced his own counsel and offered complete answer to mabons terrifying question an answer wrought from the very essence of the lios alfar the weavers chosen ones the children of light what they were and had always been and the terrible bitter price they paid the other side of the image the stone in the cup most hated by the dark for their name was light ivor wanted to bow to kneel to offer grief pity love hearts gratitude somehow none of them nor all of them together seemed adequate in the face of what ratenniel had just said ivor felt heavy clodlike looking at the three lios alfar he felt like a lump of earth and yes he thought yes he was exactly that he was prosaic unglamorous he was of the earth the grass he was of the plain which endured which would endure this too if they proved equal to the days ahead but not otherwise reaching back into his own history as ratenniel had just done the aven cast aside all thoughts all emotions save those that spoke of strength of resistance a thousand years ago the first aven of the plain led every dalrei hunter who could ride into the woven mists and the skewed time of daniloth and the weaver laid a straight track for them they came out onto a battlefield by linden bay that would otherwise have been lost revor rode from there beside ratermaine across the river celyn into andarien and so brightest lord will i ride beside you should that be our decision when we leave this place he paused and turned to the other king in the room when revor rode and ratermaine it was in the army and at the command of conary of brennin and then of colan his son it was so then and rightly sofor the high kings of brennin are the children of mórnirand it will be so again and as rightly should you accept this counsel high king he was utterly unaware of the ringing cadences the upwelling power of his own voice he said you are heir to what conary was as we are the heirs of revor and ratermaine do you accede to this counsel yours is governance here aileron dan ailell will you have us to ride with you bearded and dark devoid of ornament a soldiers sword in a plain sheath at his side aileron looked the very image of a war king not bright and glittering as conary had been or colan or even as his own brother was he was stern and expressionless and grim and one of the youngest men in the room i accede he said i would have you ride with me when the army comes tomorrow we set out for andarien in that moment halfway and a little more to gwynir a lean and scarred figure incongruously aristocratic atop one of the hideous slaug slowed and then dragged his mount to a complete stop motionless on the wide plain he watched the dust of rakoths retreating army settle in front of him for most of the night he had run in his wolf form in careful silence he had observed as uathach the giant urgach in white had enforced an orderly withdrawal out of what had begun as blind flight there had been a question of precedence there to be resolved eventually but not now galadan had other things to think about and he thought more clearly in his human shape so a little before dawn he had taken his own form again and commandeered one of the slaug even though he hated them gradually through the greyness of dawn he had let the army pass him by making sure that uathach did not notice he was far from afraid of the whiteclad urgach but he knew too little about him and knowledge for the wolflord had always been the key to power it mattered almost not at all that he was reasonably certain he could kill uathach what was important was that he understand what had made him what he was six months ago uathach had been summoned to starkadh an oversized urgach as stupid as any of the others a little more dangerous because of quickness and size he had come out again four nights ago augmented enhanced in some unsettling way he was clever now vicious and articulate and clad by rakoth in whitea touch that galadan appreciated remembering lauriel the swan the lios had loved uathach had been given command of the army that issued over the valgrind bridge that in the inception galadan had no quarrel with the wolflord himself had been away engaged in tasks of his own devising it had been he with the knowledge that came with being one of the andain son of a god and with the subtlety that was his own who had conceived and led the attack on the paraiko in khath meigol if attack it could be called the giants by their very nature had no access to anger or violence no response to war save the single inviolate fact that shedding their blood brought down any curse the injured giant chose to invoke that was the true the literal concept of the bloodcurse it had nothing to do with the superstitions about roaming fanged ghosts haunting khath meigol or so the wolflord had continually reminded himself in the days he spent there while the paraiko were penned like helpless sheep in their caves by the svarts and urgach breathing the clever killing smoke of the fires hed ordered to be made he had only lasted a few days but the true reason was his own secret he had tried to convince himself of what he had told those he left behindthat his departure was dictated by the demands of warbut he had lived too long and too searchingly to really deceive himself the truth was that the paraiko unsettled him deeply in some subconscious way his mind could not grasp in some fashion they lay in his path huge obstacles to his one unending desirewhich was for annihilation utter and absolute how they could oppose him he knew not for pacifism was woven into their very nature but nonetheless they disturbed him and rendered him uneasy as did no one else in fionavar or any other world with the single exception of his father so since he could not kill cernan of the beasts he set about destroying the paraiko in their mountain caves when the fires were burning properly and the svarts and urgach made relentlessly aware of the need not to shed bloodas if they had to be reminded for even the stupid svarts lived in abject terror of the bloodcursegaladan had withdrawn from the bitter cold of the mountains and the incessant chanting that came from the caves he had been in east gwynir when the snow had shockingly melted immediately he had begun massing his wolves among the evergreens waiting for the word of attack he had just garnered tidings of his contingent slaughtered in leinanwood by the high king when avaia herself had swooped glorious and malevolent to hiss that an army had issued forth across the valgrind bridge heading for celidon at speed he had taken his wolves down the eastern edge of the plain he had crossed adein near the edryn gap unseen unanticipated and then timing it flawlessly had arrived at the battlefield to fall on the exposed right flank of the dalrei he hadnt expected the lios to be there but that was only a source of joy a deepening of delight they were going to slaughter them all they would have had the wild hunt not suddenly flashed in the heavens above alone among the army of the dark he knew who owein was alone he grasped a hint of what had happened and alone he comprehended something of what lay beneath the cry that stopped the killing alone in that army he knew whose voice it was he was after all her brothers son there had been a great deal to assimilate and a very immediate danger as well and through all the pandemonium a thought inchoate little more than a straining toward a possibility was striving to take shape in his mind then above and beyond all this as if it had not been enough and more than enough there came an intuition he had learned to trust a vibration within the part of him that was a god cernans son as the cold rage of battle passed and then the chaos of flight galadan became increasingly aware that something was happening in the forest realm there was suddenly a very great deal to consider he needed solitude he always needed thatas being nearest to his long desirebut now his mind craved it as much as his soul so he had detached himself from the army unseen in the dawn shadows and he was riding alone when the morning sunlight found him shortly after sunrise he stopped surveying the plain he found it deeply pleasing to his heart except for the cloud of dust settling now far to the north there was no sign of life beyond the insentient grass he did not care about it was almost as if the goal for which he had striven for past a thousand years had come almost he smiled thinly irony was nearly at the center of his soul and would not let him dream for very long the striving had been too lengthy too deeply ingrained for dreams to ever be remotely adequate he could remember the very instant his designs had taken shape when he had first aligned himself with the unravellerthe moment when lisen of the wood had sent word running through pendaran that she had merged her fate and given her love to amairgen whitebranch the mortal he had been in the great wood that morning ready to celebrate with all the other powers of pendaran her slaying of the man for his presumption in the sacred grove it had turned out otherwise everything had he had gone into starkadh once and once only for in that place he who was mightiest by far of the andain and arrogant with that strength had been forced to humble himself before an obliterating magnitude of power he had not even been able to mask his own mind from maugrim who had laughed he was made to realize that he was entirely understood and notwithstanding that had been accepted with amusement as lieutenant by the dark even though rakoth knew precisely what his own purposes were and how they differed from maugrims own it hadnt seemed to matter their designs marched together a very long way galadan had told himself and though he was notno one wasremotely an equal to the unraveller he might yet ere the very end find a way to obliterate the world maugrim would rule he had served rakoth well had commanded the army that cut conary off by sennett strand so long ago he had killed conary himself in his wolf shape and he would have won that battle and so the war had revor of the plain not come somehow impossibly soon through the mists of daniloth to turn the tide of battle north to starkadh itself where it ended he himself badly wounded had hardly escaped with his life from colans avenging sword they had thought hed died he knew he almost had in an icy cave north of the ungarch river he had lain bitterly cold nursed only by his wolves for a very long time hed huddled there damping his power his aura as low as he could while the armies of the light held parley before the mountain and ginserat made the wardstones and then shaped with aid of the dwarves the chain that bound rakoth beneath rangat through all the long waiting years he had continued to serve having made his choice and set his own course he it was who had found avaia half dead herself the swan had been hiding in the frigid realm of fordaetha queen of rük whose icy touch was instant death to a spirit less strong than one of the andain with his own hands he had nursed the swan back to health in the court of that cold queen fordaetha had wanted to couple with him it had pleased him to refuse her his too had been the stratagem subtle and infinitely slow whereby the water spirit of llewenmere innocent and fair had been lured into surrendering her most handsome swans he had given her a reason that sufficed his earnest desire in the identity he had dissembled with to bring swans north to celyn lake on the borders of devastated andarien and she had released her guardianship and had all unsuspecting let him take them away he had only needed some of them the males north indeed they had been carried but far past celyn into the glacierriven mountains beyond ungarch where they had been bred to avaia then when they had died she who could not die unless slain had coupled with her children and had continued doing so year after year to bring forth the brood that had stained the skies on the evening just past the spirit of llewenmere never knew for certain what she had done or who indeed he really was she may have guessed though for in after years the lake once benign and inviting had turned dark and weedy and even in pendaran which knew a darkness of its own it was said to be haunted it brought him no joy nothing had since lisen a long long life and a slow single purpose guiding it he it was who had freed rakoth orchestrating with infinite patience the singling out and then the corruption of the dwarf brothers kaen and blod bringing into play the festering hatred of metran of the garantae first mage of brennin and finally cutting off with his own sword the hand of maugrim when ginserats chain could not be made to break he had run then with rakotha wolf beside a cloud of malice that dripped and would forever drip black bloodto the rubble of starkadh there he had watched as inexorably rakoth maugrim had showed forth his mightgreater here than anywhere in any of the worlds for here had he first set down his footand raised anew the ziggurat that was the first and the last seat of his power when it reared upward again complete even to the green flickering of its lights an obliterating presence among the ice galadan had stopped before the mighty doors though they stood open for him once had been enough everywhere else his mind was his own in one way he knew this resistance was meaningless for maugrim in that one instant a thousand years ago had learned everything of galadan he would ever need to know but in another way the sanctity of his thoughts was the only thing that had any meaning left for the wolflord so he had halted before the doors and there had he received his reward the offered image never before seen never known of maugrims revenge against the lios alfar for being what they were the soulmonger at sea waiting for the lios as they sailed west in search of a promised world and destroying them singly and in pairs to claim their voices and their songs as a lure for those who followed all of those who followed it was perfect it was beyond perfection a malevolence that used the very essence of the children of light to shape their doom he could never have bound to his service a creature so awesome galadan knew he could never even for all his own guile have thought of something so encompassing the image was among other things a reminder to him of what rakoth now free again was and could do but it was also a reward and one that had nothing at all to do with the lios alfar the vision had been clear in his mind rakoth had made it clear he had seen the soulmonger vividly its size and color the flat ugly head he could hear the singing see the lidless eyes and the staff the white staff embedded uselessly between those eyes the staff of amairgen whitebranch and so for the very first time he learned how that one had died there was no joy there could never again be joy he had no access to such a thing but that day before the open doors of starkadh there had come an easing within him for a moment a certain quiet which was as much as he could ever have alone now on the plain he tried to summon up the image again but he found it blurred and unsatisfying he shook his head there was too much happening the implications of oweins return with the wild hunt were enormous he had to find a way to deal with them first though he knew he would have to address the other thing the intuition from the wood that went deeper than anything else this was why he had stopped to seek out the quiet that would allow the thing whatever it was to move from the edge of his awareness to the center to be seen for a while he thought it was his father which would make a great deal of sense he never ventured near cernan and his father had never since a certain night not long before the bael rangat tried to contact him but this mornings sensation was intense enough so laden with overtones and shadings of longforgotten emotions that he thought it had to be cernan calling him the forest was somehow part of this it had and in that instant he knew what it was not after all his father but the intensity was suddenly explained and more with an expression on his face no one living had ever been allowed to see galadan leaped from the back of the slaug he put his hand to his chest and made a gesture then a moment later in his wolf shape covering ground faster than even the slaug might he set out west running as swiftly as he could the battle forgotten the war almost west to where lights were burning and someone stood in the anor in the room that had been lisens chapter they had been climbing all morning and the rough going was not made easier by the pain in kims side where ceriog had kicked her she was silent though and kept going head down watching the path and the long legs of paebur climbing in front of her dalreidan was leading them brock who had to be hurting far more than she was brought up the rear no one spoke the trail was difficult enough without wasting breath on words and there was really not a great deal to say she had dreamt again the night before in the outlaw camp not far from the plateau where they had been captured ruanas deep chanting ran through her sleep it was beautiful but she found no comfort in that beauty the pain was too great it twisted through her and what was worse a part of it came from her there was smoke in the dream again and the caves she saw herself with lacerations on her arms but again no blood was flowing no blood in khath meigol the smoke drifted in the starlit firelit night then there was another light as the baelrath blazed into life she felt it as a burning as guilt and pain and in the midst of that flaming she watched herself looking up into the sky above the mountains and she saw the red moon ride again and she heard a name in the morning heavily wrapped in her thoughts she had let brock and dalreidan make arrangements for their departure and in silence all morning and into the afternoon she had climbed upward and east toward the sun toward the sun she stopped abruptly brock almost ran into her from behind shielding her eyes kim gazed beyond the mountains as far as she could and then a cry of joy escaped her dalreidan turned and faebur wordlessly she pointed they spun back to look oh my king cried brock of banir tal i knew you would not fail over eridu the rain clouds were gone sunlight streamed from a sky laced only with the thin benevolent cirrus clouds of a summers day far to the west in the spinning place of cader sedat the cauldron of khath meigol lay shattered in a thousand pieces and metran of the garantae was dead kim felt the shadows of her dream dissolve as hope flared within her like the brilliant sun she thought of kevin in that moment there was sorrow in the memory there always would be but now there was joy as well and a burgeoning pride the summer had been his gift the green grass the birdsong the mild seas that had allowed prydwen to sail and the men who sailed her to do this thing there was a keen brightness in dalreidans face as he turned back to look at her forgive me he said i doubted she shook her head so did i i had terrible dreams of where they had to go there is a miracle in this i do not know how it was done brock had come up to stand beside her on the narrow trail he said nothing but his eyes were shining beneath the bandage kim had wrapped about his wound faebur though had his back to them still gazing to the east looking at him kim sobered quickly at length he too turned to look at her and she saw the tears in his eyes tell me something seer he said sounding older far than his years if an exiled mans people are all dead does his exile end or does it go on forever she struggled to frame a reply and found none it was dalreidan who answered we cannot unsay the falling of that rain or lengthen the cut threads of those who have died he said gently it is in my heart though that in the face of what maugrim has done no man is an exile any more every living creature on this side of the mountains has received a gift of life this morning we must use that gift until the hour comes that knows our name to deal such blows as we can against the dark there are arrows in your quiver faebur let them sing with the names of your loved ones as they fly it may not seem like a true recompense but it is all we can do it is what we must do said brock softly easy for a dwarf to say snarled faebur rounding on him brock shook his head harder by far than you could know every breath i draw is laden with the knowledge of what my people have done the rain will not have fallen under the twin mountains but it fell in my heart and it is raining there still faebur will you let my axe sing with your arrows in mourning for the people of the lion in eridu the tears had dried on faeburs face his chin was set in a hard straight line he had aged kim thought in a day in less than a day he seemed to have aged so much for what seemed to her a very long time he stood motionless and then slowly and deliberately he extended a hand to the dwarf brock reached up and clasped it between both of his own she became aware that dalreidan was looking at her we go on he asked gravely we go on she said and even as she spoke the dream came back with the chanting and the smoke and the name written in danas moon to the south and far below the kharn river flashed through its gorge in the evening light they were so high than an eagle hovering over the river was below them its wings shining in the sunlight that slanted down the gorge from the west all around them lay the mountains of the carnevon range the peaks white with snow even in midsummer it was cold this high up and with the day waning kim was grateful for the sweater they had given her in gwen ystrat lightweight and wonderfully warm it was a testimonial to the value accorded all the cloth arts in this the first of all the weavers worlds even so she shivered now dalreidan asked his voice carefully neutral or would you like to camp here until morning the three of them looked at her wailing it was her decision to make they had guided her to this place had helped her through the hardest parts of the climb had rested when she had needed to rest but now they had arrived and all the decisions were hers she looked past her companions to the east fifty paces away the rocks looked exactly as they did where she was standing now the light fell upon them the same way with the same softening as evening came to the mountains she had expected something different some sort of change a shimmering shadows a sharpening of intensity she saw none of these yet she knew and the three men with her knew that the rocks fifty paces to the east lay within khath meigol now that she was here she longed with all her heart to be anywhere else to be graced with the wings of the eagle below that she might sweep away on the evening breeze not from fionavar not from the war but far from the loneliness of this place and the dream that had led her here within herself she reached for and found the tacit presence that was ysanne she took comfort in that she was never truly alone there were two souls within her now and always her companions had no such solace though had no dreams or visions to guide them they were here because of her and only because of her and they were looking now for her to lead them even as she stood hesitating the shadows were slowly climbing the slopes of the ravine she drew a breath and slowly let it out she was here to repay a debt and one that was not hers alone she was also here because she bore the baelrath in a time of war and there was no one else in any world who could make manifest the seers dream shed had however dark it was however dark it had been night in the dream with fires in front of the caves she looked down and saw the stone flickering like a tongue of flame on her hand now she said to the others it will be bad in the dark i know but it wont be that much better in the morning and i dont think we should wait they were very brave all three of them without a word spoken they made room for her to fall into line after faebur with brock behind and dalreidan led them into khath meigol even with the vellin shielding her she felt the impact of magic as they passed into the country of the giants and the form the magic took was fear they are not ghosts she told herself over and over they are alive they saved my life even so even with the vellin she felt terror brushing her mind with the quick wings of night moths the two men and the dwarf with her had no green vellin bracelets to guard them no inner voices to reassure yet none of them made a sound and none broke stride humbled by their courage she felt her own heart flame with resolution and as it did the baelrath burned brighter on her hand she quickened her pace and moved past dalreidan she had brought them to this place a place where no man should ever have had to come it was her turn to lead them now for the warstone knew where to go for almost two hours they walked in the gathering darkness it was full night under the summer stars when kim saw smoke and the distant blaze of bonfires and heard the raucous laughter of svart alfar and with the brutal mockery of that sound she found suddenly that her fears which had walked with her until now were gone she had arrived and the enemy ahead of her was known and hated and in the caves beyond those ridges of stone the giants were imprisoned and were dying she turned and saw by starlight and the glow of her ring that her companions faces were grim now not with strain but with anticipation silently brock unslung his axe and faebur notched an arrow to his bow she turned to dalreidan he had not yet drawn a sword or unslung his own bow there will be time he whispered answering her unspoken question scarcely a breath in the night air shall i find us a place where we can look she nodded calmly silently he moved past her again and began picking his way among the strewn boulders and loose rocks toward the fires and the laughter moments later the four of them lay prone above a plateau sheltered by upthrust teeth of rock they looked down sickened on what the glow of the bonfires revealed there were two caves set into the mountainside with high vaulted entrances and runic lettering carved over the arches it was dark in the caves and they could not see within from one of them though if they strained to hear past the laughter of the svart alfar they could make out the sound of a single deep voice chanting slowly the light came from two huge fires on the plateau set directly before each of the caves in such a fashion that the smoke of their burning was drawn inward there was another fire just over the ridge east of them and kim could make out the glow and the rising smoke of a fourth about a quarter of a mile away to the northeast there were no others to be seen four caves then four sets of prisoners dying of starvation and smoke and four bands of svart alfar around each of the bonfires below them about thirty of the svarts were gathered and there were a handful of the nightmare urgach as well about a hundred and fifty of them then if the same numbers held true beyond the ridges not a very great force in truth but more than enough she knew to subdue and hold the paraiko whose pacifism was the very essence of their being all that the svarts had to do under the guidance of the urgach was keep the fires burning and refrain from shedding blood then they could claim their reward which they were doing now even as she watched on each of the pyres below lay the huge body charred and blackened of a paraiko every few moments one of the svart alfar would dart close enough to the roaring flames to thrust in a sword and cut for himself a piece of roasted flesh their reward kims stomach heaved in revulsion and she had to close her eyes it was an unholy scene a desecration in the worst the deepest sense beside her she could hear brock cursing under his breath in a steady invocation bitter and heartfelt meaningless words whatever scant easing they might afford and the curses of the paraiko themselves which might have been unleashed had any one of them been killed directly had been forestalled rakoth was too clever too steeped in the shaping of evil his servants too well trained for the bloodcurse to have been set free which meant that another sort of power would have to be invoked and so here she was drawn by a savesong chanted and the burden of a seers dream and what in the weavers name was she to do she had three men beside her three men alone however brave they might be from the moment she and brock had left morvran everything in her had been focused on getting to this plateau knowing that she had to do so with never a thought until now about what she could do when she arrived dalreidan touched her elbow look he whispered she opened her eyes he wasnt looking at the caves or the fires or the ridges beyond with their own smoke reluctantly as always she followed his gaze to the ring on her own hand and saw the baelrath vividly aflame with a real grief she saw that the fire at the heart of the warstone was somehow twinned to the hue and shape of the hideous fires below it was deeply unsettling but when had there been anything reassuring or easy about the ring she bore in every single thing she had ever done with the baelrath there was pain in its depths she had seen jennifer in starkadh and carried her screaming into the crossing she had awakened a dead king at stonehenge against his will she had summoned arthur on the summit of glastonbury tor to war and bitterest grief again she had released the sleepers by pendaran on the night finn took the longest road she was an invoker a war cry in darkness a storm crow truly that on the wings of a gathering storm she was a gatherer indeed a summoner she wasshe was a summoner there was a scream and then a raucous burst of laughter down below an urgach for sport had hurled a svart alfar one of the smaller green ones onto the blazing fire she saw but hardly registered it her eyes went back to the stone to the flame coiled in the depths of it and there she read a name the same name she had seen written across the face of the moon in her dream reading it she remembered something how the baelrath had blazed in answering light on the night that danas red full moon had ridden through the sky over paras derval she was a summoner and now she knew what she had to do for with the name written in the ring had come knowledge that had not lain in the dream she knew who this was and knew also what the price of her calling would be but this was khath meigol in a time of war and the paraiko were dying in the caves she could not harden her heart there was too much pity there but she could steel her will to do what had to be done and shoulder the grief as one more among many she closed her eyes again it was easier in darkness a way of hiding almost almost but not truly she drew a breath and then within her mind not aloud she said imraithnimphais then she led her companions back down and away from the fires to wait knowing it would not be long tabors watch was not until the end of the night and so he had been asleep not any more she was in the sky over the camp and she had called his name and for the first time ever he heard fear in the creature of his fast he was wide awake instantly and dressing as quickly as he could wait he sent i do not want to frighten them i will meet you on the plain no he heard she was truly afraid come now there is no time she was descending even as he went outside he was confused and a little afraid himself for he had not summoned her but even with that his heart lifted to see the beauty of her as she came down her horn shining like a star her wings folding gracefully as she landed she was trembling he stepped forward and put his arms about her laying his head against hers easy my love he sent projecting all the reassurance he could i am here what has happened i was called by name she sent still trembling a shocked surge of anger ran through him and a deeper fear of his own that he fought to master and conceal he could conceal nothing from her though they were bonded too deeply he drew a ragged breath who i do not know her a woman with white hair but not old a red ring on her hand how does she know my name his own hands moved ceaselessly gentling her anger was still there but he was ivors son and levons brother both of whom had seen her and so he knew who this was she is a friend he sent we must go to her where the wrong question though it had to be asked she told him and with the naming of that place fear was in both of them again he fought it and helped her do the same then he mounted her feeling the joy of doing so in the midst of everything else she spread her wings and he prepared to fly tabor he turned liane was there in a white shift brought back from gwen ystrat she seemed eerily far away already and he had not even taken flight i must go he said forming the words carefully the seer has called us where is she he hesitated in the mountains his sisters hair snarled in tangles of sleep lay loose on her back her feet were bare on the grass her eyes wide with apprehension never left his own be careful she said please he nodded jerkily beneath him imraithnimphais restless to be gone flexed her wings oh tabor whispered liane who was older than he but didnt sound it please come back he tried to answer that it was important that he try she was crying but words would not come he raised one hand in a gesture that had to encompass far too much and then they were in the sky and the stars blurred before their speed kim saw a streak of light in the west she raised her hand with the ring glowing on her finger and a moment later the power she had summoned descended it was dark and the clearing where they waited was rough and narrow but nothing could mar the grace of the creature that landed beside her she listened for alarms raised east of them but heard nothing why should a falling star in the mountains be cause for concern but this was not a falling star it was a deep red through the body the color of danas moon the color of the ring she carried the great wings folded now it stood restlessly on the stones seeming almost to dance above them kim looked at the single horn it was shining and silver and the seer in her knew how deadly it was how far beyond mere grace this gift of the goddess was this doubleedged gift she turned her gaze to the rider he looked very much like his father only a little like levon she had known he was only fifteen but seeing it came as a shock he reminded her she realized abruptly of finn very little time had passed since the summoning the waning moon had barely risen above the eastern reaches of the range its silver touched the silver of the horn beside kim brock stood watchfully and faebur his tattoos glowing faintly was on her other side dalreidan had withdrawn a little way though back into the shadows she was not surprised though she sorrowed for that too this meeting would have to be a hard thing for the exiled rider shed had no choice though just as she had none now and there was deeper cause for sorrow written in the eyes of the boy he sat quietly waiting for her to speak im sorry she said and meant it with all her heart i have some idea of what this does to you he tossed his head impatiently in a gesture like his brothers how did you know her name he asked low because of the laughter nearby but challenging she heard both the anger and the anxiety she shouldered her own power you ride a child of pendarans grove and the wandering moon she said i am a seer and i carry the wandering fire i read her name in the baelrath tabor she had dreamt it too but she didnt tell him that no one else is to know her name he said no one at all not so she replied gereint does the shamans always know the totem names hes different tabor said a little uncertainly so am i said kim as gently as she could he was very young and the creature was afraid she understood how they felt she had come crashing she and her wild ring into the midst of an utterly private communion the two of them shared she understood but the night of which she had dreamt was passing and she didnt know if she had time to assuage them properly or even what to say tabor surprised her he might be young but he was the avens son and he rode a gift of dana with calm simplicity he said very well what are we to do in khath meigol slay of course and take the consequences upon themselves was there an easy way to say it she knew of none she told them who was here and what was taking place and even as she spoke she saw the head of the winged creature lift and her horn begin to shine more brightly yet then she was done there was nothing more to tell tabor nodded to her once then he and the creature he rode seemed to change to coalesce she was near to them and a seer she caught a fragment of their inner speech only a fragment then she took her mind away bright one she heard and we must kill and just before she pulled away only each other at the last then they were in the air again and danas creatures wings were spread and she turned killingly bright to flash down on the plateau and suddenly the servants of the dark were not laughing any more kims three companions were already running for their vantage point again and she followed them as quickly as she could stumbling over the rocks and loose stones then she was there and watching how stunningly graceful death could be again and again imraithnimphais descended and rose the hornwith a cutting edge nowstabbing and slashing until the silver was so coated with blood it looked like the rest of her one of the urgach rose before her enormous a twohanded sword upraised with the preternatural skill of the dalrei tabor veered his mount at full speed up and to one side in the air and the sharp edge of the horn sliced through the top of the urgachs head it was all like that they were elegant blindingly swift utterly lethal and it was destroying them both kim knew a myriad of griefs and no time to deal with them even as she watched imraithnimphais was soaring again east to the next bonfire one of the svart alfar had been shamming death quickly it rose and began running west across the plateau mine said faebur quietly kim turned she saw him draw an arrow and whisper something over its long shaft she saw him notch it to his bow and draw and she saw the moonlit arrow loosed flash into the throat of the running svart and drop it in its tracks for eridu said brock of banir tal for the people of the lion a beginning faebur a beginning faebur echoed softly nothing else moved on the plateau the fire still roared their crackling was the only sound over the ridge a distant screaming could be heard but even as she picked her way down the loose slope toward the caves those sounds too abruptly ceased kim glanced over instinctively in time to see imraithnimphais rise and flash north toward the last of the bonfires making her way carefully amid the carnage and around the searing heat of the two fires she stopped before the larger of the caves she was here and had done what shed come to do but she was weary and hurting and it was not a time for joy not in the face of what had happened in the presence of those two blackened bodies on the pyres she looked down at the ring finger of her right hand the baelrath lay quiescent mute it was not finished though in her dream she had seen it burning on this plateau there was more to come in the weaving of this night what she knew not but the workings of power were not yet ended ruana she cried this is the seer of brennin i have come to the savesong chanted and you are free she waited and the three men with her the fires were the only sound a flaw of wind blew a strand of hair into her eyes she pushed it back then she realized that the wind was imraithnimphais descending as tabor brought her down to stand behind the four of them kim glanced over and saw the dark blood on the horn then there was a sound from the cave and she turned back out of the blackness of the archway and through the rising smoke the paraiko came only two of them at first one carrying the body of the other in his arms the figure that moved out from the smoke to stand before them was twice the height of longlegged faebur of eridu his hair was as white as kimberlys and so was his long beard his robe too had been white once but it was begrimed now with a smoke and dust and the stains of illness even so there was a gravity and a majesty to him that surmounted time and the unholy scene amid which they stood in his eyes as he surveyed the plateau kim read an ancient ineffable pain it made her own griefs seem shallow transitory he turned to her we give thanks he said the voice was soft incongruously so for one so enormous i am ruana when those of us who yet live are gathered we must do kanior for the dead if you wish you may name one of your number to join us and seek absolution for all of you for this nights deeds of blood absolution growled brock of banir tal we saved your lives even so said ruana he stumbled a little as he spoke dalreidan and faebur sprang forward to help him with his burden hold ruana cried drop your weapons you are in peril nodding his understanding dalreidan let fall his arrows and his sword and faebur did the same then they went forward again and straining with the effort helped ruana lower the other giant gently to the ground there were more coming now from ruanas cave two women emerged supporting a man between them six in all came out from the other cave sinking to the earth as soon as they were clear of the smoke looking east kim saw the first of the contingent from over the ridge coming to join them on the plateau they moved very slowly and many were supported and some were carried by others none of them spoke you need food she said to ruana how can we aid you he shook his head after the kanior must be first it has been so long delayed we will do the rites as soon as we are gathered others appeared now from the northeast from the fourth fire moving with the same slow strengthconserving care and in absolute silence they were all clad in white as ruana was he was neither the oldest nor the largest of them but he was the only one who had spoken and the others were gathering around the place where he stood i am not leader he said as if reading kims thoughts there has been no leader among us since connla transgressed in the making of the cauldron i will chant the kanior though and do the bloodless rites his voice was infinitely mild but this kim knew was someone who had been strong enough to find her in the very heart of rakoths designs and strong enough to shield her there he scanned the ranks of those who had come this is full numbering he asked kim looked around it was hard to see amid the shadows and the smoke but there were perhaps twentyfive of the paraiko gathered on the plateau no more than that full numbering a woman said full full numbering ruana a third voice echoed plangent with sorrow there are no more of us do the kanior top long delayed lest our essence be altered and khath meigol shed its sanctity and it was in that moment that kim had her first premonition as the dark webs of her seers dream began to spin clear she felt her heart clench like a fist and her mouth go dry very well ruana said and then to her again with utmost courtesy do you want to choose someone to join with us for what you have done it will be allowed kim said shakily if expiation is needed it is mine to seek i will do the bloodless rites with you ruana looked down on her from his great height then he glanced at each of the others in turn she heard imraithnimphais move nervously behind her under the weight of the giants gaze oh dana ruana said not an invocation the words were addressed as to a coequal words of reproach of sorrow he turned back to kimberly you speak truly seer i think it is your place the winged one needs no dispensation for doing what dana created her to do though i must grieve for her birthing again brock challenged him looking up a long way you summoned us the dwarf said you chanted your song to the seer and we came in answer rakoth is free in fionavar ruana of the paraiko would you have us all lie down in caves and grant him dominion the passionate words rang in the mountain air there came a low sound from the assembled paraiko did you summon them ruana it was the voice of the first woman who had spoken the one from the cave over the ridge still looking at brock ruana said we cannot hate were rakoth whose voice i heard in my chanting obliterated utterly from the tale of time my heart would sing until i died but we cannot make war there is only passive resistance in us it is part of our nature the way killing and grace are woven into the creature that flew to save us to change would be to end what we are and to lose the bloodcurse which is the weavers gift to us in compensation and defense since connla bound owein and made the cauldron we have not left khath meigol his voice was still low but it was deeper now than when he had first walked from the cave it was halfway to the chanting that kim knew was coming something else was coming too and she was beginning to know what it would be ruana said we have our own relationship with death have had it since first we were spun on the loom you know it means death and a curse to shed our blood there is more than you do not know we lay down in the caves because there was nothing else we could do being what we are ruana came the womans voice again did you summon them and now he turned to her slowly as if bearing a great burden i did iera i am sorry i will chant it in the kanior and seek absolution with the rites failing which i will leave khath meigol as connla did that the transgression might lie on my shoulders alone he raised his hands then high over his head in the moonlight and no more words were spoken for the kanior began it was a chant of mourning and a woven spell it was unimaginably old for the paraiko had walked in fionavar long before the weaver had spun even the lios alfar or the dwarves into the tapestry and the bloodcurse had been a part of them from the beginning and the kanior which preserved it it began with a low humming almost below the threshold of hearing from the giants gathered around ruana slowly he lowered his hands and motioned kim to come forward beside him as she did so she saw that room had been made for dalreidan faebur and brock in the circle surrounding them tabor and his winged creature remained outside the ring ruana sank to his knees and motioned for kim to do the same he folded his hands in his lap and then suddenly he was in her mind i will carry the dead she heard him say within whom would you give to me her pulse was slowing dragged by the low sounds coming from those around them her hands shook a little in her lap she clasped them together very tightly and gave him kevin and then ysanne who they were and what they had done ruanas expression did not change nor did he move but his eyes widened a little as he absorbed what she sent to him and then within her mind not speaking aloud he said i have them and they are worthy grieve with me then he lifted his voice in lament kim never forget that moment even with what followed after the memory of the kanior stayed clear within her the sorrow and the cleansing of sorrow i will carry the dead ruana had said and now he proceeded to do so with the textured richness of his voice he gathered them both kevin and then ysanne and drew them into the circle to be mourned as the humming grew stronger his own chanting twined through it and about it a thread on a loom of sound names offered to the mountain night and into the ring began to come the images of the paraiko who had died in the caves taieri ciroa hinewai caillea and more so many more all of them approached to be gathered there to stand in the place where kim knelt to be reclaimed for this moment by the woven power of the song kim was weeping but the tears of her heart fell soundlessly that nothing might mar what ruana shaped and in that moment he went even deeper he claimed more his voice growing stronger yet he reached back through the tumbling ribbon of years and began to gather the paraiko from the very beginning of days all of them who had lived in their deep peacefulness shedding no blood and had in the fullness of their time died to be mourned and to be mourned now again as ruana of khath meigol reached back for them spreading the ambit of his mighty soul to encompass the loss of all the dead amid the carnage and the fires of that night kneeling so near kim watched him do it through her falling tears watched him try to shape a solace for sorrow to rise above what had been done to them with this majestic affirmation of what the paraiko were it was a kanior of kaniors a lament for every single one of the dead and he was doing it one after another they came the ghosts of all the paraiko in all the years crowding into the wide circle of mourning for one last time on this night of deepest grief for deepest wrong done to their people kim understood then the source of the tales of ghosts in khath meigol for there were ghosts in this place when the kanior rites were done and on this night the pass in the mountains became a realm truly of the dead still they came and still ruana grew forcing his spirit to grow great enough to reach for them to carry them all with his song then his voice went deeper yet with a new note spun within it and kim saw that one had come into the circle who was taller than any giant there whose eyes even from beyond the world were brighter than any others and she knew from ruanas song that this was connla himself who had transgressed in binding owein and again in making the cauldron connla who had gone forth from khath meigol alone in voluntary exile from his peopleto be reclaimed on this night when every one of them was being reclaimed and mourned anew kim saw kevin there honored among those gathered and she saw ysanne insubstantial even among ghosts for she had gone farther away than any of them had gone so far with her own sacrifice that kim scarcely grasped how ruana had managed to bring even her shadow back to this place and at length there came a time when no new figures were drifting into the ring kim looked at ruana as he swayed slowly back and forth his eyes closed with the weight of all he was carrying she saw his hands close tightly in his lap as his voice changed one last time as it went deeper yet found access to even purer sorrow and one by one into the humbling amplitude of his soul he summoned the dead svart alfar and the urgach who had imprisoned his people and slain them and devoured them when they were dead kim had never known an act to match the grandeur of what ruana did in that moment it was an assertion utter and irrefutable of his peoples identity a clear sound in the wide dark of the night proclaiming that the paraiko were still without hate that they were equal to and greater than the worst of what rakoth maugrim could do that they could endure his evil and absorb it and rise above it in the end continuing to be what they had always been never less than such and never slaves of the dark kim felt purified in that moment transfigured by what ruana was shaping and when she saw his eyes open and come to rest upon her even as he sang she knew what was to come and fearing nothing in his presence she watched him lift a finger and using it like a blade lay open the skin on his face and arms in long deep cuts no blood flowed none at all though the skin curled back from the gashes he had made and she could see the nerves and arteries exposed within he looked at her with no fear in her none at all in a spirit of mourning and expiation kim raised her own hands and drew her fingernails along her cheeks and then down the veins of her forearms feeling the skin slice open to her touch she was a doctor and she knew that this could kill it did not no blood welled from her wounds either though her tears were falling still tears of sorrow and now of gratitude as well that ruana had offered her this had been strong enough to shape a magic so profound that even she who was not one of the paraiko and who carried grief and guilt running so deep might find absolution in the bloodless rites amid the presence of the dead even as ruanas voice lifted in the last notes of his kanior kim felt her gashes closing and looking down on her arms she saw the skin knit whole and unscarred and she gave thanks from the wellspring of her being for what he had given her then she saw the baelrath burning nothing had ever been worse not even the summoning of arthur from his rest in avalon among the summer stars the warrior had been doomed by the will of the weaver to his long fate of summoning and grief to restitution through all the years and worlds for having the children slain she had shattered his rest with that terrible name cried out upon the tor and her own heart had almost shattered with the pain of it but she had not shaped his doom that had been done long ago she and the baelrath had created nothing had changed nothing she had only compelled him in sorrow to do what he was bound by his destiny to do this was different and unimaginably worse for with the flaming of the ring the image of her dream was made real and kim finally knew why she was here to free the paraiko yes but not only for that how could it have been so in time of war and being who she was she had come here drawn by the ring and the baelrath was a summoning power it was wild allowing no compunction or pity knowing only the demands of war the dictates of absolute need she was in khath meigol to draw the giants forth in the most transcendent moment of their long history the hour of their most triumphant assertion of what they were she had come to change them to strip them of their nature and the defenses that came with it to corrupt them to bring them out to war notwithstanding the peace woven into their essence notwithstanding the glory of what ruana had just done the balm he had offered her soul the honor he had bestowed upon her two loved ones among the dead notwithstanding everything she was what she was and the stone was wild and it demanded that the paraiko be undone so they might come to war against maugrim what they could do she knew not such healing clarity was not granted her that would she thought with corrosive bitterness have made things too easy wouldnt it nothing was to be made easy for heror for any of them she amended inwardly she thought of arthur of paul on the summer tree of ysanne of kevin in the snow before dun maura of finn and tabor behind her now then she thought of jennifer in starkadh and darien and she spoke ruana only the weaver and perhaps the gods know whether i will ever be granted forgiveness for what i now must do after the sonority of the kanior her voice sounded high and harsh it seemed to bruise the silence ruana looked down on her saying nothing waiting he was very weak she could see the weariness etched into his features they would all be ravaged by weakness and hunger she knew easy prey the inward bitterness added she shook her head as if to drive those thoughts away her mouth was dry when she swallowed she saw ruana look at the baelrath it was alive driving her she said you may yet wish you had never chanted the savesong to bring me here but it might be that the warstone would have drawn me to this place even had you kept silent i do not know i do know that i have come not only to set you free but to bring you down by the power i bear to war against rakoth maugrim there was a sound from the paraiko gathered around them but watching only ruana she saw that his grave eyes did not change he said very softly we cannot go to war seer we cannot fight nor can we hate then i must teach you she cried over the grief rising within her as the warstone blazed more brilliantly than it ever had before there was real pain looking at her hand she saw it as within a writhing nest of flame brighter than the bonfires too fierce almost to look upon almost she had to look and she did the baelrath was her power wild and merciless but hers was the will and the knowledge the seers wisdom needed to turn the power to work it might seem as if the stone were compelling her but she knew that was not truly so it was respondingto need to war to the halfglimpsed intuitions of her dreams but it needed her will to unleash its power so she shouldered the weight accepted the price of power and looking into the heart of the fire enveloping her hand she cast a mental image into it and watched as the baelrath threw it back incarnate suspended in the air within the circle of the paraiko an image that would teach the giants how to hate and so break them of their sanctity an image of jennifer lowell whom they knew now to be guinevere naked and alone in starkadh before maugrim they saw the unraveller then huge in his hooded cloak faceless save for his eyes they saw his maimed hand they watched him hold it over her body so that the black dripping blood might burn her where it fell and kimberlys own burning seemed as nothing before what she saw they heard jennifer speak so blazingly defiant in that unholy place that it could break the heart to hear and they heard him laugh and fall upon her in his foulness they watched him begin to change his shapes and they heard what was said and understood that he was tearing her mind apart to find avenues for torture it went on a very long time kim felt wave after wave of nausea rising within her but she forced herself to watch jennifer had been there had lived through this and survived it and the paraiko were being stripped of their collective soul through the horror of this image they could not look away the power of the baelrath compelled them and so she would watch it too a penance in the most trivial sense she knew seeking expiation where none could possibly come but she watched she saw blod the dwarf when he was drawn into the image and she grieved for brock being forced to see this ultimate betrayal she saw it all through to the end afterward it was utterly silent in khath meigol she could not hear anyone breathe her own numbed battered soul longed for sound for birdsong water falling the laughter of children she needed light warmer kinder light than the red glow of the fires or the mountain stars or the moon she was granted none of these instead she was made conscious of something else from the moment they had entered khath meigol there had been fear an awareness of the presence of the dead in all their inviolate sanctity guarding this place with the bloodcurse that was woven into them not any more she did not weep this went too far beyond sorrow it touched the very fabric of the tapestry on the loom she held her right hand close to her breast it was blistered and painful to the touch the baelrath smoldered embers seeming to glow far down in its depths who are you ruana asked and his voice broke on the words who are you to have done this deed unto us better we had died in the caves it hurt so much she opened her mouth but no words came not so a voice replied for her it was brock loyal steadfast brock of banir tal not so people of the paraiko his voice was weak when he began but grew in strength with every word you know who she is and you know the nature of what she carries we are at war and the warstone of macha and nemain summons at need would you value your peacefulness so highly that you granted maugrim dominion how long would you survive if we went away from here and were destroyed in war who would remember your sanctity when all of you and all of us were dead or slaves the weaver would ruana replied gently it stopped brock but only for a moment so too would rakoth he said and you have heard his laughter ruana had the weaver shaped your destiny to be sacrosanct and inviolate could you have been changed by the image we have seen tonight could you hate the dark as now you do could you have been brought into the army of light as now you are surely this is your true destiny people of khath meigol a destiny that allows you to grow when the need is great however bitter the pain to come forth from hiding in these caves and make one with all of us in all the weavers worlds afflicted by the dark he ended ringingly there was silence again then we are undone came a voice from the circle of the giants we have lost the bloodcurse and the kanior a wailing rose up heartrending in its grief and loss hold another voice not ruana not brock people of the paraiko said dalreidan forgive me this presumption but i have a question to ask of you slowly the wailing died away ruana inclined his head toward the outlaw from the plain in what you did tonight dalreidan asked in the very great thing you did tonight did you not sense a farewell in the kanior that gathered and mourned every paraiko that ever was could you not find a sign from the weaver who shaped you that an ending to something had come holding her breath clutching her burned hand kim waited and then ruana spoke i did he said as a sigh like a wind in trees swept over the bare plateau i did sense that when i saw connla come how bright he was the only one of us who ever stepped forward to act in the world beyond this pass when he bound the hunt to their long sleep which our people called a transgression even though owein had asked him to do so and then he built the cauldron to bring his daughter back from death which was a wrong beyond remedy and led him to his exile when i saw him tonight how mighty he was among our dead i knew that a change was come kim gasped a cry of relief torn from her pain ruana turned to her carefully he rose to tower over her in the midst of the ring he said forgive me my harshness this will have been a grief for you as much as for us she shook her head still unable to speak we will come down he said it is tune we will leave this place and play a part in what is to come but hear me he added and know this for truth we will not kill and with that finally words came to her she too rose to her feet i do know it for truth she replied and it was the seer of breenin who spoke now i do not think you are meant to you have changed but not so much as that and not all your gifts i think are lost not all he echoed gravely seer where would you have us go to brennin andarien to eridu eridu is no more faebur spoke for the first time ruana turned to him the death rain fell there for three days until this morning there will be no one left in any of the places of the lion watching ruana kim saw something alter deep in his eyes i know of that rain he said we all do it is a part of our memories it was a death rain that began the ruin of andarien it only fell for a few hours then maugrim was not so strong fighting his weariness with a visible effort he drew himself up very straight seer this is the first role we will play there will be plague with the rain and no hope of return to eridu until the dead are buried but the plague will not harm the paraiko you were not wrong we have not lost all of what the weaver gave to us only the bloodcurse and the kanior which were shaped of the peace in our hearts we have other magics though and most of them are ways of dealing with death as connlas cauldron was we will go east from this place in the morning to cleanse the raindead of eridu that the land may live again faebur looked up at him thank you he whispered if any of us live through the dark of these days it will not be forgotten he hesitated if when you come to the largest house in the merchants street of akkaize you find lying there a lady tall and slender whose hair would once have gleamed the color of wheat fields in sunlight her name will have been arrian will you gather her gently for my sake we will said ruana with infinite compassion and if we meet again i will tell you where she lies kim turned and walked from the circle they parted to make way for her and she went to the edge of the plateau and stood her back to everyone else gazing at the dark mountains and the stars her hand was blistered and painful to the touch and her side ached from yesterday the ring was utterly spent it seemed to be slumbering she needed sleep herself she knew there were thoughts chasing each other around in her head and something else not clear enough yet to be a thought was beginning to take shape she was wise enough not to strain for the sight that was coming so she had walked toward darkness to wait she heard voices behind her she did not turn but they were not far away and she could not help but hear forgive me dalreidan said and coughed nervously but i heard a story yesterday that the women and children of the dalrei had been left alone in the last camp by the latham is this so it is tabor replied his voice sounded remote and thin but he answered the exile with courtesy every rider on the plain went north to celidon an army of the dark was seen sweeping across andarien three nights ago the aven was trying to outrace them to the adein kim had known nothing of this she closed her eyes trying to calculate the distance and the time but could not she offered an inner prayer to the night if the dalrei were lost everything the rest of them did might be quite meaningless the aven dalreidan exclaimed softly we have an aven who ivor dan banor tabor said and kim could hear the pride my father then after a moment as the other remained silent do you know him i knew him said dalreidan if you are his son you must be levon tabor levon is my older brother how do you know him what tribe are you from in the silence that followed kim could almost hear the older man struggle with himself but i am tribeless was all he said his footsteps receded as he walked back toward the circle of giants she was not alone kim thought in carrying sorrows tonight the conversation had disturbed her stirring up yet another nagging thread at the corner of her awareness she turned her thoughts inward again reaching for quiet are you all right imraithnimphais moved silently tabors voice coming so near startled her this time she did turn grateful for the kindness in the question she was painfully aware of what she had done to them and the more so when she looked at tabor he was deathly pale almost another ghost in khath meigol i think so she said and you he shrugged a boys gesture but he was so much more had been forced to be so much more she looked at the creature he rode and saw that the horn was clean again shining softly in the night he followed her glance during the kanior he said wonder in his voice while ruana chanted the blood left her horn i dont know how he was absolving you she said the kanior is a very great magic she paused it was she amended as the truth hit home she had ended it she looked back toward the paraiko those who could walk were bringing water from over the ridgethere had to be a stream or a wellto the others her companions were helping them as she watched she began finally to cry and suddenly astonishingly as she wept imraithnimphais lowered her beautiful head careful of the horn and nuzzled her gently the gesture so totally unexpected opened the last floodgates of kims heart she looked up at tabor through her tears and saw him nod permission then she threw her arms about the neck of the glorious creature she had summoned and ordered to kill and laying her head against that of imraithnimphais she let herself weep no one disturbed them no one came near after some time she didnt know how long kim stepped back she looked up at tabor he smiled do you know he said that you cry as much as my father does for the first time in days she laughed and ivors son laughed with her i know she gasped i know i do isnt it terrible he shook his head not if you can do what you did he said quietly as abruptly as it had surfaced the boyishness was gone it was imraithnimphais rider who said we must go i am guarding the camps and have been too long away she had been stroking the silken mane now she stepped back and as she did so the sight that had been eluding her drifting at the edges of her mind suddenly coalesced enough for her to see where she had to go she looked at the baelrath it was dulled and powerless she wasnt surprised this awareness came from the seer in her the soul she shared with ysanne she hesitated looking up at tabor i have one thing more to ask of you will she carry me i have a long way to travel and not enough time his glance was distanced already but it was level and calm she will he said you know her name we will carry you seer anywhere you must go it was time then to make her farewells she looked over and saw that her three guides were standing together not far away where shall we go faebur asked to celidon she answered a number of things were coming clearer even as she stood here and there was urgency in her there was a battle and it is there that you will find the army those who survived she looked at dalreidan who was hesitating hanging back my friend she said in the hearing of all of them you said words to faebur this morning that rang true no one in fionavar is an exile now go home dalreidan and take your true name on the plain tell them the seer of brennin sent you for a moment he remained frozen resisting then he nodded slowly we will meet again he asked i hope she said and stepped forward to embrace him and then faebur as well she looked at brock and you she asked i will go with them he answered until my own king comes home i will serve the aven and the high king as best i can will you be careful seer his voice was gruff she moved closer and out of habit checked the bandage shed wrapped about his head then she bent and kissed him on the lips you too she whispered my dear at the very last she turned to ruana who had been waiting for her they said nothing aloud then in her mind she heard him murmur the weaver hold your thread fast in his hand seer it was what more than anything else she had needed to hearthis last forgiveness where she had no right to any she looked up at his great whitebearded patriarchs head at the wise eyes that had seen so much and yours she replied in silence your thread and that of your people then she walked slowly back to where tabor waited and she mounted behind him upon imraithnimphais and told him where it was she had to go and they flew there were hours yet before dawn when he set her down not at a place of war but in the one place in fionavar where she had known a moments peace a quiet place a lake like a jewel with moonlight glancing along it a cottage by the lake he was in the air again hovering as soon as she dismounted he wanted to be back she knew his father had given him a task and she had drawn him from it twice now thank you she said there was nothing more she could think of to say she raised a hand in farewell as he did the same she saw grieving that the moonlight and the stars were shining through him then imraithnimphais spread her wings and she and her rider were gone another star for a moment and then nothing at all kim went into the cottage part iilisens tower chapter leaning back against the railing of the afterdeck paul watched lancelot dueling with his shadow it had been going on for most of yesterday from the time they sailed from cader sedat and had continued for much of this second morning and into the afternoon the sun was behind them now lancelot stood with his back to it and advanced and retreated along the deck his feet sliding and turning intricately his sword a blur of thrusts and parries too fast to follow properly almost every man on prydwen had spent some time watching him either covertly or as paul was with open admiration he had finally begun to pick out some of the disciplined patterns in what lancelot was doing and as he watched it go on and on paul understood something else this was more than merely training on the part of someone newly wakened from the chamber of the dead in these relentless driven repetitions paul had finally begun to see that lancelot was masking as best he could the emotions rising within himself he watched the darkhaired man go through his systematic drills without fuss or wasted motion of any kind now and always there was a quiet to lancelot a sense of a still pool wherein the ripples of turbulent life were effortlessly absorbed on one level it was deeply reassuring and that reassurance had been present from the moment he had come among them rising from his bed of stone to bring matt sören back from the dead as well paul schafer was too wise though for that to be the only level on which he perceived what was happening he was pwyll twiceborn had spoken to gods and summoned them had lived three nights on the summer tree and the ravens of mórnir were never far from him prydwen was sailing back to war and lancelots training was apt and fit for the role he would play when they landed again they were also sailing back to something else to someone else to guinevere in lancelots compulsive physical action however disciplined it might be paul read that truth as clearly as in a book and the themes of the book were absolute love and absolute betrayal and a sadness that could bind the heart arthur pendragon at the prow with cavall gazing east was the only man on the ship who had not taken a moment to watch lancelot duel his shadows sword the two men had not spoken since walking from the wreckage of cader sedat there was no hatred between them or even anger or manifest rivalry that paul could see he saw instead a guarding a shielding of the self a tight rein kept on the heart paul rememberedknew he would never forgetthe few words they had spoken to each other on the island lancelot newly wakened asking with utmost courtesy why have you done this my lord to the three of us and arthur at the very end the last doorway of that shattered bloody hall oh lance come she will be waiting for you no hatred or rivalry there but something worse more hurtful love and defenses thrown up against it in the sure foreknowledge of what was to come of the story to be played out again as it had been so many times when prydwen came again to land paul took his eyes from that fluid mesmerizing form moving up and down the deck repeating and repeating the same flawless rituals of the blade he turned away looking out to sea over the port railing he would have to defend his own heart he realized he could not afford to lose himself in the woven sorrow of those three he had his own burdens and his own destiny waiting his own role to play his own terrible unspoken anxiety which had a name the name of a child who was no longer a child of the boy who had taken himself in the godwood just a week ago most of the way to his adulthood and most of the way to his power jennifers son and rakoth maugrims darien he was not dari anymore not since that afternoon by the summer tree he had walked into that place as a little boy who had just learned to skip pebbles across a lake and had gone forth as someone very different someone older wilder wielding fire changing shape confused alienated unimaginably powerful son of the darkest god the wild card in the deck of war random his mother had called him knowing more perhaps than any of them not that there was reassurance in that for if darien was random truly so he could do anything he could go either way never brendel of the lios alfar had said never had there been any living creature in any of the worlds so poised between light and dark never anyone to compare with this boy on the brink of manhood who was graceful and handsome and whose eyes were blue except when they were red dark thoughts and there was no light or approach to it at the memory of brendel either brendel to whom he was going to have to tell or stand by while others told the story of the soulmonger and the fate of all the lios alfar who had sailed west in answer to their song since the bael rangat paul sighed looking out at the sea curling away from the motion of the ship liranan was down there he knew the elusive sea god moving through his element paul had a longing to summon him again questions to ask comfort even to seek in the knowledge of sea stars shining again in the place where the soulmonger had been slain wishful thinking that he was far too distant from the source of whatever power he had and far too unsure of how to channel that power even when it was ready to hand really when it came down to it there was only one thing he knew for certain there was a meeting in his future a third meeting and it drifted through his sleep and his daytime reveries along the very tracings of his blood paul knew that he would meet galadan one more time and not again his fate and the wolflords were warp and weft to each other and the weaver alone knew whose thread was marked to be cut when they crossed footsteps crossed the deck behind him cutting against the rhythm of lancelots steady advance and retreat then a light utterly distinctive voice spoke clearly my lord lancelot if it would please you i think i might test you somewhat better than your shadow said diarmuid dan ailell paul turned lancelot perspiring slightly regarded diarmuid with grave courtesy in his face and bearing i should be grateful for it he said with a gentle smile it has been a long time since i faced someone with a sword have you wooden ones then training swords aboard ship it was diarmuids turn to smile eyes dancing under the fair hair bleached even paler by the sun overhead it was an expression most of the men aboard knew very well unfortunately not he murmured but i would hazard that we are both skilled enough to use our blades without doing harm he paused serious harm he amended there was a little silence broken by a third voice from farther up the deck diarmuid this is hardly the time for games let alone dangerous ones the tone of command in loren silvercloaks voice was if anything even stronger since the mage had ceased to be a mage he looked and spoke with undiminished authority with it seemed a clearer sense of purpose ever since the moment matt had been brought back from his death and loren had vowed himself to the service of his old friend who had been king under banir lok before he was source to a mage in paras derval at the same time the ambit of his authorityof anyones for that matterseemed always to come to a sharp terminus at the point where diarmuids own wishes began especially this kind of wish against his will pauls mouth crooked upward as he gazed at the prince out of the corner of his eye he saw erron and rothe handing slips of paper to carde wagers he shook his head bemusedly diarmuid drew his sword we are at sea he said to loren with exaggerated reasonableness and at least a days sailing perhaps more depending on the winds and our marginally competent captaina fleeting glance spared for coll shiftless at the helmfrom reaching land there may never be a more felicitous occasion for play my lord the last question was directed at lancelot with a salute of the sword angled in such a way that the sun glinted from it into lancelots eyeswho laughed unaffectedly returned the salute and moved neatly to the side his own blade extended for the sacred honor of the black boar diarmuid said loudly to whistles and cheers he flourished his steel with a motion of wrist and shoulder for my lady the queen said lancelot automatically it shaped an immediate stillness paul looked instinctively toward the prow arthur stood gazing outward toward where land would be quite oblivious to all of them after a moment paul turned back for the blades had touched ritually and were dancing now hed never seen diarmuid with a sword hed heard the stories about both of ailells sons but this was his initial encounter at first hand and watching he learned something else about why the men of south keep followed their prince with such unwavering loyalty it was more than just the imagination and zest that could conjure moments like this out of a grim ship on a wide sea it was the uncomplicated truthin a decidedly complex manthat he was unnervingly good at everything he did including swordplay paul now saw with no surprise at all the surprise though thinking about it later paul would wonder at his unpreparedness was how urgently the prince was struggling from the first touch of blades to hold his own for this was lancelot du lac and no one ever had been as good with the same economic almost abstract precision with which he had dueled his shadow the man who had lain in a chamber undersea among the mightiest dead in all the worlds showed the men of prydwen why they were using naked blades and moving very fast on a swaying ship to pauls untutored eye there was real danger in the thrusts and cuts they leveled at each other looking past the shouting men he glanced at loren and then at coll and read the same concern in both of them he thought about interceding knew they would stop for him but even with the thought he became aware of his own racing pulse of the degree to which diarmuid had just lifted himall of theminto a mood completely opposite to the hollow silence of fifteen minutes before he stayed where he was the prince he realized knew exactly what he was doing in more ways than one diarmuid retreating before lancelots blurred attack managed to angle himself toward a coil of rope looped on the deck timing it perfectly he quickstepped backward spun around the coil and bending low scythed a cut at lancelots knees a full crippling cut it was blocked by a withdrawn blade a very quickly withdrawn blade lancelot stood up stepped back and with a bright joy in his dark eyes cried bravely done diarmuid wiping sweat from his own eyes with a billowing sleeve grinned ferociously then he leaped to attack without warning for a few quick paces lancelot gave ground but then again his sword began to blur with the speed of its motion and he was advancing forcing diarmuid back toward the hatchway leading belowdeck engrossed utterly forgetful of everything else paul watched the prince give ground he saw something else as well even as he retreated parrying diarmuids eyes were darting away from lancelot to where paul stood at the railor past him actuallybeyond his shoulder out to sea just as paul was turning to see what it was he heard the prince scream paul look out the whole company spun to look including lancelot which enabled diarmuid effortlessly to thrust his blade forward following up on his transparent deception and have it knocked flying from his hand as lancelot extended his spin into a full pirouette bringing him back to face diarmuid but down on one knee his sword sweeping with the power of that full lightningquick arc to crash into diarmuids and send it flying almost off the deck it was over there was a moments stunned silence then diarmuid burst into fullthroated laughter and stepping forward embraced lancelot vigorously as the men of south keep roared their approval unfair lance came a deep voice richly amused youve seen that move before he didnt have a chance arthur pendragon was standing halfway up the deck paul hadnt seen him come none of them had with a lifting heart he saw the smile oh the warriors face and the answering gleam in lancelots eyes and again he saluted diarmuid inwardly the prince was still laughing a chance he gasped breathlessly i would have had to tie him down to have a chance lancelot smiled still composed selfcontained but not repressively so he looked at arthur you remember he asked id almost forgotten gawain tried that once didnt he he did arthur said still amused it almost worked almost arthur agreed but it didnt gawain could never beat you lance he tried all his life and with those words a cloud though the sky was still as blue the afternoon sun as bright as before arthurs brief smile faded then lancelots the two men looked at each other their expressions suddenly unreadable laden with a weight of history amid the sudden stillness of prydwen arthur turned again cavall to heel and went back to the prow his heart aching paul looked at diarmuid who returned the gaze with an expression devoid of mirth he would explain later paul decided the prince could not know none of the others except perhaps loren could know what paul knew knowledge not born of the ravens or the tree but from the lore of his own world the knowledge that gawain of the round table had indeed tried all his life to defeat lancelot in battle they were friendly battles all of them until the every endwhich had come for him at lancelots own hand in a combat that was part of a war a war that arthur was forced to fight after lancelot had saved guinevere from burning at the stake in camelot diarmuid had tried paul thought sadly it was a gallant attempt but the doom of these two men and the woman waiting for them was far too intricately shaped to be lifted even briefly by access to laughter or joy look sharp you laggards colls prosaic carrying voice broke into his reverie weve a ship to sail and it may need some sailing yet winds shifting diar paul looked back south and west to where colls extended arm was pointing the breeze was now very strong he realized it had come up during the swordplay as he looked back he could discern straining a line of darkness at the horizon and in that moment he felt the stillness within his blood that marked the presence of mórnir younger brothers were not supposed to ride creatures of such unbridled power or to sound or look as had tabor last night before he took flight toward the mountains true shed overheard her parents talking about it many times she managed to overhear a great deal and shed been present three nights ago when her father had entrusted the guarding of the women and children to tabor alone but shed never seen the creature of his fast until last night and so it was only then that liane had truly begun to understand what had happened to her younger brother she was more like her mother than her father she didnt cry often or easily but shed understood that it was dangerous for tabor to fly and then shed heard the strangeness in his voice when he mounted up and so she had wept when he flew away she had remained awake all night sitting in the doorway of the house she shared with her mother and brother until a little before dawn there had been a falling star in the sky just west of them near the river a short time later tabor had walked back into the camp raising a hand to the astonished women on guard he touched his sister lightly on the shoulder before he passed inside unspeaking and fell into bed it was more than weariness she knew but there was nothing she could do so she had gone to bed herself to a fitful sleep and dreams of gwen ystrat and of the fairhaired man from another world who had become liadon and the spring she was up with the sunrise before her mother even which was unusual she dressed and walked out after checking to see that tabor still slept aside from those on guard at the gates the camp was quiet she looked east to the foothills and the mountains and then west to see the sparkle of the latham and the plain unrolling beyond as a little girl shed thought the plain went on forever in some ways she still did it was a beautiful morning and for all her cares and the shallow sleep shed had her heart lifted a little to hear the birds and smell the freshness of the morning air she went to check on gereint entering the shamans house she paused a moment to let her eyes adjust to the darkness they had been checking on him several times a day she and tabor a duty and a labor of love but the aged shaman had not moved at all from the moment they had carried him here and his expression had spoken of such terrible anguish that liane could hardly bear to look at him she did though every time searching for clues for ways of aiding him how did one offer aid to someone whose soul was journeying so far away she didnt know she had her fathers love of their people her mothers calm stability her own headstrong nature and not a little courage but where gereint had gone none of these seemed to matter she came anyhow and so did tabor just to be present to share in however small a way so she stood on his threshold again waiting for the darkness to clear a little and then she heard a voice shed known all her life say in a tone shed also known all her life how long does an old man have to wait for breakfast these days she screamed a little a girlish habit she was still trying to outgrow then she seemed to have covered the distance into the room very fast for she was on her knees beside gereint and hugging him and crying just as her father would have and for this perhaps even her mother too i know he said patiently patting her back i know you are deeply sorry it will never happen again i know all that but liane a hug in the morning however nice is not breakfast she was laughing and crying at the same time and trying to hold him as close as she could without hurting his brittle bones oh gereint she whispered im so glad youre back so much has happened im sure he said in a different voice entirely now be still a moment and let me read it in you it will be quicker than the telling she did it had happened so many times before that it no longer felt strange this power was at the heart of what the shamans were it came with their blinding in a very little time gereint sighed and leaned back a little deep in thought after a moment she asked did you do what you went to do he nodded was it very difficult another nod nothing more but she had known him a long time and she was her fathers daughter she had also seen his face as he journeyed she felt an inner stirring of pride gereint was theirs and whatever he had done it was something very great there was another question in her but this one she was afraid to ask ill get you some food she said preparing to rise with gereint though you seldom had to ask liane he murmured i cant tell you for certain because i am not yet strong enough to reach as far as celidon but i think i would know already if something very bad had happened there they are all right child we will have fuller tidings later but you can tell your mother that they are all right relief burst within her like another sunrise she threw her arms around his neck and kissed him again gruffly he said this is still not breakfast and i should warn you that in my day any woman who did that had to be prepared to do a good deal more she laughed breathlessly oh gereint i would lie down with you in gladness any time you asked for once he seemed taken aback no one has said that particular thing to me for a very long time he said after a moment thank you child but see to breakfast and bring your brother to me instead she was who she was and irrepressible gereint she exclaimed in mock astonishment i knew you would say that he growled your father never did teach his children proper manners that is not amusing liane dal ivor now go get your brother he has just awakened she left still giggling and breakfast he shouted after her only when he was quite sure she was out of earshot did he allow himself to laugh he laughed a long time for he was deeply pleased he was back on the plain where hed never thought to be again once having ventured out over the waves but he had indeed done what hed set out to do and his soul had survived and whatever had happened at celidon it was not too bad it could not be or even weakened as he was he would have known from the moment of his return so he laughed for several moments and allowed himselfit wasnt hardto look forward to his meal everything changed when tabor came he entered the mind of the boy and saw what was happening to him and then read the tale of what the seer had done in khath meigol after that his food was tasteless in his mouth and there were ashes in his heart she walked in the garden behind the domed temple with the high priestessif sharra thought to herself this tiny enclosure could properly be said to constitute a garden for one raised in larai rigal and familiar with every pathway waterfall and spreading tree within its walls the question almost answered itself still there were unexpected treasures here she paused beside a bed of sylvain silver and dusty rose she hadnt known they grew so far south there were none in cathal sylvain was said to flourish only on the banks of celyn lake by daniloth they were the flower of the lios alfar she said as much to jaelle the priestess glanced at the flowers with only mild attention they were a gift she murmured a long time ago when ralathen wove the mist over daniloth and the lios began the long withdrawal they sent us sylvain by which to remember them they grow here and in the palace gardens as well not many the soil is wrong or some such thingbut there are always some of them and these seem to have survived the winter and the drought sharra looked at her it means nothing to you does it she said does anything i wonder in flowers jaelle raised her eyebrows then after a pause she said actually there were flowers that mattered the ones outside dun maura when the snow began to melt sharra remembered they had been red bloodred for the sacrifice again she glanced at her companion it was a warm morning but in her white robe jaelle looked icily cool and there was a keen cutting edge to her beauty there was very little mildness or placidity about sharra herself and the man she was to wed would carry all his life the scar of a knife shed thrown at him but with jaelle it was different and provoking of course the princess of cathal murmured those flowers would matter does anything else though or does absolutely everything have to circle back to the goddess in order to reach through to you everything does circle back to her jaelle said automatically but then after a pause she went on impatiently why does everyone ask me things like that what exactly do you all expect from the high priestess of dana her eyes green as the grass in sunlight held sharras and challenged her in the face of that challenge sharra began to regret having brought it up she was still too impetuous it often took her out beyond her depth she was after all a guest in the temple well she began apologetically and got no further really jaelle exclaimed i have no idea what people want of me i am high priestess i have power to channel a mormae to controland dana knows with audiart that takes doing i have rituals to preserve counsel to give with the high king away i have a realm to govern with the chancellor how should i be other than i am what do you all want from me astonishingly she had to turn away toward the flowers to hide her face sharra was bemused and momentarily moved but she was from a country where subtlety of mind was a necessity for survival and she was the daughter and heir of the supreme lord of cathal it isnt really me youre talking to is it she asked quietly who were the others after a moment jaelle who had it seemed courage to go with everything else turned back to look at her the green eyes were dry but there was a question in their depths they heard a footstep on the path yes leila jaelle said almost before she turned what is it and why do you continue to enter places where you should not be the words were stern but not surprisingly the tone sharra looked at the thin girl with the straight fair hair who had screamed in real pain when the wild hunt flew there was some diffidence in leilas expression but not a great deal i am sorry she said but i thought you would want to know the seer is in the cottage where finn and his mother stayed with the little one jaelles expression changed swiftly kim truly you are tuned to the place itself leila i seem to be the girl replied gravely as if it were the most ordinary thing imaginable jaelle looked at her for a long time and sharra only half understanding saw pity in the eyes of the high priestess tell me jaelle asked the girl gently do you see finn now where he is riding leila shook her head only when they were summoned i saw him then though i could not speak to him he was too cold and where they are now it is too cold for me to follow dont try leila jaelle said earnestly dont even try it has nothing to do with trying the girl said simply and something in the words the calm acceptance stirred pity in sharra as well but it was to jaelle that she spoke if kim is nearby she said can we go to her jaelle nodded i have things to discuss with her are there horses here lets go the high priestess smiled thinly as easily as that there is she murmured with delicate precision a distinction between independence and irresponsibility my dear you are your fathers heir and betrothedor did you forget to the heir of brennin and i am charged with half the governance of this realm andor did you forget that too we are at war there were svart alfar slain on that path a year ago we will have to arrange an escort for you if you intend to join me princess of cathal excuse me if you will while i tend to the details and she brushed smoothly past sharra on the pebbled walkway revenge the princess thought ruefully she had trespassed on very private terrain and had just paid the price nor she knew was jaelle wrong which only made the rebuke more galling deep in thought she turned and followed the high priestess back into the temple in the end it took a fair bit of time to get the short expedition untracked and on the road to the lake largely because the preposterous fat man tegid whom diarmuid had elected as his intercedent in the matter of their marriage refused to allow her to ride forth without him even in the care of the priestess and a guard from both brennin and cathal and since there was only one horse in the capital large enough to survive martyrdom under tegids bulk and that horse was quartered in the south keep barracks on the other side of paras derval it was almost noon before they got under way and as a consequence they were too late to do anything at all about what happened in the small hours of that morning kimberly asleep in the cottage by the lake crossed a narrow bridge over a chasm filled with nameless shapeless horrors and when she stood on the other side a figure approached her in the dream and terror rose in her like a mutant shape in that lonely blighted place on her pallet in the cottage never waking she tossed violently from side to side one hand raised unconsciously in rejection and denial for the first and only time she fought her seers vision struggling to change the image of the figure that stood there with her on the farther side to alternot merely foreseethe loops spun into time on the loom to no avail it was to dream this dream that ysanne had made kim a seer had relinquished her own soul to do so she had said as much there were no surprises here only terror and renunciation helpless in the face of this vast inevitability in the cottage the sleeping figure ceased her struggling the uplifted warding hand fell back in the dream she stood quietly on the far side of the chasm facing what had come this meeting had been waiting for her from the beginning it was as true as anything had ever been true and so now with the dreaming of it with the crossing of that bridge the ending had begun it was late in the morning when she finally woke after the dream she had fallen back into the deeper healing sleep her exhausted body so desperately needed now she lay in bed a little while looking at the sunlight that streamed in through the open windows deeply grateful for the small grace of rest in this place there were birds singing outside and the breeze carried the scent of flowers she could hear the lake slapping against the rocks along the shore she rose and went out into the brightness of the day down the familiar path she walked to the broad flat rock overhanging the lake where she had knelt when ysanne threw a bannion into the moonlit waters and summoned eilathen to spin for her he was down there now she knew deep in his halls of seaweed and stone free of the binding flowerfire uncaring of what happened above the surface of his lake she knelt and washed her face in the cool clean waters she sat back on her heels and let the sunlight dry the drops of water glistening on her cheeks it was very quiet far out over the lake a fishing bird swooped and then rose caught by the light flashing away south she had stood on this shore once most of a lifetime ago it seemed throwing pebbles into the water having fled from the words ysanne had spoken in the cottage under the cottage her hair had still been brown then she had been an intern from toronto a stranger in another world she was whitehaired now and the seer of brennin and on the far side of a chasm in her dream she had seen a road stretching away and someone had stood before her on that road sparkling brilliantly a speckled fish leaped from the lake the sun was high too high the loom was shuttling even as she lingered by this shore kimberly rose and went back into the cottage she moved the table a little to one side she laid her hand on the floor and spoke a word of power there were ten steps leading down the walls were damp there were no torches but from below the wellremembered pearly light still shone on her finger the baelrath began to glow in answer then she reached the bottom and stood in the chamber again with its woven carpet single desk bed chair ancient books and the glassdoored cabinet on the farther wall wherein lay the circlet of lisen from which the shining came she walked over and opened the cabinet doors for a long time she stood motionless looking down at the gold of the circlet band and the glowing stone set within fairest creation of the lios alfar crafted by the children of light in love and sorrow for the fairest child of all the weavers worlds the light against the dark ysanne had named it it had changed kim remembered her saying the color of hope when it was made since lisens death it shone more softly and with loss thinking of ysanne kim felt her as a palpable presence she had the illusion that if she hugged herself shed be putting her arms about the frail body of the old seer it was an illusion nothing more but she remembered something else that was more than illusory words of raederth the mage ysanne had loved and been loved by the man who had found the circlet again notwithstanding all the long years it had lain lost who wears this next after lisen raederth had said shall have the darkest road to walk of any child of earth or stars the words she had heard in her dream kim reached out a hand and with infinite care lifted the circlet from where it lay she heard a sound from the room above terror burst inside her sharper even than in the dream for what had been only foreknowing then and so removed a little was present now and above her and the time had come she turned to face the stairway keeping her voice as level as she could knowing how dangerous it would be to show fear she said you can come down if you like ive been waiting for you silence her heart was thunder a drum for a moment she saw the chasm again the bridge the road then there were footsteps on the stairs then darien she had never seen him she endured a moment of terrible dislocation over and above everything else she knew nothing of what happened in the glade of the summer tree he was supposed to be a child even though a part of her had known he wasnt and couldnt be in the dream he had been only a shadowed presence ill defined and a name shed learned in toronto even before he was born by the aura of the name she had known him and by another thing which had been the deepest source of her terror his eyes had been red they were blue now and he seemed very young though he should have been even younger so much younger but jennifers child born less than a year ago stood before her his eyes uneasy darting about the chamber and he looked like any fifteenyearold boy might lookif any boy could be as beautiful as this one was and carry as much power within himself how did you know i was here he said abruptly his voice was awkward underused she tried to will her heartbeat to slow she needed to be calm needed all her wits about her for this i heard you she said i thought i was being quiet she managed to smile you were darien i have very good ears your mother used to wake me when she came in late at night however quiet she was his eyes came to rest on hers for a moment you know my mother i know her very well i love her dearly he moved a couple of paces into the room but stayed between her and the stairway she wasnt sure if it was to keep an exit for himself or block it from her he was looking around again i never knew this room was here the muscles of her back were corded with tension it belonged to the woman who lived here before you she said why he challenged who was she why is it underground he was wearing a sweater and trousers and fawncolored boots the sweater was brown too warm for summer and too large for him it would have been finns she realized all the clothing was her mouth was dry she wet her lips with her tongue she was a very wise woman and she had many things she loved in this room so she kept it hidden to guard them the circlet lay in her hand it was slender and delicate almost no weight at all yet she felt as if she carried the weight of worlds what things said darien and so the time truly was upon them this said kim holding it out to him and it is for you darien it was meant for you it is the circlet of lisen her voice trembled a little she paused he was silent watching her waiting she said it is the light against the dark her voice failed her the high heroic words went forth into the little chamber and fell away into silence do you know who i am asked darien his hands had closed at his side he took another step toward her do you know who my father is so much terror but she had dreamt this it was his she nodded i do she whispered and because she thought she had heard a diffidence in his voice not a challenge she said and i know your mother was stronger than him she didnt really but that was the prayer the hope the gleam of light she held he wanted her to die so you wouldnt be born he withdrew the one step he had advanced then he laughed a little a lonely terrible laugh i didnt know that he said cernan asked why i was allowed to live i heard him everyone seems to agree his hands were opening and closing spasmodically not everyone she said not everyone darien your mother wanted you to be born desperately she had to be so careful it mattered so much paulpwyll the one who stayed with you herehe risked his life guarding her and bringing her to vaes house the night you were born dariens expression changed as if his face had slammed shut against her he slept in finns bed he said flatly accusingly she said nothing what could she say give it to me he said what could she do it all seemed so inevitable now that the time had come who but this child should walk the darkest road he was already on it no others loneliness would ever run so deep no others dangerousness be so absolute wordlessly for no words could be adequate to the moment she stepped forward the circlet in her hands instinctively he retreated a hand raised to strike her but then he lowered his arm and stood very still and suffered her to place it about his brow he was not even as tall as she she didnt have to reach up it was easy to fit the golden band over his golden hair and close the delicate clasp it was easy it had been dreamt it was done and the moment the clasp was fitted the light of the circlet went out a sound escaped him a torn wordless cry the room was suddenly dark lit only by the red glow of the baelrath which yet burned and the thin light that streamed down the stairs from the room above then darien made another sound and this time it was laughter not the lost laugh of before this was harsh strident uncontrolled mine he cried the light against the dark oh you fool how should the son of rakoth maugrim carry such a light how should it ever shine for me kims hands were against her mouth there was so much unbridled torment in his voice then he moved and her fear exploded it doubled redoubled itself outstripped any measure shed ever had for by the light of the warstone she saw his eyes flash red he gestured nothing more than that but she felt it as a blow that drove her to the ground thrusting past her he strode to the cabinet against the wall in which lay the last object of power the last thing ysanne had seen in her life and lying on the ground helpless at his feet kim saw rakoths son take lokdal the dagger of the dwarves and claim it for his own no she gasped darien the circlet is yours but not the dagger it is not for you to take you know not what it is he laughed again and drew the blade from its jeweled sheath a sound like a plucked harpstring filled the room he looked at the gleaming blue thieren running along the blade and said i do not need to know my father will how should i go to him without a gift and what sort of gift would this dead stone of lisens make if the very light turns away from me at least i now know where i belong he was past her then and by the stairs he was climbing them and leaving with the circlet lifeless upon his brow and colans dagger in his hand darien kim cried with the voice of her hearts pain he wanted you dead it was your mother who fought to let you be born no response footsteps across the floor above a door opening and closing with the circlet gone the baelrath slowly grew dim so it was quite dark in the chamber below the cottage and in the darkness kim wept for the loss of light when they came an hour later she was by the lake again very deep in thought the sound of the horses startled her and she rose quickly to her feet but then she saw long red hair and midnight black and she knew who had come and was glad she walked forward along the curve of the shore to meet them sharra who was a friend and had been from the first day theyd met dismounted the instant her horse came to a stop and enfolded kim in a fierce embrace are you all right she asked did you do it the events of the morning were so vivid that for a moment kim didnt realize it was khath meigol that sharra was talking about the last time the princess of cathal had seen her kim had been preparing to leave for the mountains she managed a nod and a small smile though it was difficult i did she said i did what i went to do she left it at that for the moment jaelle had dismounted as well and stood a little way apart waiting she looked as she always did cool and withdrawn formidable but kim had shared a moment with her in the temple in gwen ystrat on the eve of maidaladan so walking over she gave the priestess a hug and a quick kiss on the cheek jaelle stood rigid for an instant then awkwardly her arms went around kim in a brief transient gesture that nonetheless conveyed a great deal kim stepped back she knew her eyes were red from weeping but there was no point in dissembling not with jaelle she was going to need help not least of all in deciding what to do im glad youre here she said quietly how did you know leila jaelle said shes still tuned to this cottage where finn was she told us you were here kim nodded anything else did she say anything else not this morning did something happen yes kim whispered something happened weve a lot to catch each other up on wheres jennifer the other two women exchanged glances it was sharra who answered she went with brendel to the anor lisen when the ship sailed kim closed her eyes so many dimensions to sorrow would there ever be an ending do you want to go into the cottage jaelle asked she shook her head quickly no not inside lets stay out here jaelle gave her a searching look and then without fuss gathered her white robe and sat down on the stony beach kim and sharra followed suit a little distance away the men of cathal and brennin were watchfully arrayed tegid of rhoden prodigious in brown and gold walked toward the three of them my lady he said with a deep bow to sharra how may i serve you on behalf of my prince food she answered crisply a clean cloth and a lunch to spread upon it instantly he exclaimed and bowed again not entirely steady on the loose stones of the shoreline he wheeled and scrunched his way over the beach to find them provisions sharra looked sideways at kim who had an eyebrow raised in frank curiosity a new conquest kim asked with some of her old teasing the tone she sometimes thought shed lost forever sharra surprisingly blushed well yes i suppose but not him um diarmuid proposed marriage to me before prydwen sailed tegid is his intercedent hes looking after me and so she got no further having been comprehensively enveloped in a second embrace oh sharra kim exclaimed thats the nicest news ive heard in i dont know how long i suppose jaelle murmured dryly but i thought we had more pressing matters to discuss than matrimonial tidings and we still dont have any news of the ship yes we do said kim quickly we know they got there and we know they won a battle oh dana be praised jaelle said suddenly sounding very young all cynicism stripped away sharra was speechless tell us the high priestess said how do you know kim began the story with her capture in the mountains with ceriog and faebur and dalreidan and the death rain over eridu then she told them of seeing that dread rain come to an end the morning before of seeing sunshine to the east and so knowing that metran on cader sedat had been stopped she paused a moment for tegid had returned with two soldiers in his wake carrying armloads of food and drink it took a few minutes for things to be arranged in a fashion that to his critical eye was worthy of the princess of cathal when the three men had withdrawn kina took a deep breath and spoke of khath meigol of tabor and imraithnimphais of the rescue of the paraiko and the last kanior and then at the end very softly of what she and her ring had done to the giants when she finished it was quiet on the shore again neither of the other women spoke they were both familiar with power kim knew in a great many of its shadings but what she had just told them what she had done had to be alien and almost impossible to grasp she felt very alone paul she thought might have understood for his too was a lonely path then almost as if reading her thoughts sharra reached out and squeezed her hand kim squeezed back and said tabor told me that the aven and all the dalrei rode to celidon three nights ago to meet an army of the dark i have no idea what happened neither did tabor we do jaelle said and in her turn she told of what had happened two evenings before when leila had screamed in anguish at the summoning of the wild hunt and through her link every priestess in the sanctuary had heard green ceinwens voice as she mastered owein and drew him from his kill it was kims turn to be silent absorbing this there was still one thing left to be told though and so at length she said im afraid something else has happened who was here this morning jaelle asked with unnerving anticipation it was beautiful where they were sitting the summer air was mild and clean the sky and lake were a brilliant blue there were birds and flowers and a soft breeze off the water there was a glass of cool wine in her hand darien she said i gave him the circlet of lisen ysanne had it hidden here the light went out when he put it on and he stole colans dagger lokdal which led also had in the cottage then he left he said he was going to his father it was unfair of her she knew to put it so baldly jaelles face had gone bone white with the impact of what shed just said but kim knew that it wouldnt have mattered how shed told it how could she cushion the impact of the mornings terror what shelter could there be the breeze was still blowing there were flowers green grass the lake the summer sun and fear densely woven at the very root of everything threatening to take it all away across a chasm along a shadowed road north to the heart of evil who asked sharra of cathal is darien and who is his father amazingly kim had forgotten paul and dave knew about jennifers child and jaelle and the mormae of owen ystrat vae of course and finn though he too was gone now leila probably who seemed to know everything connected in any way to finn no one else knew not loren or aileron arthur or ivor or even gereint she looked at jaelle and received a look back equally doubtful equally anxious then she nodded and after a moment the high priestess did as well and so they told sharra the whole story sitting on the shore of eilathens lake and when it was done when kim had spoken of the rape and the premature birth of vae and finn when jaelle had told them both pauls story of what had happened in the glade of the summer tree and kim had ended the telling with the red flash of dariens eyes that morning and the effortless power that had knocked her sprawling sharra of cathal rose to her feet she walked a few quick steps away and stood a moment gazing out over the water then she wheeled to face kim and jaelle again looking down on the two of them at the bleak apprehension in their faces sharra whose dreams since she was a girl had been of herself as a falcon flying alone cried aloud but this is terrible that poor child no one else in any world can be so lonely it carried kim saw the soldiers glance over at them from farther along the shore jaelle made a queer sound between a gasp and a breathless laugh really she began poor child i dont think youve quite understood no kim interrupted laying an urgent hand on jaelles arm no wait she isnt wrong even as she spoke she was reliving the scene under the cottage scanning it again trying to see past her terrified awareness of who this childs father was and as she looked back straining to remember she heard again the sound that had escaped him when lisens light had gone out and this time removed from it with sharras words to guide her kim heard clearly what shed missed before the loneliness the terrible sense of rejection in that bewildered cry wrung from the soul of this boyonly a boy they had to remember thatwho had no one and nothing and nowhere to turn and from whom the very light had turned away as if in denial and abhorrence hed actually said that she remembered now hed said as much to her but in her fear shed registered only the terrible threat that followed he was going to his father bearing gifts gifts of entreaty she now realized of supplication of longing for a place from the most solitary soul there was from darien on the darkest road kim stood up sharras words had crystallized things for her finally and she had thought of the one tiny thing she could do a desperate hope it was but it was all they had for although it might still be proven true that it was the armies and a battlefield that would end things one way or the other kim knew that there were too many other powers arrayed for that to be a certainty and she was one of the powers and another was the boy shed seen that morning she glanced over at the soldiers concerned for a moment but only for a moment it was too late for absolute secrecy the game was too far along and too much was riding on what would follow so she stepped forward a little off the stony shoreline onto the grass running up to the front door of the cottage then she lifted her voice and cried darien i know you can hear me before you go where you said you would go let me tell you this your mother is standing now in a tower west of pendaran wood that was all it was all she had left a scrap of information given to the wind after the shouting a very great silence made deeper not broken by the waves on the shore she felt a little ridiculous knowing how it must appear to the soldiers but dignity meant less than nothing now only the reaching out mattered the casting of her voice with her heart behind it with the one thing that might get through to him but there was only silence from the trees east of the cottage a white owl roused from daytime slumber rose briefly at her cry then settled again deeper in the woods still she was fairly certain and she trusted her instincts by now having had so little else to guide her for so long darien was still there he was drawn to this place and held by it and if he was nearby he could hear her and if he heard she didnt know what he would do she only knew that if anyone anywhere could hold him from that journey to his father it was jennifer in her tower with her burdens and her griefs and her insistence from the start that her child was to be random but he couldnt be left so anymore kim told herself surely jennifer would see that he was on his way to starkadh comfortless and lonely surely his mother would forgive kim this act of intervention kim turned back to the others jaelle was on her feet as well standing very tall composed very much aware of what had just been done she said should we warn her what will she do if he goes to her kim felt suddenly weary and fragile she said i dont know i dont know if hell go there he might i think sharras right though hes looking for a place as to warning heri have no idea how im sorry jaelle drew a careful breath i can take us there how said sharra how can you do that with the avarlith and blood the high priestess of dana replied in a quieter different tone of voice a great deal of each kim looked at her searchingly should you though shouldnt you stay in the temple jaelle shook her head ive been uneasy there these past few days which has never happened before i think the goddess has been preparing me for this kim looked down at the baelrath on her finger at its quiescent powerless flickering no help there sometimes she hated the ring with a frightening intensity she looked up at the other women shes right sharra said calmly jennifer will need warning if he is going to her or comfort afterward if nothing else jaelle said surprisingly seer decide quickly we will have to ride back to the temple to do this and time is the one thing we do not have there are a lot of things we dont have kim amended almost absently but she was nodding her head even as she spoke they had brought an extra horse for her later that afternoon under the dome of the temple before the altar with the axe jaelle spoke words of power and of invocation she drew blood from herselfa great deal in fact as she had warnedthen she linked to the mormae in gwen ystrat and in concert the inner circle of the priestesses of dana reached down into the earthroot for power of the mother great enough to send three women a long way off to a stony shore by an ocean not a lake it didnt take very long by any measure of such things but even so by the time they arrived the gathering storm was very nearly upon them all and the wind and the waves were wild even in the owl shape the circlet fitted about his head he had to hold the dagger in his mouth though and that was tiring he let it drop into the grass at the base of his tree nothing would come to take it all the other animals in the copse of trees were afraid of him by now he could kill with his eyes he had learned that just two nights before when a field mouse he was hunting had been on the verge of escaping under the rotted wood of the barn he had been hungry and enraged his eyes had flashedhe always knew when they did even though he couldnt entirely control themand the mouse had sizzled and died hed done it three times more that night even though he was no longer hungry there was some pleasure in the power and a certain compulsion too that part he didnt really understand he supposed it came from his father late the next night hed been falling asleep in his own form or the form hed taken for himself a week ago and as he drifted off a memory had come back halfway to a dream he recalled the winter that had passed and the voices in the storm that had called him every night hed felt the same compulsion then he remembered a desire to go outside in the cold and play with the wild voices amid the blowing snow he didnt hear the voices anymore they werent calling him he wonderedit was a difficult thoughtif they had stopped calling because he had already come to them as a boy so little time ago when the voices were calling he used to try to fight them finn had helped he used to pad across the cold floor of the cottage and crawl into bed with finn and that had made everything right there was no one to make anything right anymore he could kill with his eyes and finn was gone he had fallen asleep on that thought in the cave high up in the hills north of the cottage and in the morning hed seen the whitehaired woman walk down the path to stand by the lake then when shed gone back in hed followed her and shed called him and hed gone down the stairs hed never known were there shed been afraid of him too everyone was he could kill with his eyes but shed spoken quietly to him and smiled once he hadnt had anyone smile at him for a long time not since hed left the glade of the summer tree in this new older shape he couldnt get used to and she knew his mother his real mother the one finn had told him had been like a queen and had loved him even though shed had to go away shed made him special finn had said and hed said something else about having to be good so darien would deserve the being special something like that it was becoming harder to remember he wondered though why she had made him able to kill so easily and to want to kill sometimes hed thought about asking the whitehaired woman about that but he was uncomfortable now in the enclosed spaces of the cottage and he was afraid to tell her about the killing he was afraid she would hate him and go then shed showed him the light and shed said it was meant for him hardly daring to believe it because it was so very beautiful hed let her put it on his brow the light against the dark she called it and as she spoke darien remembered another thing finn had told him about having to hate the dark and the voices in the storm that came from the dark and now astonishingly it seemed that even though he was the son of rakoth maugrim he was being given a jewel of light and then it went out only finns going away had ever hurt as much he felt the same emptiness the same hollow sense of loss and then in the midst of it because of it hed felt his eyes readying themselves to go red and then they did he didnt kill her he could have easily but he only knocked her down and went to take the other shining thing hed seen in that room he didnt know why he took it or what it was he just took it only when he was turning to go and she tried to stop him did it come to him how he could hurt her as much as shed hurt him and so in that moment hed decided be was going to take the dagger to his father his voice had sounded cold and strong to his own ears and hed seen her face go white just before he left the room and went outside and made himself into an owl again later in the day other people had come and hed watched them from his tree in the woods east of the cottage hed seen the three women talking by the lake though he couldnt hear what they said and he was too afraid in the owl shape to go nearer but then one of them the one with dark hair had stood up and had cried loudly enough for him to hear that poor child no one else in any world can be so lonely and he knew that she was speaking of him he wanted to go down then but he was still afraid he was afraid that his eyes would want to turn red and he wouldnt know how to stop them or to stop what he did when they were that way so he waited and a moment later the one with white hair walked forward a little toward him and she called out to him by name the part of him that was an owl was so startled that he flew a few wingbeats out of sheer reflex before he was able to control himself again and then he heard her tell him where his mother was that was all a moment later they went away he was alone again he stayed in the tree in the owl form trying to decide what to do she had been like a queen finn had said she had loved him he flew down and took hold of the dagger again in his mouth and then he started to fly the part of him that was an owl didnt want to fly in the day but he was more than an owl much more it was hard to carry the dagger but he managed it he flew north but only for a little way west of pendaran wood the whitehaired one had said he knew where that was though he didnt know how he knew gradually he began to angle his flight northwest he went very fast a storm was coming chapter in the place where they were goingall of them the wolflord running in his wolf shape darien flying as an owl with a blade in his mouth the three women sent from the temple by the power of danajennifer stood on lisens balcony gazing out to sea her hair blown back by the freshening wind so still was she that save for the eyes restlessly scanning the whitecapped waves she might have been the figurehead at the prow of a ship and not a living woman waiting at the edge of land for that ship to come home they were a long way north from taerlindel she knew and a part of her wondered about that but it was here that lisen had waited for a ship to return from cader sedat and deep within herself jennifer felt an awareness a certainty that this was where she should be and embedded within that certainty as a weed in a garden was a growing sense of foreboding the wind was southwest and ever since the morning hadturned to afternoon it had been getting stronger never taking her eyes from the sea she moved back from the low parapet and sat down in the chair they had brought out for her she ran her fingers along the polished wood it had been made brendel had said by craftsmen of the brein mark in daniloth long before even the anor was built brendel was here with her and flidais as well familiar spirits never far from her side never speaking unless she spoke to them the part of her that was still jennifer lowell and had taken pleasure in riding horses and teasing her roommate and had loved kevin laine for his wit as well as his tenderness rebelled against this weighty solemnity but she had been kidnapped after riding a horse a year ago and kim was whitehaired now and a seer with her own weight to carry and kevin was dead and she herself was guinevere and arthur was here drawn back again to war against the dark and he was everything he had ever been he had broken through the walls she had raised about herself since starkadh and had set her free in the bright arc of an afternoon and then had sailed away to a place of death she knew too much about his destiny and her own bitter role in that to ever truly be lighthearted again she was the lady of the sorrows and the instrument of punishment and there was little she could do it seemed about either of them her foreboding grew and the silence began to oppress her she turned to flidais as she did her child was just then flying across the wyth llewen river in the heart of the wood coming to her will you tell me a story she asked while i watch the one shed known as taliesin at arthurs court and who was now beside her in his truer older shape drew a curved pipe from his mouth blew a circle of smoke along the wind and smiled what story he asked what would you hear lady she shook her head she didnt want to have to think anything she shrugged then after a pause tell me about the hunt kim and dave set them free i know that much how were they bound who were they flidais again he smiled and there was more than a little pride in his voice i will tell you all of what you ask and i doubt there is a living creature in fionavar now that the paraiko are dead and haunting khath meigol who would know the story rightly she gave him an ironic sidelong glance you did know all the stories didnt you all of them vain child i know the stories and the answers to all the riddles in all the worlds save he broke off abruptly brendel watching with interest saw the andain of the forest flush a deep surprising red when flidais resumed it was a different tone and as he spoke jennifer turned back to the waves listening and watching a figurehead again i had this from ceinwen and cernan a very long time ago flidais said his deep voice cutting through the sound of the wind not even the andain were in fionavar when this world was spun into time first of the weavers worlds the lios alfar were not yet on the loom nor the dwarves nor the tall men from oversea nor those east of the mountains or in the sunburnt lands south of cathal the gods and the goddesses given their names and powers by grace of the weavers hands were here there were animals in the woods and the woods were vast then there were fish in the lakes and rivers and the wide sea and birds in the wider sky and in the sky as well there flew the wild hunt and in the forests and the valleys and across rivers and up the mountain slopes there walked the paraiko in the young years of the world naming what they saw by day the paraiko walked and the hunt were at rest but at night when the moon rose owein and the seven kings and the child who rode iselen palest of the shadow horses mounted up into the starry sky and they hunted the beasts of woods and open spaces until dawn filling the night with the wild terrible beauty of their cries and their hunting horns why brendel could not forebear to ask do you know why forest one do you know why the weaver spun their killing into the tapestry who shall know the design on the loom flidais said soberly but this much i had from cernan of the beasts the hunt was placed in the tapestry to be wild in the truest sense to lay down an uncontrolled thread for the freedom of the children who came after and so did the weaver lay a constraint upon himself that not even he shuttling at the loom of worlds may preordain and shape exactly what is to be we who came after the andain who are the children of gods the lios alfar the dwarves and all the races of men we have such choices as we have some freedom to shape our own destinies because of that wild thread of owein and the hunt slipping across the loom warp and then weft in turn and at times they are there cernan told me one night long ago precisely to be wild to cut across the weavers measured will to be random and so enable us to be he stopped because the green eyes of guinevere had turned back to him from the sea and there was that within them which stilled his tongue was that cernans word she asked random he thought back carefully for the look on her face demanded care and it had been a very long time ago it was he said at length understanding that it mattered but not why he said it exactly so lady the weaver wove the hunt and set them free on the loom that we in our turn might have a freedom of our own because of them good and evil light and dark they are in all the worlds of the tapestry because owein and the kings are here following the child on iselen threading across the sky she had turned fully away from the sea to face him now he could not read her eyes he had never been able to read her eyes she said and so because of the hunt rakoth was made possible it was not a question she had seen through to the deepest bitterest part of the story he answered withwhat cernan and ceinwen had said to him the only thing that could be said he is the price we pay after a pause and a little more loudly because of the wind he added he is not in the tapestry because of the randomness of the hunt the loom itself was no longer sacrosanct it was no longer all so maugrim was able to come from outside of it from outside of time and the walls of night that bind all the rest of us even the gods and enter into fionavar and so into all the worlds he is here but he is not part of the tapestry he has never done anything that would bind him into it and so he cannot die even if everything on the loom should unravel and all our threads be lost this part brendel had known though never before how it had come to pass sick at heart he looked at the woman sitting beside them and as he gazed he read a thought in her he was not wiser than flidais nor had he even known her so long but he had tuned his soul to her service since the night shed been stolen from his care and he said jennifer if all this is true if the weaver put a check on his own shaping of our destinies it would followsurely it would followthat the warriors doom is not irrevocable it was her own burgeoning thought a hint a kernel of brightness in the darkness that surrounded her she looked at him not smiling not venturing so much but with a softening of the lines of her face and a catch in her voice that made him ache she said i know i have been thinking that oh my friend could it be i felt a difference when i first saw himi did there was no one here who was lancelot in the way that i was guinevere waiting to remember my story i told him so there are only the two of us this time he saw a brightness in her face a hint of color absent since prydwen had set sail and it seemed to bring her back in all her beauty from the realm of statues and icons to that of living women who could love and dared hope better far better the lios alfar would think bitterly later that night unsleeping by the anor that she had never allowed herself that unsheathing of her heart shall i go on flidais said with a hint of the asperity proper to an upstaged storyteller please she murmured kindly turning back to him but then as he began the tale again she fixed her gaze once more out to sea sitting so she listened to him tell of how the hunt had lost the young one iselens rider on the night they moved the moon she tried to pay attention as his deep cadences rode over the wind to recount how connla mightiest of the paraiko had agreed to shape the spells that would lay the hunt to rest until another one was born who could take the longest road with themthe road that ran between the worlds and the stars however hard she tried though she could not entirely school her thoughts for the andains earlier explanation had reached into her heart and not just in the way brendel had discerned the question of randomness of the weavers gift of choice to his children touched arthurs woven doom with a possibility of expiation shed never really allowed herself to dream about before but there was something else in what flidais had said something that went beyond their own long tragedy in all its returnings and this the lios alfar had not seen and flidais knew nothing at all of it jennifer did though and she held it close to her rapidly beating heart random cernan of the beasts had said of the wild hunt and the choice they embodied it was her own word her own instinctive word for her response to maugrim for her child and his choice she looked out to sea searching the wind was very strong now and there were storm clouds coming up fast she forced herself to keep her features calm as she gazed but inwardly she was as open as exposed as she had ever been and in that moment darien landed near the rivet at the edge of the trees and took his human form again the sound of thunder was distant yet and the clouds were still far out at sea but it was a southwest wind that was carrying the storm and when the light began to change the weatherwise lios alfar grew uneasy he took jennifers hand and the three of them withdrew into the high chamber flidais rolled the curved glass windows shut along their tracks they sealed tightly and in the abrupt silence brendel saw the andain suddenly tilt his head as if hearing something he was the howl of wind on the balcony had screened from him the alarms running through the great wood there was an intruder there were two one was here even now and the other was coming and would arrive very soon the one who was coming he knew and feared for it was his own lord lord of all the andain and mightiest of them but the other one the one standing below them at this moment he knew not nor did the powers of the wood and it frightened them in their fear they grew enraged and he could feel that rage now as a buffeting greater than the wind on the balcony be calm he sent inwardly though he was anything but calm himself i will go down i will deal with this to the others to the lios alfar and the woman hed known as guinevere he said grimly someone has come and galadan is on his way to this place even now he saw a look pass between the two of them and he felt the tightening of tension in the room he thought they were mirroring his own anxiety knowing nothing of the memory they shared of the wolflord in a wood east of paras derval a little more than a year ago are you expecting anyone he demanded who would follow you here who could follow us here brendel replied quickly there was suddenly a new brightness to the lios as if he had shed a cloak and his true nature was shining through no one has come by sea we would have seen themand how could anyone pass through the forest someone stronger than the wood flidais replied vexed at the hint of apprehension that reached his voice brendel was already by the stairwell jennifer wait here we will go down and deal with this lock the door after us and open only to one of our voices he loosened his short sword in its scabbard as he spoke then turned to flidais how long before galadan arrives the andain sent the query out to the wood and relayed the answer back half an hour perhaps less he is running very fast in his wolf shape will you help me brendel asked him directly this was of course the question the andain rarely cared for the affairs of mortals and even more rarely intervened in them but flidais had a purpose here his oldest deepest purpose and so he temporized i will go down with you i told the forest i would see who this was jennifer had gone very pale again brendel saw but her hands were steady and her head very high and once more he marveled at her sheer unwavering courage as she said i will come down whoever is here has come because of me it may be a friend it may not be brendel replied gravely then i should be no safer in this room she answered calmly and paused at the head of the curving stairs waiting for him to lead her down one more moment he hesitated then his eyes went green exactly the color of her own he took her hand and brought it to his forehead and then his lips before turning to descend sword drawn now his tread quick and light on the stone stairs she followed and flidais behind her his mind racing with calculations boiling over with considerations and possibilities and a frantically stifled excitement they saw darien standing by the river as soon as they stepped out onto the beach the wind carried lashings of sea spray that stung when they struck and the sky had grown darker even in the moments of their descent it was purple now shot through with streaks of red and thunder was rolling out at sea beyond the rising waves but for brendel of the lios alfar who immediately recognized who had come none of this even registered quickly he spun around to fling some warning to jennifer to give her time to prepare herself then he saw from her expression that she didnt need his warning she knew already who this boy standing before them was he looked at her face wet now with ocean spray and stepped aside as she moved forward toward the river where darien stood flidais came up beside him droplets of spray glittering on his bald head an avid curiosity in his face brendel became aware of the sword he carried and he sheathed it silently then he and the andain watched mother and child come together for the first time since the night darien was born an overwhelming awareness filled brendels mind of how many things might lie in the balance here he would never forget that afternoon by the summer tree and the words of cernan why was he allowed to live he thought of that he thought of pwyll far out at sea and he was conscious every moment of cernans son running toward them even now as fast as the gathering storm and more dangerous he looked down at the andain beside him not trusting the vivid inquisitive brightness in flidais eyes but what after all could he do he could stand by apprehensive and ready he could die in jennifers defense if it came to that he could watch and watching he saw darien step cautiously forward away from the riverbank as the boy came nearer brendel saw some sort of circlet about his brow with a dark gem enclosed within it and deep in his mind a chime sounded crystal on crystal a warning from memories not his own he reached back toward them but even as he did he saw the boy hold out a sheathed dagger toward his mother and as darien spoke brendels memories were wiped away by the urgent demands of the present will you will you take a gift he heard it seemed to him as if the boy were poised to take sudden flight at a breath at the fall of a leaf he held himself very still and disbelieving heard jennifers reply is it yours to give there was ice in her voice and steel hard and cold and carrying her tone knifed through the wind sharp as the dagger her son was offering her confused unprepared darien stumbled back the blade fell from his fingers aching for him for both of them brendel kept silence though his whole being was crying out to jennifer to be careful to be gentle to do whatever she had to do to hold the boy and claim him there was a sound from behind him quickly he glanced back his hand gliding to his sword the seer of brennin her white hair whipping across her eyes was standing at the edge of the forest east of the anor a moment later his shocked eyes discerned the high priestess and then sharra of cathals unmistakable beauty and the mystery cleared and deepened both they must have come from the temple by using the earthroot and jaelles power but why what was happening flidais too had heard them come but not jennifer or darien who were too intent on each other brendel turned back to them he was behind jennifer could not see her face but her back was straight and her head imperiously high as she faced her son who said small and seeming frail in the wild wind i thought it might please you i took it i thought surely now brendel thought surely she would ease the path for him now it does not jennifer replied why should i welcome a blade that does not belong to you brendel clenched his hands there seemed to be a fist squeezing his heart oh careful he thought oh please take care what he heard dariens mother say are you doing here the boys head jerked as if shed struck him ishe told me the one with white hair she said you were his words failed him whatever else he said was lost in the tearing wind she said i was here his mother said coldly very clearly very well she was right of course what of it what do you want darien you are no longer a babyyou arranged for that yourself would you have me treat you like one of course he would brendel wanted to say couldnt she see that was it so hard for her darien straightened his hands thrust forward almost of themselves he threw his head back and brendel thought he saw a flash then the boy cried from the center of his heart dont you want me from his extended hands two bolts of power flew to left and right of his mother one hurtled into the bay struck the small boat tied up to the dock and blasted it into shards and fragments of wood the other sizzled just past his mothers face and torched a tree at the edge of the wood weaver at the loom brendel gasped at his side flidais made a strangled sound and then ran as fast as his short legs could carry him to stand beneath the burning tree the andain raised his arms toward the blaze he spoke words too rapid and low to follow and the fire went out a real fire this time brendel thought numbly it had been only illusion the last time by the summer tree weaver alone knew where this childs power ended or where it would go as if in answer to his thoughts his unspoken fears darien spoke again clearly this time in a voice that mastered the wind and the thunder out at sea and the drumming rising now from the forest floor shall i go to starkadh he challenged his mother shall i see if my father gives me a fairer welcome i doubt rakoth will scruple to take a stolen dagger do you leave me any choicemother hes not a child brendel thought it was not the words or the voice of a child jennifer had not moved or flinched even when the bolts of power flew by her only her fingers spreadeagled at her sides gave any hint of tension and again amid his doubt and fear and numbing incomprehension brendel of the lios alfar was awed by what he saw in her she said darien i leave you the only choice there is i will say this much and nothing more you live though your father wanted me dead so that you would never come into the tapestry i cannot hold you in my arms or seek shelter and love for you as i did in vaes house when you were born we are past the time for that there is a choice for you to make and everything i know tells me that you must make it freely and unconstrained or it will never have been made at all if i bind you to me now or even try i strip you of what you are what if i dont want to make that choice struggling to understand brendel heard dariens voice suspended halfway it seemed between the explosion of his power and the supplication of his longing his mother laughed but not harshly oh my child she said none of us want to make it and all of us must yours is only the hardest and the one that matters most the wind died a little a lull a hesitation darien said finn told me before that my mother loved me and that she had made me special and now as if involuntarily jennifers hands did move up from her sides to clutch her elbows tightly in front of her acushla machree she saidor so brendel thought she started to go on then seemed to pull herself up short as on a tight harsh rein after a moment she added in a different voice he was wrong about making you special you know that now your power comes from rakoth when your eyes go red what you have of me is only freedom and the right to choose to make your own choice between light and dark nothing more than that no jen the seer of brennin screamed into the wind too late dariens eyes changed again as the last words were spoken and from the bitterness of his laughter brendel knew they had lost him the wind rose again wilder than before over it over the deep drumming of pendaran wood darien cried wrong mother you have it all wrong i am not here to choose but to be chosen he gestured toward his forehead do you not see what i wear on my brow do you not recognize it there was another peal of thunder louder than any yet and rain began to fall through it over it dariens voice soared this is the circlet of lisen the light against the darkand it went out when i put it on a sheet of lightning seared the sky west of them then thunder again then darien dont you see the light has turned away and now you have as well choice i have none i am of the dark that extinguishes the light and i know where to go with those words he reclaimed the dagger from the strand before his feet then he was running heedless contemptuous of the ominous drumming in the wood straight into pendaran through the slashing driving rain leaving the six of them exposed on the shore to both the storm which had come and the rawness of their terror jennifer turned the rain was sheeting down brendel had no way to tell if there were tears or raindrops on her face come he said we must go inside it is dangerous out here in this jennifer ignored him the other three women had come up she turned to kim waiting expecting something and it came what in the name of all that is holy have you done the seer of brennin screamed into the gale it was hard to stand upright they were all drenched to the bone i sent him here as a last chance to keep him from starkadh and you drove him straight there all he wanted was comfort jen but it was guinevere who answered colder sterner than the elements comfort have i comfort to give kimberly have you or any of us today now you had no right to send him here and you know it i meant him to be random free to choose and i will not back away from that jaelle what did you think you were doing you were there in the music room at paras derval when i told that to paul i meant everything i said if we bind him or try he is lost to us there was another thing inside her at the very deepest place in her heart but she did not say it it was her own too naked for the telling he is my wild hunt she whispered over and over in her soul my owein my shadow kings my child on iselen all of them she was not blind to the resonances she knew that they killed with joy and without discrimination she knew what they were she also knew since flidais tale on the balcony what they meant she glared at kimberly through the slashing rain daring her to speak again but the seer was silent and in her eyes jennifer saw no more anger or fear only sadness and wisdom and a love she remembered as never varying there was a queer constriction in her throat excuse me the women looked down at the one who had spoken excuse me flidais repeated fighting hard against the surging in his heart straining to keep his voice calm i take it you are the seer of brennin i am kim said i am flidais he said unconscionably quick with even this casually chosen name but he had no patience left he was near now so near he was afraid he would go mad with excitement i should tell you that galadan is very close to this placeminutes away i think jennifer brought her hands to her mouth she had forgotten in the total absorption of the last few minutes but it all came back now the night in the wood and the wolf who had taken her away for maugrim and then had become a man who said she is still to go north if it were not so i might take her for myself just before he gave her to the swan she shuddered she could not help herself she heard flidais say still for some reason addressing kim i can be of aid i believe i think i could divert him from this place if i go fast enough well then go kim exclaimed if hes only a few minutes or flidais went on unable now to keep the rising note from finally reaching his voice i could do nothing as the andain usually do or if i choose i could tell him exactly who just left the glade and who is here i would kill you first brendel burst out his eyes gleaming through the rain a bolt of lightning knifed into the roiling sea there came another peal of thunder you could try flidais said with equanimity you would fail and then galadan could come he paused waiting looking at kim who said slowly all right what is it you want amid the howling of the storm flidais was conscious of a great cresting illumination in his heart tenderly with a delicate ineffable joy he said only one thing a small thing so small only a name the summoning name of the warrior his soul was singing he did a little dance on the wet strand he couldnt help himself it was here it was in his hands no said kimberly his jaw dropped into the soaked mat of his beard no she repeated i swore an oath when he came to me and i will not break it seer jaelle began you must flidais moaned you must tell me it is the only riddle the last one i know all the other answers i would never tell never the weaver and all the gods know i would never tellbut i must know it seer it is the wish of my heart strange fateful phrase crossing the worlds with her kim remembered those words from all the years that had gone by remembered thinking of them again on the mountain plateau with brock unconscious at her side she looked down at the gnomelike andain his hands writhing over and about each other in frantic pleading desperation she remembered arthur in the moment he had answered her summons on glastonbury tor the bowed weight of his shoulders the weariness the stars falling and falling through his eyes she looked at jennifer who was guinevere and who said softly but near enough so as to be heard over the wind and rain give it to him even so is the name handed down it is part of the woven doom broken oaths and grief lie at the heart of it kim im sorry truly it was the apology at the end that reached through to her as much as anything else wordlessly she turned and strode a little way apart she looked back and nodded to the andain stumbling almost falling in his eagerness and haste he trotted to her side she looked down on him not bothering to mask her contempt you will go from here with this name and i charge you with two things to never repeat it to a soul in any world and to deal with galadan now doing whatever must be done to keep him from this tower and to shield the knowledge of darien from him will you do so by every power in fionavar i swear it he said he could scarcely control his voice so as to speak he rose up on tiptoe so as to be nearer to her despite herself she was moved by the helpless longing the yearning in his face childslayer she said and broke her oath he closed his eyes a radiant ecstasy suffused his face ah he moaned transfigured ah he said no more staying thus eyes closed head lifted to the falling rain as if to a benediction then he opened his eyes and fixed her with a level gaze with dignity she hadnt expected so soon after his exaltation he said you hate me now and not without cause but hear me seer i shall do everything i swore to do and more you have freed me from desire when the soul has what it needs it is without longing and so it is with me now from the darkness of what i have done to you there shall be light or i shall die trying to make it so he reached up and took her hand between both of his own do not enter the tower he will know if there are people there endure the rain and wait for me i shall not fail you then he was gone running on stubby bowed legs but fleet and blurred as soon as he entered the forest a power of pendaran moving into his element she turned back to the others waiting west of her farther down the strand they stood gathered together under this fury of the elements something an instinct made her glance down at her hand not at the baelrath which was utterly subdued but at the vellin stone about her wrist and she saw it twisting slowly back and forth there was power here magic in the storm she should have known it from the first rising of the wind but there had been no time to absorb or think about anything but darien from the moment jaelle had brought them here now there was now there was a moment a still space amid the wild fury of the elements she lifted her eyes past the three other women and the lios alfar and looking out to sea she saw the ship running helplessly before the wind into the bay chapter for a long time coll of taerlindel at the helm of his ship had fought the wind tacking desperately and with a certain brilliance across the line of the southwesterly he struggled through most of a darkening day to hold prydwen to a course that would bring them back to the harbor from which they had set out bellowing commands his voice riding over the gale he kept the men of south keep leaping from sail to sail pulling them down adjusting them straining for every inch of eastward motion he could gain against the elements that were forcing him north it was an exercise in seamanship of the highest order of calculations done by instinct and nerve on the deck of a wildly tossing ship of raw strength and raw courage as coll fought with all the power of his corded arms to hold the tiller against the gale that was pulling the ship from his chosen path and this was only wind only the first fine mist of rain the true storm massive and glowering to starboard and behind them was yet to come but it was coming swallowing what was left of the sky they heard thunder saw sheets of lightning ignite in the west felt the screaming wind grow wilder yet were drenched by driving blinding spray as they slid and slipped on the heaving deck struggling to obey colls steadily shouted commands calmly he called out his orders angling his ship with consummate inbred artistry along the troughs and into the crests of the waves gauging the seas on either side casting a frequent eye above him to judge the filling of the sails and the speed of the oncoming storm calmly he did it all though with fierce passionate intensity and not a little pride and calmly when it was clear past doubt that he had no choice coll surrendered over to port he roared in the same voice hed used throughout his pitched battle against the storm northeast it is im sorry diar well have to run with it and take our chances at the other end diarmuid dan ailell heir to the high kingdom of brennin was far too busy grappling with a sail rope in obedience to the command to do much in the way of dealing with the apology beside the prince soaked through and through almost deafened by the scream of the gale paul struggled to be useful and to cope with what he knew with what he had known from the first rising of the wind two hours ago and his first glimpse far down on the southwest horizon of the black line that was a curtain now an enveloping darkness blotting out the sky from the pulsebeat of mórnir within himself the still place like a pool in his blood that marked the presence of the god he knew that what was coming what had come was more than a storm he was pwyll twiceborn marked on the summer tree for power named to it and he knew when power of this magnitude was present manifesting itself mórnir had warned him but could do no more paul knew this was not his storm despite the crashing thunder nor was it liranans the elusive god of the sea it might have been metran with the cauldron of khath meigol but the renegade mage was dead and the cauldron shattered into fragments and this storm far out at sea was not rakoth maugrims in starkadh which meant one thing and one thing only and coll of taerlindel for all his gallant skill hadnt a chance it was not a thing you tell a captain of a ship at sea paul was wise enough to know you let him fight and trusted him to know when he could not fight any longer and after if you survived you could try to heal his pride with the knowledge of what had beaten him if you survived by lisens blood diarmuid cried paul looked up in time to see the sky swallowed quite utterly and the dark green curling wave twice the height of the ship begin to fall hang on the prince screamed again and clutched pauls hastily donned jacket with an iron grip paul threw one arm around diarmuid and looped the other through a rope lashed to the mast gripping with all the strength he had then he closed his eyes the wave fell upon them with the weight of the sea and of doom of destiny not to be delayed or denied diarmuid held him and paul gripped the prince and they both clung to their handholds like children which they were the weavers children the weaver at the loom whose storm this was when he could see again and breathe paul looked up at the tiller through the sluicing rain and spray coll had help there now badly needed help in the muscletearing task of holding the ship to its new course running now with the full speed of the storm dangerously shockingly fast in the raging sea at a speed where the slightest turnbig of the rudder could heel them over like a toy into the waves but arthur pendragon was with coll now balancing him pulling shoulder to shoulder beside the mariner salt spray drenching his greying beard and paul knewthough he could not actually see them from where he crouched in the shadow of the mainmastthat there would be stars falling and falling in the warriors eyes as he was carried toward his foretold fate again by the hand of the weaver who had woven his doom children paul thought both the children they all were helpless on this ship and the children who had died when the warrior was young and so terribly afraid that his bright dream would be destroyed the two images blurred in his mind as the rain and the sea spray blurred together driving them on running before the wind prydwen tore through the seas at a speed no ship should have ever been asked to sustain no sails to endure but the timbers of that ship screaming and creaking with strain yet held and the sails woven with love and care and centuries of handeddown artistry in taerlindel of the mariners caught that howling wind and filled with it and did not tear though the black sky above might shred with lightning and the very sea rock with the thunder riding the mad crest of that speed the two men at the tiller fought to hold their course their bodies taut with the brutal strain and then with no surprise at all only a dulled hurting sense of inevitability paul saw lancelot du lac grapple his way to their side and so at the last it was the three of them coll conning his ship with lancelot and arthur at either side their feet braced wide on the slippery deck gripping the tiller together in flawless necessary harmony guiding that small gallant muchenduring ship into the bay of the anor lisen and helpless to do so much as veer a single point off the wind onto the jagged teeth of the rocks that guarded the southern entrance to that bay paul never knew afterward whether they had been meant to survive arthur and lancelot had to he knew else there would have been no point to the storm that carried them here but the rest of them were expendable however bitter the thought might be in the unfolding of this tale he never knew either exactly what it was that warned him they were moving so fast through the darkness and the pelting blinding sheets of rain that none of them had even seen the shore let alone the rocks reaching back trying to relive the moment afterward he thought it might have been his ravens that spoke but chaos reigned on prydwen in that moment and he could never be sure what he knew was that in the fraction of splintered tune before prydwen splintered forever into fragments and spars he had risen to his feet unnaturally surefooted in the unnatural storm and had cried out in a voice that encompassed the thunder and contained it that was of it and within itexactly as he had been of and within the summer tree on the night he thought hed diedand in that voice the voice of mórnir who had sent him back he cried liranan just as they struck the masts cracked with the sound of broken trees the sides cracked and the deck the bottom of the ship was gouged mercilessly utterly and the dark sea blasted in paul was catapulted a leaf a twig a meaningless thing from the deck of the suddenly grounded ship they all hurtled over the sides every man of what had been a moment before coils grandfathers beloved prydwen and as paul flew a split second in the air another fraction of scintillated time tasting his second death knowing the rocks were there and the boiling enraged annihilating sea even in that instant he heard a voice in his mind clear and remembered and liranan spoke to him and said i will pay for this and pay and be made to pay again before the weaving of time is done but i owe you brotherthe sea stars are shining in a certain place again because you bound me to your aid this is not binding this is a gift remember me and then paul cartwheeled helplessly into the waters of the bay the calm unruffled bluegreen waters of the bay away from the jagged killing rocks out of the murderous wind and under a mild rain that fell gently down bereft of the gale that had given it its cutting edge just beyond the curve of the bay the storm raged yet the lightning still slashed from the purpled clouds where he was where all of them were rain fell softly from an overcast summer sky as they swam singly in pairs in clusters to the strand of beach under the shadow of lisens tower where guinevere stood it was a miracle kim realized but she also realized too much more for her tears to be shed only for relief and joy too dense this weaving too laden with shadings and textures and a myriad of intermingled threads both warp and weft for any emotion to be truly unmixed they had seen the ship cannon toward the rocks then even in that moment of realization and terror they had heard a single imperative crash of sound halfway between thunder and a voice and on the instantabsolutely on the instantthe wind had cut out completely and the waters of the bay had gone glassily calm the men who manned prydwen were spilled over the disintegrating sides of the ship into a bay that would have destroyed them not two seconds before a miracle there might be time enough later to search for the source of it and give thanks but not yet not now in this tangled sorrowstrewn unfolding of a long destiny for there were three of them after all and kim could do nothing nothing at all to stop the hurting in her heart a man stepped from the sea who had not been on prydwen when she sailed a man who was very tall his hair dark and his eyes as well there was a long sword at his side and beside him came cavall the grey dog and in his arms held carefully out before him the man carried the body of arthur pendragon and all five people on the beach waiting knew who this man was four of them stayed a little way behind though kim knew how every instinct in sharras soul was driving her to the sea where diarmuid was even now emerging helping one of his men out of the water she fought that instinct though and kim honored her for it standing between sharra and jaelle with brendel a pace to the side and behind she watched as jennifer moved forward through the gentle rain to stand before the two men she had loved and been loved by through so many lives in so many worlds guinevere was remembering a moment on the balcony of the tower earlier that afternoon when flidais had spoken of randomness as the variable the weaver had woven into his tapestry for a limitation on himself she was remembering as if from a place infinitely far away the explosion of hope in her mind that this time might be different because of that because lancelot was not here no third angle of the triangle and so the weavers design might yet be changed because the weaver himself had made a space in the tapestry for change no one knew of that thought and no one ever would it was buried now and smashed and gone what was here in its stead was lancelot du lac whose soul was the other half of her own whose eyes were as dark as they had been every single time before as undemanding as understanding with the same pain buried in their depths that only she could comprehend only she assuage whose hands whose long graceful fighters hands were exactly as they had been the last time and the time before every hurting time before when she had loved them and loved him as the mirror of herself whose hands cradled now gently with infinite unmistakable tenderness the body of his liege lord her husband whom she loved whom she loved in the teeth of all the lies all the crabbed envious incomprehension with a full and a shattering passion that had survived and would survive and would tear her asunder every time she woke again to who she had been and was fated to be to the memory and the knowledge of betrayal like a stone at the center of everything the grief at the heart of a dream the reason why she was here and lancelot the price the curse the punishment laid by the weaver on the warrior in the name of the children who had died she and lancelot faced each other in silence on the strand in a space that seemed to the watchers to have somehow been cut out from the ebb and flow of time an island in the tapestry she stood before the two men she loved bareheaded in the falling rain and she had memories of so many things her eyes went back again to his hands and she remembered when he had gone madtruly so for a timefor desire of her and the denial within himself of that desire how he had gone forth from camelot into the woods and wandered there through the turning of the seasons naked even in the wintertime alone and wild stripped to the very bone by longing and she remembered those hands when he was finally brought back the scars cuts scabs the calluses and broken nails the frostbite from scrabbling in the snow for berries underneath arthur had wept she remembered she had not not then not until later when she was alone it had hurt so much she had thought that death would be better than that sight and as much as any other single thing it had been those hands the palpable evidence of what love of her was doing to him that had opened her own barricades and let him in to the hearthside of her heart and the welcome so long denied how could it be a betrayal of anyone or anything to offer shelter to such a one and to let the mirror be made whole that its reflection of the fire might show both of them beside it still she was silent in the rain and he and nothing of this showed in her face even so he knew her thoughts and she knew that he did motionless wordlessly they touched after so long and yet did not touch his hands clean now unscarred slender and beautiful held arthur in a clasp of love that spoke so deeply to her that she heard it as a chorus in her heart high voices in a vaulted place singing of joy and pain and in that moment she recalled something else and this he could not know though his dark eyes might darken further looking into hers she suddenly remembered the last time she had seen his face not in camelot or any of the other lives the other worlds where they had been brought back to the working of arthurs doom but in starkadh a little more than a year ago when rakoth maugrim breaking her for the pleasure it afforded him had ransacked the effortlessly opened chambers of her memories and come out with an image she had not recognized an image of the man who stood before her now and now she understood she saw again the moment when the dark god had taken this shape in mockery in a defiling an attempt to stain and soil her knowledge of love to besmirch the memory sear it from her with the blood that fell from the black stump of his lost hand burning her and standing here by the anor as the clouds began to break up in the west with the passing of the storm as the first rays of the setting sun sliced through low down over the sea she knew that rakoth had failed better he had not failed a part of her was thinking ironic detached better he had scorched this love from her made a kind of good from the abyss of his evil freed her from lancelot that the endless betrayal might have an end but he had not she had only loved two men in all her life the two most shining men in any world and she loved them yet she was aware of the changing light amber shades of gold sunset after storm the rain had ended a square of sky appeared overhead blue toning downward toward the muted color of dusk she heard the surge of the surf and the withdrawal of it along the sand and stones she held herself straight as she could quite still she had a sense that to move just then would be to break and she could not break he is all right lancelot said what is a voice she thought what is a voice that it can do this to us firelight a mirror made whole a dream shown broken in that mirror the texture of a soul in four words four words not about her or himself not of greeting or desire four quiet words about the man he carried and so about the man he was himself if she moved it would be to break she said i know the weaver had not brought him to this place to her to have him die in a storm at sea too easy that by far he stayed at the tiller too long lancelot said he cracked his head when we hit cavall led me to him in the water as quietly as that he said it no bravado no hint of drama or achievement and then after a pause even in that storm he was trying to steer for a gap in the rocks over and over she was thinking how many ways were there for a story to circle back upon itself he was always looking for gaps in the rocks she murmured she said nothing else it was difficult to speak she looked into his eyes and waited there was light now clouds breaking apart clear sky and suddenly the track of the sunset along the sea and then the setting sun below the western clouds she waited knowing what he would say what she would say in response he said shall i go away yes she said she did not move a bird sang behind her in the trees at the edge of the strand then another bird sang the surf came in and withdrew and then it came in again he said where shall i go and now she had to hurt him very badly because he loved her and had not been here to save her when it happened she said you will know of rakoth maugrim they will have told you on the ship he took me a year ago to the place of his power he did things to me she stopped not for herself it was an old pain now and arthur had taken much of it away but she had to stop because of what was in his face then after a moment she went on carefully because she could not break not now she said i was to die after i was saved though and in time i bore his child again she was forced to pause she closed her eyes so as not to see his face no one else she knew and nothing else did this to him but she did it every time she heard him kneel not trusting his hands any longer and lay arthur gently down on the sand she said eyes still closed i wanted to have the child there are reasons words will not reach his name is darien and he was here not long ago and went away because i made him go away they do not understand why i did this why i did not try to bind him she paused again and took a breath i think i understand said lancelot only that which was so much she opened her eyes he was on his knees before her arthur lying between the two of them the sun and its track along the sea behind both men red and gold and very beautiful she did not move she said he went into this wood it is a place of ancient power and of hate and before he went he burnt a tree with his own power which comes from his father i would she faltered he had only just now come and was here before her and she faltered at the words that would send him away there was silence but not for very long lancelot said i understand i will guard him and not bind him and leave him to choose his road she swallowed and fought back her tears what was a voice a doorway with nuances of light intimations of shade a doorway to a soul it is a dark road she said speaking more truth than she knew he smiled so unexpectedly that it stopped her heart for a beat he smiled up at her and then rose and so smiled down upon her tenderly gravely with a sure strength whose only place of vulnerability was herself and he said all the roads are dark guinevere only at the end is there a hope of light the smile faded fare gently love he turned with the last words his hand moving automatically unconsciously to check the hang of the sword at his side panic rose within her a blind surge lancelot she said she had not spoken his name before that he stopped and turned two separate actions slowed by a weight of pain he looked at her slowly sharing the weight with very great care she held out one hand to him and as slowly his eyes on hers and naming her name over and over in their depths he walked back and took her hand and brought it to his lips then in her turn not speaking not daring to speak or able she took the hand in which he held her own and laid the back of it against her cheek so that one tear fell upon it then she kissed that tear away and watched him go past all the silent people who parted to make way for him as he walked from her into pendaran wood once a long time ago he had met green ceinwen by chance in a glade of the wood by moonlight cautiously for it always paid to be cautious with the huntress flidais had entered the glade and saluted her she had been sitting on the trunk of a fallen tree her long legs outstretched her bow laid down a dead boar lying beside her with an arrow in its throat there was a small pool in the glade and from it the moonlight was reflected back into her face the stories of her cruelty and capriciousness were legion and he knew all of them had started many of the tales himself so it was with extreme diffidence that he approached grateful that she had not been bathing in the pool knowing he would very likely have died had he seen her so she had been in a mood of catlike languor that night though having just killed and she greeted him with amusement stretching her supple body making room for him beside her on the fallen trunk they had spoken for a time softly as befitted the place and the moonlight and it had pleasured her to tease him with stirred desire though it was gently done and not with malice that night then as the moon made ready to pass over into the trees west of them and so be lost to that glade green ceinwen had said lazily but with a different more meaningful tone than hitherto flidais little forest one do you not ever wonder what will happen to you if you ever do learn the name you seek how so goddess he remembered asking his nerves bared suddenly by this merest most idle mention of his long desire will your soul not lie bereft and purposeless should that day come what will you do having gained the last and only thing you covet with your thirst slaked will you not be stripped of all joy in life all reason to live consider it little one give it thought the moon had gone then and the goddess too though not before stroking his face and body with her long fingers leaving him rampant with desire by the dark pool she was capricious and cruel elusive and very dangerous but she was also a goddess and not the least wise of them he sat in the grove a long time thinking about what she said and he had thought about it often in the years that followed and only now now that it had happened could he draw breath after breath that tasted of joy and realize that she had been wrong it might have been otherwise he knew gaining his hearts desire might indeed have been a blight not this transcendent brightness in his life but it had fallen out differently his dream had been made real the gapped worlds made whole and along with joy flidais of the andain now finally knew peace it had come at the price of a broken oath he knew he had some fleeting distant sense of regret that this had been demanded but it scarcely even ruffled the deep waters of his contentment and in any case he had balanced those scales with an oath of his own to the seer one that he would keep she would see however bitter her contempt for him now she would have cause to change before the story spun to its close for the first time one of the andain would lend himself freely to the cause of the mortals and their war starting now he thought with the one who was his lord he is here the lone deiena in the tree above him whispered urgently and flidais barely had time to register the sudden easing of the rain and the passing of the thunder and to fling the swift mental call hed decided upon before there came a sound of something crashing through the trees and the wolf had come and then a moment later galadan was there instead flidais felt light he had an illusion that he could fly if he wanted to that he was only tied to the forest floor by the thinnest threads of constraint but he had cause to know how dangerous the figure standing before him was and he had a task to perform now a deception to perpetrate on one who had been known for a long time as the subtlest mind in fionavar and who was also the lieutenant of rakoth maugrim so flidais schooled his features as best he could and he bowed gravely and low to the one who had only once been challenged in his claim of lordship over the elusive estranged arrogant family of the andain only onceand flidais remembered very well how liranans son and machas daughter had both died not far from here by the cliffs of rhudh what are you doing here said galadan in his mind straightening flidais saw that the wolflord looked lean and deadly his features tight with anger and unease flidais clasped his hands loosely together in front of his rounded belly i am always here he said mildly speaking aloud he winced as a sudden knife of pain slashed into his mind before speaking again he put up his mental barricades not displeased for galadan had just given him an excuse why did you do that he asked plaintively he felt the quick probe bounce away from his barriers galadan could kill him with disturbing ease but the wolflord could not see into his mind unless flidais chose to let him in and that at the moment was what mattered do not be too clever forest one not with me why are you speaking aloud and who was in the anor answer quickly i have little time and less patience the mind voice was cold and arrogantly confident but flidais had knowledge of his own and memories he knew that the wolflord was feeling the strain of being near to the towerwhich made him more not less of a danger if it came to that half an hour ago he would never have done it never have dreamt of doing it but everything had changed since he had learned the name and so flidais said still carefully aloud how dare you probe me galadan i care nothing for your war but a great deal for my own secrets and will certainly not open my mind to you when you come to mein pendaran if you pleasein this fashion and with such a tone will you kill me for my riddles wolflord you hurt me just now he thought he had the tone right grievance and pride in equal measure but it was hard to tell very hard given the one with whom he was dealing then he drew a quiet satisfied breath for when the wolflord addressed him again it was aloud and with the courtly grace that had always been a part of him forgive me he murmured and bowed in his turn with unconscious elegance i have been two days running to get here and am not myself his scarred features relaxed into a smile whoever that is i sensed someone in the anor and wanted to know who there was some hesitation at the end and this too flidais understood in the cold rational utterly clinical soul that was galadans the blinding passion that still assailed him in connection with lisen was brutally anomalous and the memory of his rejection in favor of amairgen would be a wound scraped raw every time he neared this place from the new harbor of peace where his soul was moored flidais looked at the other figure and pitied him he kept that out of his eyes though having no pressing desire to be slain he also had an oath to keep so he said reaching for the right tone of casual appeasement im sorry i should have known you would sense it i would have tried to send word i was in the anor myself galadan i am just now leaving it you why flidais shrugged expressively symmetry my own sense of time patterns on the loom you know they sailed from taerlindel some days ago for cader sedat i thought someone should be in the anor in case they returned this way the rain had stopped though the leaves overhead were still dripping the trees grew too thickly to show much of the clearing sky flidais waited to see if his bait would be taken and he guarded his mind i did not know that galadan admitted a furrow creasing his brow it is news and it matters i think i will have to take it north i thank you he said with much of the old calculation in his voice again careful very careful not to smile flidais nodded who sailed the wolflord asked flidais made his expression as stern as he could you should not have hurt me he said if you were going to ask questions galadan laughed aloud the sound rang through the great wood ah flidais is there anyone like you he queried rhetorically still chuckling there is no one with the headache i have flidais replied not smiling i apologized galadan said sobering quickly his voice suddenly silken and low i will not do so twice he let the silence hold for a moment then repeated who sailed forest one after a brief pause to show a necessary flicker of independence flidais said the mage and the dwarf the prince of brennin the one called pwyll from the tree an expression he could not read flashed briefly across galadans aristocratic fece and the warrior he concluded galadan was silent a moment deep in thought interesting he said at length i am suddenly glad i came forest one all of this matters i wonder if they killed metran what he asked swiftly do you think of the storm that just passed off balance flidais nonetheless managed to smile exactly what you think he murmured and if a storm has driven the warrior to land somewhere i for one am going to look for him again galadan laughed more softly than before of course he said of course the name do you expect him to tell you himself flidais could feel a bright color suffuse his face which was all right let the wolflord think he was embarrassed stranger things have happened he said stoutly have i your leave to go not yet what did you do in the anor a flicker of unease rippled through the forest andain it was all very well to have successfully dissembled with galadan so far but one didnt want to push ones fortune by lingering too long i cleaned it he said with an edgy impatience he did not have to feign the glass and the floors i rolled back the windows to let air in and i watched for two days to see if the ship would come then with the storm i knew it had been driven to land and since it was not here galadans eyes were cold and grey and fixed downward on his own were there not flowers he whispered and menace was suddenly a vivid rustling presence where they stood feigning nothing at all his heart racing mouth suddenly dry flidais said there were my lord they crumbled from age when i was dusting the room i can get more for you would you desire me to he got no further faster than eye could follow or most cunning mind anticipate the figure in front of him melted away and in its stead a wolf was there a wolf that leaped even in the instant it appeared with one swift precisely calculated motion a huge paw raked the forest andains head flidais never even moved he was cunning and wise and surprisingly swift within his wood but galadan was what he was and so an instant later the little bearded andain lay writhing in genuine agony on the sodden forest floor holding both hands to the bloodied place where his right ear had been ripped away live a while longer forest one he heard through the miasma of pain flowing over him and name me merciful in your innermost heart you touched the flowers i laid in that place for her the voice said benign reflective elegant could you really expect to have been allowed to live fighting to hold consciousness flidais heard within his reeling mind another voice then that sounded near and very far away at one and the same time and the voice said oh my son what have you become wiping away blood flidais managed to open his eyes the forest rocked wildly in his vision then righted itself and through the curtain of blood and pain he saw the tall naked commanding figure and the great horns of cernan of the beasts whom he had called to this place just before galadan came with a snarl of rage mingled with another thing the wolflord turned to his father a moment later galadan was in his human shape again elegant as ever you lost the right to ask me that a long time ago he said he spoke aloud to his father a part of flidais noted even as he himself had spoken aloud to galadan to deny him access to his thoughts majestic and terrible in his nakedness and power the god of the forests came forward speaking aloud his voice reverberating cernan said because i would not kill the mage for you i will not make answer to that again my son but will ask you once more in this wood where i fathered you how have you so lost yourself that you can do this thing to your own brother flidais closed his eyes he felt consciousness slipping away ripple by ripple like a withdrawing sea but before he went out with the tide he heard galadan laugh again in mockery and say to his father to their father why should it signify anything to me that this fat drudge of the forest is another byblow of your profligate seed sons and their fathers he snarled halfway to the wolf he could so easily become why should any of that matter now oh but it does flidais thought with his last shred of consciousness oh but it matters so much if only you knew brother he sent it out to neither of the others that thought closely to himself he clutched his memory of the torched tree and darien with the circlet of lisen on his brow then flidais having kept his oath having found his hearts desire was hit by another surge of pain and knew nothing more at all of what his father said to his brother in the wood in the east at celidon the sun was low in a sky unmarred by clouds or the hint of any storm as the army of brennin came at last to the midplain galloping beside niavin duke of seresh at the front of the host teyrnon the mage weary to the bone after three days of riding nonetheless managed to pull his chunky body erect in the saddle at his first glimpse of the standing stones beside him his source chuckled softly and murmured i was about to suggest you do that teyrnon glanced over amused at barak the tall handsome boyhood friend who was the source of his power and his goodnatured face slipped easily into a selfdeprecating grin ive lost more weight on this ride than i care to think about the mage said slapping his stillcomfortable girth do you good said niavin of seresh on the other side how teyrnon replied indignantly over baraks laughter can a complete scrambling of my bones possibly do me good im afraid if i try to scratch my nose ill end up rubbing my knee instead if you know what i mean niavin snorted then gave way to laughter of his own it was hard to stay grim and warlike in the company of the genial unprepossessing mage on the other hand he had known teyrnon and barak since they were children in seresh in the early days of ailells reign when niavins own father was the newly appointed duke of seresh and he had little concern about their capabilities they would be very serious indeed when the time called for it and the time it seemed was upon them now riding toward them from between the massive stones were three figures niavin raised a hand unnecessarily to point for the mages benefit i see them said teyrnon quickly niavin glanced over sharply but the other mans face had lost its open ingenuousness and was unreadable it was probably just as well that niavin could not discern the mages thoughts they would have worried him deeply as deeply as teyrnon himself was troubled by selfdoubts and diffidence and by one other thing formally the two of them greeted aileron the high king and formally they returned to him the command of his army in the presence of his two companions ratenniel of the lios alfar and the aven of the plain who had ridden out to greet the host of brennin as formally aileron returned their salutations then with the brusque efficiency of the war king he was he asked teyrnon have you been contacted mage slowly teyrnon shook his round head he had expected die question i have reached out my lord high king nothing from loren at all there is something else though he hesitated then went on a storm aileron out at sea we found it while we were reaching a southwest gale bringing a storm that should not happen ratenniel said quickly aileron nodded not speaking his bearded features grim southwest will not be maugrim ivor murmured you have seen nothing of the ship he asked teyrnon i am not a seer the mage explained patiently i can sense to some degree an assertion of magic such as this storm and i can reach out to another mage across a fair distance if the ship had returned i would have found or been reached by loren before now and so aileron said heavily it has not returned or else silvercloak has not returned with it his dark eyes met those of teyrnon for a long moment as a lateafternoon breeze stirred the grasses of the plain all around them no one else spoke they waited for the high king still looking at teyrnon aileron said we cannot wait we will push north toward gwynir now not in the morning as planned we have at least three hours of light by which to ride swiftly he explained to niavin and the mage what had happened in the battle two nights before we have been handed an advantage he said grimly one not of our own doing but by virtue of oweins sword and ceinwens intercession we must turn that advantage to good effect while the army of maugrim is disorganized and fearful weaver knows what i would give to have loren and the seer with us now but we cannot wait teyrnon of seresh will you act as my first mage in the battles that lie before us he had never been so ambitious never aimed half so high it had been derided as a flaw when he was younger then gradually accepted and indulged as the years passed teyrnon was what he was everyone said and smiled as they said it he was clever and reliable very often he had useful insights into matters of concern but the paunchy easysmiling mage had never been seenor seen himself for that matteras being of real importance in any scheme of things even in time of peace metran and loren were the mages who mattered hed been content to let that be the case hed had his books and his studies which mattered a great deal hed had the comfort of the mages quarters in the capital servants good food and drink companionship hed enjoyed the privileges of rank the satisfactions of his power and indeed the prestige that went with both not a few ladies of ailells court had found their way to his bedroom or invited him to their own scented chambers when they would have scorned to look twice at a chubby scholar from seresh hed taken his duties as a mage seriously for all his genial good nature he and barak had performed their peacetime tasks quietly and without fuss and had served unobtrusively as buffers between the other two members of the council of the mages he hadnt begrudged that either had he been asked in the last years of ailells reign before the drought had come he would have numbered his own thread on the loom as one of those that shone most brightly with the glow of the weavers benevolence but the drought had come and rangat had flamed and metran whod had wisdom once as well as cleverness had proven himself a traitor so now they found themselves at war against the unleashed power of rakoth maugrim and suddenly he teyrnon was acting first mage to the high king of brennin he was also or so the nagging unspoken premonition at the remotest turning of his mind had been telling him since yesterday morning the only mage in fionavar since yesterday morning when the cauldron of khath meigol had been destroyed he knew nothing specific about that nothing about any of the consequences of that destruction only this distant premonition so vague and terrifying he refused to speak of it or give it a tangible name in his mind what he felt though was lonely the sun had gone down the rain had stopped and the clouds were scudding away to the north and east the sky in the west still held to its last hues of sunset shading but on the beach by the anor lisen it was growing dark as loren silvercloak finished telling the truth that had to be told when he was done when his quiet sorrowful voice had come to an end those gathered on the beach listened as brendel of the lios alfar wept for the souls of his people slain as they sailed to their song sitting on the sand with arthurs head cradled in her lap jennifer saw diarmuid his expressive features twisted with pain turn away from the kneeling figure of the lios and enfold sharra of cathal in his arms not with passion or desire but in an unexpectedly vulnerable seeking of comfort there were tears on her own cheeks they kept falling even as she wiped them away grieving for her friend and his people then looking down she saw that arthur was awake and was gazing back at her and suddenly she saw herself reflected in his eyes a single star very bright fell across her reflection as she watched slowly he raised a hand and touched the cheek where lancelots hand had lain welcome home my love she said listening to the brokenhearted grief of the lios alfar who had guided her to this place hearing all the while within her mind the patient inexorable shuttling of the loom i have sent him away she said feeling the words as warp to the weft of the storm that had passed the story playing itself out again crossings and recrossings arthur closed his eyes why he asked only shaping the word not quite a sound for the same reason you brought him back she answered and then as he looked up at her again she hurt him as she had hurt lancelot to do it and have it over and done because he too had a right to know so guinevere who had been childless in camelot told arthur about darien as the western sky gave up its light and the first stars came out overhead when she was done brendels quiet weeping came also to an end there was a star in the west low down over the sea brighter than all the others in the sky and the company on the beach watched as the lios alfar rose to his feet and faced that star for a long time he stood silent then he raised both hands and spread them wide before lifting his voice in the invocation of song rough at first with the burden of his grief but growing more crystalline with each word each offering nabrendel of the kestrel mark of daniloth took the leaden weight of his sorrow and alchemized it into the achingly beautiful tuneless notes of ratermaines lament for the lost sung as it had never been sung in a thousand years not even by the one who had created it and so on that strand at the edge of the sea under all the shining stars he made a silver shining thing of his own out of what evil had done to the children of light alone of those on the beach below the anor kimberly took no comfort no easing of pain from the clear distillation of the lament that brendel sang she heard the beauty of it understood and was humbled by the grandeur of what the lios alfar was doing and she knew the power such music had to healshe could see it working in the faces of those beside her even in jennifer in arthur in stern cold jaelle as they listened to brendels soul in his voice lifted to the watching wheeling stars to the dark forest and the wide sea but she was too far gone in guilt and selflaceration for any of that easing to reach through to her was everything she touched every single thing that came within the glowering ambit of the ring she bore to be twisted and torn by her presence she was a healer herself in her own world was she to carry nothing at all but pain to those she loved to those who needed her nothing but sorrow from the summoning of tabor and the corruption of the paraiko last night to her brutal mishandling of darien this morning and then again this eveningwhen she hadnt even arrived in time to warn jennifer of what was coming and then most bitterly of all the breaking of the oath she had sworn on glastonbury tor was the warriors portion of grief not great enough she asked herself savagely that shed had to add to it by bandying about the terrible name he was cursed to answer to no matter she swore lashing herself that guinevere had said what she had said giving dispensation no matter how desperately theyd needed flidais to aid them to hold the secret of darien they would not have needed that aid or anything at all from him had she not presumed to send darien to this place she pushed her wet hair back from her eyes she looked she knew like a halfdrowned water rat she could feel the single vertical crease in her forehead it might she thought derisively fool someone into thinking she was wise and experienced that and her white hair well she decided trembling if anyone was still fooled after tonight it was their own lookout a last long wavering note rose up and then faded away as brendels song came to an end he lowered his arms and stood silent on the strand kim looked over at jennifer sitting on the wet sand with arthurs head cradled in her lap and saw her friend who was so much more than that motion for her to come over she took an unsteady breath and walked across the sand to kneel beside them how is he she asked quietly he is fine arthur replied himself fixing her with that gaze that seemed to have no ending and to be filled so much of the time with stars i have just paid a fairly mild price for being a toostubborn helmsman he smiled at her and she had to smile back guinevere has told me what you had to do she says she gave you leave and explained why but that you will still be hating yourself is this true kim shifted her glance and saw the ghost of a smile tracing the edges of jennifers mouth she swallowed she knows me pretty well she said ruefully and me he answered calmly she knows me very well and the dispensation she gave you was also mine the one you know as flidais was taliesin oncewe both knew him a very long time ago he is clearly part of the story though i am not certain how seer do not despair of brightness flowering from what you had to do there was so much comfort in his voice in the calm accepting eyes in the face of this it would be hubris mere vanity to hold to her selfcondemnation she said diffidently he said it was his hearts desire the last riddle he did not know he said he said he would make light from the darkness of what he had done or die trying to do so there was a little silence as the other two absorbed this kim listened to the surf coming in so gentle now after the wildness of the storm then they sensed rather than heard someone approaching and the three of them glanced up at brendel he seemed more ethereal than ever in the starlight less tied to the earth to the pull of gravity in the dark they could not see the color of his eyes but they were not shining he said in a voice like the whisper of the breeze my lady guinevere with your permission i must leave you now for a time it is it is now my task over and above all else i am afraid to carry the tidings i have just heard to my king in daniloth jennifer opened her mouth to reply but another voice made answer to the lios alfar he is not there said jaelle from behind them her hard voice usually so imperious was muted now more mild than kim had thought it could be there was a battle two nights ago by the banks of the adein near celidon the dalrei and the men of rhoden met an army of the dark and ratenniel led the lios alfar out of the shadow land nabrendel he led them to war on the plain and it was loren silvercloak kimberly listened as jaelle stripped of her usual arrogance told the tale of how leila had heard the blowing of oweins horn and seen the battlefield through finns presence there and then how all of them in the temple had heard ceinwen intercede the high king rode north in response to the summonglass the night prydwen set sail she concluded they will all be on the plain by now though what they will do i know not perhaps loren can reach for teyrnon and answer that for us it was the first time kim could remember that high priestess speaking so to the mage then a moment later she learned that loren wasnt a mage any longer and even as the tale was being told the ring on her finger began to glow with returning life she looked down upon it fighting hard against the nowinstinctive aversion she felt and within her mind as loren and then diarmuid spoke of cader sedat an image began to coalesce it was an image she remembered the first vision shed ever had in fionavar on the path to ysannes lake a vision of another lake high among mountains with eagles flying over it loren said quietly the circles it seems have been made complete it is now my task to go with matt to banir lok to help him regain the crown that he never truly lost so that the dwarves may be brought back from the edge of the dark we have a long way to go matt sören said and not a great deal of time we will have to set out tonight he sounded exactly as he always had kim had a sense that nothing absolutely nothing would ever make him other than he was the rock upon which all of them it seemed had rested at one time or another she looked at jen and saw the same thought in her face then she looked down at the baelrath again and said you will not get there in time even now even after so much had happened it was with a deep humility that she registered the instant silence that descended over those gathered there when the seer within her spoke when she looked up it was to meet the single eye of matt sören i must try he said simply i know she replied and loren is right as well i think it does matter somehow that you try but i can tell you you will not get there in time from this place what are you saying it was diarmuid who asked his voice stripped of nuance as jaelles had been pared clean to the simple question kim held up her hand so they could all see the flame im saying ill have to go there too that the baelrath will have to take us there and i think all of us know by now that the warstone is a mixed blessing at the very best she tried hard to keep the bitterness from her voice she almost succeeded too but in the stillness that followed someone asked kim what happened in the mountains she turned to paul schafer who had asked the question who always seemed to ask the questions that went below the surface she looked at him and then at loren beside paul gazing at her with the mix of gentleness and strength that she remembered from the beginning and then most vividly from the night theyd shared in the temple before kevin had died before she went to khath meigol so it was to the two of them so different yet so much alike in some inexplicable way that she told the story of the rescue of the paraiko and what had followed everyone heard everyone had to know but it was to loren and paul that she spoke and it was to matt that she turned at the end to repeat and so you see what i mean whatever blessing i carry will not be unmixed for a moment he looked at her as if considering the point then his expression changed she saw his mouth move in the grimace that she knew to be his smile and heard him say wryly no blade i have ever known to be worth anything at all has had only a single edge that was all but she knew those quiet words were all the reassurance she had any right to seek inclination matched training in the high priestess of dana and so jaelle cold in the falling rain chilled by what had happened with darien and what was happening now since the shipwreck showed nothing at all of her apprehension to anyone on the strand she knew being what she was that it had been the voice of mórnir that had thundered to still the waves and so her gaze was on pwyll first of all of them when he came ashore she remembered him standing on another beach far to the south speaking with liranan in a perilous light that came not from the moon he was alive though and had come back she supposed she was pleased about that they had all come back it seemed and there was someone new with them and it was not hard to tell from jennifers face who this was she had made herself cold and hard but she was not stone however she might try to be pity and wonder had moved her equally to see guinevere and lancelot stand together in the rain as the setting sun slanted through disappearing clouds low in the west she had not heard what they said to each other but the language of gesture was plain and at the end when the man walked away alone into the wood jaelle found herself unexpectedly grieved she watched him go knowing the history not finding it hard at all to guess what distancing quest guinevere had now imposed upon her second love what was hard was to preserve her own necessary image of detachmentin the presence of so many men and in the turbulent wake of what had happened in the temple before she had taken kim and sharra away with blood and the earthroot tapped she had needed the mormae in gwen ystrat to wield such a potent magic and that meant dealing with audiart which was never pleasant most of the time she could manage it without real trouble but that afternoons exchange was different she had been on dubious ground and shed known it and so had audiart it was beyond the irregular bordering on a real transgression for the high priestess to be leaving the templeand the kingdomeven at a time like this it was her sacred duty audiart reminded her along the mindlink the mormae shared to remain in the sanctuary ready and able to deal with the needs of the mother furthermore her secondincommand did not scruple to point out had not the high king charged her to remain in paras derval and govern the country with the chancellor was it not her further duty to exploit this unexpected opportunity as best she could in the service of their unwavering quest for danas return to primacy in the high kingdom all of this unfortunately was true in response all she could really do was pull rank and not for the first time not actually dissembling she had drawn upon the unease and restlessness shed been feeling in the temple and told the mormae without amplification that it was her judgment as high priestess that for her to leave at this time was according to the will of danasuperseding any traditions or opportunities for gain there was also she had sent along the mindlink a very real urgencywhich was true as she had seen from kims white face and clenched hands as she waited tensely with sharra under the dome oblivious to the closed exchange of the priestesses she had made that sending whitehot with her anger and she was still stronger than any of the others very well audiart had replied if you must do this you must i will leave for paras derval immediately to act as best i can in your absence this was when the real clash had come making what had gone before seem like a minor skirmish in a childrens game no shed sent back absolute firmness masking her inner anxiety it is my command and so danas that you stay where you are it is only a week since the sacrifice of liadon and the rites of response are not complete are you mad audiart had replied more nakedly rebellious than ever before which of those chattering idiots those insipid nonentities do you propose to have act in your stead in a time of war a mistake audiart always let her contempt and ambition show through too clearly sensing the response of the mormae jaelle drew a breath of relief she was going to get away with it every established pattern of precedent would have demanded that the second of the mother come to paras derval to take charge in her absence had audiart said so quietly with even the most cursorily assumed humility jaelle might have lost this battle as it was she sprang to the attack would you like to be cursed and cast out second of dana she sent with the silken clarity she alone could command over the mindlink she felt the mormaes collectively indrawn breath at the unveiled threat dare you speak so to your high priestess dare you so denigrate your sisters have a care audiart lest you lose everything your scheming has won you thus far strong words almost too strong but shed needed to throw them all off balance for what she had to say next i have chosen my surrogate and the chancellor has been informed on behalf of the high king i have this afternoon named the newest member of the mormae and she stands beside me robed in red and opened now to the mindlink greetings sisters of the mother leila sent on cue and even jaelle half prepared for it had been stunned by the vividness of her words on the strand beneath the anor lisen as the rain slowly came to an end and the sunset tinted the western sky jaelle was remembering that vividness it offered a confirmation of sorts for her own instinctive actions and had served to still quite effectively whatever opposition to her peremptory behavior might have been mounted in gwen ystrat even so there was something profoundly unsettling about the mixture of child and woman in leila and her link to the wild hunt dana had not yet chosen to reveal to her high priestess any indication of what all this might mean the voice of loren silvercloak the mage she had hated and feared all her life brought her fully back to the strand she heard him reveal what had happened to him and the triumph she might once have felt at such a revelation of weakness was quite lost in a wave of fear they had need of silvercloaks power and they were not going to have it shed hoped he might be able to send her home so far from the temple she had no magic of her own no way to get back by herselfand it now appeared no one to help her she saw the baelrath come to life on the seers hand then she heard where kim was going with that power she listened to pwylls questionhis first words spoken since prydwen had run aground and theyd come ashore she wondered about him how one who could speak with the thundered voice of the god could be so quiet and selfcontained and then surface when his presence had almost been forgotten with words that cut through to the heart of what was happening she was she realized a little afraid of him and her attempts to channel that fear into hatred or contempt were not really working once more she forced her mind back to the beach it was growing darker by the minute in the shadows diarmuids fair hair was still bright catching the last color of the western sky it was the prince who spoke now very well he said it seems that what we have been told is all we are going to learn let us be grateful to our charming priestess for such information as we do have now loren cant reach teyrnon anymore kim i gather has had a vision of calor diman but nothing of the armies and jaelle has exhausted her store of useful tidings the gibe seemed reflexive halfhearted she didnt bother to respond diarmuid didnt wait which leaves us dependent he murmured with what seemed to be a genuinely rueful shake of his head upon my own less than exhaustive store of knowledge about what my beloved brother is likely to do in some inexplicable way the glib flow of words had a calming effect once more jaelle realized the one she used to dismiss as the princeling knew exactly what he was doing he had already decided and now he was making the decision sound effortless and of little consequence jaelle looked at sharra standing beside the prince she wasnt sure whether or not to pity her which was another change once she would have had no trouble doing so at a time like this diarmuid continued i can do no better than go back to my precocious childhood memories some of you may have known patient supportive older brothers i have been blighted sadly by the lack of such a one loren will remember from the time i was able to take my first stumbling steps in my brothers wake one thing was manifestly clear aileron never ever waited for me he paused and glanced at loren as if seeking his confirmation but then continued in a voice from which the flippancy was suddenly gone he will not wait now nor could he given where we went if he is on the plain with the army and the lios with him aileron will push for battle i would stake my life on that in fact with your leave i will stake my life on it and all of yours aileron will take the fight to starkadh as swiftly as he can which to my mind means one thing only andarien said loren silvercloak who jaelle suddenly recalled had taught both diarmuid and his brother andarien the prince echoed quietly he will go through gwynir to andarien there was a silence jaelle was aware of the sea and of the forest to the east and acutely now of the dark shape of lisens tower looming above diem in the darkness i suggest diarmuid went on that we skirt the western edge of pendaran going north from here angle up through sennett across the river celyn to meet if childhood memories have any merit at all with the army of brennin and daniloth and the dalrei on the borders of andarien if i am wrong he concluded with a generous smile at her then at least we will have jaelle with us to terrify whatever the fifty of us find there she favored him with nothing more than a wintry glance his smile grew broader as if her expression had only confirmed his statement but then in one of his mercurial changes of mood he turned and looked at arthur who had risen to stand my lord said the prince with no levity at all such is my counsel at this time i will attend to any suggestion you might make but i knew the geography here and i think i know my brother unless there is something you know or sense andarien is where i think we must go slowly the warrior shook his head i have never been in this world before arthur said in his deep carrying voice and i never had a brother in any world these are your men prince diarmuid number me as one of them and lead us to war we will have to take the women diarmuid murmured she was about to make a stinging retort but in that moment something very bright caught her eye and she turned to see the baelrath on kims finger burst into even more imperative flame she looked at the seer as if seeing her for the first time the small slim figure with tangled hair so improbably white the sudden appearance of the vertical crease on her forehead again she had a sense that there seemed to be burdens here greater than her own she remembered the moment she had shared with kim in gwen ystrat and she wished a little surprised at herself that there were something she could do some comfort she might offer that was more than merely words but jennifer has been right in what shed said when darien had gone none of them had any real shelter to offer each other she watched as kim walked over to pwyll and put her arms around him gripping him very hard jaelle saw her kiss him on the mouth he stroked her hair till next the seer said an echo clearly of the world the two of them had left behind try hard to be careful paul and you was all he said the priestess saw her walk over to jennifer then and saw the two women speak though she could not hear what they said then the seer turned she seemed to jaelle to grow more remote even as she watched kim gestured loren and matt to either side of her she bade them join hands and she laid her own left hand over both of theirs then she lifted her other hand high in the darkness and closed her eyes in that instant as if a connection had been made the warstone blazed so brightly it could not be looked upon and when the blinding light was gone so were the three of them when he woke it was quite dark in the wood putting a hand to his head flidais could feel that his wound had healed the pain seemed to be gone so too however was his right ear he sat up slowly and looked around his father was there cernan had crouched down on his haunches not very far away and was regarding him gravely the horned head held motionless flidais met the gaze for a long moment in silence thank you he said at length speaking aloud the antlers dipped briefly in acknowledgment then cernan said also aloud he was not trying to kill you nothing has changed flidais thought nothing at all it was too old a pattern laid down far too long ago when both he and galadan were young for the anger or the hurt to be strong he said mildly he wasnt trying not to either cernan said nothing it was dark in the forest the moon not yet high enough to lend silver to the place where they were both of them though could see very well in the dark and flidais looking at his father read sorrow and guilt both in the eyes of the god it was the latter that disarmed him it always had he said with a shrug it could have been worse i suppose the antlers moved again i healed the wound his father said defensively i know he felt the ragged edge of tissue where his ear had been tell me he asked am i very ugly cernan tilted his magnificent head in appraisal no more than before he said judiciously flidais laughed and so too after a moment did the goda deep rumbling sensuous sound that reverberated through the wood when the laughter subsided it seemed very quiet among the trees but only for those not tuned to pendaran as were both of these the forest god and his son even with only one ear flidais could hear the whispering of the wood the messages running back and forth like fire it was why they were talking out loud there was too much happening on the silent link and there were other powers in pendaran that night he was suddenly reminded of something of fire to be precise he said it really could have gone worse for me i lied to him his fathers eyes narrowed how so he wanted to know who had been in the anor he was aware that someone had you know why i said only myself which was not true he paused then said softly guinevere was as well cernan of the beasts rose to his feet with a swift animallithe motion that he said explains something what in response flidais was offered an image it was his father who was offering and cernan had never done him actual harm although until just now little good either and so in uncharacteristic trust he opened his mind and received the image a man walking swiftly through the forest with an utterly distinctive grace not stumbling even with the darkness and the entangling roots it was not the one hed expected to see but he knew quite well who this was and so he knew what must have happened while he lay unconscious on the forest floor lancelot he breathed an unexpected note most of the way to awe in his voice his mind raced he will have been in cader sedat of course the warrior will have awakened him and she has sent him away again he had been in camelot had seen those three in their first life and seen them again without their knowing him in many of the returnings they had been forced to make he knew the story he was a part of it and now he remembered with a flash of joy like light in the darkness of the wood he knew the summoning name that however brought back the memory of his oath he said the child is in the wood as well guineveres child and urgently where is my brother now he is running north cernan replied for an instant he hesitated he passed by the child not a hundred yards away some time ago while you slept he did not see or sense him you have friends in the wood angry for your shed blood he was offered no messages no one is speaking to him flidais closed his eyes and drew a ragged breath so close he had a vision of the wolf and the boy passing by each other in the blackness of the wood in the hour before moonrise passing by so near and not knowing not ever to know or did they he wondered was there a part of the soul that reached out somehow toward possibilities barely missed futures that would never be because of such a little distance in a forest at night he felt a stir of air just then wind with a hintonly imagined perhapsof something more he opened his eyes he felt alert sharpened exalted still by what had come to pass there was no pain he said i need you to do one thing for me to help me keep an oath the dark eyes of cernan flashed with anger you too he said softly like a hunting cat i have done what i will i have healed the damage my son did how many of the weavers bonds would you have me break i too am your son flidais said greatly daring for he could feel the wrath of the god i have not forgotten i have done what i will do flidais stood up i cannot bind the forest in a matter such as this i am not strong enough but i do not want the child killed even though he burned the tree i swore an oath you are god of the wood as well as the beasts i need your help slowly cernans anger seemed to fade away flidais had to look up a long way to see his fathers face you are wrong you do not need my help in this the god said from the majesty of his great height you have forgotten something wise child for reasons i will never accept rakoths son has been given the circlet of lisen the powers and spirits of the wood will not harm him directly not while he wears it they will do something else and you should know what that is littlest one he did know the grove he whispered he is being guided to the sacred grove and against what will meet him there said cernan what will meet him and kill him i have no power at all nor would i desire such power even could i do so i would not intervene he should never have been allowed to live it is time for him to die before he reaches his father and all hope ends he was turning to go having said all he intended to say having done the one thing he felt bound to do when his son replied in a voice deep as tree roots perhaps but i think not i think there is more to this weaving you too have forgotten something cernan looked back there was a first hint of silver in the space where they stood it touched and molded his naked form he had a place where he wanted to be when the moon rose and the very thought of what would be waiting for him there stirred his desire he stayed though for one more moment waiting lancelot said flidais and turned himself to run with that always unexpected speed toward the grove where lisen had been born so long ago in the presence of all the goddesses and gods in his anger and confusion the bitterness of rejection darien had run a long way into the forest before realizing that it was not the wisest thing to have done he hadnt intended to burn the tree but events the flow of what happened never seemed to go the way he expected them to they never seemed to go right and when that happened something else took place inside of him and his power the change in his eyes came back and trees burned even then hed only wanted the illusionthe same illusion of fire hed shaped in the glade of the summer treebut hed been stronger this time and uneasy in the presence of so many people and his mother had been beautiful and cold and had sent him away he hadnt been able to control what he did and so the fire had been real and hed run into the shadows of the wood from what seemed to be the colder more hurtful shadows on the beach it was quite dark by now the moon had not yet risen and gradually as his rage receded darien became increasingly aware that he was in danger he knew nothing of the history of the great wood but he was of the andain himself and so could half understand the messages running through pendaran messages about him and what he had done and what he wore about his brow as the sense of danger increased so too grew his awareness that he was being forced in a particular direction he thought about taking his owl shape to fly over and out of the forest but with the thought he became overwhelmingly conscious of weariness he had flown a long way very fast in that form and he didnt know if he could sustain it again he was strong but not infinitely so and he usually needed a cresting tide of emotion to source his power fear hunger longing rage now he had none of them he was aware of danger but couldnt summon any response to it numbed indifferent alone he stayed in his own shape wearing the clothes finn had worn and followed unresisting the subtly shifting paths of pendaran wood letting the powers of the forest guide him where they would to whatever was waiting for him there he heard their anger and the anticipation of revenge but he offered no response to it he walked not really caring about anything thinking about his mothers imperious cold face her words what are you doing here what do you want darien what did he want what could he be allowed to want to hope for dream of desire he had only been born less than a year ago how could he know what he wanted he knew only that his eyes could turn red like his fathers and when they did trees burned and everyone turned away from him even the light turned away it had been beautiful and serene and sorrowful and the seer had put it on his brow and it had gone out as soon as it was clasped to him he walked did not weep his eyes were blue the halfmoon was rising soon it would shine down through spaces in the trees the wood whispered triumphantly malice in the leaves he was guided unresisting the circlet of lisen on his brow into the sacred grove of pendaran wood to be slain numberless were the years that grove had lain steeped in its power nor was mere any place in any world with roots so deeply woven into the tapestry against the antiquity of this place even mórnirs claiming of the summer tree in the godwood of the high kingdom had been but a blink of time agoin the days when iorweth had been summoned to brennin from over the wide sea for thousands upon thousands of years before that day pendaran wood had seen summers and winters in fionavar and through all the turnings and returnings of the seasons this grove and the glade within it had been the heart of the wood there was magic here ancient powers slumbered beneath the forest floor here more than a thousand years ago a blink of time no more lisen had been born in the rapt silent presence of all the powers of the wood and the shining company of the goddesses whose beauty had been hers from the beginning of her days here too had come amairgen whitebranch first mortal first child of the weaver not born of the wood to dare a night in that grove seeking a power for men that did not find its source in the blood magic of the priestesses and here had he found that power and more as lisen wild and glorious had returned to the violated glade of her birth to slay him in the morning and had fallen in love instead and so left the wood after that a great deal had changed for the powers of the grove for all of pendaran time ran up to the moment she had died leaping from the balcony of the anor and then it moved forward more slowly as if weighted down from that day since then since those warshattered days of the first coming of rakoth maugrim only one other mortal had ever come into this place and he too was a mage a follower of amairgen and he was a thief with guile and a cunning use of lore raederth the mage had known exactly when it might be safe to enter pendaran in search of the thing he sought there was one day and one day only in every year when the wood was vulnerable when it grieved and could not guard itself when the seasons came around to the day of lisens leap the river running past the anor ran red into the killing sea with the memory of her blood and all the spirits of the forest that could do so gathered at the foot of the tower to mourn and all those that could not travel projected their awareness toward that place to see the river and the anor through the eyes of those assembled there and one year on the morning of that day raederth came without his source casting no aura of power he had entered the sacred grove and knelt in the glade by the birthing place and he had taken the circlet of lisen that lay shining on the grass by the time the sun went down and the river ran clear again into the sea he had been running himself for a whole day without pause and was very near to the eastern fringes of the forest pendaran had become aware of him then and of what he had done but all the mightiest powers of the wood were gathered by the sea and there was agonizingly little they could do they made the forest paths change for him the trees shift and close menacingly about the fleeing man but he was too near the plain he could see the tall grass in the light of the setting sun and his will and courage were very strong greater than those of any ordinary thief and he made his waythough they hurt him they hurt him badlyout of the forest and away south again with a shining thing held in his hands that only lisen had ever worn so now it was with exultation with a fierce collective joy that pendaran became aware that the circlet had come home home and in pain the spirits whispered to each other it had to be in agony with its light extinguished on the brow of one who had torched a tree he would go mad and be flayed mind and body both before they released him to death so they vowed one to another the deiena to the leaves of the sentient trees the leaves to the silent powers and the singing ones the dark shapeless things of dread to the old unmoving deeprooted forces that had once been trees and were now something more and intimately versed in hate for a moment the whispering stopped in that instant they heard cernan their lord they heard him say aloud that it was past time for this one to die and they gloried in what he said there would be no staying them no gods voice to cry them off the kill the sacrifice was led to the grove delicately he was guided the forest paths made smooth and even for his tread and as he walked his doom was decreed and it was decided who would effect it all the powers of the wood were agreed however bitter his sacrilege however sharp the desire to kill lay upon them they would not themselves act against one who wore lisens circlet about his head there was another power though the mightiest of all a power of earth not of forest not bound by the griefs and constraints of the wood even as darien was being guided unresisting to the sacred grove the spirits of pendaran sent down their summons to the guardian who slept below that place they woke the oldest one it was very dark in the forest but even when he wasnt in his owl shape he could see very well at night in some ways in fact the darkness was easier which was another source of unease it reminded him this affinity of the night voices calling from the winter of his boyhood and of how he had been drawn to them and that reminded him of finn who had held him back and told him he had to hate the dark and then had left him alone he remembered the day he would always remember the day of his first betrayal he had made a flower in the snow and colored it with the power of his eyes it was quiet in the grove now that he was here the whisper of the leaves had died down to a gentle rustle in the night there was a scent in the air he did not recognize the grass of the glade was even and smooth and soft under his feet he could not see the moon overhead the stars shone down from the narrow circle of sky framed by the looming trees they hated him trees leaves the soft grass the spirits present behind the trunks of trees the deiena peeking through the leavesall of them hated him he knew he should be terrified a part of him acknowledged he should be wielding his own power to break free of this place to make them all pay in flame and smoke for their hate he couldnt seem to do it he was tired and alone and he hurt in ways he could never have expressed he was ready for an ending near the northern edge of the glade there was a mound grasscovered and upon it there were night flowers open in the darkness he walked over the flowers were very beautiful the scent of the grove came from them carefully so as to give no further injury or offense darien sat down on the grass of the mound between two clusters of dark flowers immediately there came a surging thrashing sound of fury from the wood he leaped to his feet an involuntary cry of protest escaping his throat hed been careful hed harmed nothing hed only wanted to sit awhile in the starlit silence before he died his arms went out openhanded in a hopeless gesture of appeasement gradually the sound faded though there remained after it was gone a kind of drumming a rumbling scarcely audible beneath the grass of the grove darien drew a breath and looked around again nothing moved save the leaves rustling slightly in the breeze on the lowest branch of one of the trees of the grove a small geiala perched its soft furry tail held inquisitively high it regarded him with a preternatural gravity had he been in his owl shape darien knew the geiala would have fled frantically at first sight of him but he appeared harmless now he supposed a curiosity only a boy at the mercy of the woodwhich was merciless it was all right he decided with a kind of desperate acceptance it was even easier this way everyone from the time of his first memories had spoken to him of choice of light and dark and choosing between the two but they hadnt even been able to choose or decide about him among themselves pwyll whod taken him to the summer tree had wanted dari to be older to come into this shape so he could come to greater knowledge cernan of the beasts had wanted to know why hed even been allowed to live the whitehaired seer fear in her eyes had given him a shining object of light and had watched with him as it went out then shed sent him to his mother whod driven him away finn even finn whod told him to love the light had gone away without a farewell to find a kind of darkness of his own in the wide spaces between the stars they spoke of choice of his being balanced between his mother and his father he was too finely balanced he decided it was too hard for all of them and at the last for him it was easier this way easier to surrender that need to decide to give himself over to the wood in this place of ancient power to accept his dying which would make things better for everyone dead you couldnt be lonely darien thought you couldnt be this hurt they were all afraid of him afraid of what he might do with the freedom to choose of what he might become they wouldnt have to be afraid anymore he remembered the face of the lios alfar that last cold morning of winter by the summer treehow beautiful and shining he had been and how afraid he remembered the seer with her white hair shed given him a gift which no stranger had ever done but hed seen her eyes the doubt and apprehension even before the light went out it was true they were all afraid of what he would choose except his mother the thought found him totally unprepared it hit with the force of revelation she wasnt afraid of what he might do she was the only one who hadnt tried to lure him like the storm voices or persuade him like the seer she had not tried to bind him to her or even suggest a path to him she had sent him away because the choice was his own and she was the only one willing to allow that to be so maybe he thought suddenly maybe she trusted him in the grove in the darkness he saw the flowers on the mound where lisen had been born and he saw them clearly with the night vision of his father thinking of his mother as he did for some reason then he remembered vae and shahar the first mother and father hed known he thought about his two fathers the one a helpless minor soldier in the army of brennin obedient to the impersonal orders of the high king unable to stay by his wife and sons in the winter cold unable to keep them warm the other a god and the strongest god shaper of winter and war feared as he darien was feared for being his son he was supposed to choose between them looked at one way there was no choice at all to be made his sight in the darkness the fear he aroused the dying of the light on his brow all spoke to that it was as if the choice had already been made on the other hand he never finished the thought it would please me if you pleaded for your life if the rocks of the earths crust could speak they would have sounded like that the words were a rumbling a sliding as of gigantic stones lurching into motion a prelude to avalanche and earthquake darien wheeled there was a shape darker than darkness in the glade and there was a huge hole in the ground jagged and irregular beside the creature that had spoken with the voice of the earth fear leaped in darien primeval instinctive despite all his resignation of the moments before he felt his eyes explode to red he lifted his hands ringers spread pointing and nothing happened there came a laugh deep and low like a shifting of boulders long at rest not here said the shape not in this grove and not untutored as you are i have your name and your fathers it is clear what you might become enough even to test me somewhat had we met long after this but tonight you are nothing in this place you do not go nearly deep enough it would please me it said again to hear you plead darien lowered his arms he felt his eyes return to the blue he had from neither father nor mother the blue that was his own perhaps the only thing that was he was silent and in that silence he regarded what had come under the halfmoon that rose at last above the eastern trees to shine palely down it held to no fixed shape or hue even as he watched the creature oscillated ceaselessly through amorphous forms it had four arms then three then none its head was a mans then a hideous mutant shape covered with slugs and maggots then a boulder featureless as the maggots fell back into the grass and the gaping hole beside it it was grey and mottled brown and black it was huge in all the blurred shiftings of its shape it had two legs always and one of them darien saw was deformed in one hand it carried a hammer that was the greyblack color of wet clay and was almost as large as darien himself again it spoke amid the suddenly absolute fearful silence of the forest and again it said will you not plead circletbearer give me a voice to carry back to my sleep under stone they have asked me to leave you alive treeburner they want your flesh and your mind to flay when the circlet is gone from your brow i will offer you an easier quicker release if you but ask for it ask grovedefiler only ask there is nothing else you can do the face was almost human now but huge and grey and there were worms crawling over it in and out of the nose and mouth the voice was the thickened voice of earth and stone it said it is night in the sacred grove son of maugrim you are nothing beside me and less than that you do not go nearly deep enough even to make me swing my hammer i do said another voice and lancelot du lac entered the moonlit grove they were sleeping on the beach just south of the anor brendel had disobeyed flidais instructions to the extent of going inside alone and bringing out blankets and bedding from the lower rooms where lisens guards had slept he did not go upstairs again for fear of once more stirring galadans awareness of that place on a pallet beside arthur a little apart from the others jennifer lay in the motionless sleep of utter exhaustion her head was on his shoulder one hand rested on his broad chest and her golden hair was loose on the pillow they shared wide awake the warrior listened to her breathing and felt the beat of the heart he loved then the heartbeat changed she hurtled bolt upright instantly awake her gaze riveted on the high watching moon her face was so white it made her hair look dark he saw her draw a shuddering afflicted breath he felt it as a pain within himself he said he is in danger guinevere she said nothing at all her gaze never leaving the face of the moon one hand was over her mouth he took the other as gently as he could it trembled like an aspen leaf in an autumn wind it was colder than it should ever have been in the mild midsummer night he said what do you see is he in danger guinevere they both are she whispered eyes on the moon they both are my love and i sent them both away he was silent he looked up at the moon and he thought of lancelot he held one of guineveres hands clasped between both of his own broad square ones and he wished her peace and hearts ease with longing fiercer and more passionate than any he had ever felt for his own release from doom i go as deep as you said the tall man quietly as he entered the glade he had a drawn sword in his hand it shimmered faintly catching the silver of the moon i know who you are he went on speaking softly and without haste i know you curdardh and whence you come i am here as champion of this child if you wish his death you will have first to accomplish my own who are you the demon rumbled the trees were loud again all around them darien realized he looked at the man who had come and he wondered i am lancelot he heard a memory stirred at the back of his mind a memory of gamesplaying with finn in the winter snow a game of the warrior with his king spear and his friend his tanist finn had said first of the warriors company whose name was lancelot who had loved the warriors queen whose name whose name the demon curdardh shifted position with a sound of granite dragging over grass it hefted its hammer and said i had not thought to see you here but i am not surprised it laughed softly gravel rolling down a slope it shifted shape again it had two heads now and both were demon heads it said i will claim no quarrel with you lancelot and pendaran knows that you lived a winter in a forest and did no evil there you will come to no harm if you leave here now but i must kill you if you stay with an absolutely focused inner quietude lancelot said you must try to kill me it is not an easy task curdardh even for you i am deep as the earths core swordsman my hammer was forged in a pit so deep the fire burns downward it was said as a fact without bravado i have been here since pendaran was here said curdardh the oldest one for all that time i held this grove sacrosanct waking only when it was violated you have a blade and unmatched skill with it it will not be enough i am not without mercy leave with the last rumbled command the trees at the edge of the grove shook and the earth rocked darien fought to keep his balance then as the tremor came to an end lancelot said with a courtesy strangely eerily befitting to the place i have more than you think though i thank you for the kindness of your praise you should know before we begin for we are going to do battle here curdardh that i have lain dead in caer sidi which is cader sedat which is the corona borealis of the kings among the stars you will know that that castle lies at the axletree of all the worlds with the sea pounding at its walls and all the stars of heaven turning about it dariens heart was racing though he understood only a fragment of what he had heard he had remembered something else finn who in those days had seemed to know everything there was in the world to know had told him that his mother had been a queen the knowledge made everything even more confusing than it had been already he swallowed he felt like a child even so curdardh was saying to lancelot even with where you have lain you are mortal swordsman would you die for the son of rakoth maugrim i am here said lancelot simply and the battle began chapter his secretary shalhassan of cathal decided at about the same moment had not been born for the military life raziel on horseback was just a pale shadowalmost literally in factof his usual efficient self already the supreme lord had been forced to pause twice in his dictation while raziel rummaged frantically in his saddlebag to replace a broken stylus waiting shalhassan ran his fingers through his long pleated beard and scanned the moonlit road in front of his racing chariot they were in brennin on the road from seresh to the capital riding by moonlight and at speed because war demanded such things of men it was a mild summer night though the tail end of a major storm had whipped through seresh late in the day when he and his reinforcements from cathal had crossed the river raziel retrieved a stylus and promptly dropped it as he attempted to shift his grip on the reins of his horse shalhassan betrayed not a flicker of response with his feet firmly on the ground raziel was quite good at what he did shalhassan was willing marginally to allow him this deviation from absolute competence with a wave of his hand he dismissed his secretary to fall back into the ranks the dictation could wait until they reached paras derval they were not far away shalhassan had a sudden vivid recollection of the last time hed taken this road eastward at the head of an army it had been a winters day diamondbright and hed been met in the road by a prince in a white fur cloak and a white hat with a red djena feather brilliant against the snow for ornament and now not two weeks later the snow was utterly gone and the glittering prince was betrothed to shalhassans daughter he was also away at sea there had been no word in seresh as to the fate of the ship that had sailed for spiral castle there had been word of the high king he had ridden north at the head of the army of brennin and those of cathal who were already there in response to a summonglass calling from daniloth the same night prydwen had set sail shalhassan nodded tersely to his charioteer and gripped the front rail more firmly as they picked up speed it was probably unnecessary he knew the odds were that he and this second contingent were too late to constitute anything but a rear guard at this stage but he wanted to see gorlaes the chancellor to confirm that and he also wanted to see his daughter they went very fast in the moonlight a short time later he was in paras derval and then he was being ushered travelstained allowing himself no luxury of time to change his clothing into the torchlit great hall of the palace where gorlaes stood one dutiful step below the level of the empty throne the chancellor bowed to him the triple obeisance which was unexpected and gratifying besides gorlaes and a farther step below him stood someone else who also bowed as deferentially though rather less ornately which was understandable given who it was then tegid of rhoden intercedent for prince diarmuid told the supreme lord of cathal that sharra had gone away and stood flinching in anticipation of the explosion that had to come inwardly it did fear and a towering rage exploded in shalhassans breast but neither found expression in his face or bearing there was ice in his voice though as he asked where and with whom it was gorlaes who answered she went with the seer and the high priestess my lord they did not tell us where if i may say so there is wisdom in both in all three of them i do not think he stopped short at a keen glance from shalhassan whose gaze had quelled more formidable speakers than this one at the same time shalhassan was aware that his rage had already sluiced away leaving only the fear he himself had never been able to keep his daughter under control how could he expect this fat man and the overextended chancellor to do better he also remembered the seer very well and his respect for her went deep for what she had done one night in the temple at gwen ystratknifing her way alone into the darkness of rakoths designs to show them the source of winterhe would always honor her if she had gone away it was to a purpose and the same applied to the high priestess who was equally formidable in her own way however formidable they both were though he doubted they would have been able to stop his daughter from joining them if shed decided that was what she wanted to do oh sharra he thought for the tenthousandth time he wondered if he had been wise not to remarry when his wife died the girl had needed some sort of guidance that much was more and more evident he looked up above and behind the oak throne of brennin set high in the walls of the great hall were the stainedglass windows of delevan the one behind the throne showed conary and colan riding north to war the light of the halfmoon shining outside silvered their yellow hair well shalhassan thought it would be up to their successor the young high king aileron to wage whatever war the northlands would see now the instructions were as hed expectedas indeed they had to be he would have done exactly the same thing the men of the second contingent of cathal under the leadership of their supreme lord were to remain in brennin distributed as shalhassan and gorlaes deemed wisest to guard the high kingdom and cathal beyond as best they could he drew his gaze slowly down from the glory of the window looking at tegida contrast worthy of an aphorismhe said kindly do not reproach yourself the chancellor is rightthe three of them will know what they are doing you may join me if you like in sympathizing with your prince who will have to deal with her from henceforth if we survive he turned to the chancellor i would appreciate food my lord gorlaes and instruction to my captains for the quartering of my men after that if you are not weary i wonder if we might share some wine and a game of tabael that may be the closest we two get to war it seems and i find it soothes me to play at night the chancellor smiled ailell used to say the same thing my lord i will be glad to play with you though i must warn that i am an indifferent player at best might i come watch the fat man asked diffidently shalhassan scrutinized him do you play tabael he asked dubiously a little said tegid the supreme lord of cathal pulled his sole remaining rider backward interposing it in defense of his queen he favored his opponent with a glance that had made more than one man contemplate a ritual suicide i think he said more to himself than to either of the other two men that i have just been set up quite royally gorlaes watching grunted in commiseration tegid of rhoden picked off the intervening rider with his castle prince diarmuid insists he murmured putting the captured piece beside the board that every member of his band know how to play tabael properly none of us have ever beaten him though he smiled and leaned back in his chair patting his unmatched girth complacently studying the board intently searching for a defense to the twopronged attack that would be unleashed as soon as tegid moved the castle again shalhassan decided to divert some of his earlier sympathy to his daughter who was going to have to live with this prince tell me he asked does aileron also play ailell taught both his sons when they were children gorlaes murmured filling shalhassans wine flask from a beaker of south keep vintage and does the high king also play now at some rarefied level of excellence shalhassan noted the hint of exasperation in his voice the two sons of ailell seemed to elicit that in him i have no idea gorlaes replied ive never seen him play as an adult he was very good when he was a boy he used to play with his father all the time he doesnt play tabael anymore said tegid dont you know the story aileron hasnt touched a piece since the first time diarmuid beat him when they were boys hes like that you know absorbing this considering it shalhassan moved his mage threateningly along the diagonal it was a trap of course the last one he had to help it along he distracted the fat man with a question i dont know like what pushing hard on the arms of his chair tegid levered himself forward to see the board more clearly ignoring the trap and the question both he slid his castle laterally exposing shalhassans queen once more to attack and simultaneously threatening the cathalian lords own king it was quite decisive he doesnt like to lose at anything tegid explained he doesnt do things when he thinks he might lose doesnt that limit his activities somewhat shalhassan said testily he didnt much like losing himself nor was he accustomed to it not really said tegid a little reluctantly hes extremely good at almost everything both of them are he added loyally with such grace as he could muster shalhassan tipped his king sideways in surrender and raised his glass to the victor a good game said tegid genially tell me he added turning to gorlaes have you any decent ale here wine is all very well but im grievously thirsty tonight if you want to know the truth a pitcher of ale vierre the chancellor advised the page standing silently in the doorway two shalhassan said surprising himself set up the pieces for another game he lost that one too but won the third decisively with immense eveningredeeming satisfaction then both he and tegid made cursory work of gorlaes in two other games it was all unexpectedly congenial and then quite late at night he and the chancellor further surprised themselves by accepting a highly unorthodox suggestion from the sole member of prince diarmuids band remaining in paras derval what was even more surprising to shalhassan ultimately was how entertaining he found the music and the ambience and the undeniably pert serving women in the huge downstairs rooms of the black boar tavern and a smaller darker room upstairs it was a late night if he did nothing further paul thought nothing at all from now until whatever ending lay waiting for them no one could tax him with not having done his share he was lying on the strand near the river a little apart as usual from all the others he had lain awake for hours watching the wheeling stars listening to the sea the moon had climbed as high as it could go and was westering now it was very late he lay by himself and thought about the night he had ended the drought and then about the predawn hour when he had seen the soulmonger and summoned liranan with gereints aid to battle rakoths monster in the sea and then he let his mind come forward to the moment earlier this evening when he had spoken with the voice of mórnir and the sea god had answered again and stilled the waves to let the mariners of prydwen survive the weavers storm he had also he knew done something else almost a year ago his had been the crossing between the worlds that had saved jennifer from galadan and allowed darien to be born he wondered if those who came after would curse his name for that he wondered if there would be anyone to come after he had done his part in this war no one could question that furthermore he knew no one but himself would even think to raise the issue the reproaches here the sleeplessness the striving always for something more all of it was internal a part of the pattern of his life the pattern that seemed woven into what he was even in fionavar it lay at the heart of why rachel had left him it encompassed the solitariness kevin laine had tried so hard to break throughand had in some way paul still hadnt found time to assimilate but solitude appeared truly to be bound into the tangled roots of what he was alone on the summer tree hed come into his power and it seemed that even in the midst of a great many people he still came into it alone his gift seemed profoundly secret even from himself it was cryptic and selfcontained shaped of hidden lore and solitary stubborn resistance to the dark he could speak with gods and hear them but never move among them and every such exchange drew him farther away from everyone he knew as if hed needed something to do that not feeling the cold of the winter or the lash of the rain that had passed sent back by the god he was the arrow of mórnir and arrows flew alone he was he realized hopelessly far from falling asleep he looked at the halfmoon out over the sea it seemed to be calling him he rose with the sound of the surf loud in his ears north toward the anor he could see the shadows that were the sleeping men of south keep behind him the river ran west toward the sea he followed it as he walked the sand became pebbles and then boulders he climbed up on one of them by the waters edge and saw by moonlight that he was not the only sleepless person on the beach that night he almost turned back but somethinga memory of another beach the night before prydwen had sailedmade him hesitate and then speak to the figure sitting on the dark rock nearest to the lapping waves we seem to be reversing roles shall i give you a cloak it came out more sardonically than hed intended but it didnt seem to matter her icy selfpossession was unsettlingly complete without turning or startling her gaze still on the water jaelle murmured im not cold you were that night does it bother you so much immediately he was sorry hed spoken this always seemed to happen when they met this polarity of dana and mórnir he half turned to climb back down and away but then stopped held by stubbornness more than anything else he drew a breath and carefully keeping any inflection from his voice said it really doesnt jaelle i spoke by way of greeting nothing more not everything anyone says to you has to be taken as a challenge this time she did turn her hair was held back by the silver circlet but the ends still lifted and blew in the sea breeze he could not make out her eyes the moonlight was behind her shining on his own face for a long moment they were both silent then jaelle said you have an unusual way of greeting people twiceborn he let out his breath i know he conceded especially you he took a step and a short jump down and sat on the boulder nearest to hers the water slapped below them he could taste salt in the spray not answering jaelle turned back to look out to sea after a moment paul did the same they sat like that for a long time then something occurred to him he said youre a long way from the temple how were you planning to return she pushed a loop of hair back with an impatient hand kimberly the mage i didnt really think about it she needed to come here quickly and i was the only way he smiled then suppressed it lest she think he was mocking her at the risk of being cursed or some such thing may i say that that sounds uncharacteristically unselfish she turned sharply glaring at him her mouth opened and then closed and even by moonlight he could see her flush i didnt mean that to sting he added quickly truly jaelle i have some idea of what it meant for you to do this her color slowly faded where the moon touched it her hair gleamed with a strange unearthly shading of red her circlet shone she said simply i dont think you do not even you pwyll then tell me he said tell someone something jaelle he was surprised at the intensity in his voice are you one to talk she shot back reflexively but then as he kept silent she added more slowly and in a different voice i named someone to act in my stead but i broke the patterns of succession when i did so do i know her she smiled wryly actually you do the one who spied on us last year he felt the edge of a shadow pass over him he looked up quickly no clouds across the moon it was in his mind leila is it a presumption to ask why is she not very young you know she is jaelle said sharply then again as if fighting her own impulses she went on as to why i am not certain an instinct a premonition as i told you all earlier this evening she is still tuned to finn and so to the wild hunt i am not easy with it though i dont know what it means do you always know why you do what you do pwyll he laughed bitterly touched on the raw nerve that had kept him awake i used to think i did not anymore since the tree im afraid i dont know why i do any of what i do im going by instinct too jaelle and im not used to it i dont seem to have any control at all do you want to know the truth the words tumbled out of him low and impassioned i almost envy you and kimyou both seem so sure of your places in this war her face grave she considered that then she said dont envy the seer pwyll not her and as for me she turned away toward the water again as for me i have been feeling uneasy in my own sanctuary which has never happened before i dont think i need be an object of anyones envy im sorry he said risking it and seemed to fail as her glance flashed swiftly back to him that is presumption she said coldly and unasked for he held her gaze refusing to yield to it but reaching nonetheless for something to say even as he did her expression changed and she added in any case such sorrow as you might feel would be balancedoverbalanced in truthby audiarts pleasure did she learn of this she would sing for joy and dana knows she cannot sing paul let his mouth drop open jaelle he whispered did you just make a joke she gestured in exasperation what do you think we are in the temple she snapped do you think we stalk around intoning chants and curses day and night and gathering blood for amusement he left a little silence before answering over the sound of the waves that sounds about right he said gently you havent been at pains to suggest otherwise there are reasons for that jaelle shot back quite unfazed you are sufficiently acquainted with power by now surely to be able to guess why but the truth is that the temples have been my only home for a long time now and there was laughter there and music and quiet pleasures to be found until the drought came and then the war the problem with jaelle or one of the problems he decided wryly was that she was right too much of the time he nodded fair enough but if i was wrong you must concede that it was because you wanted me to be wrong you cant tax me with that misunderstanding now thats one blade that shouldnt cut both ways they all cut both ways she said quietly he had known she would say that in many ways she was still very young though it seldom showed how old were you when you entered the temple he asked fifteen she answered after a pause and seventeen when i was named to the mormae he shook his head that is very leila was fourteen she is only fifteen now she cut in anticipating him and because of what i did this morning she is of the mormae now herself and even more than that what do you mean she fixed him with a careful regard i have your silence on this you know you do jaelle said because i named her to act for me while i was away and in a time of war it will follow by the patterns of dana that if i do not return to paras derval leila is high priestess at fifteen despite himself he felt another chill though the night was mild and the skies fair you knew this you knew this when you named her didnt you he managed to ask of course she said with more than a trace of her effortless scorn what do you think i am i dont really know he said honestly why did you do it then the question was direct enough to give her pause at length she answered i told you a few moments ago instinct intuition i have little more than those much of the time which is something for you to consider you were lamenting your lack of control just now power such as ours is not so easy to manipulate nor in truth should it be i do not command dana i speak for her and so it seems to me do you speak for the god when he chooses to speak you might give thought twiceborn of mórnir as to whether control matters too much to you and with the words he was suddenly on a highway in the rain again hearing the woman he loved tax him with the same cold flaw hearing her announce that she was leaving because of it unable to find a place in him where need of her found a true voice he seemed to be on his feet standing above the priestess by the sea he wasnt sure how that had happened he looked down and saw his hands clenched at his sides and then he turned and was walking away not from the truth for that came with him under the stars but from the icy green eyes and the voice that had spoken that truth here she watched him go and surprised herself with regret she had not meant to wound dana knew shed intended to hurt with so many things shed said to him at one time or another but not with that last it had been kindly meant as much so as lay within her nature and instead shed found a place where he was raw and vulnerable she should she knew keep that knowledge in readiness for encounters to come but sitting on the rock thinking back over what they each had said it was hard to hold to such cold controlling thoughts she smiled a little to herself at the irony and turned back toward the seato see a ghost ship passing between herself and the setting moon pwyll she cried the name almost without thought she was on her feet her heart pounding with terror and awe she could not take her eyes from the ship slowly it moved from north to south across her line of sight though the wind was from the west its sails were tattered and ragged and the low moon shone through them easily it lit the broken masts the shattered figurehead the smashed upheaval of the deck where the tiller was low down by the waterline she thought she could see a dark hole in the side of the ship where the sea must have rushed in there was no way that ship could remain afloat she heard pwylls quick running footsteps and then he was beside her again she did not turn or speak she registered the sharp intake of his breath and voiced an inward prayer of relief he too saw the ship it was not a phantom of her own mind not a prelude to madness suddenly he extended one hand pointing in silence she followed the line of his finger there was a man a solitary mariner standing near the prow of the ship by the railing nearest to them and the moon was shining through him as well he was lifting something in his hands holding it out over the side of the ship toward the two of them and jaelle saw with a second surge of awe that it was a spear i would be grateful for your prayers said pwyll she heard a beat of unseen wings she looked up and then quickly back to him she saw him step down off the rock where they stood and begin to walk across the waves toward the ship the provinces of dana ended at the sea nevertheless thought jaelle the high priestess nevertheless she closed her eyes for the first step knowing she was going to sink and set out after him she did not sink the waves barely wet the sandals she wore she opened her eyes saw pwyll striding purposefully in front of her and quickened her pace to catch up she received a startled glance as she came abreast you may need more than prayers she said shortly and invocations of dana hold no sway at sea i told you that once before i remember he said stepping a little upward to clear an advancing wave which makes you either very brave or very foolish indeed shall we call it both if you like she said masking an unexpected rush of pleasure and accept that i am sorry if what i said before caused you pain for once i hadnt meant it for once he repeated dryly but she was finally beginning to catch the shifting tones in his voice and this was mild irony and nothing more i know you didnt mean it he said negotiating a trough between waves i did that one to myself ill try to explain someday if you like she said nothing concentrating on moving over the water the sensation was uncanny jaelle felt perfectly flawlessly balanced she had to watch where they were going and what the sea was doing in front of them but having done so it was no trouble to skim along the surface the hem of her robe was wet nothing more if they hadnt been walking toward a ship that had been destroyed a thousand years ago she might even have found it pleasurable as it was though the closer they came the more eerily translucent loomed that hollow craft as they came alongside jaelle could clearly see the gaping holes torn in it at the waterline and in the exposed hold of amairgens ship the sea sparkled with moonlight for such of course it was there was nothing else it could be not in the bay of the anor lisen she had absolutely no idea what power kept it in the visible world let alone afloat but she did know beyond doubt who the one mariner high above them had to be for a moment when they stopped standing upon the waves just below that tall ghostly figure jaelle thought about the power of love and she did pray then briefly for lisens peace at the weavers side then amairgen spoke or what was left of him spoke after so long a death with the moonlight shining through he said in a voice like a deeptoned reed played by the wind why have you come jaelle felt herself rocked her balance slipped she had expectedthough she couldnt think whya welcome not this cold flat query suddenly the sea seemed terrifyingly dark and deep and land a long way off she felt an impersonal hand on her elbow steadying her pwyll waited until he saw her nod before turning his attention back to the one who had spoken from the deck above their heads she saw him look up at the mage slain by the soulmonger pale at the best of times pwyll was white and ghostly himself in the long moonlight there was no flicker of doubt in his eyes though no hesitation in his voice as he made reply we have come for the spear unquiet one and to bring you the tidings you have sought this many a year someone was in the tower the ghost cried it seemed to jaelle as if the wind lifted with the pain in the words the long burden of loss someone was in the tower and so i am come again where i never came as living man to the place where she died who stood in that room to draw me back guinevere said pwyll and waited amairgen was silent jaelle was aware of the rocking of the sea beneath her she glanced down a moment and then quickly back up it had seemed to her dizzyingly that shed seen stars below her feet amairgen leaned forward over the railing she was the high priestess of dana and standing above her was the ghost of the one who had broken the power of dana in fionavar she should curse him a part of her was saying curse him as the priestesses of the goddess did at the turning of every month she should let her blood fall in the sea below where she stood as she spoke the most bitter invocation of the mother it was as much as anything had ever been her duty but she could not do it such hatred for his ancient deed was not within her tonight nor would it ever be again she somehow knew there was too much pain too pure a sorrow here all the stories seemed to be merging into each other she gazed up at him and at what he held and kept silent watching he was foreshortened by the angle but she could descry his chiseled translucent features the long pale locks of his hair and the mighty gleaming spear he cradled in both his hands he wore a ring on one finger she thought she knew what it was is the warrior here then amairgen asked a breath on a moonlit reed he is said pwyll and added after a moment so too is lancelot what even in darkness and from where she stood jaelle saw his eyes suddenly gleam like sapphires in the night his hands shifted along the spear pwyll waited unhurried for the figure above them to absorb the implications of that then both of them standing on the tossing waves beside the ship heard amairgen say very formally now what tidings have you for me after so long jaelle surprised saw tears on pwylls face he said very gently tidings of rest unquiet one you are avenged your staff has been redeemed the soulmonger of maugrim is dead go home first of the mages beloved of lisen sail home between the stars to the weavers side and be granted peace after all these years we have gone to cader sedat and destroyed the evil there with the power of your staff held by one who followed you by loren silvercloak first mage of brennin what i tell you tonight is true i am the twiceborn of mórnir lord of the summer tree there came a sound then that jaelle never forgot for what was left of her days it came not from amairgen but rather seemed to rise from the ship itself though no one at all was to be seen a high keening sound twinned somehow to the slanting moon in the west balanced achingly between ecstasy and pain she realized suddenly that there were other ghosts here though they could not be seen others manned that doomed ship then amairgen spoke over the sound of his mariners and he said to pwyll if this is so if it has come to pass then in the name of mórnir i release the spear into your trust but there is one thing i will ask of you one thing further that is needed before i can rest there is one more death for the first time she saw pwyll hesitate she didnt know why but she did know something else and she said galadan she heard pwyll draw a breath even as she felt the sapphire eyes of the one who had found the skylore fix themselves on her own she willed herself not to flinch she heard him say you are a long way from your temples and your thirsty axe priestess do you not fear the killing sea i fear the unraveller more she said pleased to hear her voice strong and unwavering the killing sea she registered sorrowing lisen and i hate the dark more than i ever hated you or any of the mages who followed you i am saving my curses for maugrim andshe swallowedand i will pray after tonight to dana for your peace and lisens she ended ritually as pwyll had done what i tell you tonight is true i am the high priestess of the goddess in fionavar what have i said she thought in bemused wonder but she kept that she hoped from her eyes gravely he looked down upon her from the ruined ship and she could see for the first time something in him that went beyond power and pain he had been loved she remembered and had loved so much that it had bound him in grief beyond death through all the years to this bay where lisen had died over the sounds that came from the torn hulk of his ship amairgen said i will be grateful for your prayers pwylls words earlier she thought exactly his words it seemed to her that this had become a night outside of time where everything signified in some way or another galadan amairgen repeated the wailing from the dark ship was louder now joy and pain she heard them both she saw the moon shine through the sundered hulk it was dissolving even as she watched galadan amairgen cried one last time looking down at the twiceborn as he spoke i have sworn it said pwyll and jaelle heard for the first time a doubt in his voice she saw him draw a breath and lift his head higher i have sworn that he is mine he said and this time it carried be it so said amairgens ghost may your thread never be lost he was starting to fade she could see a star shine through him he raised the spear preparing to drop it over the side to them the provinces of dana ended at the sea she had no power here but she was still what she was and a thought came to jaelle then as she stood on the dark waves wait she cried sharp and clear in the starry night amairgen hold she thought it was too late he was already so translucent the ship so emphemeral they could see the low moon through its timbers the wailing of the invisible mariners seemed to be coming from very far away he came back though he did not let loose the spear and slowly as they watched he took again a more substantial form the ship had gone silent bobbing on the gentle swells of the bay beside her pwyll said nothing waiting there was nothing she knew he could say he had done what he could had recognized this ship for what it was had known the spear and ventured forth out over the waves to claim it and set the mage free of his long tormented sailing he had brought tidings of revenge and so of release the other thing what might happen now was hers for he could not know what she knew the mages cold spectral gaze was fixed upon her he said speak priestess why should i hold for you because i have a question to ask speaking not only for dana but in the name of light suddenly she was afraid of her own thought of what she wanted from him ask it then amairgen said high above she had been high priestess for too long to be so direct even now she said you were about to let go of the spear did you think thus to be so easily quit of your task in carrying it i did he replied by giving it into your custody with the warrior in fionavar summoning all her courage jaelle said coldly not so mage should i tell you why there was ice in his eyes they were colder than her own could go and with her words there came a low ominous sound from the ship again pwyll said nothing he listened balanced on the waves beside her tell me why amairgen said because you were to give the spear to the warrior for use against the dark not to carry far off from the fields of war from the moonlit winter of his death the mages expression seemed acidly sardonic you argue like a priestess he murmured it is clear that nothing has changed in gwen ystrat for all the years that have run by not so said pwyll quietly surprising both her and the mage she offered to pray for you amairgen and if you are able to see us clearly you will know that she was crying for you as she spoke you will also know better than i what a change that marks she swallowed wondering if she had really wanted him to see that no time to think about it instead she lifted her voice again hear me amairgen whitebranch long said to have hated rakoth maugrim and the legions of the dark more than any man who ever lived the high king of brennin is riding from celidon even nowso we believe he is taking war to maugrim in andarien again as the high king did in your own day we have as far to go as the army does and we are on foot neither the warrior with his spear nor any of us here by the anor will be there in time we have three days walking through sennett perhaps a fourth before we cross celyn into andarien it was true she had known it and diarmuid and brendel too theyd had no other choices though once agreeing that aileron would be riding north from the battle hed missed by celidon they would simply have to walk as fast and as far as they could and pray now they might have a choice a terrible one but the times were terrible and it seemed as if she might be charged with this part of their remedy if what you tell me is true the ghost said then indeed you have cause to fear you had a question though i have stayed for it speak for courtesy will not hold me any longer in this hour of our release and so she asked it will your ship carry mortal men amairgen pwyll drew a sharp breath do you know what you are asking amairgen said very softly it was cold now among the waves in the lee of that pale ship she said i think i do do you know that we are released now that tidings of the soulmongers death mark our release from bondage in the sea and you would bind us longer yet it had all become very hard she said there is no binding i have mage i have no power here no hold upon you i have asked a question nothing more she realized that she was trembling for what seemed an interminable time the ghost of conarys mage was silent then in a voice like a stir of wind he said would you sail with the dead the killing sea she thought for the second time there was a marrowdeep fear within her so far from the temples she knew she masked it though and then beat it back can we do so she asked there are some fifty of us and we must be at the mouth of the celyn two mornings hence in front of them the timbers of the ship showed black and splintered there were broken shards at the waterline and one vast gaping hole where the sea was flowing in amairgen looked down his pale hair ruffled by the night breeze he said we will do this thing for a night and a day and a night we will carry you past the cliffs of rhudh into sennett strand and men down again to where celyn finds the sea i will earn the prayers you offered high priestess of dana and the salt of your tears it was hard to tell in the thin moonlight and she was a long way below him but it seemed to her there was some kindness in his smile we can carry you he said though you will see none of the mariners and myself only when the stars are overhead there is a ladder aft of where you stand you may both come aboard and we will moor the ship by the jetty at the foot of the anor for your companions it is very shallow said pwyll can you go so close at that amairgen suddenly threw back his head and laughed harsh and cold in the darkness above the sea twiceborn of mórnir he said be very clear what you are about to do there are no seas too shallow for this ship we are not here nor will you be when once you stand upon this deck i ask you againwould you sail with the dead i would said pwyll calmly if that is what we must do together the two of them walked along the sea to where a rope ladder hung over the almost translucent side of the rotting ship they looked at each other saying nothing pwyll went first entrusting his weight to the ladder it held and slowly he went up to stand at length upon the deck jaelle followed it seemed a long way to climb upon nothing to reach nothingness she tried not to let herself think about it pwyll reached out a hand for her she took it and let him help her onto the deck it held her weight though looking down she could see right through the planks there were waves washing through the hold below quickly she looked up again there seemed to be no wind suddenly but the stars were brighter where they stood and the moon also amairgen did not approach he walked to the tiller and with no one visible to aid him began bringing the ship in toward the dock no one visible but all around her jaelle now heard footsteps and then the creaking of the tattered sails as they suddenly flapped full though still she could feel no breath of wind there were faint voices a thread of what might have been laughter then they were sailing toward the anor looking to the land she saw that all the others had awakened by now and were waiting there in silence she wondered if they could see her and what she and pwyll must look like standing here if they had become as ghosts themselves and what they would be when they stepped down off this ship if ever they did it did not seem that words were necessary diarmuid unsettlingly quick as he always seemed to be had already grasped what was happening amairgen gentled his ship to the foot of lisens tower a thing jaelle knew that he had never done as a living man she looked over at him but could read nothing at all in his face she wondered if she had imagined the smile she thought shed seen from below there was no more time for wondering the first of the men from the jetty were coming over the rail wonder in their eyes and apprehension in various measures she and pwyll moved to help them last of all were sharra then guinevere and arthur finally diarmuid dan ailell came aboard he looked at pwyll and then his blue eyes swung to jaelle to hold her with a long glance not much of a ship he murmured at length but ill concede it was fairly short notice she was too strained to even try to think of a response he didnt give her a chance in any case bending swiftly he kissed her cheekwhich was not by any measure something to be permittedand said very brightly woven first of dana both of you and he moved over and kissed pwyll as well i didnt know said pwyll dryly that you found this sort of thing so stimulating and that jaelle decided gratefully would do for her response as well they were all on board now all silent among the tread of the invisible mariners and the filling of sails that should have been too tattered to fill in a wind that none of them felt jaelle turned to see amairgen walking slowly toward arthur the spear cradled in his hands there was one more thing to be done she realized be welcome the dead mage said to the warrior insofar as the living can be welcome here insofar as i am living arthur replied quietly amairgen looked at him a moment then sank down on one knee i have had charge in this world of a thing that belongs to you my lord will you accept the king spear from my hands they were moving out to sea rounding the curve of the bay swinging north under the stars they heard arthur say simply in the deep voice that carried the shadings of centuries and of so many wars i will accept it amairgen lifted the spear arthur took it and as he did the head of the king spear blazed bluewhite for a dazzling instant and in that moment the moon set guinevere wheeled abruptly as if shed heard a sound in silence she looked back at the strand and at the forest beyond then oh my love she whispered oh my dear love the battle had been going on for a long time when flidais finally reached the sacred grove he was the last to arrive he realized all the moving spirits of the wood were here ringing the circle of the glade watching and those who could not travel were present as well having projected their awareness to this place to see through the eyes of those assembled here they made way for him as he approached though some more readily than others and he registered that he was the son of cernan though they made room for him to pass and passing through that shadowy company he came to the very edge of the glade and looking within saw lancelot battling desperately by starlight for his life and dariens flidais had lived a very long time but he had only seen the oldest one once before on the night the whole of pendaran had gathered as it had now to watch curdardh rise up from the riven earth in order to slay amairgen of brennin who had dared to pass a night in the glade flidais had been young then but he was always a wise watchful child and the memory was clear the demon disdaining its mighty hammer had sought to smash and overwhelm the mind of the arrogant intruder who was mortal and nothing more and could never resist and yet flidais remembered amairgen had resisted with an iron will and courage that cernans younger son had never yet in all the years that had spun between seen surpassed he had battled back against the oldest one and prevailed but only because he had help flidais would never forget the shocked thrill hed felt like the taste of forbidden wine in machas cloud palace or his first and only glimpse of ceinwen rising naked from her pool in faelinn grove at his sudden realization that mórnir was intervening in the battle at the end after amairgen had driven back curdardh in the grey hour before dawn the godasserting after with the daunting authority of his thunder voice that he had been summoned and bound by amairgens victorysent down a visitation of his own to the mortal and so granted him the runes of the skylore afterward mórnir had had to deal with danawhich had occasioned a chaos among the goddesses and gods that flidais thought back in the glade again a thousand years later had nothing and everything to do with what was happening now but two clear truths manifested themselves to the diminutive andain as he watched the figures battling here under the stars the first was that for whatever unknown reasonand flidais was ignorant as yet of lancelots sojourn among the dead in cader sedatthe demon was using his hammer and his terrifying physical presence as well as the power of his mind in this battle the second was that lancelot was fighting alone with nothing but his sword and his skill without aid from any power at all which meant the watching andain realized that he could not win despite what he was and had always been matchless among all mortals in any and all of the weavers worlds flidais remembering with brilliant clarity when he had been taliesin in camelot and had first seen this man fight felt an ache in his throat a tightness building in his broad chest to see the hopeless dazzling courage being wasted here he surprised himself the andain were not supposed to care what happened to mortals even to this one and beyond that he was a guardian of the wood himself and the sacred grove was being violated by this man his own duty and allegiance should have been as clear as the circle of sky above the glade a day ago and with anyone else perhaps they would have been but not anymore and not with lancelot flidais watched keeneyed by starlight and betrayed his long trust by grieving for what he saw curdardh was shifting shape constantly his amorphous fluid physicality finding new and deadly guises as he fought he grew an extra limb even as flidais watched and fashioned a stone sword at the end of it a sword made from his own body he challenged lancelot backed him up to the trees at the eastern side of the glade with that sword and then with effortless primeval strength brought his mighty hammer swinging across in an obliterating blow which was eluded desperately by the man lancelot hurled himself down and to one side in a roll that took him under the crushing hammer and over the simultaneously slashing sword and then even as he landed he was somehow on his knees and lashing out backhanded with his own bladeto completely sever curdardhs newest arm at the shoulder the stone sword fell harmlessly on the grass flidais caught his breath in wonder and awe then after a moment of wild irrational hope he exhaled again a long sigh of sorrow for the demon only laughedunwearied unhurtand shaped another limb from its slategrey torso another limb with another sword exactly as before and it was attacking again without slackening without respite once more lancelot dodged the deepforged hammer once more he parried a thrust of the stone sword and this time with a motion too swift to clearly follow he knifed in himself and stabbed upward at the earth demons dark maggotencrusted head that had to cause it pain flidais thought astonished still to find how much he cared and he seemed to be right for curdardh hesitated rumbling wordlessly before sinuously beginning to change again shaping this time into a living creature of featureless stone invulnerable impervious to blade wherever forged however wielded and it began to track the man about the small ambit of the glade to cut him off and crush the life out of him flidais realized then that he had been right from the first every time lancelot did damage any kind of injury the demon could withdraw into a shape that was impregnable it could heal itself of any sworddelivered wound while still forcing the tiring man to elude its dangerous pursuit even with the crippled leg flidais sawritually maimed millennia ago to signify the tethering of the demon to guardianship of this placecurdardh was agile and deadly and the glade was small and the trees of the grove around and the spirits watching there would not allow the man any escape however momentary from the sacrosanct place he had violated and where he was to die he and someone else tearing his eyes away from the grueling hurtful combat flidais looked over to his right the boy his face bone white was watching with an expression absolutely unreadable as he looked at rakoths son flidais felt the same instinctive withdrawal he had known on the beach by the anor and he was honest enough to name it fear then he thought about who the mother was and he looked back again at lancelot battling silently in darkness for this childs life and he mastered his own doubts and walked over the grass at the edge of the glade to darien i am flidais he said thereby breaking his own oldest rule for such things what were rules though he was thinking on a night such as this talking to such a one as this child was darien moved sideways a couple of steps shying away from closer proximity his eyes never left the two figures fighting in front of them i am a friend to your mother flidais said struggling uncharacteristically for the right words i ask you to believe that i mean you no malice for the first time the boy turned to him it doesnt really matter he said scarcely above a whisper you cant make any difference can you the choice is being taken away chilled flidais seemed to see him clearly for the first time suddenly aware in that moment of how young darien was and how fair and for his vision was keen in the darkness of how blue the boys eyes were he couldnt though however hard he tried escape the image of their crimson flashing on the beach and the blaze of the burning tree there was a sudden loud rumble of sound from the glade and flidais pressed quickly back against the trunk of one of the trees not six feet away lancelot was retreating toward them pursued with a sound like dragging scree by the demon in its impervious rock shape as lancelot drew near flidais saw that his whole body was laced with a network of cuts and purpling bruises blood flowed freely from his left shoulder and his right side his clothing hung in tattered bloodstained ribbons from bis body and his thick black hair lay plastered to his head rivulets of perspiration ran continuously down his face every few moments it seemed he had to lift his free hand ignoring the wound and claw sweat free from his eyes so he could see insofar as he could see at all for he was only mortal and unaided and even the halfmoon had long since passed out of sight to the west hidden by the towering trees that ringed the glade only a handful of stars looked down from above on this act of courage by the tormented scintillant soul of lancelot du lacthe single most gallant impossible act of courage ever woven into the tapestry bound by his own duty to the wood and by the power of that place flidais watched helplessly as the two of them drew closer yet he saw lancelot lithe and neatfooted mastering pain and weariness drop to one knee just out of reach of the advancing demon and lunging forward and down level a scything blow of his sword at the demons leg the only part of the slategrey rock shape that was not impervious to iron but nimbly for all its grotesque worminfested ugliness the demon of the grove spun away from the thrust with terrifying speed he shaped a new sword arm and even as the weapon coalesced launched a savage blow downward against the sprawling man who rolled in a racking contorted movement and thrust up his own bright blade to meet the overpowering descent of curdardhs stone sword the blades met with a crash that shook the glade flidais clenched his fists his heart hammering and then he saw that even agamst this even against the full brutal strength of the demons arm lancelot had held firm his blade did not break nor his muscled arm give way the swords met and it was the stone that shattered as lancelot rolled again away from the edge of the glade and scrambled chest heaving convulsively to his feet with flidais saw another wound a jagged fragment of the broken sword of the demon had cut him anew his shirt shredded to confining strips lancelot tore it off and stood barechested in the middle of the glade dark blood welling from a wound over his heart he balanced on the balls of his feet his unflinching eyes on his adversary his sword held out once more as he waited for curdardh to come at him again and curdardh with the primeval pitiless unwearied power of earth came once more shifting shape away from the awkward though invulnerable guise of rock once more it gave itself a headalmost human it was though with only a single monstrous eye in the center from which black grubs and beetles fell like tearsand once more most terribly it brought forth the colossal hammer from some place within itself taking hold of it with an arm so brawny it seemed as thick around as lancelot was at the chest the demon surged forward seeming to cover the space of the glade with one huge stride and roaring like an avalanche brought the hammer crashing down on the waiting man who dodged yet again though narrowly for the demon was brutally swift flidais felt the ground shake again with the impact of the blow and when curdardh moved on pursuing always pursuing the watching andain saw a smoking hole in the scorched grass of the glade where the hammer had fallen like doom on it went on and on till flidais driving his nails unconsciously into the palms of his hands thought that his own heart would shatter from strain and weariness again and again lancelot eluded the ruinous hammer and the slashing swords the demon shaped from its own body twice more the man succeeded in severing the arms that swung the stone blades and twice more he was able to leap in with a shining grace worthy of the watching stars and wound curdardh once in the eye and then in the neck forcing it each time into the protective recuperative shape of rock this gave some respite to the man but only a little for even in that form the demon could attack striving to corner lancelot against the impervious wall of the trees ringing the glade and crush his life away against the dark mottled mass of its body once more an attack brought demon and man near to where flidais stood beside darien and once more lancelot managed to fling himself away but this time his shoulder landed in one of the smoking holes the hammer had gouged and flidais heard him grunt involuntarily with pain and saw him scramble with an awkward desperation this time away from the renewed assault he was burnt now the andain realized horror and pity consuming his own soul he heard a strangled sound from beside him and realized that darien too had registered what had happened he looked over briefly at the boy and his heart stopped literally for a moment over and over in his hands darien was twisting a bright dagger blade seeming almost oblivious to the fact that he was doing so flidais had glimpsed a telling flash of blue and so he knew what that blade was be careful he whispered urgently he coughed his throat was dry what are you thinking of doing for only the second time darien looked directly at him i dont know the boy said painfully young i made my eyes red before you came that is how i have my power flidais fought successfully this time to conceal his fear he nodded darien went on but nothing happened the rock thing said it was because i did not go deep enough to master it that i had no power here so i he paused and looked down at the knife i thought i might through the black night and through the blackness of what was happening and the pity and horror he felt flidais of pendaran seemed to see within his mind a faint almost illusionary light gleaming in a far far distance a little light like the small cast glow of a candle in a cottage window at night seen by a traveler in a storm far from home he said in his rich deep voice it is a good thought darien it is worthy of you and worthy of the one who is doing this for you but do not do it now and not with that blade why darien asked in a small voice once shall i tell you and for your ears only and once is enough for those who are wise flidais intoned reverting if briefly to his cryptic elusiveness he felt a familiar rush of pleasure even here even with what was happening that he knew this and that reminded himpast pleasure reaching joyof what else now he knew and remembering that he remembered also that he had sworn an oath earlier that night to try to shape a light from the darkness all around he looked at darien hesitating then said quite directly what you are holding is named lokdal it is the enchanted dagger of the dwarves give to colan dan conary a long time ago he closed his eyes for a moment to summon up the exact phrasing given him by a winedrowsy mage one spring night seven hundred years ago beside an evening fire on the edge of the llychlyn marsh who strikes with this blade without love in his heart said flidais as the words came back shall surely die and then he told the rest of it who kills with love may make of his soul a gift to the one marked with the pattern on the daggers haft potent words and a deepdelved intricate magic darien was looking down gazing at the traced pattern on the hilt of the blade he glanced up again and said so quietly flidais had to strain to hear him i wouldnt wish my soul on anything alive and then after a pause the andain heard him say my gift was to be the dagger itself before i was brought to this place a gift to whom flidais asked though within himself he knew to my father of course said darien that i might find a welcome somewhere in the worlds there had to be something to say to that flidais was thinking there had to be an adequate response so much depended on it but he couldnt think for once he couldnt find words and then suddenly he didnt have time for them either there came a rumbling crash from the glade louder than any before and this time there was a resonance of triumph within it flidais turned back just in time to see lancelot hurtle through the air clipped by the very end of a hammer swing hed not quite dodged it would have smashed the life from him had it hit more squarely as it was the merest glancing blow had knocked him flying halfway across the glade to a bruising crumpled landing beside darien curdardh tireless sensing an ending at last was advancing toward him again dripping blood desperately weary his left arm now hanging uselessly at his side lancelot somehow by an effort of will flidais could not even comprehend dragged himself to his feet in the instant before the demon was upon him he turned to darien flidais saw their eyes lock and hold then he heard lancelot say quickly in a voice drained of all inflection one final cast in memory of gawain i have nothing left count ten for me then scream and then pray to whatever you like he had time for no more sidestepping with a halfspin he launched himself in another rolling dive away from the murderous hammer it smote the ground where he had stood and flidais flinched back from the thunder of that stroke and the heat that roared up from the riven ground curdardh wheeled lancelot was on his feet again swaying a little the demon made a loose spilling sound and slowly advanced flidais felt as if his heart was going to tear apart in his chest even as he stood there the ticking seconds were the longest he had ever known in a long life he was a guardian of the wood of this grove as much as was curdardh these two had defiled the glade three he couldnt look at darien the demon slashed with his sword lancelot parried stumbling five again curdardh thrust with the stone blade the gigantic hammer held high in readiness again the man defended himself he almost fell flidais suddenly heard a rustling of anticipation in the leaves of the watching trees seven chained to silence forced to bear witness the andain tasted blood in his mouth he had bitten his tongue curdardh fluid sinuous utterly unwearied moved forward feinting with the sword flidais saw the hammer rise higher he lifted his hands in a useless pitiful gesture of denial and in that instant a sound such as flidais had never heard in all his years exploded from darien it was a scream of anguish and rage of terror and blinding agony torn whole and bleeding from a tortured soul it was monstrous insupportable overwhelming flidais battered to his knees by the pain of it saw curdardh quickly glance backward and lancelot made his move with two quick strides and a straining upward leap he slashed his bright blade downward with stupefying strength and completely severed the arm that hed never been able to reach until now the arm that held the monstrous hammer the demon roared with shock and pain but even as it did it was already causing itself to flow back over the amputated limb growing it again flidais saw that out of the corner of one eye but he was watching lancelot who had landed neatly from his unbelievable blow who had hurled his sword away from him toward darien and flidais and who was bending now breathing harshly over the hammer of curdardh his left arm was useless he wrapped his right hand about the shaft and groaning with the effort fought to lift it and failed the hammer was vast unimaginably heavy it was the weapon of a demon of the oldest one it had been forged in fires deeper than the chasms of dana and lancelot du lac was only a man flidais saw the demon shape two new swords from its body he saw it advance again with a wet gurgling sound of rage and pain lancelot glanced up and flidais on his knees unable to move unable to so much as breathe was given a new measure in that moment of the magnitude of mortal man he saw lancelot will himselfthere was no other wordto raise the black hammer with one hand and it moved the handle came off the ground and then beyond comprehension so did the monstrous head the demon stopped with a grinding sound as lancelot his mouth wide open in a soundless scream of uttermost endeavoring used the initial momentum of that lifting to wheel himself through a full circle his arm extended flat out the muscles ridged corded glistening the hammer inexorably rising with the speed of his motion then he let it fly and that mighty hammer forged in downwardburning fires thrown with all the passion of an unmatched soul smashed into the chest of curdardh the oldest one with a sound like the earths crust cracking and it shattered the demon of the grove into fragments and pieces and shards killing it utterly flidais felt the silence as a weight upon his life he had never known pendaran to be so still not a leaf rustled not a spirit whispered the powers of the wood lay as if enchanted in an awed stupefaction flidais had a sense absurdly that even the stars above the glade had ceased to move the loom itself lying silent and still the weavers hands at rest he looked down on his own trembling hands and then slowly he stood up feeling the motion like a returning into time from another world entirely he walked over amid the silence to stand by the man in the center of the grove lancelot had pulled himself to a sitting position his knees bent his head lowered between them his left arm hung uselessly at his side there was dark blood on the grass and it was welling still from half a dozen wounds there was an ugly burn on his shoulder raw and blistered where he had rolled in the scorching pit of a hammer blow then flidais coming nearer saw the other burn and his breath lodged painfully in his chest where the mans handonce so beautifulhad gripped the hammer of curdardh the skin of his palm was blackened and peeled away in thick strips of violated flesh oh lancelot the andain murmured it came out as a croak almost inaudible slowly the man lifted his head his eyes clouded with pain met those of flidais and then unbelievably the thinnest trace of a smile lifted the corners of his mouth taliesin he whispered i thought i saw you i am sorry he gasped and looked down at the seared flesh of his palm then he looked away and continued i am sorry i could not greet you properly before flidais shook his head mutely he opened his mouth but no words came he cleared his throat and tried again formally it has been told for centuries that you were never matched in your day of earthly knights hand what you battled tonight was not mortal and should never have been defeated i have never seen a thing to match it and i never will what may i offer you my lord lancelot the mortal eyes holding his own seemed to grow clearer your silence taliesin i need your silence about what happened here lest all the worlds learn of my shame shame flidais felt his voice crack lancelot lifted his head to gaze at the high stars overhead this was single combat he said quietly and i sought aid from the boy it will be a mark against my name for so long as time shall run in the name of the loom flidais snapped what idiocy is this what about the trees and the powers of the wood that aided curdardh and hemmed you in what about this battleground where the demons power was greater than anywhere else what about the darkness where it could see and you could not what about even so murmured lancelot and the little andains sharp voice was stilled even so i besought aid in single combat is that so terrible said a new voice flidais turned darien had come forward from the edge of the glade his expression was calm now but flidais could still see the shadow of its contorted anguish when the boy had screamed we both would have died darien went on why is it so terrible to have asked that one small thing lancelot swung to look at him there was a moments stillness then he said save in one thing only a love for which i will make eternal redress i have served the light in everything i have ever done in that service a victory won with a tool of the dark is no victory at all darien took a step backward do you mean me he asked a tool of the no lancelot murmured quietly flidais felt his cold fear coming back as he looked at the boy no i mean the thing i did you saved my life darien said it sounded like an accusation he did not step forward again and you mine quietly still why darien shouted suddenly why did you do it the man closed his eyes for a moment then opened them because your mother asked me to he said simply with the words flidais heard a rustling in the leaves again there was an ache in his heart darien stood as if poised for flight but he had not yet moved she knew i was going to my father he said less loudly did she tell you do you know that you have saved me to do that lancelot shook his head he lifted his voice though clearly it took an effort i have saved you to follow your road darien laughed the sound knifed into flidais and if it leads north the boy asked coldly in a voice that sounded older suddenly due north to the dark to rakoth maugrim lancelots eyes were undisturbed his voice utterly calm then it leads there by your choice darien only thus are we not slaves if we can choose where we would walk failing that all is mockery there was a silence broken to flidais horror by the sound of darien laughing again bitter lonely lost it is though said the boy it is all mockery the light went out when i put it on dont you know that and why why should i choose to walk in any case there was an instant of silence no flidais cried reaching out to the child too late perhaps it had always been too late from birth from conception amid the unlight of starkadh from the time the worlds first were spun flidais thought heartsick the eyes blazed savagely red there came a roaring sound from the powers of the wood a blurring of shapes in the grove and suddenly darien was not there anymore instead an owl gleaming white in the darkness darted swiftly down into the grass seized a fallen dagger in its mouth and was aloft and away wheeling out of sight to the north to the north flidais gazed at the circle of night sky framed by the towering trees and with all his soul he tried to will a shape to be there the shape of a white owl returning flying back to land beside them and turn into a child again a fair child with mild blue eyes who had chosen the light and been chosen by it to be a bright blade in the looming dark he swallowed he looked away from the empty sky he turned back to lancelotwho was on his feet bleeding burnt swaying with fatigue what are you doing flidais cried lancelot looked down on him i am following he said calmly as if it were the most obvious thing imaginable will you help me with my sword he held up his mangled palm his left arm hung at his side are you mad the andain spluttered lancelot made a sound that managed to be a laugh i have been mad he admitted a long time ago but not now little one what would you have me do lie here and lick my wounds in a time of war flidais did a little dance of sheer exasperation what role can you play if you kill yourself i am aware that im not good for much right now lancelot said gravely but i dont think these wounds are going to youre going to follow the andain interrupted as the full import of lancelots words struck him lancelot hes an owl now hes flying by the time you even get out of pendaran he will be he stopped abruptly in midsentence what is it what have you thought of wise child he hadnt been a child for a very long time but he had indeed thought of something he looked up at the man saw the blood on his bare chest he was going to fly due north that will take him over the western edge of daniloth and and he may not get through time is very strange in the shadowland my sword said lancelot crisply please somehow flidais found himself collecting the discarded blade and then the scabbard he came back to lancelot and as gently as he could buckled the sword about the mans waist will the spirits of the wood let me pass lancelot asked quietly flidais paused to listen to the messages passing around them and beneath their feet they will he said at length not a little surprised for guinevere and for your blood spilled tonight they do you honor lancelot more than i merit the man said he drew a deep breath as if gathering reserves of endurance from where flidais knew not he scowled upward at lancelot you will go easier with a guide i will take you to the borders of daniloth but i have a condition which is always the mild courtesy one of my homes lies on our way you will have to let me dress your wounds when we come there i will be grateful for it said lancelot the andain opened his mouth a cutting retort readied he never said it instead he turned and stomped from the grove walking north when he had gone a short way he stopped and looked back to see a thing of wonder lancelot was following slowly on the dark and narrow path all about him and from high above the mighty trees of pendaran wood were letting fall their green leaves gently on a night in the midst of summer to honor the passage of the man part iiicalor diman chapter she had flamed red to travel once before in her own world not this one from stonehenge to glastonbury tor it was not like the crossings passing between the worlds was a coldness and a dark a time without time deeply unsettling this was different when the baelrath blazed to let her travel kim felt as if she truly touched the immensity of its power of her own power she could blink distance to nothingness she was wilder than any other magic known more akin to macha and red nemain in those hurtling seconds than to any mortal woman ever born with one difference an awareness harbored deep within herheart that they were goddesses those two profoundly in control of what they were and she she was a mortal woman only that and as much borne by the baelrath as bearing it and thinking so carrying her ring carried by it she found herself coming down with loren and mattthree mortals riding the currents of time and twilit spaceonto a cleared threshold high up in sharp mountain air before them two mighty bronze doors towered in majesty worked with intricate designs in blue thieren and shining gold kim turned to the south and saw the wild dark hills of eridu rolling away into shadow land where the death rain had fallen above her some night bird of the high places lifted a long lonely cry she listened to its echoes fading thinking of the paraiko moving even now among those desolate tarns and the highwalled plagueravaged cities beyond gathering the raindead cleansing eridu she turned north a gleam of light from high above drew her eyes she looked up far up beyond the grandeur of the twinned doors of the kingdom of the dwarves to see the peaks of banir lok and banir tal as they caught the last light of the setting sun the bird called again one long quavering descending note far off there was another gleam as if in answer to the daysend shining of the twin peaks overhead to the north and west higher by far than anything else rangat claimed the last of the light for its own none of them had spoken kim looked over at matt sören and her hands closed involuntarily at her side forty years she thought gazing at her friend who had once beenwho yet wasthe true king of the realm beyond these doors his arms were spread wide hands open in a gesture of propitiation and utmost vulnerability in his face she read clear as calligraphy the marks of longing of bitterness and bitterest pain she turned away to meet the eyes of loren silvercloak in them she saw the burden of his own difficult complex grief and guilt she rememberedknew that loren had never forgottenmatts telling them all in paras derval about the tide of calor diman in his heart the tide he had fought ceaselessly for the forty years hed served as source to the onetime mage she turned back to the doors even in the dusk she could make out the exquisite tracery of gold and thieren it was very quiet she heard the thin sound of a pebble dislodged somewhere and falling the twin peaks were dark now overhead and dark too she knew would be calor diman the crystal lake high and hidden in its meadow bowl between the mountains the first stars appeared delicately in the clear sky kim looked down at her hand the ring flickered quietly its surge of power spent she tried to think of something to say of words to ease the sorrows of this threshold but she feared there might be danger in sound beyond that there was a texture a woven weight to this silence that she sensed was not hers to shoulder or to shoulder aside it encompassed the spun threads of the lives of the two men here with her and morethe long manystranded destiny of an ancient people of the dwarves of banir lok and banir tal it went back too far beyond her even with her own twinned soul so she kept her peace heard another pebble dislodged another bird cry farther away and then listened as matt sören finally spoke very softly never looking around loren hear me i regret nothing not a breath not a moment not the shadow of a moment this is truth my friend and i swear it to be such in the name of the crystal i fashioned long ago the crystal i threw in the lake on the night the full moon made me king there is no weaving the loom could have held to my name that i can imagine to be richer than the one i have known he lowered his hands slowly still facing the awesome grandeur of the doors when he spoke again his voice was rougher and even lower than before i am glad though that the threads of my days have brought me to this place again before the end loving him loving them both kim wanted to weep forty years she thought again something shone in the depths of lorens eyes shone as the twin peaks had with the last of the sun she felt a swirl of mountain winds on the high threshold heard a sound behind her of gravel sliding was turning to see when the blow fell on the base of her skull and knocked her sprawling to the ground she felt consciousness sliding away tried desperately to cling to it as if it were a physical thing that could be held that had to be held but despairing she knew she was going to fail it was going sliding pain exploding in her head blackness coming down there were sounds she could not see she was lying on the stony plateau before the doors and the last thought she had was of brutal selfmockery akin to the goddesses of war she had imagined herself only moments ago yet for all the arrogance of that and for all the gifts of the seers that ysanne had lavished upon her shed not been able to sense a simple ambush that was her last thought the very last thing she felt with a helpless terror that went beyond thought was someone taking the baelrath from her hand she tried to cry out to resist to flame but then it seemed as if a slow wide river had come and it carried her away into the dark she opened her eyes the room rocked and spun both the floor dropped sickeningly away then rushed precipitously back toward her she had a stupefying headache and even without moving a hand to feel it knew she had to have an eggsized lump on the back of her head lying carefully motionless she waited for things to settle it took a while eventually she sat up she was in a windowless chamber by herself there was a pearly light mercifully gentle in the room though she couldnt see where it was coming from the stone walls themselves it seemed and the ceiling there was no door either or none that she could see a chair and a footstool stood in one corner on a low table beside them rested a basin of water which reminded her of how thirsty she was the table seemed a long way off though she decided to wait a few moments before chancing that journey she was sittinghad been lyingon a small bed at least a foot too short for her which reminded her of where she was she remembered something else and looked down the ring was gone she had not imagined that last terrible sensation she thought she was going to be sick she thought of kaen who was leader here though not king kaen and his brother blod who had broken the wardstone of eridu who had found the cauldron of khath meigol and given it to maugrim and now they had the baelrath kim felt naked without it though she still wore the belted gown shed been wearing all day from the time shed risen in the cottage and seen darien all day she didnt even know what day it was she had no idea of the time but the diffused light emanating from the stone had the hue of dawn to it she wondered about that and about the absence of any door the dwarves she knew could do marvelous things with stone under their mountains they could also under kaen and blod be servants of the dark such as maugrim had never had before she thought about lokdal and then of course about darien the constant fear at the bedrock of everything apprehension mastered sickness and pain driving her to her feet she had to get out too much was happening too much depended on her the surge of panic faded leaving her with the sudden grim awareness that without the baelrath not much in fact really did depend on her anymore she tried to take heart from the simple fact that she was still alive they had not killed her and there was water here and a clean towel she tried to draw strength from the presence of such things tried and failed the ring was gone eventually she did walk over to the low table she drank deeply of the watersome property of the stone basin had kept it chilledand washed herself jolted breathlessly awake by the cold she probed her wound a bruise large very tender but there was no laceration for small favors she gave thanks things do happen she remembered her grandfather saying in the days after her gran had died we got to soldier on he had said she set her jaw a certain resolution came back into her grey eyes she sat down in the chair put her feet up on the stool and composed herself to wait grim and ready as the color of the light all around gradually grew brighter and then brighter still through the hours of what had to be morning outside echoed by craft or magic or some fusion of both in the glowing of the stones within the mountain a door opened or rather a door appeared in the wall opposite kim and then swung soundlessly outward kim was on her feet her heart racing and then she was suddenly very confused she could never have explained rationally why the presence of a dwarf woman should surprise her so much why shed assumed without ever giving it a moments thought that the females among the dwarves should look like oh beardless stocky equivalents of fighting men like matt and brock after all she herself didnt much resemble coll of taerlindel or dave martyniuk at least on a good day she didnt neither did the woman who had come for her a couple of inches shorter than matt sören she was slim and graceful with wideset dark eyes and straight black hair hanging down her back for all the delicate beauty of the woman kim nonetheless sensed in her the same resilience and fortitude shed come to know in brock and matt formidable deeply valued allies the dwarves would be and very dangerous enemies with everything she knew with the pain in her head and the baelrath gone with the memory of what blod had done to jennifer in starkadh and the brutal awareness of the death rain unleashed by the cauldron it was still somehow hard to confront this woman as an avowed foe a weakness a mistake kim wondered but nevertheless she managed a half smile i was wondering when someone would come she said im kimberly i know the other woman said not returning the smile we have been told who you are and what i am sent to bring you to seithrs hall the dwarfmoot is gathering the king has returned i know said kim dryly trying to keep the irony out of her tone and the quick surge of hope what is happening a challenge before the elders of the moot a wordstriving the first in forty years between kaen and matt sören no more questions we have little time kim wasnt good with orders wait she said tell me who who do you support the other woman looked up at her with eyes dark and unrevealing no more questions i said she turned and went out pushing her hair back with one hand kim hastened to follow they turned left out the door and made their way along a series of ascending highceilinged corridors lit by the same diffused naturalseeming light that had brightened her room there were beautifully sculpted torch brackets along the walls but they were not in use it was daytime kim concluded the torches would be lit at night there were no decorations on the walls but at intervalsrandom or regulated by some pattern she had no chance to discernkim saw a number of low plinths or pillars and resting on top of each of them were crystalline works of art exquisite and strange most were abstract shapes that caught and reflected the light of the corridors but some were not she saw a spear embedded in a mountain of glass a crystal eagle with a wingspan fully five feet across and at a junction of many hallways a dragon looked down from the highest pedestal of all she had no time to admire or even think about any of this or about the fact that the hallways of this kingdom under the two mountains were so empty despite the width of the corridorsclearly built to allow the passage of great numbersshe and the dwarf woman passed only a few other people men and women of the dwarves all of whom stopped in their tracks to gaze up at kimberly with cold repressive stares she began to be afraid again the art and mastery of the crystal sculptures the casual power inherent in the vanishing doorways and the corridor lighting the very fact of a race of people dwelling for so very long under the mountains kim found herself feeling more alien here than she had anywhere else in fionavar and her own wild power was gone it had been entrusted to her dreamt by a seer on her hand and she had lost it they had left her the vellin bracelet though her screen and protection from magic she wondered why were vellin stones so commonplace here as to be not worth taking she had no time to think this through either no time just then for anything but awe for her guide turned a last corridor and kim following her did the same and stood within one of the vast arched entranceways to the hall named for seithr king during the bael rangat even the paraiko she thought let alone mortal men or the lios alfar would be made to feel small in this place and thinking so she came most of the way to an awareness of why the dwarves had built their moot hall on this scale on the level she and her guide were on there were eight other arched entrances to the circular chamber each of them as lofty and imposing as the one wherein she stood looking up dumbfounded kim saw that there were two other levels of access to the chamber and on each of these as well nine arches allowed entry into the prodigious hall dwarves were filtering through all the arches on all three levels a cluster of dwarf women walked past just then pausing to fix kim with a collective regard stern and unrevealing then they went in seithrs hall was laid out in the manner of an amphitheater the ceiling of the chamber was so high and the light all around so convincingly natural that it seemed to kim as if they might indeed be outside in the clear cold air of the mountains caught in that illusion still gazing upward she saw that there seemed to be birds of infinite variety wheeling and circling in the huge bright spaces high above the hall light flashed manycolored from their shapes and she realized that these too were creations of the dwarves held aloft and in apparent freedom of flight by a craft or art beyond her comprehension a dazzle of light from the stage below drew her eye and she looked down after a moment she recognized what she was looking at and as soon as she did her gaze whipped back incredulous to the circling birds overhead from which the reflection of color and light was exactly the same as it was from the two objects below which meant that the birds even the spectacular eagles were made not of crystal as were the sculptures she had seen in the corridors as they approached but of diamond for resting on deep red cushions on a stone table in the middle of the stage were the diamond crown and scepter of the dwarves kim felt a childish desire to rub her eyes in disbelief to discover if when she took her hands away she would still see what she was seeing now there were diamond eagles overhead how could the people who were able to place them there who wanted them there be allies of the dark and yet and yet from the real sky outside these mountain halls a death rain had fallen on eridu for three full nights and days and it had fallen because of what the dwarves had done for the first time she became aware that her guide was watching her with a cool curiosity to gauge her response to the splendor of the hall perhaps to glory in it she was awed and humbled she had never seen anything like it not even in her seers dreams and yet she put her hands in the pockets of her gown very pretty she said casually i like the eagles how many of the real ones died in the rain and was rewardedif it really was a rewardto see the dwarf woman go as pale as the stone walls of kims room had been when she awoke at dawn she felt a quick surge of pity but fiercely suppressed it looking away they had freed rakoth they had taken her ring and this woman had been sufficiently trusted by kaen to be sent to bring kim to this place not all the birds died her guide said very low so as not to be overheard it seemed i went up by the lake yesterday morning there were some eagles there kim clenched her fists isnt that just wonderful she said as coldly as she could for how much longer do you think if rakoth maugrim defeats us the dwarf womans glance fell away before the stony rage in kims eyes kaen says there have been promises she whispered he says she stopped after a long moment she looked kim squarely in the face again with the hardihood of her race do we really have any choice now she asked bitterly looking at her her anger sluicing away kim felt as if she finally understood what had happened what was still happening within these halls she opened her mouth to speak but in the moment there came a loud murmur from within seithrs hall and she quickly glanced over at the stage loren silvercloak limping slightly leaning on amairgens white staff was making his way behind another dwarf woman to a seat near the stage kim felt an overwhelming relief only momentarily thoughfor as loren came to his seat she saw armed guards move to take up positions on either side of him come her own guide said her cool detachment completely restored by the pause i am to lead you to that place as well and so pushing back that one aggravating strand of hair yet again walking as regally and as tall as she could kim followed her into the moot hall ignoring the renewed rustle of sound that greeted her appearance she descended the long wide aisle between the seats on either side never turning her head and pausing before loren chanced and succeeded in the first curtsy of her life in the same grave spirit he bowed to her and bringing one of her hands to his lips kissed it she thought of diarmuid and jen the first night they had come to fionavar most of a long lifetime ago it seemed she gave lorens hand a squeeze and then ignoring the guards let her glanceimperious she devoutly hopedsweep over the assembled dwarves doing so she noticed something she turned back to loren and said softly almost all women why women and older men and the members of the moot who will be coming out soon oh kim my dear why do you think his eyesso kind she remembered them beingseemed to hold a crushing weight of trouble within their depths silence one of the guards snapped not harshly but his tone meant business it didnt matter lorens expression had told her what she had to know she felt the weight of knowledge that he carried come into her as well women and the old and the councillors of the moot the men in their prime the warriors away away of course at war she didnt need to be told which side they would be fighting on if kaen had sent them forth and in that moment kaen himself came forth from the far wing of the stage and so for the first time she saw the one who had unchained blackest evil in their time quietly without any evident pride or arrogance he strode to stand at one side of the stone table his thick hair was raven black his beard closely trimmed he was slighter than matt or brock not as powerful except for one thing his hands were those of a sculptor large capable very strong he rested one of them on the table although carefully he did not touch the crown he was clad unpretentiously in simple brown and his eyes betrayed no hint of madness or delusions they were meditative tranquil almost sorrowful there was another footfall on the stage kim tore her eyes away from kaen to watch matt sören step forward from the near wing she expected a babble of noise a murmur some level of response but the dwarf she knew and lovedunchanged she saw always unchanged no matter what might come to passmoved to stand at the other side of the table from kaen and as he came there was not a single thread of sound in all the vastness of seithrs hall in the well of that silence matt waited scanning the dwarves assembled there with his one dark eye she heard the guards shift restively behind her then without any fuss at all matt took the diamond crown and placed it upon his head it was as if a tree in a dry forest had been struck by lightning so explosive was the response her heart leaping kim heard a shocked roar of sound ignite the hall in the thunder of it she felt anger and confusion strove to detect a hint of joy and thought that she did but her gaze had gone instinctively to kaen as soon as matt claimed the crown kaens mouth was crooked in a wry caustic smile unruffled even amused but his eyes had given him away for in them kim had seen if only for an instant a bleak vicious malevolence she read murder there and it knifed into her heart powerless a prisoner fear within her like a living sharpclawed creature kim turned back to matt and felt her racing heartbeat slow even with a crown of a thousand diamonds dazzling upon his head the aura of him the essence was still a quiet reassuring certitude an everlasting calm he raised one hand and waited patiently for silence when he had it nearly he said calor diman never surrenders her kings nothing more and he did not say it loudly but the acoustics of that chamber carried his words to the farthest corners of seithrs hall when their resonance had died away the silence once more was complete into it emerging from either wing of the stage there came some fifteen or twenty dwarves they were all clad in black and kim saw that each of them wore upon the third finger of his right hand a diamond ring gleaming like white fire none of them were young but the one who came first was the eldest by far whitebearded and leaning for support upon a staff he paused to let the others file past him to stone seats placed on one side of the stage the dwarfmoot loren whispered softly they will judge between kaen and matt the one with the staff is miach first of the moot judge what kim whispered back apprehensively the wordstriving loren murmured not very helpfully of the same kind as the one matt lost forty years ago when the moot judged in favor of kaen and voted to continue the search for the cauldron silence hissed the same guard as before he emphasized the command by striking loren on the arm with his hand not gently silvercloak turned swiftly and fixed the guard with a gaze that made the dwarf stumble quickly backward blanching i am i am ordered to keep you quiet he stammered i do not intend to say overmuch loren said but if you touch me again i will turn you into a geiala and roast you for lunch once warned is all you will be he turned back to the stage his face impressive it was a bluff nothing more kim knew but she also realized that none of the dwarves not even kaen could know what had happened to the mages powers in cader sedat miach had moved forward the click of his staff on the stone sounding loud in the silence he took a position in front of kaen and matt a little to one side after bowing with equal gravity to each of them he turned and addressed the assembled dwarves daughters and sons of calor diman you will have heard why we are summoned to seithrs hall matt who was king once here under banir lok has returned and has satisfied the moot that he is who he claims to be this is so despite the passage of forty years he carries a second name nowsörento mark the loss of an eye in a war far from our mountains a war miach added quietly in which the dwarves had no proper role to play kim winced out of the corner of her eye she saw loren bite his lower lip in consternation miach continued in the same judicious tones be that as it may matt sören it is who is here again and last night before the convened moot he issued challenge to kaen who has ruled us these forty yearsruled but only by the support and sufferance of the dwarfmoot not as a true king for he has never shaped a crystal for the lake nor spent a night beside her shores under the full moon there was a tiny ripple of sound at that it was kaens turn to react his expression of attentive deference did not change but kim watching closely saw his hand on the table close into a fist a moment later he seemed to become aware of this and the fist opened again be that as it may miach said a second time you are summoned to hear and the moot to judge a wordstriving after the old kind such as we have not seen in forty yearssince last these two stood before us i have lived long enough by a grace of the weavers hand upon my thread to say that a pattern is unfolding here with a symmetry that bears witness to interwoven destinies he paused then looking directly at kim to her great surprise he said there are two here not of our people tidings are slow to come across the mountains and slower still to come within them but the dwarves know well of loren silvercloak the mage whose source was once our king and matt sören has named the woman here as seer to the high king of brennin he has also undertaken to stand surety with his life that both of them will not wield the magics we know they carry and will accept whatever judgment the dwarfmoot makes of this striving matt sören has said this i now ask that they acknowledge by whatever oath they deem most binding that this is true in return i offer the assurance of the dwarfmoot to which kaen has accededindeed it was his suggestionthat they will be conducted safely from our realm if such need be after the striving is judged lying snake kim thought furiously looking at kaens bland earnest expression she schooled her features though placed her ringless hand in the pocket of her gown and listened as loren rose from his seat to say in the name of seithr greatest of the dwarf kings who died in the cause of light battling rakoth maugrim and the legions of the dark i swear that i will abide by the words you have spoken he sat down another rustle quiet but unmistakable went through the hall take that kim thought as in her turn she rose she felt ysanne within her then twin soul under the twin mountains and when she spoke it was with a seers voice that rang out sternly in the huge spaces in the name of the paraiko of khath meigol gentlest of the weavers children the giants who are not ghosts who live and even now are cleansing eridu gathering the innocent dead of the cauldrons killing rain i swear that i will abide by the words you have spoken more than a murmur now an urgent cascade of sound that is a lie an old dwarf shouted from high up in the hall his voice cracked the cauldron we found brought life not death kim saw matt looking at her he shook his head very slightly and she kept quiet miach gestured for silence again truth or lies will be for the dwarfmoot to decree he said it is time for the challenge to begin those of you gathered here will know the laws of the wordstriving kaen who governs now will speak first as matt did forty years ago when governance was his they will speak to you not to the moot you who are gathered here are to be as a wall of stone off which their words will come to us silence is law for you and from the weight of it the shape the woven texture will the dwarfmoot seek guidance for the judgment we are to make between these two he paused i have one thing only left to ask though no one else has known a full moon night by calor diman at issue today is matt sörens continued right to wear the diamond crown in fairness then i would ask him to remove it for the striving he turned and kims eyes went with those of everyone else in the hall to matt to discover that having made his initial point he had already placed it again on the stone table between himself and kaen oh clever kim thought fighting to suppress a grin oh clever my dear friend matt nodded gravely to miach who bowed in response turning to kaen miach said simply you may begin he shuffled over leaning upon his staff to take his seat among the others of the dwarfmoot kaens hand kim saw had closed into a fist again at matts smooth anticipation of miachs request hes rattled she thought matt has him way off balance she felt a quick rush of hope and confidence then kaen who had not said a single word until that moment began the wordstriving and as he did all kims hopes were blown away as if they were wispy clouds torn by mountain winds she had thought that gorlaes the chancellor of brennin was a deepvoiced mellifluous speaker she had even feared his persuasiveness in the early days she had heard diarmuid dan ailell in the great hall of paras derval and remembered the power of his light sardonic riveting words she had heard nabrendel of the lios alfar take speech to the edge of music and beyond and within herself engraved on her heart and mind she held close the sound of arthur pendragon speaking to command or to reassurewith him somehow the two became as one but in seithrs hall within banir lok that day she learned how words could be claimed and mastered brought to a scintillant glorious apexturned into diamonds trulyand all in the service of evil of the dark kaen spoke and she heard his voice rise majestically with the passion of a denunciation she heard it swoop downward like a bird of prey to whisper an innuendo or offer a halftruth that soundedeven for a moment to herlike a revelation from the warp and weft of the loom itself she heard it soar with confident assertions of the future and then shape itself into a cutting blade to slash to ribbons the honor of the dwarf who stood beside him who had dared to return and strive a second time with kaen her mouth dry with apprehension kim saw kaens handshis large beautiful artisans handsrise and fall gracefully as he spoke she saw his arms spread suddenly wide in a gesture of entreaty of transparent honesty she saw a hand stab savagely upward to punctuate a question and then fall away open as he spoke what he deemed to bewhat he made them believe to bethe only possible response she saw him point a long shaking finger of undisguised overwhelming rage at the one who had returned and it seemed to her as to all the others in seithrs hall that the denouncing hand was that of a god and it became a source of wonder that matt sören had the temerity still to be standing upright before it instead of crawling on his knees to beg for the merciful death he did not deserve from the weight of the silence miach had said from the shape and texture of it the dwarfmoot would seek guidance as kaen spoke the stillness in seithrs hall was a palpable thing it did have shape and weight and a discernible texture even kim utterly unversed in reading such a subtle message could feel the silent dwarves responding to kaen giving him back his words thousands of voiceless auditors for chorus there was awe in that response and guilt that kaen who had labored so long in the service of his people should be forced yet again to defend himself and his actions beyond these two thingsbeyond awe and guilt there was also a humbled grateful acquiesence in the rightness and clarity of everything kaen said he came one step forward from where he had been standing seeming with that small motion to have come among them to be one with all of them to be speaking directly intimately to every single listener in the hall he said it may be thought that the dwarf beside me now will see farther with his one eye than anyone else in this hall let me remind you of something something i must say before i end for it cries out within me for utterance forty years ago matt the sisterson of march king of the dwarves shaped a crystal for calor diman on a new moon night an act of courage for which i honored him on the next night of the full moon he slept by the shore of the lake as all who would be king must do an act of courage for which i honored him kaen paused i honor him no more he said into the silence i have not honored him since another thing he did forty years agoan act of cowardice that wiped away all memory of courage let me remind you people of the twin mountains let me remind you of the day when he took the scepter lying here beside us and threw it down upon these stones the diamond scepter treated like a stick of wood let me remind you of when he discarded the crown he so arrogantly claimed just nowafter forty years discarded it like a trinket that no longer gave him pleasure and let me remind youthe voice dipped down laden with marrowdeep sorrow that after doing these things matt king under banir lok abandoned us kaen let the grim stillness linger let it gather full weight of condemnation said gently the wordstriving forty years ago was his own choice the submission of the matter of the cauldron of khath meigol to the dwarfmoot was his own decision no one forced his hand no one could he was king under the mountains he ruled not as i have striven to do by consensus and counsel but absolutely wearing the crown wedded to the crystal lake and in pique in spite in petulance when the dwarfmoot honored me by agreeing that the cauldron i sought was a worthy quest for the dwarves king matt abandoned us there was grief in his voice the pain of one bereft in those longago days of sorely needed guidance and support he left us to manage as best we could without him without the kings bond to the lake that has always been the heartbeat of the dwarves for forty years i have been here with blod my brother beside me managing with the dwarfmoots counsel as best i could for forty years matt has been far away seeking fame and his own desires in the wide world across the mountains and now now he would come back after so long now because it suits himhis vanity his pridehe would come back and reclaim the scepter and crown he so contemptuously threw away one more step forward from his mouth to the ear of their hearts do not let him children of calor diman forty years ago you decided that the search for the cauldronthe cauldron of lifewas worthy of us in our time in your service following the decision the dwarfmoot made that day i have labored all these years here among you do not turn away from me now slowly the extended arms came down and kaen was done overhead high above the rigid absolute silence the birds fashioned from diamonds circled and shone her chest tight with strain and apprehension kims glance went with that of everyone else in seithrs hall to matt sören to the friend whose words ever since shed met him had been parceled out in careful plain measures whose strengths were fortitude and watchfulness and an unvoiced depth of caring words had never been marts tools not now not forty years ago when he had lost bitterly his last striving with kaen and losing had surrendered his crown she had an image of how it must have been that day the young proud king newly wedded to the crystal lake afire with its visions of light hating the dark then as he did now with her inner seers eye she could picture it the rage the anguished sense of rejection that kaens victory had created in him she could see him hurling away the crown and she knew he had been wrong to do so in that moment she thought of arthur pendragon another young king new to his crown and his dreams learning of the childincestuous seed of his loinswho was destined to destroy everything arthur shaped and so in a vain attempt to forstall that hed ordered so many infants slain for the sins of good men she grieved for the sins and the way the shuttling of the loom brought them back back as matt had come back again after so long to his mountains to seithrs hall to stand beside kaen before the dwarfmoot praying for him for all the living in search of light knowing how much lay in the balance here kim felt the cast spell of kaens last plea still lingering in the hall and she wondered where matt would ever find anything to match what kaen had done then she learned all of them did we have heard nothing said matt sören nothing at all of rakoth maugrim nothing of war of evil of friends betrayed into the dark we have heard nothing from kaen of the broken wardstone of eridu of the cauldron surrendered to maugrim seithr would weep and curse us through his tears blunt words sharp prosaic unadorned cold and stern they slashed into the hall like a wind blowing away the mists of kaens eloquent imagery hands on his hips his legs spread wide seemingly anchored in the stone matt did not even try to lure or seduce his listeners he challenged them and they listened forty years ago i made a mistake i will not cease to regret for the rest of my days newly crowned unproven unknown i sought approval for what i knew to be right in a striving before the dwarfmoot in this hall i was wrong to do so a king when he sees his way clear must act that his people may follow my way should have been clear and it would have been had i been strong enough kaen and blod who had defied my orders should have been taken to traitors crag upon banir tal and hurled to their deaths i was wrong i was not strong enough i accept as a king must accept my share of the burden for the evils since done the very great evils he said his voice uncompromising in its message who among you if not bewitched or terrified can accept what we have done how far the dwarves have fallen who among you can accept the wardstone broken rakoth freed the cauldron of the paraiko given over unto him and now i must speak of the cauldron the transition was clumsy awkward matt seemed not to care he said before this striving began the seer of brennin spoke of the cauldron as a thing of death and one of youand i remember you edrig you were wise already when i was king in these halls and i never knew any evil to rest in your heartedrig named the seer a liar and said that the cauldron was a thing of life he crossed his arms en his broad chest it is not so once maybe when first forged in khath meigol but not now not in the hands of the unraveller he used the cauldron the dwarves gave him to shape the winter just now past and thengrief to my tongue to tellto cause the death rain to fall on eridu that is a lie said kaen flatly there was a shocked whisper of sound kaen ignored it you are not to tell a pure untruth in wordstriving this you know i claim this contest by virtue of a breaching of the rules the cauldron revives the dead it does not kill every one of us here knows this to be true do we so matt sören snarled wheeling on kaen with such ferocity that the other recoiled dare you speak to say i lie then hear me every one of you hear me did not a mage of brennin come with perverted wisdom and forbidden lore did metran of the garantae not enter these halls to give aid and counsel to kaen and blod silence was his answer the silence of the wordstriving intense rapt shaping itself to surround his questions know you that when the cauldron was found and given over to maugrim it was placed in the care of that mage and he bore it away to cader sedat that island not found on any map which maugrim had made a place of unlife even in the days of the bael rangat in that unholy place metran used the cauldron to shape the winter and then the rain he drew his unnatural magestrength to do these terrible things from a host of svart alfar he killed them draining their life force with the power he took and then used the cauldron to bring them back to life over and over again this is what he did and this children of calor diman descendants of seithr this my beloved people is what we did a lie said kaen again a little desperately how would you know this if he truly took it to that place how would the rain have stopped if this were so this time there was no murmuring and this time matt did not wheel in rage upon the other dwarf very slowly he turned and looked at kaen you would like to know wouldnt you he asked softly the acoustics carried the question all of them heard you would like to know what went wrong we were there kaen with arthur pendragon and diarmuid of brennin and pwyll twiceborn lord of the summer tree we went to cader sedat and we killed metran and we broke the cauldron loren and i did it kaen for the evil done by a mage and the evil done by the dwarves we made what recompense we could in that place kaens mouth opened and then closed again you do not believe me matt went on inexorably mercilessly you want not to believe so your hopes and plans will not have gone so terribly awry do not believe me then believe instead the witness of your eyes and thrusting a hand into the pocket of the vest he wore he drew from it a black shard that he threw down on the stone table between the scepter and the crown kaen leaned forward to look and an involuntary sound escaped him well may you wail matt intoned his voice like that of a final judgment though even now you are grieving for yourself and not for your people to see a fragment of the broken cauldron return to these mountains he turned back to face the highvaulted hall under the ceaseless circling of the diamond birds again the shift in his speech was awkward rough again he seemed oblivous to that dwarves matt cried i claim no blamelessness before you now i have done wrong but have made redress as best i might and i will continue to do so now and forward from this day until i die i will bear the burdens of my own transgressions and take upon myself as many of your own burdens as i can for so must a king do and i am your king i have returned to lead you back among the armies of the light where the dwarves belong where we have always belonged will you have me silence of course scarcely breathing kim strove with all her untutored instincts to take its measure the shape of the silence was sharp it was heavy with unnamed fears inchoate apprehensions it was densely intricately threaded with numberless questions and doubts there was more she knew there was more but she was not equal to discerning any of it clearly and then in any case the silence was broken hold kaen cried and even kim knew how flagrant a transgression of the laws of the wordstriving this had to be kaen drew three quick sharp breaths to calm and control himself then coming forward again he said this is more than a striving now and so i must deviate from the course of a true challenging matt sören seeks not only to reclaim a crown he tossed away when he elected to be a servant in brennin rather than to rule in banir lok but now he also invites the mootcommands it if his tone be heard and not only his wordsto adopt a new course of action without a moments thought with every word he seemed to be growing in confidence again weaving his own thick tapestry of persuasive sound i did not raise this matter when i spoke because i did not dreamin my own innocencethat matt would so presume but he has done so and so i must speak again and beg your forgiveness for that mild transgression matt sören comes here in the last days of war to order us to bring our army over to the king of brennin he uses other words but that is what he means he forgets one thing he chooses to forget it i think but we who will pay the price of his omission must not be so careless kaen paused and scanned the hall for a long moment to be sure he had them all with him then grimly he said the army of the dwarves is not here my brother has led it from these halls and over the mountains to war we promised aid to the lord of starkadh in exchange for the aid we asked of him in the search for the cauldronaid freely given and accepted by us i will not shame you or the memory of our fathers by speaking overmuch of the honor of the dwarves of what it might mean to have asked assistance from him and to now refuse the help we promised in return i will not speak of that i will say only the clearest most obvious thinga thing matt sören has chosen not to see the army is gone we have chosen a course i chose and the dwarfmoot chose with me honor and necessity both compel us to stay on the path we are set upon we could not reach blod and the army in time to call them back even if we wanted to yes we could kim ford lied shouting it she was on her feet the nearest guard shifted forward but quailed at a paralyzing glare from loren i brought your true king here from the edge of the sea last night by the power i carry i can take him to your army as easily should the dwarfmoot ask me to lies lies the baelrath was gone she kept both hands in her pockets all the time she spoke it was no more than a bluff as lorens words to the guard had been so much was at stake though and she really wasnt good at this sort of thing she knew she wasnt nonetheless she held her gaze fixed on kaens and did not flinch if he wanted to expose her to show the baelrath that had been stolen from her then let him he would have to explain to the dwarfmoot how he got itand then where would his talk of honor be kaen did not speak or move but from the side of the stage there came suddenly three loud echoing thumps of a staff on the stone floor miach moved forward slowly and carefully as before but his anger was palpable and when he spoke he had to struggle to master his voice bravely done he said with bitter sarcasm a striving to remember never have i seen the rules so flouted in a challenge matt sören not even forty years away can justify the ignorance involved in your bringing an object into a striving you knew the rules governing such things before you had seen ten summers and you kaen a minor transgression how dare you speak a second time in a wordstriving what have we become that not even the oldest rules of our people are remembered and observed even to the extenthe swung around to glare at kimberlyof having a guest speak in seithrs hall during a challenge this she decided was too much feeling her own pentup fury rising she began a stinging retort and felt lorens punishing grip on her arm she closed her mouth without saying a word though her hands inside the pockets of her gown clenched into white fists then she relaxed them for miachs rage seemed to have spent itself with that brief impassioned flurry he seemed to shrink back again no longer an infuriated patriarch but only an old man in troubled times faced now with a very great responsibility he said in a quieter almost an apologetic voice it may be that the rules that were clear and important enough for all our kings from before seithr down to march himself are no longer paramount it may be that none of the dwarves have had to live through times so cloudy and confused as these that a longing for clarity is only an old mans wistfulness kim saw matt shaking his head in denial miach did not notice he was looking up at the lofty halffilled hall it may be he repeated vaguely but even if it is this striving is ended and it is now for the moot to judge we will withdraw you will all remain herethe voice grew stronger again with words of ritualuntil we have returned to declare the will of the dwarfmoot we give thanks for the counsel of your silence it was heard and shall be given voice he turned and the others of the blackgarbed moot rose and together they all withdrew from the stage leaving matt and kaen standing there on either side of a table which held a shining crown and a shining scepter and a black sharpedged fragment of the cauldron of khath meigol kim became aware that lorens hand was still squeezing her arm very hard he seemed to realize it in the same moment im sorry he murmured easing but not releasing his grasp she shook her head i was about to say something stupid this time the guards were careful not to test lorens patience by intervening again indeed all about the hall there was a rising swell of sound as the dwarves released from the bond of silence that had held them during the striving began animatedly to discuss what had taken place only matt and kaen motionless on the stage not looking at each other remained silent not stupid at all said loren quietly you took a chance by speaking but they needed to hear what you could do kim looked over at him with sudden dismay his eyes narrowed at the sight of her consternation what is it he whispered careful not to be overheard kim said nothing only withdrew her right hand slowly from its pocket so that he could see what clearly he hadnt seen beforethe terrible absence of fire the baelrath gone he looked and then he closed his eyes she put her hand back in her pocket when loren asked his voice thin and stretched when we were ambushed i felt it being taken i woke this morning without it loren opened his eyes and looked at the stage at kaen i wonder he murmured i wonder how he knew kim shrugged it hardly seemed to matter at this point what mattered was that as things stood kaen had been quite accurate in what hed told the dwarves if the army was west of the mountains there was nothing they could do to stop them now from fighting among the legions of the dark loren seemed to read her thoughts or else they were his own as well he said it is not over yet in part because of what you did that was brightly woven kimberlyyou blunted a thrust of kaens and you may have bought us time to do something he paused his expression changed became diffident and strained actually he amended you may have bought matt time and perhaps yourself there isnt much of anything i can do anymore that isnt true kim said with all the conviction she could muster wisdom carries its own strength he smiled faintly at the platitude and even nodded his head i know i know it does only it is a hard thing kim it is a very hard thing to have known power for forty years and to have none of it now when it matters so much to this kim who had carried her own power for only a little over a year and had fought it for much of that time could find nothing to say there was no time for her to reply in any case the rustle of sound in the hall rose swiftly higher and then as swiftly subsided into a stiff tense silence in that silence the dwarfmoot filed soberly back to their stone seats on the stage for the third time miach came forward to stand beside kaen and matt facing the multitude in the seats above kim glanced at loren rigid beside her she followed the tall mans gaze to his friend of forty years she saw marts mouth move silently weaver at the loom she thought echoing the prayer she read on the dwarfs lips then wasting no time miach spoke we have listened to the speech of the wordstriving and to the silence of the dwarves hear now the rendering of the dwarfmoot of banir lok forty years ago in this hall matt now also called sören threw down the symbols of his kingship there was no equivocation in what he did no mistaking his intention to relinquish the crown kim would have sold her soul both her souls for a glass of water her throat was so dry it hurt to swallow miach went on soberly at that same time did kaen assume governance here under the mountains nor was he challenged in this nor has he been until this day even so despite the urging of the moot kaen chose not to make a crystal for the lake or to pass a full moon night beside her shores he never became our king there is then over and above all else the moot has decided one question that must be answered in this striving it has long been said in these mountain hallsso long it is now a catchphrase for usthat calor diman never surrenders her kings it was said today by matt sören and the moot heard him say it before we came forth for the judging that we have now decided is not the question at issue here kim desperately struggling to understand to anticipate saw kaens eyes flash with a swiftly veiled triumph her heart was a drum and fear beat the rhythm of it the question at issue said miach softly is whether the king can surrender the lake the silence was absolute into it he said it has never happened before in all the long history of our people that a king in these halls should do what matt did long ago or seek to do what he strives for now there are no precedents and the dwarfmoot has decreed that it would be presumption for us to decide all other questionsthe disposition of our armies everything we shall do henceforthare contained in this one issue who truly is our leader now the one who has governed us forty years with the dwarfmoot at his side or the one who slept by calor diman and then walked away it is the dwarfmoot decrees a matter for the powers of calor diman to decide here then is our judgment there are now six hours left before sunset each of you matt and kaen will be guided to a chamber with all the tools of the crystal makers craft you will each shape whatsoever image you please with such artistry as you may command tonight when darkness falls you shall ascend the nine and ninety steps to the meadow door that leads from bank tal to calor diman and you shall cast your artifices into the crystal lake i will be there and ingen also from the moot you may each name two to come with you to bear witness on your behalf the moon is not full this is not properly a night for the naming of a king but neither has anything such as this ever confronted us before we will leave it to the lake a place more fair than any in all the worlds matt sören had named calor diman long ago before the first crossing they had been still in the park plaza hotel five people from toronto en route to another world for two weeks of partying at a high kings celebrations a place more fair a place of judgment of what might be final judgment chapter that same day as the dwarves of the twin mountains prepared for the judgment of their lake gereint the shaman crosslegged on the mat in his dark house cast the net of his awareness out over fionavar and vibrated like a harp with what he sensed it was coming to a head all of it and very soon from that remote elbow of land east of the latham he reached out an old brown spider at the center of his web and saw many things with the power of his blinding but not what he was looking for he wanted the seer feeling helplessly removed from what was happening he sought the bright aura of kimberlys presence groping for a clue to what was shuttling on the loom of war tabor had told him the morning before that he had flown the seer to a cottage by a lake near paras derval and gereint had known ysanne for much of his life and so knew where this cottage was but when he reached to that place he found only the ancient green power that dwelt beneath the water and no sign of kim at all he did not knowhe had no way of knowingthat since tabor had set her down beside that shore she had already gone by the tapped power of the avarlith to lisens tower and from there that same night with the red flaming of her own wild magic over the mountains to banir lok and over the mountains he could not go unless he sent his soul traveling and he was too recently returned from journeying out over the waves to do that again so soon so she was lost to him he felt the presence of other powers though lights on a map in the darkness of his mind the other shamans were all around him in their houses much like his own here beside the latham their auras were like the trace flickerings of lienae at night erratic and insubstantial there would be no aid or comfort there he was preeminent among the shamans of the plain and had been since his blinding if any of them were to have a role yet to play in what was to come it would have to be him for all his years there came a tapping on his door he had already heard footsteps approaching from outside he quelled a quick surge of anger at the intrusion for he recognized both the tread and the rhythm of the knocking come in he said what can i do for you wife of the aven liane and i have brought you a lunch leith replied in her brisk tones good he said energetically though for once he wasnt hungry he was also discomfited it seemed that his hearing was finally starting to go hed only heard one set of footsteps both women entered and liane approaching brushed his cheek with her lips is that die best you can do he mockgrowled she squeezed his hand and he squeezed back he would have ferociously denied it if pressed but in his heart gereint had long acknowledged that ivors daughter was his favorite child of the tribe of the plain of all the worlds if it came to that it was to her mother that he turned though to where he heard her kneel in front of him and a little to the side strength of the plain he said respectfully may i touch your thoughts she leaned forward and he raised his hands to run them along the bones of her face the touch let him into her mind where he saw anxiety a weight of cares the burdens of sleeplessness butand he marveled even as he touched her facenot even a shadow of fear his touch became briefly a caress ivor is lucky in you bright soul we all are luckier than we deserve he had known leith since her birth had watched her grow into womanhood and had feasted at her wedding to ivor dan banor in those faroff days he had first seen a certain kind of brightness shining within her it had been there ever since growing even stronger as her children were born and gereint knew it for what it was a deep luminous love that was rarely allowed to shine forth she was a profoundly private person leith never given to open demonstration not trusting it in others she had been called cold and unyielding all her life gereint knew better he drew his hands away reluctantly and as he did he felt the reverberations of war sweep over him again diffidently leith asked have you seen anything shaman is there something you can tell me i am looking now he said quietly sit both of you and i will tell you what i can he reached out again seeking interstices of power along the webs of time and space he was a long way off though no longer young and but recently returned from the worst journeying of his days nothing was clear except for the reverberations the sense of a climax coming and end to war or an ending to everything he did not tell them that it would be needlessly cruel instead he ate the lunch they had brought for himit seemed he was hungry after alland listened to the dispositions leith had made of resources within the crowded camp of women and children and the old and eight blind useless shamans all through that day and the next as premonitions gathered more closely about him gereint sat on the mat in his dark house and strove whenever his waning strength allowed to see something clearly to find a role to play both days would pass though before he felt the touch of the god of cernans offered gift of foreknowledge and with that voice that vision there would come a fear such as hed never known not even out over the waves this would be something new something terrible the more so because it was not directed at him with all his years with his long full life behind him it was not his price to pay and there was not a single thing he could do about it with sorrow in his heart two mornings hence gereint would lift his voice in summons and call for tabor to come to him over the plain the army of light was riding to war north of celidon of the adein of the green mound ceinwen had raised for the dead they rode and the white magnificence of rangat towered ahead of them filling the blue cloudscattered summer sky every one of them was on horseback save for a number of the cathalians racing in their scythewheeled war chariots at the outer rim of the army when the summonglass had flamed in brennin aileron had had too much need of speed to allow the presence of foot soldiers by the same token throughout the long unnatural winter hed been laying his plans against such a time as this the horses had been ready and every man in the army of brennin could ride so too could the men and women of the lios alfar from daniloth and of the dalrei there was not and never had been any question under the benevolent miraculous sun of summer returned they rode amid the smell of fresh grass and vibrant splashes of wildflowers the plain rolled away in every direction as far as the eye could follow twice they passed great swifts of eltor and the heart of every one of them had lifted to see the beasts of the plain released from the killing bondage of snow run free again over the tall grass for how long amid all the beauty that surrounded them that remained the question they were not a company of friends out for a gallop under summer skies they were an army advancing very fast to the door of the dark and they would be there soon they were going fast dave realized it was not the headlong pace of the dalreis wild ride to celidon but aileron was pushing them hard and dave was grateful for the brief rest period they were granted midway through the afternoon he swung down off his horse muscles protesting and he flexed and limbered them as best he could before stretching out on his back on the soft grass as tore dropped down beside him a question occurred to dave why are we hurrying he asked i mean were missing diarmuid and arthur and kim and paul what advantage does aileron see in pushing on well know when levon gets back from the conference up front tore answered my guess is that its geography as much as anything else he wants to get close to gwynir this evening so we can go through the woods in the morning if we do that we should be able to be north of celyn lake in andarien before dark tomorrow that would make sense especially if maugrims army is waiting for us there the calmness of tores voice was unsettling maugrims army svart alfar urgach upon slaug galadans wolves the swans of avaias brood and weaver alone knew what else only oweins horn had saved them last time and dave knew he didnt dare blow it again the larger picture was too daunting he focused on immediate goals will we make the forest then gwynir can we get there by dark he saw tores eyes flick beyond him and then the dark man said if we were dalrei alone we could of course but im not sure with all this excess weight of brennin were carrying dave heard a loud snort of indignation and turned to see mabon of rhoden subside comfortably down beside him i didnt notice any of us falling behind on the way to celidon the duke said he took a pull of water from his flask and offered it to dave who drank as well it was icy cool he didnt know how mabons presence was a surprise of sorts though a happy one the wound hed taken by the adein had been healed last night by teyrnon and barak after aileron had finally let them make camp mabon had flatly refused to be left behind since the journey from paras derval to the latham where ivor and the dalrei had been waiting the duke seemed to favor the company of levon and tore and dave dave wasnt displeased among other things mabon had saved his life when avaia had exploded out of a clear sky on that ride beyond that the duke though no longer young was an experienced campaigner and good company too he had already established a relationship with tore that had the otherwise grim dalrei joking back and forth with him now mabon tipped dave a surreptitious wink and continued in any case this isnt a sprint my young hero this is a long haul and for that you need rhoden staying power none of your dalrei brashness that fades as the hours roll by tore didnt bother to reply instead he tore up a handful of long grass and threw it at mabons recumbent figure the wind was against him though and most of it landed on dave i wish i knew said levon walking up why i continue to spend my time with such irresponsible people the tone was jocular but his eyes were sober all three of them sat up and looked at him gravely levon crouched down on his heels and played idly with a handful of grass stems as he spoke aileron does want to make gwynir by tonight i have never been this far north but my father has and he says we should be able to do it there is a problem though which is mabon was grimly attentive teyrnon and barak have been mindscanning forward all day to see if they can sense the presence of evil gwynir would be an obvious place to ambush us the horses and especially the chariots are going to be awkward even if we keep to the edges of the forest have they seen anything mabon was asking the questions dave and tore listened and waited after a fashion which is the problem teyrnon says he finds only the tracest flicker of evil in gwynir but he has a feeling of danger nonetheless he cannot understand it he does sense the army of the dark ahead of us but far beyond gwynir they are in andarien already we think gathering there so what is in the forest mabon queried his brow furrowed with thought no one knows teyrnons guess is that the evil he apprehends is the lingering trace of the armys passage or else a handful of spies they have left behind the danger may be inherent in the forest he thinks there were powers of darkness in gwynir at the time of the bael rangat so what do we do dave asked do we have a choice not really levon replied they talked about going through daniloth but ratenniel said that even with the lios alfar to guide us we are too many for the lios to guarantee that a great many of us would not be lost in the shadowland and aileron will not ask him to let down the woven mist with the army of the dark in andarien they would move south the moment that happened and we would be fighting in daniloth the high king said he will not permit that so we take our chances in the forest mabon summarized so it seems levon agreed but teyrnon keeps saying that he doesnt really see evil there so i dont know how much of a chance were taking were doing it in any case in the morning no one is to enter the forest at night was that a direct order tore asked quietly levon turned to him not actually why tores voice was carefully neutral i was thinking that a group of people a very small group might be able to scout ahead tonight and see what there is to see there was a little silence a group say of four people mabon of rhoden murmured in a tone of purely academic interest that would be a reasonable number i would guess tore replied after judicious reflection looking at the other three his heartbeat suddenly quickening dave saw a quiet resolution in each of them nothing more was said the rest period was almost over they rose prepared to mount up again something was happening though a commotion was stirring the southeastern fringes of the army dave turned with the others in time to see three strange riders being escorted past them to where the high king was and the aven and ratenniel of daniloth the three were travelstained and each of them slumped in his saddle with weariness written deep into his features one was a dalrei an older man his face obscured by mud and grime the second was a younger man tall fairhaired with a pattern of green tattoo markings on his face the third was a dwarf and it was brock of banir tal brock whom dave had last seen in gwen ystrat preparing to ride east into the mountains with kim i think i want to see this said levon quickly he started forward to follow the three newcomers and dave was right beside him with mabon and tore in stride by virtue of levons rank and the dukes they passed through into the presence of the kings dave stood there half a head taller than anyone else and watched standing just behind tore as the three newcomers knelt before the high king be welcome brock aileron said with genuine warmth bright the hour of your return will you name your companions to me and give me what tidings you can brock rose and for all his fatigue his voice was clear greetings high king said the dwarf i would wish you to extend your welcome to these two who have come with me riding without stop through two nights and most of two days to serve in your ranks beside me is faebur of larak in eridu and beyond him is one who styles himself dalreidan and i can tell you that he saved my life and that of the seer of brennin when otherwise we would surely have died dave blinked at the dalreis name he caught a glance from levon who whispered riders son an exile i wonder who it is i bid you both welcome aileron said and then with a tightening in his voice what tidings beyond the mountains grievous my lord brock said one more grief to lay at the door of the dwarves a death rain fell for three days in eridu the cauldron shaped it from cader sedat andbitter to my tongue the tellingi do not think there is a man or woman left alive in that land the stillness that followed was of devastation beyond the compassing of words faebur dave saw stood straight as a spear his face set in a mask of stone is it falling still ratenniel asked very softly brock shook his head i would have thought you knew are there no tidings from them the rain stopped two days ago the seer told us that the cauldron had been smashed in cader sedat after pain after grief hope beyond expectation a murmur of sound suddenly rose sweeping back through the ranks of the army weaver be praised aileron exclaimed and then what of the seer brock brock said she was alive and well though i know not where she is now we were guided to khath meigol by the two men here with me she freed the paraiko there with the aid of tabor dan ivor and his flying creature and they bore her west two nights ago where i know not dave looked at ivor the aven said what was he doing there i left him with orders to guard the camps he was the one called dalreidan spoke for the first tune he was guarding them and was going back to do so again he was summoned by the seer ivor aven she knew the name of his creature and he had no choice nor did sheshe could not have done what she had to do with only the three of us be not angry with him i think he is suffering enough levons face had gone white ivor opened his mouth and then closed it again what is it you fear aven of the plain it was ratenniel again ivor hesitated then as if drawing the thought up from the wellspring of his heart he said he goes farther away every time he flies i am afraid he will soon be like like owein and the wild hunt a thing of smoke and death utterly cut off from the world of men silence once more a different kind shaped of awe as much as fear it was broken by aileron in a deliberately crisp voice that brought them all back to the plain and the day moving inexorably toward dusk weve a long way to go the high king said the three of you are welcome among us can you ride brock nodded it is why i am here said faebur a young voice trying hard to be stern to ride with you and do what i can when battle comes aileron looked over at the older man who called himself dalreidan dave saw that ivor was looking at him too and that dalreidan was gazing back not at the high king but at the aven i can ride dalreidan said very softly have i leave abruptly dave realized that something else was happening here ivor looked at dalreidan for a long time without answering then no chieftain can reclaim an exile within the law but nothing i know in the parchments at celidon speaks to what the aven may do in such a case we are at war and you have done service already in our cause you have leave to return as aven i say so now he stopped then in a different voice ivor said you have leave to return to the plain and to your tribe though not under the name you have taken now be welcome back under the name you bore before the accident that thrust you forth into the mountains this is a brighter thread in darkness than i ever thought to see a promise of return i cannot say how glad i am to see you here again he smiled turn now for there is another here who will be as glad sorcha of the third tribe turn and greet your son in front of dave tore went rigid as levon let out a whoop of delight sorcha turned he looked at his son and dave still standing behind tore saw the old dalreis begrimed face light up with an unlookedfor joy one moment the tableau held then tore stumbled forward with unwonted awkwardness and he and his father met in an embrace so fierce it seemed as if they meant to squeeze away all the dark years that had lain between dave who had given tore the push that sent him forward was smiling through tears he looked at levon and then at ivor he thought of his own father so far away so far away it seemed all his life he looked over and up at rangat and remembered the hand of fire do you think mabon of rhoden murmured that that small expedition we were planning might just as easily be done with seven dave wiped his eyes he nodded then still unable to speak he nodded again levon signaled them forward careful of the axe he carried moving as silently as he could dave crawled up beside his friend the others did the same lying prone on a hillockscant shelter on the open plainthe seven of them gazed north toward the darkness of gwynir overhead clouds scudded eastward now revealing now obscuring the waning moon sighing through the tall grass the breeze carried for the first time the scent of the evergreen forest far beyond the trees rangat reared up dominating the northern sky when the moon was clear of the clouds the mountain glowed with a strange spectral light dave looked away to the west and saw that the world ended there or seemed to they were on the very edge of daniloth the shadowland where time changed where men could wander lost in ralathens mist until the end of all the worlds dave peered into the moonlit shadows the drifting fog and it seemed to him that he saw blurred figures moving there some riding ghostly horses others on foot all silent in the mist they had left the camp at moonrise with less difficulty than expected levon had led them to the guard post manned by cechtar of the third tribe who was not about to betray or impede the designs of the avens son indeed his only objection had been in not being allowed to accompany them you cant levon had murmured very calmly in control if we arent back before sunrise we will be captured or dead and someone will have to warn the high king the someone is you cechtar im sorry a thankless task if the gods love us it is a message youll not have to carry after that there had been no more words for a long time only the whisper of the night breeze across the plain the hoot of a hunting owl the soft tread of their own footsteps as they walked away from the fires of the camp into the dark then the rustling sound of grasses parting as they dropped down and crawled the last part of the way toward the low tummock levon had pointed out just east of daniloth just south of gwynir crawling along beside mabon of rhoden behind tore and sorcha who seemed unwilling to allow more than a few inches of space between them now dave found himself thinking about how much a part of his reality death had been since he came to fionavar since he had crashed through the space between worlds here on the plain and tore had almost killed him with a dagger there had been a killing that first night he and the dark dalrei he called a brother now had slain an urgach together in faelinn grove first death among so many there had been a battle by llewenmere and then among the snows of the latham a wolf hunt in gwen ystrat and then only three nights ago the carnage along the banks of the adein he had been lucky he realized moving more cautiously forward as the moon came out from between two banks of cloud he could have died a dozen times over died a long way from home the moon slid back behind the clouds the breeze was cool another owl hooted there were scattered stars overhead where the cloud cover broke he thought of his father for the second time that day it wasnt hard even for dave to figure out why he looked at sorcha just ahead moving effortlessly over the shadowed ground almost against his will a trick of distance and shadows and of long sorrow he pictured his father here with them an eighth figure on the dark plain josef martyniuk had fought among the ukrainian partisans for three years more than forty years ago but even so even so a lifetime of physical labor had kept his big body hard and dave had grown up fearing the power of his fathers brawny arm josef could have swung a killing axe and his icy blue eyes might have glinted just a littletoo much to ask to see how easily his son handled one how honored dave was among people of rank and wisdom he could have kept up too dave thought going with the fantasy a little way at least as well as mabon surely and he wouldnt have had any doubts any hesitations about the lightness of doing this of going to war in this cause there had been stories in daves childhood about his fathers deeds in his own war none from josef though whatever fragments dave had heard had come from friends of his parents middleaged men pouring a third glass of iced vodka for themselves telling the awkward oversized younger son stories about his father long ago or beginning the stories before josef overhearing would silence them with a harsh storm of words in the old tongue dave could still remember the first time he had beaten up his older brother when vincent late one night in the room they shared had let slip a casual reference to a railway bombing their father had organized how do you know about that dave perhaps ten had demanded he could still remember the way his heart had lurched dad told me vincent had answered calmly hes told me lots of those stories perhaps even now fifteen years after vincent still didnt know why his younger brother had so ferociously attacked him for the first time ever and the only time leaping upon his smaller frailer older brother and punching him about crying that vincent was lying vincents own cries had brought josef storming into the room to block the light from the hallway with his size to seize his younger son in one hand and hold him in the air as he cuffed him about with an open meaty palm he is smaller than you josef had roared you are never to hit him and dave crying suspended helplessly in the air unable to dodge the slaps raining down on him had screamed almost incoherently but im smaller than you and josef had stopped had set his gangly clumsy son down to weep on his bed and had said in a strained unsettling voice this is true this is correct and had gone out closing the bedroom door on the light dave hadnt understood any of it then and to be honest he grasped only a part of what had happened that night even now he didnt have that kind of introspection perhaps by choice he did remember vincent the next night offering to tell his younger brother the story of the train bombing and himself inarticulate but defiant telling vince to just shut up he was sorry about that now sorry about a lot of things distance he supposed did that to you and thinking so he crawled up beside levon on the hillock and looked upon the darkness of gwynir this isnt levon murmured the most intelligent thing ive ever done the words were rueful but the tone was not dave heard the barely suppressed excitement in the voice of ivors son and within himself rising over his fears he felt an unexpected rush of joy he was among friends men he liked and deeply respected and he was sharing danger with them in a cause worthy of that sharing his nerves seemed sharp honed he felt intensely alive the moon slipped behind another thick bank of clouds the outline of the forest became blurred and indistinct levon said very well i will lead follow in pairs behind me i do not think they are watching for usif indeed there is anything there beyond bears and hunting cats i will make for the depression a little east of north follow quietly if the moon comes out hold where you are until it is gone again levon slipped over the ridge and working along on his belly began sliding over the open space toward the forest he moved so neatly the grasses scarcely seemed to move to mark his passage dave waited a moment then with mabon beside him began propelling himself forward it wasnt easy going with the axe but he hadnt come here to share in something easy he found a rhythm of elbows and knees forced himself to breathe evenly and slowly and kept his head low to the ground twice he glanced up to make sure of his orientation and once the thinning moon did slide out briefly pinning them down among the silvered grasses when it disappeared again they went on they found the downward slope just where the trees began to thicken levon was waiting crouched low a finger to his lips dave rested on one knee balancing his axe breathing carefully and listening silence save for night birds wind in the trees the quick scurrying of some small animal then a barely audible rustle of grass and tore and sorcha were beside him followed a moment later as silently by brock and faebur the young eriduns face was set in a grim mask with the dark tattoos he looked like some primitive implacable god of war levon motioned them close in the faintest thread of a whisper he said if there is an ambush of any kind it will not be far from here they will expect us to skirt as close to daniloth as we can any attack would pin us against the shadowland with the horses useless among these trees i want to check due north from here and then loop back along a line farther east if we find nothing we can return to camp and play at dice with cechtar hes a bad gambler with a belt i like levons teeth flashed white in the blackness dave grinned back at him moments like this he decided were what you lived for then the armed guard stepped into their hollow from the north had he given the alarm had he had time to do so all of them would probably have died he did not he had no time of the seven men he stumbled upon every one was terribly dangerous in his own fashion and very quick the guard saw them opened his mouth to scream a warningand died with the quickest blade of them all in his throat two arrows struck him and a second knife before he hit the ground but all seven of them knew whose blade had killed whose had been first they looked at brock of banir tal and then at the dwarf he had slain and they were silent brock walked forward and stood looking down at his victim for a long time then he stooped and withdrew his knife and sorchas as well from the dwarfs heart he walked back to the six of them and his eyes even in the night shadows bore witness to a great pain i knew him he whispered his name was vojna he was very young i knew his parents too he never did an evil thing in all his days what has happened to us it was mabons deep voice that slipped quietly into the silence to some of you he amended gently but i think we have an answer now to teyrnons riddle there is danger here but not true evil only a thread of it the dwarves are sent to ambush us but they are not truly of the dark does it matter brock whispered bitterly i think so levon replied gravely i think it might enough words though there will be other guards i want to find out how many of them there are and exactly where i also need two of you to carry word back to the camp right now he hesitated tore sorcha levon no tore hissed you cannot levons jaw tightened and his eyes blazed tore stopped abruptly the dark dalrei swallowed nodded once jerkily and then with his father beside him turned and left the forest heading back south the night took them as if theyd never been there dave found levon looking at him he returned the gaze i couldnt levon whispered not so soon after theyd found each other words were useless sometimes they were stupid dave reached forward and squeezed levons shoulder none of the others spoke either levon turned and started ahead with mabon beside him again and brock and faebur following dave set out after him his axe held ready into the blackness of the forest the guard had come from the northeast and levon led them the same way his heart racing now dave walked crouched low among the scented outlines of the evergreens his eyes straining for shapes in the night there was death here and treachery and for all his fear and anger there was room within him to pity brock and grieve for himand he knew he would never have felt either a year and a half ago levon stopped and held up one hand dave froze a moment later he heard it too the sounds of a great many men too many to maintain an absolute silence carefully he sank to one knee and bending low caught a glimpse of firelight in the space between two trees he tapped levons leg and the fairhaired dalrei dropped down as well and his gaze followed daves pointing finger levon looked for a long time then he turned back and his eyes met brocks he nodded and the dwarf silently moved past levon to lead them toward the camp of his people levon fell back beside faebur who had drawn his bow dave looped his hand tightly through the thong at the end of his axe handle he saw that brock had done the same mabon drew his sword they went forward crawling again careful of their weapons desperately careful of twigs and leaves on the forest floor with excruciating slowness brock guided them toward the glow of light dave had seen then suddenly he stopped dave held himself rigidly still save for his own warning hand raised for levon and faebur behind him holding motionless hardly breathing he heard the crunching footsteps of another guard approach on the right and then he saw a dwarf walk past not five feet away returning to the camp dave wiped perspiration from his brow and drew a long quiet breath brock was slipping forward again even more slowly than before and dave sharing a quick glance with mabon followed he found himself thinking absurdly about cechtars belt the one levon had wanted to gamble for it seemed farther away than anything had any right to be he crawled moving each hand and knee with infinite deliberation he hardly dared lift his head to look up so fearful was he of making a sound on the forest floor it seemed to go on forever this last stage of the journey then out of the corner of his eye dave saw that brock had stopped glancing up he saw that they were within sight of the fires dave looked and his heart sank there was a huge clearing in gwynir it seemed unnatural manmade he wondered briefly how it had come to be there but there were more pressing concerns than that this was no raiding party waiting for them no delaying contingent readying a skirmish there were a great many watch fires in the clearing the flames kept low to avoid discovery and around them mostly sleeping was the entire army of the dwarves of banik lok and banir tal dave had a horrifying premonition of the kind of havoc these fighters could wreak among ailerons horsemen he pictured the horses screaming hampered and dangerous in the congested woods he saw the dwarves small quick deadly far more courageous than the svart alfar slashing horseflesh and men amid the encircling trees he looked over at brock and his heart ached for the transparent anguish he saw in the others face then even as he watched brocks expression changed and a cold hatred invested the dwarfs normally kind features brock touched levon on the arm and pointed dave followed his finger and saw a dwarf beside the nearest of the fires talking softly to three others who then ran off to the east obviously carrying orders the one who had spoken remained and dave saw that he was bearded and dark as were brock and matt and that his eyes were deepset and hidden under an overhanging brow he was too far away though to make out anything else dave turned to brock his eyebrows raised in a question blod brock mouthed not making a sound and then dave knew this was the one theyd spoken of before the one whod given the cauldron to maugrim and had been in starkadh when jennifer was taken there he felt his own hatred rising his own eyes going flinty and cold as he looked back at the dwarf by the fire he tightened his grip on the axe but this was a reconnaissance not a raid even as he stared at blod hungering for his death he heard levons soft whisper commanding them to turn back they never had a chance though there came a sound to their right a loud crashing at the edge of the clearing and then sudden hoarse shouts of alarm very near them someones here a dwarf guard screamed another one echoed the alarm dave martyniuk thought of his father blowing up bridges in darkest night in a darkest time he saw brock rise and levon weapons out he rose hefting his axe saw faeburs strung bow and mabons long sword glint in the red light of the fire for a moment he looked up the moon was hidden but there were stars up there between the banks of clouds high above the trees the fires high above everything he stepped forward into the open to have room to swing the axe levon was beside him he exchanged one glance with the man he called his brother there was time for nothing more then dave turned toward the roused army of the dwarves and prepared to send as many of them as he could into night before he died it was still dark when sharra woke on the deck of amairgens ship a heavy fog lay over the sea shrouding the stars the moon had long since set she pulled diarmuids cloak more tightly about herself the wind was cold she closed her eyes not really wanting to be awake yet to become fully aware of where she was she knew though the creaking of the masts and the flap of the torn sails told her and every few moments she would hear the sound of invisible footsteps passing mariners dead a thousand years on either side of her jaelle and jennifer still slept she wondered what time it was the fog made it impossible to tell she wished that diarmuid were beside her warming her with his nearness she only had his cloak though damp with the mist hed been too scrupulous of her honor to lie anywhere near her either on the ship or before theyd boarded on the beach below the anor they had found a moment together though after lancelot had gone into the woods alone in the deceptively tranquil hour between twilight and full dark all tranquility was deceptive now sharra decided huddling under the cloak and the blankets theyd given her there were too many dimensions of danger and grief all around and shed learned new ones with the tale diarmuid had unfolded as they walked along the northwest curving of the strand past the anor and sawfirst time for both of themthe sheer cliffs of rhudh gleam bloodred in the last of the light he had told her of the voyage in a voice stripped of all its customary irony of any inflections of mockery and irreverence he spoke of the soulmonger and she held his hand in her own and seemed to hear as backdrop to the musing fall of his voice the sound of brendel singing his lament again then he told her of the moment in the chamber of the dead under cader sedat the moment when amid the ceaseless pounding of all the seas of all the worlds arthur pendragon had wakened lancelot from his death on the bed of stone sharra lay on the boat eyes closed listening to wind and sea remembering what hed said do you know hed murmured watching the cliffs shade to a darker red that if you loved someone else as well as me i do not think i could have done that to bring him back to you i really dont think im man enough to have done what arthur did she was wise enough to know that it was a hard admission for him to make shed said he is something more than a mortal now the threads of their three names on the loom go back so far intertwined in so many ways do not reproach yourself diar or if you mustshe smileddo so for thinking i could ever love another as i do you he had stopped at that brow furrowed and turned to make some serious reply she wondered now what it was hed been meaning to say because she hadnt let him speak she had risen up instead on tiptoe and putting her hands behind his head had pulled his mouth down so she could reach it with her own to stop him from talking to finally properly begin to welcome him home from the sea after which they had greeted each other properly lying upon his cloak on that strand north of lisens tower slipping out of their clothes under the first of the stars hed made love to her with an aching tenderness holding her moving upon her with the gentle rhythm of the quiet sea when she cried out at length it was softlya sound to her own ears like the sighing of a wave a deep surging on the sand and so it was all right after a fashion that he did not lie with her when they came back to the anor brendel brought a pallet out from the tower for her and blankets woven in daniloth for lisen and diarmuid left her the cloak so she might have at least that much of him next to her as she fell asleep to awaken not long after along with every one else on the beach to see a ghostly ship sailing toward them with jaelle aboard and pwyll and a pale proud figure beside them both who was they gave her to understand the ghost of amairgen whitebranch beloved of lisen dead these long long years they had boarded that spectral ship by starlight by the cast glimmer of the setting moon and unseen sailors had brought it about and they had begun moving north as a mist descended over the sea to hide the stars footsteps passed again though there was no one to be seen it had to be close to morning now but there was no real way to tell try as she might sharra could not sleep too many thoughts chased each other around and around in her mind amid fear and sorrow perhaps because of them she felt a new keenness to all of her memories and perceptions as if the context of war had given an added intensity to everything an intensity that sharra recognized as the awareness of possible loss she thought about diar and about herselfa solitary falcon no moreand found herself yearning more than she ever had before for peace for an end to the terrors of this time that she might lie in his arms every night without fearing what the mists of morning might bring she rose careful not to wake the others sleeping beside her and wrapping the cloak about herself she walked to the leeward rail of the ship peering out into the darkness and the fog there were voices farther along the deck others it seemed were awake as well then she recognized diarmuids light inflections and a moment later the cold clear tones of amairgen nearly morning the mage was saying i will be fading any moment only at night can i be seen in your time and during the day diarmuid asked is there anything we must do nothing the ghost replied we will be here though you will not know it one thing do not for fear of your lives leave the ship in daylight sharra glanced over arthur pendragon stood there as well beside diarmuid and amairgen in the greyness and the mist all three of them looked like ghosts to her she made a sudden gesture rooted in old foolish superstitions to unsay the thought she saw cavall then a grey shadow upon shadow and in the fog he too seemed to belong to some realm of the supernatural terribly far from her own from sunlight on the waterfalls and flowers of larai rigal the sea slapped against the hull with a cold relentless sound magnified in the fog she looked over the rail but couldnt even see the waterline it was probably just as well one glimpse on first boarding of water foaming through the shattered timbers of the ship had been enough she looked back at the three men then caught her breath and looked more closely yet there were only two of them arthur and diar stood together with the dog beside them but the ghost of the mage was gone and in that moment sharra became aware that the eastern darkness was beginning to lift peering through the grey thinning mist she could now make out a long low rolling tongue of land this had to be sennett strand of the legends they had passed the cliffs of rhudh in the night and if her geography master in larai rigal had told true and she remembered rightly before the day was out they would come to the mouth of linden bay and see the fjords of ice and the vast glaciers looming in the north and starkadh the seat of rakoth maugrim set like a black claw in the heart of a world of whitest light she honestly didnt know how she was going to deal with looking upon it it had as much to do with the ice as with anything else she realized with how far north they were in a world so alien to one raised amid the gentle seasons of cathal and the shelter of its gardens sternly she reminded herself that they were not sailing to starkadh or anywhere near it their journey would take them back south down linden bay to the mouth of the celyn river there diarmuid had explained amairgen would set them down if all went well in the darkness before dawn tomorrow bringing an end to this strangest of voyages it would have to be in darkness she now realized given what amairgen had just said do not for fear of your lives leave the ship in daylight the mist was still rising quickly now she saw a small patch of blue overhead then another and then gloriously the sun burst into the sky over sennett and the lands beyond and in that moment sharra looking toward the morning was the first to notice something about the strand diar she called hoping shed kept the fear out of her voice he was still speaking to arthur just along the rail standing quite deliberately on a part of the deck where the timbers had been completely torn away he seemed to be suspended in air and she knew that below him if she looked she would see seawater rushing in to swirl through the dark hold of amairgens ship he broke off the conversation and came over quickly arthur followed what is it she pointed by now the mist was entirely gone from off the water and there was a great deal of light morning in summer bright and fair she heard a babble of sound along the deck others had seen as well the men of south keep were crowding to the rail and other hands were pointing to the same thing she was they were sailing along a green and fertile coast sennett strand had always been known if she remembered her lessons rightly for the richness of its soil though the growing season was short this far north but sennett had been ruined as andarien beyond the bay had been in the time of the bael rangat despoiled by a killing rain and then ravaged by rakoths armies in the late days of the war before conary came north with the armies of brennin and cathal ruined and emptied both of those oncefair lands how then could they be seeing what now they saw a quilting of fields laid out under the blue summer sky farmhouses of stone and wood scattered across the strand the smoke of cooking fires rising from chimneys crops flourishing in rich shades of brown and gold and in the reddish hues of tall solais growing in row upon row nearer to the ship at the waters edge as they continued north and the light grew clearer yet sharra saw a harbor indenting the long coastline and within that harbor were a score or more of manycolored ships some tallmasted with deep holds for grain and timber others little more than fishing boats to chance the ocean waters west of the strand with a catch in her heart as the cries of wonder grew louder all about her sharra saw that the very tallest of the ships carried proudly upon its mainmast a green flag with a curved sword and a red leaf the flag of raith westernmost of the provinces of cathal next to it she saw another tall ship this one flying the crescent moon and oak flag of brennin and the mariners of both ships were waving to them clearly from over the sparkling water came the sound of their greetings and laughter beyond the ships the quayside bustled with earlymorning life one ship was offloading and a number of others were taking on cargo dogs and little boys careened about getting in everyones way beyond the docks the town stretched along the bay in both directions and back up from the sea she saw brightly painted houses under slanting shingled roofs wide laneways ran up from the waterside and following the widest with her gaze sharra saw a tall manor house to the north and east with a high stone wall around it she could see it all as they sailed past the mouth of the harbor and she knew this town had to be guiraut upon iorweths bay but iorweths bay had been reclaimed by the rising land hundreds and hundreds of years ago and guiraut town had been burnt and utterly razed to the ground by rakoth maugrim in the bael rangat it was so full of life so beautiful she suddenly realized that if she wasnt careful she would weep diar how has this happened she asked turning to him where are we a long way off he said were sailing through the seas this ship knew before she was destroyed in the days after rakoth had come to fionavar but before the bael rangat his voice was husky she turned back to look at the harbor trying very hard to deal with that diarmuid touched her hand i dont think there is anything that endangers us directly he said so long as we stay on the ship we will return to our own seas our own time after the sun has set she nodded never taking her eyes from the brilliant colors of the harbor she said wonderingly do you see that ship from raith and the smaller oneover therewith the flag of cynan diar my country doesnt even exist yet those are ships of the principalities they only became a country after angirad returned from the bael rangat i know that he said gently were looking at a world that was destroyed from over the water now she recognized the sound of a trena played high and sweet on the deck of the ship from cynan she knew that music she had grown up with it a thought came to her born of the ache lodged in her heart cant we warn them cant we do something diarmuid shook his head they cant see us or hear us what do you mean cant you hear the music and looktheyre waving to us his hands were loosely clasped together as he leaned on the rail but the strain in his voice gave the lie to that casualness not to us my dear they arent waving to us what they see isnt this broken hulk they see a beautiful ship passing with a picked crew from brennin they see amairgens mariners sharra and his ship as it was before it sailed for cader sedat were invisible im afraid so finally she understood they sailed north along the line of the coast and guiraut town disappeared from sight soon to disappear forever from the world of men its brightness remembered only in song soon and yet long ago both loops in the weaving of time the sound of the trena followed them a long way even after the town was lost behind the curve of the bay they left it because they had no choice to the fires of its future and their past after that the mood of the ship turned grim not with apprehension but with a newer sterner resolution a deeper awareness of what evil was and meant there was a harder tone to the speech of the men on the deck a crispness to the movements with which they cleaned and polished their weapons that boded ill for those who would seek to oppose mem in what was to come and it was coming sharra knew that now and she too was ready for it some of that same resolution had hardened in her own heart they sailed north up the seaward coast of sennett strand and late in the afternoon with the sun well out over the sea they came to the northernmost tip of sennett and rounded that cape swinging east and they saw the glaciers and the fjords and the blackness of starkadh beyond sharra gazed upon it and did not flinch or close her eyes she looked upon the heart of evil and she willed herself not to look away she could not of course see herself in that moment but others could and there was a murmuring along the ship at how fierce and cold the beauty of the dark rose of cathal had suddenly become an ice queen from the garden country a rival to the queen of rük herself as stern and as unyielding and even here on this doorstep of the dark there was a thing of beauty to be found high above and far beyond starkadh rangat reared up snowcrowned cloudshouldered mastering the northlands with its glory sharra understood suddenly for the first time why the conflict of a thousand years ago had come to be called the bael rangat even though not one of the major battles had taken place by the mountain the truth was that rangat loomed so imperiously high this far north there was no place in these lands that could not be said to lie under the sovereignty of the mountain unless and until rakoth defeated them they sailed down the bay of a thousand years ago under the westering sun to the east they could see the golden beaches of andarien and beyond them a hint of a green fair land rising in gentle slopes toward the north it would be dotted with strands of tall trees sharra knew and there would be deep blue lakes sparkling in the sun with fish leaping from them in curved homage to the light all gone she knew all gone to dust and barrenness to bleak highlands where the north wind whistled down over nothingness the forests were leveled the lakes dry the thin grasses scattered and brown ruined andarien where the war had been fought and would be again if diarmuid was right if even now aileron the high king was leading his armies from the plain toward gwynir to come on the morrow through the evergreens to andarien they too would be there those on this ship if amairgens promise held it did they sailed southeast down linden bay through the growing shadows of that afternoon and the long summer twilight watching the golden sands where andarien met the bay gradually grow dark looking back to the west over sennett strand again sham saw the evening starlaurielsand then a moment later the sun set and amairgen was among them again shadowy and insubstantial but growing clearer as the night deepened there was a cold arrogance to him and she wondered for a moment that lisen had loved this man then she thought about how long ago she had died and how long he had wandered a ghost loveless and unrevenged through lonely endless seas he would have been different she guessed when he was a living man and young and loved by the fairest child of all the weavers worlds a pity she could never have expressed rose in her as she looked upon the proud figure of the first mage later it grew too dark and she could no longer see him clearly under the starlight the moon thinning toward new rose very late sharra slept for a time most of them did knowing how little rest might lie in the days aheador how much rest an eternity of it she woke long before dawn the moon was over the strand west of them they carried no lights on that ship andarien was a dark blur to the east she heard low voices speaking againamairgen diar and arthur pendragon then the voices were gradually stilled sharra rose diarmuids cloak about her in the chill jaelle the high priestess came to stand beside her and the two of them watched as the warrior walked to the prow of the ship he stood therecavall beside him as everand in the darkness of that night he suddenly thrust high his spear and the head of the king spear blazed bluewhite and dazzling and by that light amairgen whitebranch guided his ship to land by the mouth of the river celyn where it ran into linden bay they disembarked in the shallows by that sweetest of rivers which flowed from celyn lake along the enchanted borders of daniloth last of all to leave the ship sharra saw was the one they called pwyll twiceborn he stood on the deck above the swaying ladder and said something to amairgen and the mage made reply she couldnt hear what they said but she felt a shiver raise the hairs of her neck to look upon the two of them then pwyll came down the rope ladder and they were all gathered on land again amairgen stood above them proud and austere in what was left of the moonlight he said high priestess of dana i have done as you bade me have i still the prayers you promised gravely jaelle replied you would have had them even had you not carried us go to your rest unquiet ghost all of you the soulmonger is dead you are released may there be light for you at the weavers side and for you amairgen said and for all of you he turned to pwyll again and seemed about to speak once more he did not instead he slowly lifted high both his hands and then amid the sudden enraptured crying of his unseen mariners he faded from sight in the darkness and his ship faded away with him and the crying of the mariners fell slowly away on the breeze leaving only the sound of the surf to carry its echo awhile from so far back in time in that place where the river met the bay they turned and led by brendel of the lios alfar who knew every slope and shadow of this country so near his home they began walking east toward where the sun would rise chapter i will not go within flidais said turning way from the mist he looked up at the man standing beside him not even the andain are proof against wandering lost in ralathens woven shadows had i any words left that might prevail upon you i would urge you again not to go there lancelot listened with that always grave courtesy that was so much a part of him the patience that seemed virtually inexhaustible he made one ashamed flidais thought to be importunate or demanding to fall too far short of the mark set by that gentleness and yet he was not without humor even now there was a glint of amusement in his eyes as he looked down on the diminutive andain i was wondering he said mildly if it were actually possible that you might run out of words i was beginning to doubt it taliesin flidais felt himself beginning to flush but there was no malice in lancelots teasing only a laughter they could share and a moment later they did i am bereft neither of words nor yet of arguments of dappled confusing inconsequentiality flidais protested only of time am i now run short given where we stand i am not about to try to restrain you physically here on the borders of daniloth i am somewhat wiser than that at least at least lancelot agreed then after a pause would you really want to restrain me now even if you could knowing what you know an unfairly difficult question but flidais who had been the wisest most precocious child of all in his day was a child no longer not without sorrow he said i would not knowing the three of you i would not constrain you from doing a thing she asked i fear the child though lancelot i fear him deeply and to this the man made no reply the first hint of grey appeared in the sky overture to morning and all that the day might bring to the west amairgens ghostly ship was just then sailing north along sennett strand its passengers looking out upon a town given to the fire long ago long since turned to ashes and to shards of pottery a bird lifted its voice in song behind them from some hidden place among the trees of the dark forest they stood between wood and mist and looked at each other for what flidais knew might be the last time i am grateful for your guidance to this place said lancelot and for the tending of my wounds flidais snorted brusquely and turned away couldnt have done the one without the other he growled couldnt have guided you anywhere let alone through the whole of a night unless id first done something about those wounds lancelot smiled should i unsay my thanks then or is this some of your dappled inconsequentiality he was flidais decided altogether too clever always had been it was the key to his mastery in battle lancelot had always been more intelligent than anyone he fought the andain found himself smiling back and nodding a reluctant agreement how is your hand he asked it had been by far the worst of the wounds the palm savagely scored by the burning of curdardhs hammer lancelot didnt even spare it a glance it will do i shall make it do i suppose he looked north toward the mists of daniloth looming in front of them something changed in his eyes it was almost as if he heard a horn or a call or another kind i must go i think or there will have been no point in our having come so far i hope we meet again old friend in a time of greater light flidais found himself blinking rapidly he managed a shrug it is in the weavers hands he said he hoped it sounded casual lancelot said gravely half a truth little one it is in our own hands as well however maimed they are our own choices matter or i would not be here she would not have asked me to follow the child fare kindly taliesin flidais i hope you find what you want he touched the andain lightly on the shoulder and then he turned and after a dozen strides was swallowed up by the mists of the shadowland but i have flidais was thinking i have found what i want the summoning name was singing in his head reverberating in the chambers of his heart he had sought it so long and now it was his he had what he wanted which did not do anything to explain why he stood rooted to that spot for so long afterward gazing north into the dense impenetrable shadows it was only afterward thinking about it that she consciously understood that this was something of which she must have always been inwardly aware the terrible danger that lay in wait for her if she ever fell in love how else explain why leyse of the swan mark fairest and most desired of all the women in danilothlong sought by ratenniel himself in vainhad chosen to abjure each and every such overture however sweetly sung these long long years how else indeed the swan mark alone of the lios alfar had not gone to war dedicated in memory of lauriel for whom they were named to serenity and peace they lingered few in number in the shadowland wandering alone and in pairs through the days and nights since ratenniel had led the brothers and sisters of the other two marks to war on the plain leyse was one of those who wandered alone she had come early of this mild summers dawning to glimpse the muted light of sunriseall light was muted herethrough the waters of the upwardrushing waterfall of fiathal her favorite place within the shadowland though truly her favorite place of all lay beyond the borders north on the banks of celyn lake where the sylvain could be gathered in spring by one who was careful not to be seen that place was closed to her now it was a time of war outside the protection of the mist and what it did to time so she had come south instead to the waterfall and she was waiting for the sunrise sitting quietly clad as ever in white beside the rushing waters and so it was that she saw just before the sun came up a mortal man walk into daniloth she had a momentary spasm of fearthis had not happened for a very long timebut then she relaxed knowing the mists would take him momentarily and leave him lost to time no threat to anyone she had an instant to look at him the graceful slightly stiff gait the high carriage of his head dark hair his clothes were nondescript there was blood on them he carried a sword buckled about his waist he saw her from across the green green glade that did not matter the mist would have him long before he could cross to where she sat it did not she raised a hand almost without thought she spoke the words of warding to shield him to leave him safe in time and speaking them she shaped her own doom the doom her inward self had tried to avoid all these long years and had instead prepared as a feast upon the grass the sun came up light sparkled gently mildly in the splash of the upwardrunning falls it was very beautiful it always was she hardly saw he walked toward her over the carpet of the grass and she rose so as to be standing drops of water in her hair on her race when he came to where she was her eyes she knew had come to crystal his were dark she thought afterward that she might have known who he was before he even spoke his name it was possible the mind had as many loops as did time itself even here in daniloth she forgot who had told her that the tall man came up to her he stopped he said with deepest gravest courtesy good morning my lady i am come in peace and trespass only by reason of utmost need i must ask of you your aid my name is lancelot she had already given her aid she might have said else he would not have walked this far not be seeing her now he would be locked in a soundless sightless world of his own forever until the loom was stilled she might have said that were her eyes not crystal past that evenbrighter clearer than she had thought they could go she might have had her heart not already been given and lost even before she heard the name before she knew who he was there were droplets of water in her hair the grass was very green the sun shone down gently through the shadows as it always did she looked into his eyes knowing who he was and already even in that first moment she sensed what her own destiny was now to be she heard it the first high distant impossibly beautiful notes she said i am leyse of the swan mark be welcome to daniloth she could see him drinking in her beauty the delicate music of her voice she let her eyes slide into a shade of green and then return to crystal again she offered a hand and let him take it and bring it to his lips ratenniel would have passed a sleepless night walking through fields of flowers shaping another song had she done as much for him she looked into lancelots eyes so dark she saw kindness there and admiration gratitude but behind everything else and above it all shaping the worlds he knew and woven through them all over and over endlessly she saw guinevere and the irrevocable finality the fact of his absolute love what she was spareda dimension of his kindnesswas seeing in his calm gaze even a hint of how many many times this meeting had come to pass in how many forests meadows worlds beside how many liquescent waterfalls making sweet summer music for a maidens heartbreak she was shielded by him even as she shaped her own warding from knowing how much a part of the long threefold doom this was how easily and entirely her sudden transfigured blazing could be gathered within the telling one more note of an oftrepeated theme a thread of a color already in the tapestry her beauty deserved more the incandescent crystalline flourishing of it so also did the centurieslong simplicity of her waiting that too by any measure deserved more and he knew this knew it as intimately as he knew his name as deeply as he named his own transgression within his heart he stood in that place of sheerest beauty within the shadowland and he shouldered her sorrow as he had done for so many others and took the guilt and the burden of it for his own and all this happened in the space of time it might take a man to cross a grassy sward and stand before a lady in the morning light it was by an act of will of consummate nobility that leyse kept the shading of her eyes as bright as before she held them to crystalfragile breakable crystal she was thinkingand she said with music in her voice how may i be of aid to thee only the last word betrayed her he gave no hint that he had heard the caress in it the longing she let slip into that one word he said formally i am on a quest set by my lady there will have been another who came within the borders of your land last night flying in the shape of an owl though not truly so he is on a journey of his own a very dark road and i fear he may have been caught within the shadows over daniloth unknowing in the night it is my charge to keep him safe to take that road there was nothing she wanted more than to lie down again beside the rising rushing waters of the falls of fiathal with this man beside her until the sun had gone and the stars and the loom had spun its course come then was all she said and led him from that place of gentlest beauty and enchantment in search of darien along the southern margins of daniloth they walked side by side a little distance between but not a great deal for he was deeply aware of what had happened to her they did not speak all around them the muted serene spaces of grass and hillocks stretched there were flowing rivers and flowers in pale delicate hues growing along their banks once he knelt to drink from a stream but she shook her head quickly and he did not she had seen his palm though as he cupped it to drink and when he stood she took it between her own and looked upon his wound he felt the pain of it then seeing it in her eyes more keenly than he had when hed lifted the black hammer in the sacred grove she did not ask slowly she released his handdid so as if surrendering it to everything in the world that was not her touchand they went on it was very quiet they passed no one else walking as the went once only they came upon a man clad in armor carrying a sword his face contorted with rage and fear he seemed to lancelot to be frozen in place motionless his foot thrust forward in a long stride he would never complete lancelot looked at leyse clad in white beside him but he said nothing another time it seemed to him that he heard the sound of horses rushing toward them very near he spun shielding her reflexively but he saw no one at all riding past whether friend or foe he could tell though from the turning of her gaze that she did see a company riding there riding right through the two of them perhaps lost as well in a different way amid the mists of daniloth he released his grip on her arm he apologized she shook her head with a sadness that went into him like a blade she said this land was always dangerous to anyone other than our kind even before lathen mistweavers time when these shadows came down those men were horsemen from before the bael rangat and they are lost there is nothing we can do for them they are in no time we know to be spoken to or saved had we space for the telling i might spin you the tale of revor who risked that fate in the service of light a thousand years ago had we space for the telling he said i would take pleasure in that she seemed about to say something more but then her eyesthey were a pale quiet blue now much like the last of the flowers they had passedlooked beyond his face and he turned west of them lay a thicket of trees the leaves of the trees were of many colors even in midsummer and the woods were very beautiful offering a promise of peace of quiet shade of a place where the sunlight might slant down through the leaves with a brook murmuring not far away above the southernmost of the trees of that small wood at the very edge of daniloth an owl hung suspended wings spread wide and motionless in the clear morning air lancelot looked and he saw the sheath of a dagger held in the owls mouth glint with a streak of blue in the mild light he turned back to the woman beside him her eyes had changed color they were dark looking upon the owl that hung in the air before them not this one she said before he could speak he heard the fear the denial in her voice oh my lord surely not this one he said this is the child i have been sent to follow and to guard can you not see the evil within him leyse cried her voice was loud in the quiet of that place there was music in it still but strained now and overlaid by many things i know it is there he said i know also that there is a yearning after light both are part of his road then let the road end here she said it was a plea she turned to him my lord there is too much darkness in this one i can feel it even from where we stand she was a child of light and she stood in daniloth her certainty planted a momentary doubt in his own heart it never took root he had his own certainties he said there is darkness everywhere now we cannot avoid it only break through and not easily in the danger of this might lie our hope of passage she looked at him for a long moment who is he she asked finally he had been hoping she would not ask for many reasons but when the question came he did not turn away guineveres child he said levelly though it cost him something and rakoth maugrims he took her by force in starkadh and therein lies the evil you see and the hope of light beyond there was pain now overlying the fear in her eyes and under both of those things at bedrock was love he had seen it before too many times she said and you think she will prove stronger music in her voice again distant but very clear it is a hope he replied gravely honest no more than that and you would act and have me act upon that hope music still she has asked me to guard him he said quietly to see him through to the choice he has to make i can do no more than ask you i have only the request she shook her head you have more than that she said and with the words she turned away from him leaving her heart she looked at the motionless bird child of dark and light then she gestured with her long graceful hands and sang a word of power to shape a space through which he could fly over the shadowland she made a corridor for darien a rift in the mists of time that coiled through daniloth and she watched with an inner brilliant sight as he flew north along that corridor over the mound of atronel and beyond coming out at length above the river celyn where she lost him it took a long time lancelot waited beside her silent all the while he had seen dariens flight begin but when the owl had gone some distance north over the manycolored leaves of the forest it was lost to his mortal sight he continued to wait knowing among many other things that this was as far as he would be able to follow guineveres child the last service he could offer it was a sorrow he was conscious as he stood beside leyse and the pale sun climbed higher in the sky of a great weariness and not a little pain there was a fragrance in the meadow and birdsong in the woods nearby he could hear the sound of water without actually being aware of having done so he found himself sitting upon the grass at the womans feet and then in a trance half shaped by daniloth and half by marrowdeep exhaustion he lay down and fell asleep when the owl had passed beyond the northernmost borders of her land and she had lost him beyond the mist leyse let her mind come back to where she stood it was early in the afternoon and the light was as bright as it ever became even so she too was very tired what she had done was not an easy thing made harder for one of the swan mark by the inescapable resonance of evil she had sensed she looked down upon the man fast asleep beside her there was a quiet now in her heart an acceptance of what had come to her beside the waters of fiathal she knew he would not stay unless she bound him by magic to this place and she would not do that one thing only she would allow herself she looked at his sleeping face for a very long tune committing it to the memory of her soul then she lay down beside him on the soft scented grass and slipped her hand into his wounded one no more than that for in her pride she would go no further and linked in that fashion for a toobrief summers afternoon joined only by their interwoven fingers she fell asleep for one time and the only time beside lancelot whom she loved through the afternoon they slept and in the quiet peace of daniloth nothing came not so much as a dream to cause either of them to stir far to the east across the looming barrier of the mountains the dwarves of banir lok and banir tal waited for sunset and the judgment of their crystal lake nearer on the wide plain a dwarf and an eridun and an exile of the dalrei reached the camp of the high king and were made welcome there before the army set out for the last hours of the ride to gwynir and the eastern borders of this shadowland and north of them as they slept darien was flying to his father they woke at the same time as the sun went down in the twilight lancelot gazed at her and he saw her hair and eyes gleam in the dusk beside him beautiful and strange he looked down at her long fingers laced through his own he closed his eyes for a moment and let the last of that deep peace wash over him like a tide a withdrawing tide very gently then he disengaged his hand neither of them spoke he rose there was a faint phosphorescence to the grass and to the leaves of the wood nearby as if the growing things of daniloth were reluctant to yield the light it was the same gleaming he saw in her eyes and in the halo of her hair there were echoes of many things in his mind memories he was careful not to let her see he helped her rise slowly the glow of light fadedfrom the leaves and the grass and then last of all from leyse she turned to the west and pointed he followed the line of her arm and saw a star lauriels she said we have named the evening star for her and then she sang he listened and partway through he wept for many reasons when her song was done she turned and saw his tears she said nothing more nor did he speak she led him north through daniloth sheltered from the mist and the loops of time by her presence all the night they walked she led him up the mound of atronel past the crystal throne and then down the other side and lancelot du lac was the first mortal man ever to ascend that place in time they came to the southern bay of celyn lake the arm that dipped down into daniloth and they went along its banks to the north not because it was quickest or easiest but because she loved this place and wanted him to see there were night flowers in bloom along the shore giving off their scent and out over the water he saw strange elusive figures dancing on the waves and he heard music all the while at length they came to the edge of a river where it left the waters of the lake and they turned to the west as the first hint of dawn touched the sky behind them and a very little while later leyse stopped and turned to lancelot the river is quiet here she said and there are stepping stones along which you may cross i can go no farther on the other side of celyn you will be in andarien he looked upon the beauty of her for a long time in silence when he opened his mouth to speak he was stopped for she placed her fingers over his lips say nothing she whispered there is nothing you can say it was true a moment longer he stood there then very slowly she drew her hand away from his mouth and he turned and crossed the river over the smooth round stones and so left daniloth he didnt go far whether it was an instinct of war or of love or of the two bound into each other he went only as far as a small copse of trees on the banks of the river near the lake there were willows growing in the celyn and beautiful flowers silver and red he didnt know their name he sat down in that place of beauty as the dawn brokedazzling after the muted light of the shadowlandand he gazed out upon the ruined desolation of andarien he looped his hands over his knees placed his sword where he could reach it and composed himself to wait facing west toward the sea she waited as well though she had told herself all through the long nights silent walking that she would not linger she had not expected him to stay so near though and her resolution faltered as soon as he was not there she saw him walk toward the aum trees and then sit down amid the sylvain she loved in her most cherished place of any in this one world she knew she knew he could not see her standing here and it was not easy for her to see clearly either beyond the encircling billows of the mist she waited nonetheless and toward the middle of the afternoon a company of some fifty people approached from the west along the riverbank she saw him rise she saw the company stop not far away from him leading them was brendel of the kestrel mark and she knew that if he looked to the south he would see her he did not he remained with the others and watched with the others as a woman fairhaired very tall walked toward lancelot it seemed to leyse that the mists parted a little for her thena blessing or a curse she could not sayand she saw lancelots face clearly as guinevere came up to him she saw him kneel and take her hand in his good one and bring it to his lips the same as he had done with hers when he had first approached her over the grass by fiathal yet not the same not the same and it came to pass that in that moment leyse of the swan mark heard her song she went away from that place walking alone hidden by the screening of the shadows and within her a song was building all the time a last song along the riverbank farther west she found amid the willows and corandiel a small craft of aum wood with a single sail white as her own white robe she had walked past this place a thousand times before and never seen that boat it had not been there she realized the music of her song had called it forth shed always thought that she would have to build her boat when the time came and had wondered how she would now she knew the song was within her rising all the while shaping a sweeter and sweeter sadness and a promise of peace to come beyond the waves she stepped down into the boat and pushed off from the restraining shallows and the willows as she drifted close to the northern bank of the celyn she plucked one red flower of sylvain and one of silver to carry with her as the music carried her and the river carried her to the sea she did not know and it was a granting of grace that she was spared the knowing how very much an echo this too was of the story she had been brought into how deeply woven it was into that saddest story of all the long tales told she drifted with the current with her flowers in her hand and at length she reached the sea and that craft shaped by magic brought into being by a longing that was of the very essence of the lios alfar did not founder among the waves of the wide sea westward it went and farther westward still and farther yet until at length it had gone far enough and had reached the place where everything changed including the world and in this fashion did leyse of the swan mark sail past the waters where the soulmonger had lain in wait and so became the first of her people for past a thousand years to reach the world the weaver had shaped for the children of light alone chapter the sun had set and so the glow of the walls had faded torches flickered in the brackets now they burned without smoke kim didnt know how she stood with the others at the foot of the ninetynine stairs that led to the crystal lake and a feeling of dread was in her heart there were eight of them there kaen had brought two dwarves she didnt know she and loren had come with matt and miach and ingen were present for the dwarfmoot to bear witness to the judgment of calor diman loren carried an object wrapped in a heavy cloth and so did one of kaens companions the crystalsfruits of an afternoons crafting gifts for the lake kaen had donned a heavy black cloak clasped at the throat with a single brooch worked in gold with a vein of blue thieren that flashed in the torchlight matt was dressed as he always was in brown with a wide leather belt and boots and no adornment at all kim looked at his face it was expressionless but he seemed strangely vivid flushed almost as if he were glowing no one spoke at a gesture from miach they began to climb the stairs were very old the stone crumbling in places worn smooth and slippery in others an inescapable contrast to the polished highly worked architecture everywhere else the walls were rough unfinished with sharp edges that might cut if not avoided it was hard to see clearly the torches cast shadows as much as light the primitive stairway seemed to kim to be carrying her back in time more than anything else she was profoundly aware of being within a mountain there was a growing consciousness of raw power massed all about her a power of rock and stone of earth upthrust to challenge sky an image came into her mind titanic forces battling with mountains for boulders to hurl at each other she felt the absence of the baelrath with an intensity that bordered on despair they came to the door at the top of the stairs it was not like the ones she had seenentranceways of consummate artistry that could slide into and out of the surrounding walls or high carved arches with their perfectly measured proportions she had known halfway up that this door wouldnt be like any of the others it was of stone not particularly large with a heavy blackened iron lock they waited on the threshold as miach walked up to it leaning upon his staff he drew an iron key from within his robe and turned it slowly with some effort in the lock then he grasped the handle and pulled the door swung open revealing the dark night sky beyond with a handful of stars framed in the opening they walked out in silence to the meadow of calor diman she had seen it before in a vision on the road to ysannes lake shed thought that might have prepared her it had not there was no preparing for this place the bluegreen meadow lay in the bowl of the mountains like a hidden fragile thing of infinite worth and cradled within the meadow as the meadow lay within the circle of the peaks were the motionless waters of the crystal lake the water was dark almost black kim had a swift apprehension of how deep and cold it would be here and there though along the silent surface of the water she could see a gleam of light as the lake gave back the light of the early stars the thinning moon had not yet risen she knew calor diman would shine when the moon came up over banir lok and she suddenly had a senseonly a sense but that was a good deal more than enoughof how utterly alien how terrifying this place would be when a full moon shone down on it and calor diman shone back upon the sky casting an inhuman light over the meadow and the mountainsides this would be no place for mortals on such a night madness would lie in the sky and in the deep waters in every gleaming blade of grass in the ancient watchful shining crags even now by starlight it was not easy to bear she had never realized how sharp a danger lay in beauty and there was something more as well something deeper and colder as the lake itself was deep and cold each passing second while the night gathered and the stars grew blighter made her more and more conscious of magic here waiting to be unleashed she was grateful beyond words for the green shielding of the vellin stone matts gift she remembered she looked at him who had been here on a night of the full moon and had survived and been made king by that she looked with a newer deeper understanding and saw that he was gazing back at her his face still vivid with that strange glowing intensity he had come home she realized the tide of the lake in his heart had drawn him back there was no longer any need to fight its pull no need to fight only judgment to be endured with so very much at risk here in this mountain bowl most of the way it seemed to the stars she thought of the army of the dwarves across the dividing range of the mountains she had no idea of what to do none at all matt came over to her with a gesture of his head not speaking he motioned her to walk a little way apart she went with him from the others she put up the hood of her robe and plunged her hands in the pockets it was very cold she looked down at matt and said nothing waiting he said very softly i asked you a long time ago to save some of your words of praise for ysannes lake against the time when you might see this place it is past beauty she replied beyond any words i might offer but i am very much afraid matt i know i am as well if i do not show it it is because i have made my peace with whatever judgment is to come what i did forty years ago i did in the name of light it may still have been an act of evil such things have happened before and will happen again i will abide by the judging she had never seen him like this she felt humbled in his presence behind matt miach was whispering something to ingen and then he motioned loren to approach and kaens companion carrying their crystals wrapped in cloth matt said it is time now i think and it may be an ending to my time i have something for you first he lowered his head and brought a hand up to the patch over his lost eye she saw him lift the patch and for the first time she caught a glimpse of the ruined socket behind then something white fell out and he caught it in the palm of his hand it was a tiny square of soft cloth matt opened itto show her the baelrath gleaming softly in his hand kim let out a wordless cry i am sorry matt said i know you will have been tormented by fear of who had it but i have had no chance to speak with you i took it from your hand when we were first attacked by the doorway to banir lok i thought it would be best if i kept an eye on it until we knew what was happening forgive me she swallowed took the warstone put it on it flared on her finger then subsided again she said reaching for the tone that used to come so easily to her i will forgive you anything and everything from now until the looms last thread is woven except the wretched pun his mouth crooked sideways she wanted to say more but there really wasnt time it seemed that there had never been enough time miach was calling to them kim sank to her knees in the deep cold grass and matt embraced her with infinite gentleness then he kissed her once on the lips and turned away she followed him back to where the others stood there was power on her hand now and she could feel it responding to the magic of this place slowly gradually but there was no mistaking it and suddenly now that it was hers again she remembered some of the things the baelrath had caused her to do there was a price to power she had been paying it all along and others had been paying it with her arthur finn ruana and the paraiko tabor not a new grief but sterner now and sharper she had no chance to think about it she came up to stand beside loren in time to hear miach speak with a hushed gravity you will not need to be told that there is no history for this we are living through days that have no patterns to draw upon even so the dwarftnoot has taken counsel and this is what shall be done with six of us to witness a judgment between two he paused to draw breath there was no stir of wind in the mountain bowl the cold night air was still as if waiting and still too were the starry waters of the lake miach said you will each unveil your crystal fashionings that we may take note of them and what they might mean and then you will cast them together into the waters and we will wait for a sign from the lake if there is fault found with this speak to it now he looked at kaen who shook his head no fault he said in the resonant beautiful voice let he who turned away from his people and from calor diman seek to avoid this hour he looked handsome and proud in his black cloak with the golden and blue brooch holding it about him miach looked to matt no fault said matt sören nothing more when kim thought a lump in her throat had he ever wasted a word in all the time shed known him legs spread wide hands on his hips he seemed to be as one with the rocks all around them as enduring and as steadfast and yet he had left these mountains she thought of arthur in that moment and the children slain she grieved in her heart for the sins of good men caught in a dark world longing for light the question at issue miach had said in seithrs hall is whether the king can surrender the lake she didnt know none of them did they were here to find out miach turned back to kaen and nodded kaen walked over to his companion who held up his hands the covered crystal within them and with a sweeping graceful motion kaen drew the cloth away kim felt as if shed been punched in the chest tears sprang to her eyes her breath was torn away and she had to fight for some time before it came back and all the while she was inwardly cursing the terrible unfairness the corruscating ultimate irony of thisthat someone so twisted with evil with deeds so very black laid down at the door of his heart should have so much beauty at his command he had shaped out of crystal in miniature the cauldron of khath meigol it was exactly as she had seen it in her long dark mind journey from the temple in gwen ystrat when she had ventured so far into the blackness of rakoths designs that she could never have come back without ruanas chanting to shield her and give her a reason to return it was exactly the same but with everything reversed somehow the black cauldron she had seen the source of the killing winter in midsummer and then the death rain that had unpeopled eridu was now a glittering delicate ineffably glorious thing of crystalline light even to the runic lettering around the rim and the symmetrical design at the base kaen had taken the image of that dark shattered cauldron and made of it a thing that caught the starlight as brightly as did the lake it was a thing to be longed for to be heartachingly desired by every single one of the weavers mortal children in all the worlds of time both for itself and for what it symbolized the return from death from beyond the walls of night the passionate yearning of all those fated to die that there might be a coming back or a going on that the ending not be an ending kim looked at the dwarf who had done this saw him gaze at his own creation and understood in that moment how he could have come to release maugrim and surrender the cauldron into his hand kaens she realized was the soul of an artist carried too far the search the yearning for knowledge and creation taken to the point where madness began using the cauldron would have meant nothing to such a one it was the finding that mattered the knowledge of where it was it was all abstract internalized and so allconsuming that nothing could be allowed to stand between the searcher and his long desire not a thousand deaths or tens of thousands not a world given over to the dark or all the worlds given over he was a genius and mad he was selfabsorbed to the point where that could no longer be separated from evil and yet he held this beauty within himself pitched to a level kim had never thought to see or ever imagined could be seen she didnt know how long they stood transfixed by that shining thing at length miach gave a small almost an apologetic cough he said kaens gift has been considered his voice was husky diffident kim couldnt even blame him had she been able to speak that too would have been her tone even with all she knew matt sören miach said matt walked over to loren for a moment he paused before the man for whom he had forsaken these mountains and this lake a look passed between the two of them that made kimberiy turn away for a moment it was so deeply private speaking to so many things that no one else had a right to share then matt quietly drew the cloth from his own fashioning loren was holding a dragon in his hands it bore the same relationship to kaens dazzling artistry that the stone door at the top of the stairs did to the magnificent archways that led into seithrs hall it was roughly worked all planes and sharp angles not polished where kaens cauldron glittered brilliantly in the starlight matts crafted dragon seemed dull beside it it had two great gouged eyes and its head was turned upward at an awkward straining angle and yet kim couldnt take her eyes off it nor she was aware had any of the others there not even kaen whose quick chuckle of derision had given way to silence looking more closely kim saw that the roughness was entirely deliberate a matter of decision not inability or haste the line of the dragons shoulder she saw would have been a matter of moments to smooth down and the same was true of the sharp edge of the averted neck matt had wanted it this way and slowly she began to understand she shivered then uncontrollably for there was power in this beyond words rising from the soul and the heart from an awareness not sourced in the conscious mind for whereas kaen had soughtand founda form to give expression to the beauty of this place to catch and transmute the stars matt had reached for something else he had shaped an approachno more than thatto the ancient primitive power kim had sensed as they mounted the stairs and had been overwhelmingly conscious of from the moment they had come into the meadow calor diman was infinitely more than a place of glory however much it was that it was hearthstone bedrock root it encompassed the roughness of rock and the age of earth and the cold depths of mountain waters it was very dangerous it was the heart of the dwarves and the power of them and matt sören who had been made king by a night in this high meadow knew that better than anyone alive and his grafting for the lake bore witness to it none of them there could know it and the one man who might have told them had died in gwen ystrat to end the winter but there was a cracked stone bowl of enormous antiquity lying even then beside a chasm in danas cave at dun maura and that bowl embodied the same unthinking awareness of the nature of ancient power that matt sörens dragon did you did this before said miach quietly forty years ago you remember matt asked i do it was not the same i was young then i thought i might strive to equal in crystal the truth of what i was shaping i am older now and some few things i have learned i am glad of a chance to set matters right before the end there was a grudging respect in miachs eyes and in ingens as well kim saw in lorens face was something else an expression that combined somehow a fathers pride and a brothers and a sons very well miach said straightening as much as his bent years would allow we have considered both of your craftings take them and cast them forth and may the queen of waters grant her guidance to us now matt sören took his dragon then and kaen his shining crystal cauldron and the two of them went side by side away from the six who would watch and they came in the silence of that night under the stars but not yet the laterising moon to the shore of calor diman and there they stopped there were stars mirrored in the lake and high overhead and then a moment later there were two more shining things above the water as both dwarves who had come to be judged threw their crystal gifts in arcs out over the lake and they fell both of them with splashes that echoed in the brooding stillness and disappeared in the depths of calor diman there were kim saw with a shiver no ripples at all to ruffle the water and so mark the place where they fell then came a time of waiting a time outside of time so charged with the resonances of that place it seemed to go on forever to have been going on since first fionavar was spun onto the loom kimberly for all her dreaming all her seers gifts had no hint of what they were waiting to see what form the lakes answer was to take never taking her eyes from the two dwarves by the water she reached within and found her own twin soul searching for a reply to the question she could not answer but neither it seemed could the part of her that was ysanne not even the old seers dreams or her own vast store of knowledge were equal to this the dwarves had guarded their secret far too well and then even as kim was thinking this she saw that calor diman was moving whitecaps began to take shape in the center of the lake and with them there suddenly came a sound high and shrill a wailing haunted cry unlike anything shed ever heard loren beside her murmured something that must have been a prayer the whitecaps became waves and the wailing sound grew higher and higher and then so too did the waves and suddenly they were rushing hugely from the agitated heart of the dark water toward the shore as if calor diman were emptying her center or rising from it and in that moment the crystal dragon came understanding burst in kimberly then and with it a sense after the fact as so many times before that it should have been obvious all along she had seen the enormous sculpture of a dragon dominating the entrance of seithrs hall she had seen matts crafting and heard what he and miach had said to each other she had known there was more than beauty in this place she had been aware of magic ancient and deep this was it this crystalline shimmering dragon of the lake was the power of calor diman it was the heart of the dwarves their soul and their secret which she and loren had now been allowed to see a fact she was grimly aware that made their deaths doubly certain if kaen should prevail in what was coming she forced her mind from that thought all around her everyone else including loren had knelt she did not not clearly understanding the impulse that kept her on her feetpride but more than thatshe met the shining eyes of the crystal dragon as they fell upon her and she met them with respect but as an equal it was hard though the dragon was unimaginably beautiful creature of mountain meadow and the icy depths of mountain waters it glittered almost translucent in the starlight rising from the agitated waves high above the kneeling figures of the two dwarves on the banks of calor diman then it spread its wings and kimberly cried aloud in wonder and awe for the wings of the dragon dazzled and shone with a myriad of colors like gems in infinite variety a play of light in the meadow bowl of night she almost did sink to her knees then but again something kept her on her feet watching her heart aching the dragon did not fly it held itself suspended half within the water half rising from it then it opened its mouth and flame burst forth flame without smoke like the torches on the walls within the mountain bluewhite flame through which the stars could still be seen the fire died the dragons wings were still a silence cold and absolute like the silence that might have lain at the very beginning of time wrapped the meadow kim saw one of the dragons claws slowly emerge glittering from the water there was something clutched in its grasp something the crystal dragon suddenly tossed with what seemed to her to be contemptuous disdain on the grass by the lake she saw what it was no she breathed the sound torn from her like flesh from a wound discarded on the grass glinting lay a miniature crafting of a crystal dragon wait loren whispered sharply rising to his feet he touched her hand look even as she watched she saw the dragon of calor diman raise a second claw holding a second object and this was a cauldron of shining scintillant beauty and this object too the dragon threw away to lie sparkling on the bluegreen grass she didnt understand she looked at loren there was a curious light in his eyes he said look again kim look closely she turned back saw matt and kaen kneeling by the lake saw the dragon shining above them saw stars subsiding waves dark mountain crags saw a crystal cauldron tumbled on the grass and a small crafted dragon lying beside it saw that the dragon discarded there was not the one matt had just offered to the lake and in that moment as hope blazed in her like the dragons bluewhite fire kim saw something else come up from calor diman a tiny creature exploded from the water furiously beating wings holding it aloft a creature that now shone more brilliantly than it ever had before with eyes that dazzled in the night no longer dark and lifeless it was the hearts crafting matt had offered given life by the lake which had accepted his gift there was a flurry of motion kaen scrambled forward on his knees he reclaimed his cauldron rose to his feet holding it outstretched beseechingly no he pleaded wait he had time for nothing more time ended for him in that high place of beauty which was so much more than that power suddenly made manifest its presence for a moment only but a moment was enough the dragon of the lake the guardian of the dwarves opened its mouth and flame roared forth a second time not up into the mountain air not for warning or display the dragonfire struck kaen of banir lok where he stood arms extended offering his rejected gift again and it incinerated him consumed him utterly for one horrifying instant kim saw his body writhing within the translucent flame and then he was gone there was nothing left at all not even the cauldron he had made the bluewhite fire died and when it did matt sören was kneeling alone in the stunned silence of aftermath by the shore of the lake she saw him reach out and pick up the sculpted dragon lying beside him the one kim now realizedseeing what loren had grasped from the firstthat he had shaped forty years ago when the lake had made him king slowly matt rose to stand facing the dragon of calor diman it seemed to kim that there was a tinted brightness to the air then the dragon spoke you should not have gone away it said with an ancient sorrow so deep a sadness after so wild a blaze of power matt lowered his head i accepted your gift that night the dragon said in a voice like a mountain wind cold and clear and lonely i accepted it because of the courage that lay beneath the pride of what you offered me i made you king under banir lok you should not have gone away matt looked up accepting the weight of the dragons crystal gaze still he said nothing beside her kim became aware that loren was weeping quietly nevertheless said the dragon of the lake and there was a new timbre in its voice nevertheless you have changed since you went from here matt sören you have lost an eye in wars not properly those of your people but you have shown tonight with this second gift that with one eye only you still see more deeply into my waters than any of the kings of the dwarves have ever done before kimberly bit her lip she slipped her hand into lorens there was a brightness in her heart you should not have gone away she heard the dragon say to matt but from what you have done tonight i will accept that a part of you never did be welcome back matt sören and hear me as i name you now truest of all kings ever to reign under banir lok and banirtal there was light there seemed to be so much light a tinted rosy hue of fiercest illumination oh kim no loren suddenly cried in a choked desperate voice not this oh surely not this light burned to ash in the wake of knowledge of bitter bitterest recurring understanding of course there was light in the meadow of course there was she was here with the baelrath blazing in wildest summons on her hand matt had wheeled at lorens cry kim saw him look at the ring he had only just returned to her and she read the brutal anguish in his face as this moment of heartdeep triumph the moment of his return was transformed into something terrible beyond words she wanted desperately not to be here not to understand what this imperative blazing meant she was here though and she did know and she had not knelt to the dragon because somehow a part of her must have been aware of what was to come what had come now she carried the warstone again the summons to war and it was on fire to summon to compel the crystal dragon from its mountain bowl kim had no illusions none at alland the sight of matts stricken face would have stripped them away from her if shed had any the dragon could not leave the lake not if it was to be what it had always been ancient guardian key to the soul heartdeep symbol of what the dwarves were what she was about to do would shatter the people of the twin mountains as much and more as she had smashed the paraiko in khath meigol this crystal power of calor diman which had endured the death rain of maugrim would not be able to resist the fire she carried nothing could matt turned away loren released her hand i dont have a choice she cried within her heart not aloud she knew why the stone was burning there was tremendous power here in this creature of the lake and its very shining made it a part of the army of light they were at war with the dark with the unnumbered legions of rakoth she had carried the ring here for a reason and this was it she stepped forward toward the nowstill waters of calor diman she looked up and saw the clear eyes of the dragon resting upon her accepting and unafraid though infinitely sorrowful as deeply rooted in power as anything in fionavar and knowing that kims was a force that would bind it and change it forever on her hand the baelrath was pulsing now so wildly that the whole of the meadow and all the mountain crags were lit by its glow kim lifted her hand she thought of macha and nemain the goddesses of war she thought of ruana and the paraiko remembered the kanior the last kanior because of her she thought of arthur and of matt sören who stood not far away not looking at her lest his expression plead she thought upon the evil that good men had done in the name of light remembered jennifer in starkadh war was upon them it was all around them threatening those living now and all who might come after with the terrible dominion of the dark no said kimberly ford quietly with absolute finality i have come this far and have done this much i will go no farther on this path there is a point beyond which the quest for light becomes a serving of the dark kim matt began his face was working strangely be silent she said stern because she would break if she heard him speak she knew him and knew what he would say come here beside me loren and miach too ill need you her mind was racing as fast as it ever had they moved toward her drawn by the power in her voiceher seers voiceas much as by the burning on her hand she knew exactly what she was doing and what it might mean knew the implications as deeply as she had ever known anything at all and she would shoulder them if it made her name a curse from now to the end of time then so be it she would not destroy what she had seen tonight there was understanding in the dragons crystal eyes slowly it spread its wings like a curtain of benison manycolored glittering with light kim had no illusions about that none at all the two dwarves and the man were beside her now the flame on her hand was still driving her to summon it was demanding that she do so there was war there was need she met the eyes of the dragon for the very last time no she said again with all the conviction of her soulboth her souls and then she used the incandescent overwhelming blazing of the ring not to bind the dragon of the dwarves but to take herself away across the mountains herself and three others with her far from that hidden place of starlight and enchantment though not so far as she had gone in coming there the baelraths power was rampant within her flaming with the fire of war she entered into it saw where it was she had to go gathered and channeled what she carried and took them there they came down in what seemed to all of them to be a corona of crimson light they were in a clearing a clearing in the forest of gwynir not far from daniloth someones here a voice screamed in strident warning another echoed it voices of dwarves from the army blod commanded they had come in time kim was driven to her knees by the impact of landing she looked quickly around and saw dave martyniuk standing not ten feet away from her with an axe in his hand behind him she recognized with an incredulity that bordered on stupefaction faebur and brock swords drawn there was no time to think miach she screamed stop them and the aged leader of the dwarfmoot did not fail her moving more swiftly than she had ever thought he could he stepped between dave and the trio of dwarves menacing him and he cried hold arrows and blades people of the mountains miach of the moot commands you in the name of the king of the dwarves there was thunder in him for that one moment a ringing peal of command the dwarves froze slowly dave lowered his axe faebur his bow in the brittle silence of the forest clearing miach said very clearly hear me there has been judgment tonight by the shores of calor diman matt sören returned to our mountains yesterday and it was the decision of the moot after a wordstriving in seithrs hall between him and kaen that their dispute be left to the lake so did it come to pass tonight i must tell you that kaen is dead destroyed by the fire of the lake the spirit of calor diman came forth tonight and i saw it with my eyes and heard it name matt sören to be our king again and more i heard it name him as truest of all kings ever to reign under the mountains you are lying a harsh voice intruded none of this is true rinn nemedseize him blod pointed a shaking finger at miach no one moved i am first of the moot miach said calmly i cannot lie you know this is true i know you are an old fool blod snarled in response why should we let ourselves be deceived by that childrens fable you can lie as well as any of us miach better than any of blod said the king of the dwarves have done it is over matt stepped forward from the darkness of the trees he said nothing more and his voice had not been loud but the tone of command was complete and not to be mistaken blods face worked spasmodically but he did not speak behind him a swelling murmur of sound rushed backward through the army to the ends of the clearing and beyond where dwarves had been sleeping among the evergreens they were sleeping no longer oh my king a voice cried brock of banir tal stumbled forward throwing down his axe to kneel at matts feet bright the hour of our meeting matt said to him formally he laid a hand on brocks shoulder but stand back now old friend there is a thing yet to be done there was something in his voice that evoked an abrupt image for kim of the iron lock on the door to the meadow of calor diman brock withdrew gradually the murmur and the cries of the army subsided a watchful silence descended occasionally someone coughed or a twig crackled underfoot in that stillness matt sören confronted the dwarf who had served in starkadh who had done what he had done to jennifer who had been leading the dwarves even now in the army of the dark blods eyes darted back and forth but he did not try to run or plead kim had thought he would be a coward but she was wrong none of the dwarves lacked courage it seemed even those who had surrendered themselves to evil blod of banir lok matt said your brother has died tonight and your dragon waits for you now as well in judgment astride the wall of night in the presence of our people i will grant you what you do not deserve a right to combat and life in exile if you survive as atonement for my own wrongs which are many i will fight you in this wood until one of us is dead matt no loren exclaimed matt held up one hand he did not turn around first though he said i would ask leave of those assembled here to take this battle upon myself there are a very great many here who have a claim upon your death he did turn then and of all of them it was to faebur that he looked first i see one here whose face marks him as an eridun have i leave to take this death for you and in the name of your people stranger of eridu kim saw the young man step forward a single pace i am faebur once of larak he said king of the dwarves you have leave to do this for me and for all the raindead of eridu and in the name of a girl called arrian whom i loved and who is gone the weaver guide your hand he withdrew with a dignity that belied his years again matt turned dave martyniuk you too have a claim to this for the sufferings of a woman of your own world and the death of a man will you surrender that claim to me i will surrender it dave said solemnly mabon of rhoden matt asked and mabon said gravely in the name of the high king of brennin i ask you to act for the army of brennin and cathal levon dan ivor this hour knows his name levon said strike for the dalrei matt sören for the living and the dead miach strike for the dwarves king of the dwarves only then did matt draw forth his axe from where it hung by his side and turn again his face grim as mountain stone to blod who was waiting contemptuously have i your word blod asked now in the sharp edgy voice so unlike his brothers that i will walk safely from this place if i leave you dead you have said matt clearly and i declare this in the presence of the first of the dwarfmoot and blod had not waited even as matt was speaking the other dwarf had thrown himself sideways into the shadows and hurled a cunning dagger straight at matts heart matt did not even bother to dodge with an unhurried movement as if he had all the time in the world he blocked the flung blade with the head of his axe it fell harmlessly to the grass blod swore and scrambled to his feet reaching for his own weapon he never touched it matt sörens axe thrown then with all the strength of his arm and all the passion of his heart flew through the firelit clearing like an instrument of the watching gods a power of ultimate justice never to be denied and it smote blod between the eyes and buried itself in his brain killing him where he stood there were no shouts no cheering a collective sigh seemed to rise and fall within the clearing and beyond it to where dwarves stood watching among the trees kim had a sudden image in that moment of a spirit batwinged malevolent rising to fly away there was a dragon waiting for him matt had said let it be so she thought she looked at the body of the dwarf who had savaged jennifer and it seemed to her that vengeance should mean more somehow it should be more of a reply something beyond this bloodied torchlit body in gwynir oh jen she thought hes dead now ill be able to tell you that hes dead it didnt mean as much as shed once thought it would it was only a step a stage in this terrible journey there was too far yet to go she had no more time for thoughts which was a blessing and not a small one brock came rushing up to her and faebur and she was embracing them both with joy amid the steadily growing noise all around there was time for a quick question and answer about dalreidan and for delighted wonder as she learned who he really was then finally she was standing in front of dave who had of course been hanging back letting the others approach her first pushing her hair from her eyes she looked up at him well she began and got no further she was gathered in an embrace that lifted her completely off the ground and threatened to squeeze every trace of air out of her lungs i have never he said holding her close his mouth to her ear been so happy to see anyone in all my life he let her go she dropped to the ground and stumbled gasping frantically for breath she heard mabon of rhoden chuckle she was grinning like an idiot she knew me neither she said aware abruptly of how true that was me neither ahem said levon dan ivor with the broadest stage cough shed ever heard they turned to find him grinning as much as they were i hate to intrude with petty matters of concern the avens son said striving to sound sardonic but we do have a report to make to the high king on tonights events and if were to get back before tore and sorcha raise a false alarm wed best get moving aileron shed be seeing aileron again too so much was happening so fast she drew a breath and turned to see that matt had come over to her her smile faded in her mind even as she stood among the evergreens of gwynir she was seeing a crystal lake and a dragon rising from it glittering wings spread wide a place where she would never walk again under stars or sun or moon she was a seer she knew that this was so she and matt looked at each other for a long time at length he said the ring is dark it is she said she didnt even have to look she knew she knew something else too but that was her own burden not his she said nothing about it seer matt began he stopped kim you were supposed to bind it werent you to bring it to war only loren and miach standing behind matt would know what he was talking about picking her words carefully she said we have a choice matt we are not slaves even to our gifts i chose to use the ring another way she said nothing more she was thinking about darien even as she spoke about choices remembering him running into pendaran past a burning tree matt drew a breath and then he nodded slowly may i thank you he asked this was hard everything was hard now not yet she said wait and see you may not want to i dont think well have long to wait and that last thing was said in her seers voice and so she knew it was true very well matt said he turned to levon you say you must carry word to the high king we will join you tomorrow the dwarves have gone through a time worse than any in all our days we shall remain by ourselves in these woods tonight and try to deal with what has happened to us tell aileron we will meet him here when he comes and that matt sören king of the dwarves will bring his people into the army of the light at that time i will tell him said levon simply come davor mabon faebur he glanced at kim and she nodded with loren and dave on either side she began to follow levon south out of the clearing wait matt cried suddenly to her astonishment kim heard real fear in his voice loren where are you going loren turned an awkward expression investing his lined face you asked us to leave he protested to leave the dwarves alone for tonight matts grim face seemed to change in the firelight not you he whispered softly never you my friend surely you will not leave me now the two of them looked at each other in that way they had of seeming to be alone in the midst of a great many people and then very slowly loren smiled as they followed levon out of the clearing into the darkness of the evergreens kim and dave paused for a moment to look back they saw matt sören standing with brock on one side and loren silvercloak on the other matt had placed his fingertips together in front of his chest with his palms held a little way apartas if to form a mountain peak with his hands and one by one the dwarves of the twin mountains were filing up to him and kneeling and placing their own hands between his inside the sheltering mountain the dwarf king formed part ivandarien chapter in one way leila thought listening to the last notes of the mornings lament for liadon it had been easier than shed had any right to expect she stood alone behind the altar looking out upon all the others closest to the axe but careful not to touch it for that the high priestess alone could do she stood closest though she was fifteen years old only newly clad in the grey of the priestesses yet jaelle had named her to act in her stead while the high priestess was away from paras derval dun to grey to red she was of the mormae now jaelle had warned her that there might be difficulties here in the temple the fact that there hadnt been so far had a great deal to do with fear they were all a little afraid of her ever since the evening when only four nights ago she had seen owein and the wild hunt arrive at the battle by celidon and had served as conduit for ceinwens voice to resound in the sanctuary so far from the river where the goddess was in the supercharged atmosphere of war that manifestation of her own unsettling powers was still reverberating in the temple unfortunately it didnt help much with gwen ystrat audiart was another matter entirely three separate times in the day and a half following jaelles departure the second of the goddess had reached for leila through the gathered mormae in morvran and three times audiart had graciously offered to make her way to para derval to assist the poor beleaguered child so unfairly taxed with such a heavy burden in such a terrible time it had taken all the clarity and firmness leila could muster to hold her back she knew the issues at stake as well as any of them if jaelle did not return then leila named in a time of war to act as high priestess would become the high priestess notwithstanding all the normal peacetime rituals of succession she also knew that jaelle had been explicit about this one thing audiart was not to be allowed to come to the temple during the last mindlink the evening before diplomacy hadnt worked at all jaelle had warned her it might not and had told her what to do but that didnt make the doing any easier for a fifteenyearold confronting the most formidable figure of the mormae nonetheless she had done it aided by the astonishing clarityshe even surprised herself with itof her own mind voice during the linkings and speaking as acting high priestess invoking the goddess by the nine names in sequence she had formally ordered audiart to remain precisely where she was in gwen ystrat and to initiate no further mindlinks she leila had far too much to do to tolerate any more of these avarlithdraining communications and then she had broken the link that had been last night she hadnt slept very well afterward troubled by dreams one was of audiart mounted on some terrible sixlegged steed thundering over the roads from morvran to seize and bind her with cold curses from millennia ago there had been other dreams having nothing to do with the mormae leila didnt understand the way her own mind worked where her swirling premonitions came from but they had been with her all night long and most of them were about finn which since she knew where he really was and with whom he rode became the most unsettling thing of all darien never even knew hed been frozen in time over daniloth as far as he was concerned hed been flying north the dagger in his mouth all the while it was evening and not morning when he left the shadowland and came out over andarien but he didnt know the geography here so that didnt concern him in any case it was hard to think clearly in the owl shape and he was very tired by now he had flown from brennin to the anor lisen and then walked to the sacred grove and flown again from there through an unsleeping night to daniloth and then through the whole of yet another day to where he now was heading north to his father through the growing darkness he flew and his keen night sight registered the presence of an unimaginably vast army gathering beneath him on the barren desolation of this land he knew who they were but he didnt descend or slow to take a closer look he had a long way to go below him a lean scarred figure lifted his head suddenly to cast a keen glance at the darkening sky there was nothing there only a single owl its plumage still white despite the changed season galadan watched it flying north there was an old superstition about owls they were good luck or bad depending on which way they curved overhead this one did not swerve arrowing straight north over the massing army of the dark the wolflord watched it troubled by a nameless disquiet until it disappeared it was the color he decided the strange whiteness at sunset over this barren desolation he put it out of his mind with the snow gone white was a vulnerable color and more of the swans were due to be coming back down from the north tonight the owl was unlikely to survive it almost didnt a few hours later darien was even more tired than before and fatigue made him careless he became aware of danger only an instant before the unnatural claws of one of avaias brood reached his flesh he screeched almost dropping the dagger and veered sharply downward and to his left even so one claw claimed a half dozen feathers from his side another black swan swooped hugely toward him wings lashing the air darien wheeled desperately back to his right and forced his tired wings into a steep climb straight toward the last of the three black swans which had been waiting patiently behind the other two for precisely this move owls for all their vaunted intelligence were fairly predictable in combat with a carnivorous grin the third swan waited for the little white owl keen to slake its continuous hunger for blood in dariens breast fear beat back tiredness and following upon terror came a red surge of rage he did not even try to dodge this last pursuing swan straight at it he flew and an instant before they collideda collision that would surely have killed himhe let his eyes burn as red as they could go with the same blast of fire he had used to torch the tree he incinerated the swan it didnt even have time to scream darien wheeled again fury pulsing within him and he raked the other two swans with the same red fire and they died he watched them fall to the dark earth below all around him the air was full of the smell of singed feathers and charred flesh he felt dizzy suddenly and overwhelmingly weak he let himself descend in a slow shallow glide looking for a tree of any kind there were none this was andarien and nothing so tall as a tree grew here not for a thousand years he came to rest for want of a better place on the slope of a low hill littered with boulders and sharpedged stones it was cold the wind blew from the north and made a keening sound as it passed between the rocks there were stars overhead low in the east the waning moon had just risen it offered no comfort casting only a chill faint illumination over the stony landscape the stunted grass darien took his own shape again he looked around nothing moved as far as he could see in the wide night he was completely alone in a gesture that had become a reflex in the past two days though he was unaware of that he reached up to touch the stone set in the circlet of lisen it was as cool and dark and distant as it had been from the moment hed put it on he remembered the way it had shone in the seers hands the memory was like a blade or the wound made by a blade either or both he lowered his hand and looked around again about him in every direction stretched the desolation of andarien he was so far to the north that rangat was almost east of him it towered over the whole of the northlands dominant and magnificent he didnt look at the mountain for long instead he turned his gaze due north and because he was much more than mortal and his eyes were very good he could discern far off through the moonlit shadows where the stony highlands reached the mountains and the ice a cold greenish glow and he knew that this was starkadh beyond the valgrind bridge and that he could fly there by tomorrow he decided that he would not fly though something about the owl shape felt wrong he wanted to hold to his own form he realized to be darien whatever and whoever that might be to regain the clarity of thought that came in his human shape though at the price of loneliness even so he would do it this way he would not fly he would go on foot over the stones and the barren soil over the ruin of this wasteland he would go with an extinguished light upon his brow bearing a blade in his hand as a gift for the dark not tonight though he was much too tired and there was a pain in his side where the swans claw had caught him he was probably bleeding but was too weary to even check he lay down on the south side of the largest of the bouldersfor such scant shelter as it might offer from the windand in time he did fall asleep despite his fears and cares he was young yet and had come a long distance to a lonely place and his soul was as much overtaxed as his body was as he passed over into the far countries of sleep his mother was sailing in a ghostly ship down linden bay just beyond the moonlit western ridges of the land toward the river mouth of the celyn he dreamt of finn all night just as leila did in the temple a long way south his dream was of the last afternoon when he had still been small playing in the yard behind the cottage with his brother and they had seen riders passing on the snowclad slopes east of them he had waved a mittened hand because finn had told him to and then finn had gone away after the riders and then much farther than they had gone farther than anyone else even darien even in dream could go he did not know huddled in the shadow of a leaning boulder on the cold ground of andarien that he was crying in his sleep nor did he know that all night long his hand kept returning to the lifeless gem bound about his brow reaching reaching out for something finding no response do you know said diarmuid gazing east with an enigmatic expression this is almost enough to make one believe in fraternal instincts after all beside him on the banks of the river celyn paul remained silent across the northwestern spur of the lake the army was coming they were too far off yet for him to make out individual details but that didnt matter what mattered was that diarmuid for all the reflexive irony of his words had indeed been right aileron had not waited for them or for anyone he had carried this war to maugrim the army of the high king was in andarien again a thousand years after it had last swept through these wild desolate highlands and waiting for them in the lateafternoon light was his brother with arthur and lancelot and guinevere with sharra of cathal and jaelle the high priestess with the men of south keep who had manned prydwen and with pwyll twiceborn lord of the summer tree for what paul thought that last was worth it didnt at the moment feel like much he should be used to this by now he knew this sense of latency without control of holding power without harnessing it he remembered jaelles words on the rocks and he was acutely aware that she was rightaware of how much his difficulties were caused by his own overdeveloped need for controlling things particularly himself all of this was true it made sense he even understood it it didnt make him feel any better though not now not so near to whatever ending lay in wait whatever future toward which they were toiling he has the dwarves with him keeneyed brendel suddenly cried now that said diannuid sharply is news it was matt succeeded then paul exclaimed do you see him brendel the silverhaired lios alfar scanned the distant army not yet he murmured but yes it has to be her the seer is with the high king no one else has her white hair paul looked quickly over at jennifer she returned his glance and smiled it was strange he thought in some ways it was the strangest thing of all how she could be at once so different so remote so much guinevere of camelot arthurs queen lancelots love and then a moment later with the quickness of a smile be jennifer lowell again sharing his own flash of joy at kimberlys return should we walk around the lake to meet them arthur asked diarmuid shook his head with exaggerated decisiveness they have horses he said pointedly and we have been walking all day if brendel can see them then the lios alfar in the army can see us there are limits im afraid to how far i will stumble over those rocks in order to meet a brother who didnt bother to wait for me lancelot laughed glancing over at him paul was hit with a renewed sense of awe and predictably by another wave of his own frustrated impotence lancelot had been waiting for them here sitting patiently under the trees as they had walked up along the river two hours ago in the gentle restraint of his greeting of guinevere and then of arthur paul had glimpsed again the depths of the grief that bound these three it was not an easy thing to watch and then lancelot had told sparely without inflection the tale of his night battle with the demon in the sacred grove for the life of darien he made it sound prosaic almost a negligible event but every man and the three women there could see the wounds and burns of that battle the price he had paid for what paul didnt know none of them did not even jennifer and there had been nothing at all to be read in her eyes as lancelot told of freeing the owl in daniloth and watching it fly north the random thread in this weaving of war a war that seemed to be upon them now the army had come closer it was rounding the tip of celyn lake beneath diarmuids acerbic flippancy paul could read a febrile tension building the reunion with his brother the nearness of battle they could make out figures now paul saw aileron under the banner of the high kingdom and then he realized that the banner had changed the tree was still there the summer tree for which he himself was named but the moon above it was no longer the silver crescent of before instead the moon above the tree was the red full moon dana had caused to shine on a new moon nightthe goddesss challenge to maugrim and the challenge aileron was carrying now at the head of the army of light and so that army rode up around the lake and it came to pass that the sons of ailell met again on the borders of daniloth north of the river celyn among the broadleafed aum trees and the silver and red flowers of sylvain on the riverbank diarmuid with sharra holding him by the hand walked a little forward from the others and aileron too stepped apart from the army he led paul saw ivor watching and a lios alfar who had to be ratenniel and matt was there with loren beside him kim was smiling at him and next to her was dave a crooked awkward grin on his face they were all here it seemed here on the edge of andarien for the beginning of the end all of them or not quite all one was missing one would always be missing diarmuid was bowing formally to the high king what kept you so long he said brightly aileron did not smile it took some doing to maneuver the chariots through the forest i see said diarmuid nodding gravely aileron his eyes unrevealing as ever looked his brother carefully up and down then said expressionlessly your boots seem seriously in need of repair it was kim who laughed letting all of them know that they could amid the release of tension diarmuid swore impressively his color suddenly high aileron finally smiled loren and matt have told us what you did on the island and at sea i have seen amairgens staff you will know without my telling you how brightly woven a journey that was you might tell me anyhow diarmuid murmured aileron ignored that there is a man among you i would greet he said they watched as lancelot stepped quietly forward limping very slightly dave martyniuk was remembering something a wolf hunt in leinanwood where the high king had slain the last seven wolves himself and arthur pendragon had said a strangeness in his voice only one man i ever saw could do what you just did now the one man was here and kneeling before aileron and the high king bade him rise and gently with care for the others wounds he clasped him about the shoulders as he had not clasped his brother who stood a little way behind a slight smile on his face holding the princess of cathal by the hand my lord high king said mabon of rhoden stepping forward from the ranks of the army the daylight wanes and it has been a long days riding to this place would you make camp here shall i give the orders to do so i would not advise it said ratenniel of daniloth quickly turning from conversation with brendel aileron was already shaking his head not here he said not with the shadowland so near if the army of the dark were to advance overnight we would have the worst possible ground for battle with the river behind us and no retreat beyond it into the mist no we will move on it will not be dark for a few hours yet mabon nodded agreement and withdrew to alert the captains of the army ivor paul noted already had the dalrei mounted up again waiting for the signal to ride diarmuid coughed loudly may i he said plaintively as his brother turned to him be so bold as to entreat the loan of horses for my company or did you want me to trundle along in your wake that aileron said laughing for the first time has more appeal than you know he turned to walk back to the army but over his shoulder as if offhandedly added we brought your own horse diar i thought you would find a way to get back in time they mounted up behind them as they left the river for andariens stony ground a boat was drifting gently down the current of the celyn within that craft leyse of the swan mark was listening to the music of her song even as she came out upon the waves to follow the setting sun across the wideness of the sea kim looked over at dave for encouragement she didnt really have a right to any support but the big man gave her an unexpectedly shrewd glance and when she began picking her way forward and to the left to where jennifer was riding he detached himself from ivors side and followed her there was something she had to tell jennifer and she wasnt happy about it at all especially not when she thought about the disastrous results of her sending darien to the anor two days ago still there was really no avoiding this and she wasnt about to try hi she said brightly to her closest friend are you still speaking to me jennifer smiled wearily and leaned across in her saddle to kiss kim on the cheek dont be silly she said its not that silly you were pretty angry jennifer lowered her gaze i know im sorry she paused i wish i could explain better why im doing what im doing you wanted him to be left alone it isnt that complicated jennifer looked up again we have to leave him alone she said quietly if id tried to bind him wed never have known what he really was he might have changed at any time wed never have been sure what he might do we arent very sure now kim said rather more sharply than shed intended i know that jennifer replied but at least hell do it freely whatever he does by his own choice i think thats the whole point kim i think it has to be would it have been so terrible kim asked not wisely but she couldnt hold the question back if you had just told him you loved him jennifer didnt flinch nor did she flare into anger again i did she said mildly a hint of surprise in her voice i did let him know surely you can see that i left him free to make his choice i trusted him fair enough said paul schafer they hadnt heard him ride up you were the only one of us who did he added everyone else has been busy trying to cajole him or make him into something including me i suppose when i took him to the godwood do you know jennifer asked paul suddenly why the weaver made the wild hunt do you know what owein means paul shook his head remind me to tell you if we ever have the time she said you too she added turning to kim i think it might help you understand kim was silent she really didnt know how to respond it was too hard this whole question of darien and since what shed done or refused to do last night by calor diman she no longer trusted her own instincts about anything besides this confrontation wasnt why shed come over she sighed you may hate me after all she said i interfered again im afraid jens green eyes were calm though she said i can guess you told aileron and the others about darien kim blinked she must have looked comical because dave grinned suddenly and jennifer leaned across again to pat her hand i thought you might have jen explained and i cant say you were wrong by now he has to know arthur told me that on the ship last night i would have talked to him myself if you hadnt it may affect his planning though i cant see how she paused and then in a different voice added dont you see the secret doesnt matter now kim none of them can stop him from whatever hes going to dolancelot freed him from daniloth yesterday morning hes a long way north of us now involuntarily kims gaze went out over the land that stretched in front of them she saw dave martyniuk do the same wild and empty in the lateafternoon light andarien rolled away all stony hills and barren hollows and she knew it was like this all the way to the ungarch river to the valgrind bridge across that river to starkadh on the other side as it happened they did not have nearly so far to go themselves they were very close to the front of the army only a few paces behind aileron and ratenniel ascending a wide lightly sloping ridge with yet another bleak depression beyond the reddened sun was well over to the west and a breeze had come up overture to twilight then they saw the frontriding auberei suddenly reappear on the crest of the ridge the high king reached the summit he reined in his own black charger and froze utterly still they topped the rise themselves the four of them riding together for the first and only time and looked down onto a vast stony plain and saw the army of the dark the plain was huge easily the largest expanse of level ground theyd yet reached in andarien and paul knew this was no accident of chance he also guessed as he tried to control his accelerating heartbeat that this would be the broadest such expanse in all the land between here and the ice it had to be with subtleties of contour and land formation stripped away less of ailerons training in war little of his lifes studies could be drawn into play the ridge upon which they now were looking down the gentle slope was the only distinguishing feature in all the level land to east or west this would be a battle of force on force with nowhere to hide or seek advantage where sheer numbers would tell the tale between them and whatever lands lay beyond was an army so huge it numbed the mind it could scarcely be registered that was another reason why this plain had been chosen nowhere else could such obliterating numbers have been assembled to move freely without hindering each other paul looked up and saw hundreds of swans all black circling ominously in the sky over rakoths army well done teyrnon the high king said calmly paul realized with a shock that aileron as always seemed to have been prepared even for this the mage had been using his powers to sense forward aileron had guessed the army was here it was why hed been so adamant about not camping overnight against the mist of the shadowland even as he looked down heartsick upon what lay waiting for them paul felt a quick pride in the young war king who was leading them completely unruffled aileron took the measure of the army he would have to somehow try to defeat without turning around his eyes ceaselessly scanning the plain below he began to issue a string of quiet instructions they will not attack tonight he said confidently they will not want to come at us up this ridge and at night theyll lose the advantage of the swans eyes we will have battle with the sunrise my friends i wish we had some way of fighting them for control of the air but it cant be helped teyrnon youll have to be my eyes for as long as you and barak can do so we can do so for as long as you need us to the last mage in brennin replied paul noticed that kim had gone pale at ailerons last words he tried to catch her eye but she avoided his glance he didnt have time to find out why the lios can help with that ratenniel murmured there was music in his voice still but there was nothing delicate about it anymore nothing soothing i can post the most longsighted among us up on this ridge to overlook the battle good said aileron crisply do that place them tonight to keep watch they will stay there tomorrow as well ivor assign pairs of auberei to stay with each of the posted lios to carry their messages back and forth i will said ivor simply and my archers know what to do if the swans come too low i know they do said aileron grimly for tonight all of you bid your men divide into three watches and keep their weapons to hand when they rest as for the morning wait said diarmuid from beside paul look we seem to have a guest his tone was as effortlessly light as it always was he was right paul saw the red light of the sunset picked out a single huge whiteclad figure that had detached itself from the heaving mass of the army on the plain riding one of the monstrous sixlegged slaug it picked its way over the stony ground to a position carefully out of bowshot from those watching on the ridge an unnatural stillness descended paul was acutely aware of the breeze the angle of the sun the clouds scudding overhead he reached a little desperately for the place within himself that would mark the presence of mórnir it was there but faint and hopelessly far he shook his head uathach dave martyniuk said suddenly it was a snarl who is he aileron asked very calm he led them in the battle by the adein ivor replied his voice thick with loathing he is an urgach but much more than that rakoth has done something to him aileron nodded but said nothing more instead it was uathach who spoke hear me he cried his voice a viscous howl so loud it seemed to bruise the air i bid you welcome high king of brennin to andarien my friends behind me are hungry tonight and i have promised them warrior meat tomorrow and more delicate fare after that in daniloth he laughed huge and fell on the plain the red sun tinting the mocking white of his robe aileron made no reply nor did anyone else on the ridge in grim repressive silence stony as the land over which they rode they looked down upon the leader of rakoths army the slaug moved restlessly sideways uathach reined it viciously then he laughed a second time and something in the sound chilled paul uathach said i have promised the svart alfar meat for tomorrow and offered them sport tonight tell me warriors of brennin of daniloth of the dalrei treacherous dwarves tell me if there is one among you who will come down alone to me now or will you all hide as the frail lios do in their shadows i offer challenge in the presence of these armies is there one who will accept or are you all craven before my sword there was a stir along the ridge paul saw dave jaw clamped tight turn quickly to look at the avens son levon his hand trembling had half drawn his sword no said ivor dan banor and not only to his son i have seen this one in battle we cannot fight him and we cannot afford to lose any man here before anyone else could speak uathachs coarse laughter spilled forth again a slimy flood of sound he had heard he said i thought as much then let me say one thing more to all the brave ones on that hill i have a message from my lord the voice changed it became colder less rough more frightening a year ago and a little more rakoth took pleasure in a woman of your company he would do so again she offered rare willing sport black avaia is with me now to bear her back to starkadh at his bidding is there one among you who will contest against my blade rakoths claim to her naked flesh a sickness rose within paul of revulsion and of premonition my lord high king said arthur pendragon as uathachs laughter and the howls of the svart alfar behind him rose and fell would you tell me the name of this place paul saw aileron turn to the warrior but it was loren silvercloak who answered a knowing sorrow in his voice this plain was green and fertile a thousand years ago he said and in those days it was called camlann i thought it might be arthur replied very quietly without speaking again he began checking the fit of his sword belt and the tilt of the king spear in his saddle rest paul turned to jenniferto guinevere what he saw in her face then as she looked at the warriors quiet preparations went straight to his heart my lord arthur said aileron i must ask you to defer to me the leader of their army should fight the leader of our own this is my battle and i lay claim to it arthur didnt even look up from his preparations not so he said and you know it is not you are needed on the morrow more than any other man here i told you all a long time ago on the eve of the voyage to cader sedat that i am never allowed to see the end of things when i am summoned and the name loren spoke has made things clear there has been a camlann waiting for me in every world this is what i was brought here for high king beside him cavall made a sound more whimper than growl the red sun was low casting a strange light upon all their faces below them the laughter had ended arthur no said kimberly with passion you are here for more than this you must not go down there we need all of you too much cant you see what he is none of you can fight him jennifer tell them it is foolishness you must tell them but jennifer looking at the warrior said nothing at all arthur had finished his preparations he looked up then straight at kimberly who had summoned him who had brought him to this place by the binding of his name and to her he made reply in words paul knew he would never forget how can we not fight him seer how can we claim to carry our swords in the name of light if we are cowards when we stand before the dark this challenge goes further back than any of us further back even than i what are we if we deny the dance aileron was nodding slowly and levon and ratenniels eyes were bright with his agreement within his own heart paul felt some deep eonsold force behind the warriors words and as he accepted them grieving he felt another thing the pulsebeat of the god it was true it was a dance that was not to be denied and it seemed that it was arthurs after all no said guinevere every eye went to her in the windswept silence of that desolate place her beauty seemed to burn like some evening star brought among men almost too fierce to look upon motionless astride her horse her hands twisted in its mane she said arthur i will not lose you again like this i could not bear it single combat is not why you were summoned my love it cannot be why camlann or no this must not be your battle his face under the greying hair had gone still he said we are caught in a woven doom of no escape you know i must go down to him there were tears welling in her eyes she did not speak but slowly she shook her head back and forth in denial whose place is it then if not mine he asked scarcely more than a whisper she lowered her head her hands moved in a little helpless trapped gesture of despair and then without looking up she said with sudden terrible formality in this place and before these many people my name has been besmirched i have need of one who will take this challenge upon himself and unmake it with his sword and now she lifted her head and now she turned to the one who had been sitting quietly upon his horse not speaking not moving waiting patiently for what he seemed to have known was coming and guinevere said wilt thou who hast been my champion so many times before be so yet again wilt thou take this challenge in my name my lord lancelot lady i will he said you cant paul exclaimed his voice crashing into the stillness unable to stop himself jennifer hes wounded look at his palmhe cant even hold a sword beside him someone made a curious breathless sound the three figures in the center of the circle ignored him completely it was as if he hadnt even spoken there was another silence laden with unsaid things with so many layers of time a stir of wind blew jennifers hair back from her face arthur said my lady i have known too many things for too long to ever deny lancelots claim to be your champion or that healthy he is far more worthy than i to face this foe even so i will not allow it now not this time my love you have asked him sorely wounded to take this upon himself not for your sake or his but for mine you have not asked him in love guineveres head snapped back her green eyes went wide and then they blazed with a naked dazzling anger she shook her head so fiercely that the tears flew off her face and in the voice of a queen a voice that froze and bound them into the power of the grief it carried she cried aloud have i not my lord and shall you tell me so would you tear open my flesh that all men here might probe into my heart as maugrim did arthur flinched as if stunned by a blow but she was not done with icy relentless fury she said what man even you my lord dares in my presence to say whether i have spoken in love or no guinevere lancelot began but quailed in his turn as her burning glance swung to him not a word she snapped not from you or anyone else arthur had slipped down from his horse he knelt before her pain raw as a wound in his face he opened his mouth to speak and in that moment precisely then paul became aware of an absence and he remembered the slight breathless sound at his elbow a moment before a sound hed ignored but there was no one beside him anymore he turned his heart lurching and looked north along the downwardsloping path to where uathach waited on the stony plain he saw and then he heard they all heard as a ringing cry rose up echoing in the twilight air between the armies of light and dark for the black boar he heard they all heard for the honor of the black boar and thus did diarmuid dan ailell take uathachs challenge upon himself riding forth alone on the horse his brother had brought for him his sword uplifted high his fair hair lit by the sunset as he raced toward the dance his bright soul would not deny he was a master dave knew having fought beside diarmuid at the winter skirmish by the latham and then at the wolf hunt in leinanwood he had reason to know what ailerons brother could do and daves hearthalfway to his own battle furyleaped to see diarmuids first swiftly angled engagement of the urgach and then an instant later battle frenzy gave way to chilled grief because he remembered uathach too from the bloody banks of the adein in the first battle of kevins spring and in his mind replayed more vividly than such a memory should ever have been he saw maugrims whiteclad urgach swing his colossal sword in one scything blow from the slaugs saddle that had cleaved through barth and navon both the babies in the wood he remembered uathach and now he saw him again and the memory however grim was less than the reality far less by the light of the setting sun in that wasteland between armies diarmuid and his quick clever horse met with a thunder of hooves and a grinding shock of blades a foe that was too much more than mortal for a mortal man to face the urgach was too large too uncannily swift despite his massive bulk and he was shrewder than any such creature could ever have been had it not been altered in some way within the confines of starkadh beyond all this the slaug was a deadly terror in and of itself constantly ripping with its curved horn seeking the flesh of diarmuids horse running on four legs and lashing out with the other two it was too dangerous for diarmuid to do much more than evade for fear that his own mount would be gorged or trampled leaving him helpless on the barren ground and because he couldnt work in close his slim blade could scarcely reach uathachthough diarmuid was a perilously easy target for the urgachs huge black sword beside dave levon dan ivors face was white with affliction as he watched the drama below dave knew how desperately levon had wanted the death of this creature and how adamant torewho feared nothing else that dave knewhad been in binding levon by oath not to fight uathach alone not to do what diarmuid was doing now and doing despite the horror of what he faced with a seemingly effortless grace that somehow had woven within its movements the unpredictable scintillant wit of the man so sudden were his stops and starts his reversals of directionthe horse seeming an extension of his mindthat twice within moments of each other he managed to veer around the slaugs horn to launch brilliant slashing blows at uathach who parried with a brutal indifference that almost broke the heart to see and each time his pounding counterstroke sent diarmuid reeling in the saddle with the jarring impact of parrying it dave knew about that he remembered his own first urgach battle in the dark of faelinn grove he had barely been able to lift his arm for two days after blocking one of those blows and the beast hed faced had been to uathach as sleep was to death but diarmuid was still in saddle still probing for an opening with his sword wheeling his gallant mountso small beside the slaugin arcs and halfcircles random and disorienting calculated to the hairsbreadth edge of sword or destroying horn seeking an angle a way in a gap to penetrate in the name of light gods he can ride levon whispered and dave knew that there were no words of higher more holy praise that a dalrei could ever speak and it was true it was dazzlingly true they were watching an exercise in glory as the sun sank into the west then suddenly it became even more than thatfor again diarmuid scythed in on uathachs right side and again he stabbed upward for the heart of the beast once more the urgach blocked the reaching thrust and once more exactly as before his counterstroke descended like an iron tree falling diarmuid absorbed it on his blade he rocked in the saddle but this time letting the momentum work for him he reared his horse upward and to the right and sent his shining sword slashing downward to sever the slaugs nearest leg dave began a startled wordless cry of joy and then savagely bit it back uathachs mocking laughter seemed to fill the world and behind him the army of the dark let loose a raucous deafening roar of predatory anticipation too great a price dave thought hurting for the man below for though the slaug had lost a leg and so was much less of a danger than before diarmuids left shoulder had been torn through by a ripping thrust of the animals horn in the waning light they could see his blood flowering darkly from a deep raking wound it was too much dave thought truly too inhuman a foe for a man to face tore had been right dave turned his head away from the terrible ritual being acted out before them and as he did he saw paul schafer farther along the ridge looking back at him paul registered daves glance and the pain in the big mans expression but his own mind was a long way off along the twisting paths of memory a memory of diarmuid on the first night theyd arrived a peach hed said of jennifer as he bent to kiss her hand and then said it and did it again a few moments later swinging lazily through a high window to confound gorlaes sardonically another image another extravagant phraseive plucked the fairest rose in shalhassans gardenas he rejoined kevin and paul and the men of south keep from within scented larai rigal extravagance always the flamboyant gesture masking so many deeper truths but the truths were there to be seen if one only knew where to look hadnt he shielded sharra afterward the day shed tried to kill him in paras derval and then on the eve of the voyage to cader sedat he had asked her to be his wife using tegid as his intercedent always the gesture the deflecting glitter of style hiding what he was at root behind the last locked doorway of his soul paul remembered hurting on that windy rise of land unwilling to look down again how diarmuid had relinquished his claim to the throne how in the moment when fate seemed to have come full circle when jaelle had been about to speak for the goddess and proclaim a high king in danas name diarmuid had made the decision himself flippantly speaking the words he knew to be right though aileron had sworn he was prepared to kill him just moments before there was a grinding of metal on metal paul turned back diarmuid had somehowthe gods only knew what it must be costing himmanaged to circle in again close to the monstrous urgach and again hed attacked carrying the battle to his foe to be beaten back one more with a bonejarring force that paul could feel even up here he watched it seemed necessary to watch to bear witness and remember and one more set of memories came to him then as diarmuids brave horse pirouetted yet again just out of reach of slaug horn and urgach sword images from cader sedat that place of death at sea an island in all worlds and none where the soul lay open without hiding place where diars face as he looked upon metran had shown the full unshielded passion of his hatred of the dark where he had stood in the chamber of the dead beneath the sea and whereyes there was a truth in this a kernel a cluehe had said to the warrior as arthur prepared to summon lancelot and so bring the old threesided tragedy into the world again you do not have to do this it is neither written nor compelled and paul glimpsed then with a shiver of primal recognition the thread that led from that moment to this because it was for arthur and lancelot and for guinevere that diarmuid in all the wild anarchy of his nature had claimed this dance as his own it was against the weaving of their long doom that he had defiantly rebelled and had channeled that rebellion into an act of his own against the dark taking uathach unto himself that arthur and lancelot both might go forward past this day the sun was almost gone only the last long rays slanted low and red across andarien in the twilight the battle seemed to have moved farther away into a realm of shadows like the past it was very quiet even the loosely spilling triumphant cries of the svart alfar had ended there were flecks of blood staining uathachs snowy robe paul couldnt tell if they were diarmuids or the urgachs own it didnt seem to matter much diars horse fiercely gallant but hopelessly overmatched was visibly tiring even as they watched diarmuid backed it off a few paces to try to buy it a moments rest but this was not to be allowed not in this battle with this foe uathach not laughing now grim death in his black sword came on and diarmuid was forced to cruelly spur his mount to motion again amid the silence along the ridge a single voice spoke there is one chance only left for him said lancelot du lac only one man understood and made reply if you call it a chance aileron said in a tone not one of them had ever heard him use before to the west out beyond linden bay the sun went down paul turned instinctively and saw its last dying light touch the face of the princess of cathal he saw that kim and jaelle had moved to either side of her after a moment he turned back to the figures on the plain in time to see it end it was on the whole just a little bit ridiculous this ugly hairy monster oversized even for an urgach was as quick as he was himself and it was swinging a sword that diarmuid doubted he could even have lifted let along swung in those pounding ceaseless blows it was cunning too unnaturally viciously intelligent by lisens river blood urgach were supposed to be stupid where the prince thought absorbing another blow like an avalanche on his sword where was the sense of proportion in this thing he felt like asking the question aloud but survival had become a matter of meticulous concentration these last few moments and he had not breath to spare for even halfway witty remarks a shame he wondered hilariously what uathach would say to a suggestion that this matter be settled with the gambling dice diarmuid just happened to have in his gods even with a leg gone the slaug twice the size of his own tiring horse was death itself with a movement of his sword as desperately swift as any hed ever made diarmuid managed to block a thrust of the animals ripping horn that would have disemboweled his own mount unfortunately that meant he resurfaced in the saddle having passed clean under his horse on one side and up again on the other with uathachs annihilating slash a whistling sound in the darkening air where his own head had been an instant before he wondered if ivor of the dalrei remembered teaching him how to do that so many years ago when diarmuid was a boy summering with his brother on the plain so many years but for some reason it felt like yesterday just now funny how almost everything felt like yesterday the sweep of uathachs last stroke had swung the urgach grunting sideways in his saddle and carried the slaug a few paces away with the shift of weight fresh diarmuid might have tried to use that to renew some kind of attack but his horse was sucking air with desperate heaving motions of its lathered flanks and his own left arm was gradually growing cold a weakness spreading from the deep tear of the wound reaching across his chest he used the brief respite the only way he could to buy time for the horse a handful of seconds no more than that and it wasnt enough he thought of his mother then and of the day his father had died so much seemed to have happened yesterday he thought of aileron and of all the things left unsaid in all the yesterdays and then as uathach turned the slaug again diarmuid dan ailell whispered to his horse one last time and felt it steady bravely to the murmur of his voice within himself he let a calm take shape and from within that calm he summoned up sharras face through whose dark eyesdoorways to a falcons soullove had entered into him so unexpectedly and had stayed to carry him to this moment her image in his mind and the certain sustaining knowledge of her love to carry him forward across the darkened ground of that plain in andarien toward the last thing he could do straight at the slaug he rode his horse gallantly reaching for a last flourish of speed and at the final second he veered it sharply left and launched the sternest blow he could at uathachs side it was blocked he knew it would be they all had been and now there came the huge descending counterstroke of the urgachs sword the one like all the others that would drive him shuddering back when he parried it that would numb his arm bringing the inevitable end that much nearer he didnt parry it he wheeled his horse hard to gain just a little space so uathachs blade would not sever his body entirely and he took that terrible blow on his left side just under the heart knowing it was the end and then as white pain exploded within him in the darkness towering indescribable as his lifes blood fountained to fall among the stones diarmuid dan ailell with the last strength of his soul almost the very last of his selfcontrol with sharras face before him not uathachs did the final deed of his days he rose up above his agony and with his left hand he clutched the hairy arm that held that black sword and with his right pulling himself forward as toward a longsought dream of overwhelming light he thrust his own bright blade into the urgachs face and out the back of its head and he killed it in andarien just after the sun had set sharra watched as though from very far away at the descent of dark through a blurring mist of tears she saw him take his wound saw him kill uathach saw the beautiful rearing horse gored hideously from below by the ripping horn of the slaug the urgach fell she could hear screams of terror from the svart alfar the scream of the dying horse saw diar fall free as the horse rolled on the ground and thrashed in its death agony saw the enraged bloodmaddened slaug turn to rip the fallen man to shreds of flesh saw a spear its head gleaming bluewhite flash through the dark and plunge into the throat of the slaug killing it instantly saw nothing after that but the man lying on the ground come child said arthur pendragon who had thrown the king spear in a cast almost beyond belief in this light and from so far he laid a gentle hand upon her arm let me lead you down to him she let him lead her down through the rainfall of her tears she was aware distantly of utter confusion among the ranks of the dark terror at the loss of their leader she was conscious of people on horseback beside her but not of who they were save for arthur who was holding her arm she went down the slope and rode across the dark stony ground and came to where he lay there were torches somehow all around them she drew a choking desperate breath and wiped away her tears with the loose sleeve of the robe she wore then she dismounted and walked over his head was cradled in the lap of coll of taerlindel blood pouring and pouring from the wound uathachs sword had made soaking into the barren soil he was not yet dead he breathed with quick shallow motions of his chest but every breath sent forth another torrent of his blood his eyes were closed there were other people there but it seemed to her that she and he were all alone in a wide night world without stars she knelt on the ground beside him and something the intuitive awareness of her presence caused him to open his eyes by torchlight she met his blue gaze for the last time with her own he tried to smile to speak but at the last there was too much pain she saw he would not even be allowed this much and so she lowered her mouth to his and kissed him and said good night my love i will not say goodbye wait for me by the weavers side if the gods love us she tried to go on tried very hard but the tears were blinding her and stopping her throat his face was bloodless bone white in the light of the torches his eyes had closed again she could feel his blood pouring from the wound saturating the ground where she knelt she knew he was leaving her no power of magic no voice of a god could bring him back from where this silent terrible pain was taking him it was too deep it was final then he opened his eyes with a very great effort for the last time and she realized that words didnt matter that she knew everything he would ever want to say she read the message in his eyes and knew what he was asking her it was as if here at the very last they had moved beyond all need for anything but looking she lifted her head and saw aileron kneeling at diarmuids other side his face laid open as if by a lash distorted with grief she understood something then and could even find a place within herself to pity him she swallowed and fought past the thickness in her throat to find words again diarmuids words for he could not speak and so she would have to be his voice for this last time she whispered he wants you to set him free to send him home that it will not have been done by the urgachs sword oh diar no aileron said but diarmuid turned his head slowly fighting the pain of movement his breathing so shallow it was hardly there and he looked at his older brother and he nodded once aileron was still for a very long time as the two sons of ailell looked at each other by the flickering torchlight then the high king stretched forth a hand and laid it gently against his brothers cheek he held it there a moment and then he looked at sharra with a last question asking dispensation with his own dark eyes and sharra reached for all the courage that she had and granted it to him saying for herself and for diar let it be done with love then aileron dan ailell the high king drew forth his dagger from a sheath that hung down at his side and he laid its point over his brothers heart and diarmuid moved one hand and found sharras and aileron waited as he brought it to his lips one last time he was holding it there and holding her eyes with his own when his brothers knife agent of love set him free from his iron pain and he died aileron withdrew his blade and set it down then he buried his face in his hands sharra could hardly see she was so blinded by her tears it seemed to be raining everywhere in that clear cool starry evening over andarien come my dear said jaelle the high priestess helping her rise she was weeping the seer came up on the other side and sharra went where they took her diarmuid dan ailell was borne back in his brothers arms from the place where he died for the high king would suffer no man else to do so across the stony plain aileron carried him with torches burning on either side and all around up the long slope he went the body cradled against his chest and men turned away their heads so as not to have to look upon the face of the living brother as he bore away the dead they made a pyre that night in andarien they washed diarmuids body and clothed it in white and gold hiding his terrible wounds and they combed his golden hair then the high king took him up again for the last time and bore him to where they had gathered the wood of the pyre and he laid his brother down upon it and kissed him upon the lips and withdrew then teyrnon the last mage of brennin stepped forward with barak his source and with loren silvercloak and matt sören and all of them were weeping in the darkness there but teyrnon thrust forth his hand and spoke a word of power and a single shaft of light flew forward from his fingers blazing white and gold like the robes of the dead prince and the pyre roared suddenly to flame consuming the body laid upon it so passed diarmuid dan ailell so did his untamed brightness come in the end to flame and then ash and at the very last in the clear voices of the lios alfar into song under the stars chapter a long way north of that burning darien stood in the shadows below the valgrind bridge it was very cold here at the edge of the ice with the sun gone and no other living thing to be seen or heard he looked across the dark waters of the river spanned by that bridge and on the other side he saw the massive ziggurat of starkadh rising with chill green lights shining wanly amid the blackness of his fathers mighty home he was utterly alone there were no guards posted anywhere what need had rakoth maugrim for guards who would ever venture to this unholy place an army perhaps but they would be visible far off amid the treeless waste only an army might come but darien had seen as he walked here countless numbers of svart alfar and the huge urgach moving south there were so many they seemed to shrink the vastness of the barren lands he didnt think any army would be coming not past those hordes hed seen issuing forth he had been forced to hide several times seeking shelter in the shadows of rocks swinging gradually westward as he went so the legions of the dark would pass east of him he was not seen no one was looking for him not for a solitary child stumbling north through a morning and an afternoon and then a cold evening and a colder night with pale rangat towering in the east and black starkadh growing more oppressively dominant with every step he took he had come at last to the bridge and crouched down under it looking across the ungarch at where he was to go not tonight he decided shivering his arms wrapped tightly about himself better the chill of another night outside than trying to pass into that place in the dark he looked at the dagger he carried and drew it from his sheath the sound like a harpstring reverberated thinly in the cold night air there was a vein of blue in the sheath and a brighter one along the shaft of the blade they gleamed a little under the frosty stars he remembered what the little one flidais had said to him he rehearsed the words in his mind as he sheathed lokdal again their magic was part of the gift he was bringing he would have to have them right the metal of the bridge was cold when he leaned back beneath it and so was the stony ground everything was cold this far north he rubbed his hands on the sweater he wore it wasnt even his sweater his mother had made it for finnwho was gone and not really his mother either vae had made it his mother was tall and very beautiful and she had sent him away and then had sent the man lancelot to battle the demon in the wood for dariens sake he didnt understand he wanted to but there was no one to help him and he was cold and tired and far away he had just closed his eyes there at the edge of the darkly flowing river half under the iron bridge when he heard a tremendous reverberating sound as some mighty door clanged open far above he scrambled to his feet and peered out from under the bridge as he did he was hit by a titanic buffet of wind that knocked him sprawling almost into the river he rolled quickly over his eyes straining up against the force of the sudden gale and far overhead he saw a huge featureless shadow sweeping swiftly away to the south blotting out the stars where it passed then he heard the sound of his fathers laughter anger for dave martyniuk had always been a hot exploding thing within himself it was his fathers rage unsubtle enormous a lava flow in the mind and heart even here in fionavar in the battles hed fought what had come upon him each time had been of the same order a fiery obliterating hatred that consumed all else within it this morning he was not like that this morning he was ice the coldness of his fury as the sun rose and they readied themselves for war was something alien to him it was even a little frightening he was calmer more clearheaded than he could ever remember being in all his life and yet filled with a more dangerous more utterly implacable anger than he had ever known overhead the black swans were circling crying raucously in the early morning light below the army of the dark was gathered so vast it seemed to blot out the whole of the plain and at their headdave could see him nowwas a new leader galadan of course the wolflord not a blessing ivor had murmured before riding off to receive ailerons orders more dangerous than even uathach would have been more subtle in his malice it didnt matter dave thought sitting tall and stern in his saddle oblivious to the diffident glances he was drawing from all who passed near to him it didnt matter at all who led rakoths army who they sent against him wolves or svart alfar or urgach or mutant swans or anything else or however many let them come he would drive them back or leave them dead before him he was not fire the fire had been last night when diarmuid burned he was ice now absolutely in control of himself and ready for war he would do what had to be done whatever had to be done for diarmuid and for kevin lane for the babies hed guarded in the wood for sharras grief for guinevere and arthur and lancelot for ivor and levon and tore for the dimensions of sorrow within himself for all those who would die before this day was done for josef martyniuk there is something i would ask said matt sören though i will understand if you choose to deny me kim saw aileron turn to him there was winter in the high kings eyes he waited and did not speak matt said the dwarves have a price to pay and atonement to make insofar as we ever can will you give us leave to take the center today my lord that we may bear the main shock of whatever may befall there was a murmur from the captains gathered there the pale sun had just risen in the east beyond gwynir aileron was silent a moment longer then he said very clearly so it carried in every single record i have ever found of the bael rangatand i have read all such writings there are i thinkone common thread prevails even in the company of conary and colan of ratermaine and fierce angirad from what was not yet cathal of revor of the plain and those who rode with him even in such glittering company the records of those days all tell that no contingent of the army of light was so deadly as were seithr and the dwarves there is nothing you might think to ask of me that i could find it within me to deny matt but i intended to request this of you in any case let your people follow their king and take pride of place in our ranks let them draw honor from his own bright honor and courage from their past let it be so said ivor quietly where would you have the dalrei high king with the lios alfar as you were by the adein ratenniel can you and the aven hold our right flank between the two of you if we cannot said the lord of the lios alfar with a thread of laughter in his silvery voice then i know not who can we will ride with the riders he was mounted on one of the glorious raithen and so too behind him were brendel and galen and lydan leaders of their marks there was a fifth raithen riderless standing beside the others ratenniel gestured toward it he turned to arthur pendragon but he did not speak it was loren silvercloak no longer harnessing a mages powers but still bearing a mages knowledge who broke the waiting silence my lord arthur he said you have told us you never survive to see the last battle of your wars today it seems you shall although this place was once called camlann it carries that name no longer nor has it for a thousand years since laid waste by war shall we seek to find good in that evil hope in the cycle of years and arthur said against all that i have been forced through pain to know let us try he stepped down from his horse and took the king spear in his hand and he walked over to the last of the gold and silver raithen of daniloth when he mounted up the spear blazed for a moment with light come my lord aileron said and my lord lancelot if you will i bid you welcome into the numbers of brennin and cathal we will take the left side of this fight let us seek to meet the dalrei and the lios before the end of day having curved our ranks inward over the bodies of our foes arthur nodded and so too did lancelot they moved over to where mabon of rhoden was waiting with niavin duke of seresh and coll of taerlindel stonyfaced now leader of the men of south keep diarmuids men kim grieved for him but there would be griefs and to spare this day she knew and there might be final darkness for them all it seemed that they had said what had to be said but aileron surprised her again one thing more the high king said as his captains prepared to move off a thousand years ago there was another company in the army of light a people fell and wild and courageous out of measure a people destroyed now and lost to us save one kim saw him turn then and heard him say faebur of larak will you ride in the name of the people of the lion at the forefront of our host will you join with the dwarves today at the side of their king and will you take this horn i carry and sound the attack for us all faebur was pale but not with fear kim saw he moved his horse toward the black charger aileron rode and he took the horn in the name of the lion he said i will do so he rode forward and stopped at matts left hand on the other side of matt brock of banir tal was waiting kims mouth was dry with apprehension she looked up and saw the swans circling overhead unchallenged masters of the sky she knew without looking how utterly lifeless the baelrath was on her hand knew as a seer knew that it would never blaze for her again not after her refusal by calor diman she felt helpless and a little sick her place would be here on the ridge with loren and jaelle and a number of others from all parts of the army she still had her training and they would have to deal with the wounded very soon very soon indeed aileron and arthur galloped quickly off to the left and she saw ivor cantering to the right beside ratenniel and the lios alfar to join the dalrei waiting there even at a distance she could make out the figure of dave martyniuk taller by far than anyone around him she saw him unsling an axe from where it hung by his saddle loren came to stand beside her she slipped her hand into his together they watched matt sören stride to the front of the host of the dwarves who had never fought on horseback and would not do so today faebur was with him the young eridun had dismounted to leave his own horse on die high ground the sun was higher now from where kim stood she could see the seething army of the dark carpeting the whole of the plain below to the left aileron raised his sword and on the other side the aven did the same and ratenniel she saw matt turn to faebur and speak to him then she heard the ringing note of the horn that faebur sounded and there was war cechtar was the first man dave saw die the big dalrei thundered screaming at the top of his voice toward the nearest of the urgach as the armies met with a crash that shook the earth cechtars momentum and his whistling sword blow knocked the urgach sprawling sideways in his saddle but before the dalrei could follow up his mount was viciously speared by the horn of the slaug the urgach rode and as the grey horse stumbled dying cechtars side was exposed and a svart alfar leaped up a long thin knife in its hand and plunged it into his heart dave didnt even have time to cry out or grieve or even think about it there was death all around him bloody and blurred there were svart alfar shrieking amid the screams of dying men a svart leaped for his horse dave dragged a foot free of his stirrups kicked at it viciously and felt the ugly creatures skull crack under the impact fighting for room to swing his axe he urged his horse forward he went for the nearest urgach then and every time thereafter with a hatred and a bitterness cold though icily calculating cold that drove him on and on the head of his axe soon red and wet with blood as it rose and fell and rose and fell again he had no idea what was happening even twenty feet away the lios alfar were somewhere to the right he knew that levon was beside him always through everything that happened and tore and sorcha were on his other side he saw ivors stocky figure just ahead and in all that he did he fought to stay within reach of the aven again as in the fight by the banks of the adein he completely lost track of time his was a narrowed maelstrom of a world a universe of sweat and shattered bone of lathered horses and slaug horns and ground slippery with blood and with the trampled flesh of the dying and the dead he fought with a silent savagery amid the screams of battle and where his axe fell where the hooves of his horse lashed out they killed time warped and twisted spun away from him he thrust the axe forward like a sword smashing in the hairy face of the urgach in front of him almost in the same motion he drove the axehead down to bite through the flesh of the slaug it rode he rode on beside him levons blade was a whirling thing of ceaseless glinting motion a counterpoint of lethal grace to daves own driven strength time was gone from him and the morning he knew that they had been advancing for a time and then later now with the sun somehow high in the sky that they were no longer pressing forward only holding their ground desperately they strained to leave each other enough room to fight yet not so much space that the quick svart alfar might slip between to kill from below and gradually dave began to acknowledge however hard he tried to block the thought something that a part of him had known the evening before when first theyd topped the ridge and looked down it was the numbers the sheer brutal weight that would beat them it isnt even worth thinking about he told himself hammering the axe right through the blocking sword of an urgach on his right watching tores sword slash into the creatures brain at the same moment he and the dark dalreihis brotherlooked at each other for one grim instant there was time for no more than that time and strength had rapidly become the most precious things in all the worlds and were becoming more rare with each passing moment the white sun swung up the sky and paused overhead balanced for an instant as were all the worlds that day and then began sliding down through a bloody afternoon daves horse trampled a svart alfar even as his axe severed the raking horn of a dark green slaug he felt a pain in his thigh ignored it killed with a mighty blow of his fist the daggerwielding svart that had slashed him he heard levon grunt with exertion and he wheeled just in time to crash his mount into the side of the slaug menacing the avens son levon dispatched the unbalanced urgach with a sweep of his blade there were two more behind it and half a dozen of the svart alfar dave didnt even have room to stay with levon in front of him three more of the slaug pressed forward over the body of the one whose horn hed smashed dave fell back a couple of paces sick at heart beside him levon was doing the same then disbelieving dave heard the ceaseless shrieking of the svart alfar rise to a higher pitch the largest of the urgach advancing on him roared a sudden desperate command and a moment later dave saw a space suddenly materialize on his left beyond levon as the enemy fell back and then even as it appeared the space was filled by matt sören king of the dwarves fighting in grim ferocious silence his clothing shredded saturated with blood as he waded forward over the bodies of the dead to lead the dwarves into the gap well met king of dwarves ivors voice rose high over the tumult of battle with a glad cry dave thrust forward levon just ahead of him and they merged with matts forces and began to advance again ratenniel dazzlingly swift on the raithen was suddenly beside them as well how are they doing on the left he sang out aileron sent us this way he says they will hold matt shouted back i dont know for how long though galadans wolves are on that side we have to break through together and then circle back west come on then levon screamed moving past them all leading them northward as if he would storm the towers of starkadh itself ivor was right beside his son dave kicked his own mount ahead hastening to follow he had to stay close to guard them if he could to share in whatever happened to them he felt a wind suddenly saw a vast onrushing shadow sweeping across andarien dear gods sorcha cried by daves right hand there came a tremendous roaring sound dave looked up at dawn leila woke she felt feverish and afraid after a terrible restless night when shiel came to get her she told the other priestess to lead the morning chants in her stead shiel took one look at leila and went away without a word pacing the narrow confines of her room leila struggled to hold the images that were flashing into her mind they were too quick though too violently chaotic she didnt know where they were coming from how she was receiving them she didnt know she didnt want them her hands were damp and she felt perspiration on her face though the underground rooms were as cool as they always were the chanting ended under the dome in the sudden silence she became conscious of her own footsteps the rapid beating of her heart the pulsing in her mindall seemed louder more insistent she was afraid now more so than she had ever been there was a tapping at her door yes she snapped she hadnt meant to say it that way timorously shiel opened the door and peeped in she did not enter the room her eyes grew wide at the sight of leilas face what is it leila said fighting to control her voice there are men here priestess waiting by the entranceway will you see them it was a thing to do an action to take she brushed past shiel walking swiftly down the curving corridors toward the entrance to the temple there were three priestesses and a dunrobed acolyte waiting there the doors were open but the men waited patiently outside she came to the threshold and saw who was there she knew all three of them gorlaes the chancellor shalhassan of cathal and the fat man tegid who had been so much in attendance while sharra of cathal had been here what do you want she said again her voice was harsher than she meant it to be she was having a hard time controlling it it seemed to be a bright day outside the sun hurt her eyes child said gorlaes not hiding his surprise are you the one who is acting as high priestess i am she answered shortly and waited shalhassans expression was different more quietly appraising he said i have been told about you you are leila dal karsh she nodded shifted a little sideways to be in the shade shalhassan said priestess we have come because we are afraid we know nothing can discover nothing i thought it was possible that the priestesses might somehow have tidings of what is happening she closed her eyes somewhere at some level in the normal weaving of these things this should be taken as a triumphthe leaders of brennin and cathal coming to the sanctuary thus humbly she was aware of this but couldnt summon up the appropriate response it seemed lifetimes removed from the brittle fevers of this day she opened her eyes again and said i too am afraid i know very little only that something is happening this morning and there is blood i think they are fighting the big man tegid made a rumbling sound deep in his chest she saw anguish and doubt in his face for an instant longer she hesitated then drawing a deep breath she said if you like if you offer blood you may enter within i will share whatever i come to know all three of them bowed to her we will be grateful shalhassan murmured and she could hear that he meant it shiel she said snapping again unable not to use the knife and the bowl then bring them to the dome i will shiel said with a hardiness rare for her leila didnt wait another inner vision sliced into her mind like a blade and was gone she strode from the doorway stumbled almost fell she saw the frightened eyes of the acolyte as the young one backed away from her young a part of her mind registered the girl was older than she was leila went on toward the dome her face was bloodless now she could feel it and could feel a dark cold fear rising within her higher and higher all the time it seemed to her that all around her as she went the sanctuary walls were streaming with blood paul tried he wasnt a swordsman nor did he have daves tremendous size or strength but he had his own anger and courage to spare sourced in a driven nature infinitely demanding of himself he had grace and very fast reflexes but swordsmanship at this level was not a thing one mastered overnight not matched against urgach and galadans wolves through the whole of the morning though he stayed in the heart of the battle on the western flank fighting with a passionate coursing renunciation ahead of him he saw lancelot and aileron dismount side by side the better to wade swords blurred with intricate flashing speed among the giant wolves he knew that he was seeing something never to be forgotten excellence on a scale almost unimaginable lancelot was fighting with a glove on his burned hand that the hilt of his sword might not dig into the wound the glove had been white when the morning began but already the palm of it was soaked through with blood on either side of paul carde and erron were fighting savagely slashing through the svart alfar battling the wolves holding back as best they could the terrible mounted urgach and paul was painfully aware doing their best to guard him all the time even as they fought for their own lives he did the best he could bending on either side of his horses neck to thrust and cut with the sword he carried seeing a svart fall under one blow a wolf draw back snarling from another but even as that happened erron had been forced to whirl with his lithe speed to skewer another svart that had been leaping for pauls exposed side no time for gratitude to be expressed no time for any words at all and only chance scattered seconds amid chaos in which to reach within himself and vainly seek some clue some pulsebeat from the god that might show him how to be more than a liability here more than a source of danger to the friends guarding his life gods carde gasped in one brief respite some time later why are the wolves so much worse than they were in leinanwood paul knew the answer to that he could see the answer ahead of them and to the right lethally fluid in all his movements a palpable aura of menace hovering about him was galadan he was battling in his animal shape providing the guiding spirit malevolent and subtle for the onslaught of his wolves for the whole of maugrims army galadan whom paul had so arrogantly claimed for his own it seemed a mockery here an act of fatuous hubris on the part of someone who couldnt even defend himself from the svart alfar in that moment as he looked across the surging crush of the battle a space opened up in front of galadan and then with a hurtful twist of his heart paul saw grey cavall move to confront for a second time the wolf with the splash of silver between its eyes memory slashed through paul like a different kind of wound a memory of the battle in the godwood that had served to foretell the war they were fighting now he saw the scarred grey dog and the proud lord of the andain face each other for the second time both were still for a frozen moment coiling themselves in readiness but there was to be no reprise of that primal clash in the glade of the summer tree a phalanx of mounted urgach thundered into the space between wolf and dog to be met with a ringing crash of blades by coll of taerlindel and redheaded averren at the head of a score of the men of south keep diarmuids band fighting with a bleak savagery that day each of them driving back hearts grief with the fury of war glad of the chance to kill on either side of paul carde and erron held their ground covering his body as well as their own the sight of the princes men struggling with the urgach just ahead decided him go join the others he shouted to the two of them im no help here im going back up on the ridgei can do more there there was an instant to exchange a glance with each of them an instant to know it might be the last he touched cardes shoulder briefly felt errons hand grip his arm then he wheeled his horse sharply and cut away racing back to the high ground bitterly cursing his uselessness to his left as he rode he saw another pair of figures break free of the press galloping back toward the ridge as well angling his mount over he intercepted teyrnon and barak where are you going he cried up above teyrnon shouted sweat streaming down his face his voice raw the fightings too congested if i try to throw a power bolt ill hit as many of our own men as theirs and barak is hopelessly vulnerable when he has to source my magic barak was weeping with frustration paul saw they reached the slope and charged upward at the top a line of lios alfar stood scanning the stretch of the battle mounted auberei waited beside them ready to race down with word for the high king and his captains whats happening paul gasped to the nearest of the lios as he dismounted and spun to look but it was loren silvercloak striding forward who answered him too finely balanced he said his lined features grim were being held to a standstill and time is on their side aileron has ordered the dwarves to drive east toward the dalrei and the lios alfar hes going to try to hold the western flank and half of the center alone can he teyrnon asked loren shook his head for a time not forever and see the swans are telling galadan everything we do down below paul could see that the wolflord had withdrawn to a cleared space toward the rear of the army of the dark he was in his mortal shape again and every moment another of the hideous black swans would descend from the uncontested reaches of the air to give him tidings and carry away instructions beside paul barak began to curse a stream of heartfelt anguished invective below to their left a flash of light caught pauls eye it was arthur the king spear gleaming in his hand guiding his magnificent raithen all along the line of battle on the western flank driving back the legions of maugrim with the incandescent flame of his presence shaping a respite for the beleaguered men of brennin wherever he went the warrior in the last battle at camlann the battle he had not been meant to see and would not have seen had not diarmuid intervened behind paul the embers of the pyre still glowed and ashes drifted in the morning sun paul looked up no longer morning he realized beyond the circling swans the sun had reached its zenith and was starting down he jogged back toward the south in a cleared space a handful of people kim and jaelle among them were doing the best they could for the wounded that the auberei were bringing up the ridge in frightening numbers kims face was streaked with blood and sweat he knelt beside her im useless down there he said quickly what can i do you too she answered her grey eyes shadowed with pain pass me those bandages behind you yes she took the cloths and began wrapping the leg wound of one of the dwarves what do you mean paul asked kim cut the bandage with a blade and fastened it as tightly as she could she stood up and moved on without answering paul followed a young dalrei no more than sixteen lay in breathless agony an axe wound in his side kim looked down on him with despair teyrnon paul shouted the mage and his source hurried toward them teyrnon took one look at the wounded boy glanced briefly at barak and then knelt beside the dalrei barak closed his eyes and teyrnon placed his hand over the jagged wound he spoke under his breath half a dozen words and as he did the wound slowly closed itself when he was done though barak almost fell fatigue etched into his features teyrnon stood up quickly and steadied his source i cant do much more of this the mage said grimly looking closely at barak yes you can barak snapped glaring who else seer who else needs us go to jaelle kim said tonelessly shell show you the ones who are worst off do what you can but try not to exhaust yourself you two are all we have in the way of magic teyrnon nodded tersely and strode off to where paul could see the high priestess the sleeves of her white gown pushed back kneeling beside the figure of a crumpled lios alfar paul turned back to kim your own magic he said pointing to the dulled warstone whats happened for a moment she hesitated then she quickly told him the story of what had happened by calor diman i rejected it she concluded flatly and now the swans have the sky to themselves and the baelrath is totally dead i feel sick paul so did he but he masked it and pulled her to him in a hard embrace he felt her trembling against his body paul said no one here or anywhere else has done as much as you and we dont know if what you did was wrongwould you have gotten to the dwarves in time if youd used the ring to bind the creature in the lake it isnt over kim its a long way from over from not far off they heard a grunt of pain four of the auberei set down a stretcher theyd been carrying on it bleeding from half a dozen new wounds lay mabon of rhoden loren silvercloak and a whitefaced sharra of cathal hurried to the side of the fallen duke paul didnt know where to look all around them lay the dying and the dead below on the plain of battle the forces of the dark seemed scarcely to have diminished within himself the pulsebeat of mórnir seemed to faint as ever agonizingly far a hint of something but not a promise an awareness but not power he cursed as barak had done helplessly kim looked at him and after a moment she said in a strange voice i just realized something youre hating yourself for not being able to use your power in battle you dont have a power of war though paul we should have realized that before im that kind of power or i was until last night youre something else he heard a truth but the bitterness wouldnt leave him wonderful he snapped makes me awfully useful doesnt it maybe was all she said but there was a quiet speculation in her eyes that calmed him wheres jen he asked she pointed he looked over and saw that jennifer too was dealing with the wounded as best she could at the moment she had just risen from someones side to walk a step or two north looking down over the battlefield he could only see her in profile but as he gazed at her paul realized that he had never seen a woman look as she did then as if taking the pain of all the worlds onto herself in the manner of a queen he never ever knew what made him look up to see a black swan diving soundlessly a terror against the sky razored claws extended straight for jennifer black avaia putrescent death in the air returning to claim her victim for a second time paul screamed a warning at the top of his voice and launched himself in a frantic sprint over the distance between the swan was a black projectile hurtling down with annihilating speed jennifer turned at his cry and looked up she saw and did not flinch she grappled bravely for the slim blade theyd given her paul ran as hed never run before in all his life a sob escaped him too far he was too far away he tried reached for speed for more for something a meaty stench filled the air a shrieking sound of triumph jennifer lifted her blade twenty feet away paul stumbled fell heard himself screaming her name glimpsed the raking teeth of the swan and saw avaia ten feet above jennifers head smashed into a crumple of feathers by a red comet in the sky a living comet that had somehow materialized blindingly swift to intersect her path a horn like a blade exploded into avaias breast a bright sword smote at her head the black swan screamed in pain and terror so strident they heard it on the plain below she fell screaming still at the feet of the woman and guinevere walked over then not faltering and looked down upon the creature that had delivered her unto maugrim one moment she stood so then her own slim blade thrust forward into avaias throat and the screaming of the swan came to an end as lauriel the white was avenged after a thousand years the silence on the ridge was overwhelming even the tumult of war below seemed to have receded paul watched they all watched in awe as gereint the old blind shaman climbed carefully down to the ground to leave tabor dan ivor alone astride his winged creature the two of them seemed eerily remote even in the midst of so many people blood on his sword blood on her deadly shining horn the shaman stood very still his head lifted a little as if listening for something he sniffed the air which was foul with the corrupt odor of the swan pah exclaimed gereint and spat on the ground at his feet it is dead shaman said paul quietly he waited gereints sightless eyes swung unerringly to where paul stood twiceborn the old man asked yes said paul and stepping forward he embraced for the first time the old blind gallant figure who had sent his soul so far to find pauls on the dark wide sea paul stepped back gereint turned with that uncanny precision to where kim was standing silent inexplicable tears streaming down her face shaman and seer faced each other and no words at all were said kim closed her eyes still weeping im sorry she said brokenly oh tabor im sorry paul didnt understand he saw loren silvercloak lift his head sharply was this it gereint tabor asked in a strangely calm voice was it the black swan that you saw oh child the shaman whispered for the love i bear you and all your family i only wish that it were so loren had now turned completely away staring north weaver at the loom he cried then the others too saw the onrushing of the shadow they heard the huge roaring sound and felt the mighty buffet of the wind that had come jaelle clutched at pauls arm he was aware of her touch but it was at kim that he looked as the shadow came over them he finally understood her grief it became his own there was nothing he could do though nothing at all he saw tabor look up the boys eyes seemed to open very wide he touched the glorious creature that he rode she spread her wings and they rose into the sky he had been ordered to stay by the women and children in the curve of land east of the latham to guard them if necessary it was as much for his sake tabor knew as it was for their own his fathers attempt to keep him from leaving the world of men which was what seemed to happen whenever he rode imraithnimphais gereint had called for him though only half awake in that grey predawn hour in front of the shamans house tabor heard gereints words and everything changed child the shaman said i have been sent a vision from cernan as sharp as when he came to me and named you to your fast i am afraid that you must fly son of ivor you have to be in andarien before the sun is high it seemed to tabor as if there was an elusive music playing somewhere amid the ground mist and the greyness that lay all about before the rising of the sun his mother and sister were beside him awakened by the same boy gereint had sent with his message he turned to his mother to try to explain to ask forgiveness and saw that it wasnt necessary not with leith she had brought his sword from their house how she had known to do so he couldnt even guess she held it out toward him and he took it from her hands her eyes were dry his father was always the one who cried his mother said in her quiet strong voice you will do what you must do and your father will understand since the message comes from the god weave brightly for the dalrei my son and bring them home bring them home tabor found it hard to frame words of his own all about him and more clearly now he could hear the strange music calling him away he turned to his sister liane was weeping and he grieved for her she had been hurt in gwen ystrat he knew on the night liadon died there was a new vulnerability to her these days or perhaps it had always been there and only now was he noticing it it didnt really matter which not anymore in silence for words were truly very difficult he handed her his sword and raised his arms out from his side kneeling his sister buckled the sword belt upon him after the fashion of the old days she did not speak either when she was done he kissed her and then his mother leith held him very tightly for a moment and then she let him go he stepped a little way apart from all of them the music had gone now the sky was brighter in the east above the carnevon range in whose looming shadows they lay tabor looked around at the silent sleeping camp then he closed his eyes and inside himself not aloud he said beloved and almost before the thought was fully formed he theard the voice of his dreaming that was the voice of his soul respond i am here shall we fly i he opened his eyes she was in the sky overhead more glorious to see than even innermost knowledge remembered her to be she seemed brighter her horn more luminous every time she came his heart lifted to see her and to watch her land so lightly at his side i think we must he answered her walking over to stroke the glistening red mane she lowered her head so the shining horn rested on his shoulder for a moment i think this is the time for which we were brought together we shall have each other she said to him come i will take you up to the sunrise he smiled a little at her eagerness but then an instant later his indulgent smile faded as he felt the same fierce exhilaration surge through him as well he mounted up upon imraithnimphais and even as he did she spread her wings wait he said with the last of his selfcontrol he turned back his mother and sister were watching them leith had never seen his winged creature before and a faroff part of tabor hurt a little to see awe in her face a mother should not be awed by her son he thought but already such thoughts seemed to come from a long way away the sky was appreciably lighter now the mist was lifting he turned to gereint who had been waiting patiently saying nothing tabor said you know her name shaman you know the names of all our totem animals even this one she will bear you if you like would you fly with us and gereint as unruffled as he always seemed to be said quietly i would not have presumed to ask but there may yet be a reason for me to be there yes i will come help me mount without being asked imraithnhnphais moved nearer to the frail wizened shaman she stood very still as tabor reached down a hand and liane moved forward and helped gereint up behind tabor then it seemed that there was nothing else to be said and no time to say it even if he could have managed to within his mind tabor told the creature of his dream let us fly my love and with the thought they were in the sky winging north just as the morning sun burst up on their right hand behind him tabor knew without looking his mother would be standing straightbacked dryeyed holding his sister in her arms watching her youngest fly away from her this has been his very last thought his last clear image from the world of men as they had sped through the morning high over the rolling plain racing the rising sun to a field of war to which they had finally come and in time with the sun high starting over into the west they had come and tabor had seen a black thing of horror a monstrous swan diving from the sky and he had drawn his sword and imraithnimphais glorious and deadly had reached for even greater speed and they had met the diving swan and struck her two mortal wounds with shining blade and horn when it was over tabor had felt just as he had before each time theyd flown and killed that the balance of his soul had shifted again farther away than ever from the world through which the people all around them moved gereint descended unaided and so tabor and imraithnimphais stood by themselves among men and women some of whom they knew he saw the blood dark on his creatures horn and heard her say to him in the moment before he formed the thought himself only each other at the last and then an instant later he heard silvercloak cry aloud and he wheeled about and looked to the north above the tumult of the battlefield where his father and his brother were fighting he looked saw the shadow felt the wind and realized what had come here now at the last and knew in that moment why he had dreamt his creature and that the pending was upon them he did not hesitate or turn to bid farewell to anyone he was already too far away for such things he moved hands a little and imraithnimphais leaped into the to meet the dragon the dragon of rakoth maugrim in the sky over andarien a thousand years before it had been too young to fly wings too weak to bear the colossal weight of its body secret most terrible of all maugrims malevolent designs it had been another casualty of the unravellers untimely haste at the bael rangathis dragon had been able to play no part in that war instead it had lurked in a vast underground chamber hollowed out beneath starkadh and when the end had come when the army of light had beaten its way northward rakoth had sent his dragon away flying with awkward halfcrippled motions to seek refuge in the northern ice where no man would ever go it had been seen from afar by the lios alfar and the longsighted among men but they had been too distant still to discern it clearly or know what it was there were tales told about it that became legends in time motifs for tapestries for nightmares of childhood it had survived nurtured through the long turning years of the unravellers imprisonment by fordaetha the queen of rük in her ice palace amid the barrens gradually as the years passed and then the centuries its wings grew stronger it began to fly on longer and longer journeys through that white and trackless waste at the roof of the world it learned to fly and then it learned to harness and hurl forth the molten fire of its lungs to send roaring tongues of flame exploding amid the white cold far above the great ice floes that ceaselessly ground and crashed against each other farther and farther it flew its great wings beating the frigid air the flame of its breath luridly lighting the night sky over the ice where no one was there to see save only the queen of rük from her cold towers it flew so high it could see at times beyond the glacier walls beyond the titanic prison of cloudshouldered rangat to the green lands far away in the south it was all fordaetha could do as the sweep of time pushed even the stars into newer patterns to hold the dragon back but hold it she did having power of her own in the cold kingdom she ruled and in time there came a messenger from galadan the wolflord and the message was that rakoth maugrim was free and black starkadh had risen anew only then did she send it south and the dragon went landing in a space prepared for it north of starkadh and rakoth maugrim was there and the unraveller laughed aloud to see the mightiest creature of his hate now full grown this time rakoth had waited savoring the malice of a thousand years watching his own black blood fall burning from where his severed hand had been he waited and in the fullness of time he made the mountain go up in flame and he shaped the winter and then the death rain over eridu and only when these were ended did he let his army issue forth in might and only after that saved for the very last that its unforeseen coming might shatter the hearts of those who would oppose him he sent out his dragon to scorch and burn and destroy so did it come to pass the sun was blotted out and half the sky over that battlefield in andarien that the armies of light and dark both of them were driven to their knees by the pounding force of the wind of the dragons wings that fire blackened the dry ground of wasted andarien for miles upon miles in a long smoldering strip of twiceravaged earth and so also did it come to pass that tabor dan ivor drew forth his sword and the shining creature he rode lifted herself wings beating in a blur of speed even into the fury of that wind they rose aloft alone at the last as both of them had known they would be from the very first and they hovered in the darkened air shining gallant pitifully small directly in the path of the dragon on the ground below battered to his knees by the wind ivor dan banor looked up for one instant only and the image of his son in the sky imprinted itself forever onto the patterns of his brain then he turned away and covered his face with his bloodied sleeve for he could not bear to watch high overhead tabor lifted his sword to draw the dragon toward him it was not necessary though the dragon was already aware of them he saw it accelerate and draw breath to send a river of flame toward them from the furnace of its lungs he saw that it was vast and unspeakably hideous with greyblack scales covering its hide and mottled greygreen skin below he knew that there was nothing and no one on the windswept ground below that could withstand this thing he also knew with an exquisite quiet certaintya last space of calm here in the teeth of the windthat there was one thing and one thing only they could do and there was only a moment this moment in which to do it before the dragons flame burst forth to turn them into ash he stroked her shining glossy mane in his mind he said so here it is be not afraid my love let us do what we were born to do i am not afraid she sent back in the mind voice whose every cadence he knew you have named me your beloved since first we saw each other do you know that you have been mine the dragon was upon them blackness filling the sky there was a roaring a deafening noise of wind pushed to its outermost limits still imraithnimphais held steady before it her wings straining as fast they had ever gone her horn a point of blinding light in the roaring chaos of the sky of course i know tabor sent to her his last such thought now come my darling we must kill it as we die and imraithnimphais forced herself higher then somehow and forward somehow directly into the maelstrom of the dragon wind and tabor clung to her mane with all his might letting fall his useless sword above the dragons path they rose he saw it lift its head open its mouth but they were hurtling toward it angling downward like a shaft of killing light straight for the loathsome head making themselves the two of them having only each other at the last into a living blade that they might explode at this dazzling incandescent speed the sharp horn shining like a star right into and through the skin and muscle the cartilage and bone of the dragons brain and so kill it as they died at the very edge of impact the edge of the end of all things tabor saw the dragons lidless eyes narrow he looked down and saw the first tongue of the flame appear at the base of its gaping throat too late he knew it was too late they were going to hit in time he closed his eyes and felt himself thrown free by imraithnimphais in a tumbling spiraling parabola he screamed his voice lost in the cataclysm he spun in the air like a torn leaf he fell in his mind he heard clear and sweet like a bell heard over summer fields a mind voice say in the purest tones of love remember me then she hit the dragon at the apex of her speed her horn sheared through its skull and her body followed it truly a living blade and just as imraithnimphais had shone living like a star so did she explode like a star in her dying for the dragons gathered fire burst within itself incinerating the two of them they fell burning to the earth west of the battlefield and crashed there with a force of impact that shook the ground as far east as gwynir as far north as the walls of starkadh and tabor dan ivor thrown free by an act of love plummeted after them from a killing height when the dragon came kim was beaten to her knees not only by the wind of its wings but by the brutal awareness of her own folly now she knew why the baelrath had blazed for the crystal dragon of calor diman why macha and nemain the goddesses of war whom the warstone served had known that the guardian spirit of the dwarves would be needed whatever the cost might be and she had refused in her arrogance her own imposed morality she had refused to exact that price from the dwarves or to pay it herself had refused to accept at the last test the responsibility of the baelrath and so now tabor dan ivor hopelessly overmatched was rising into the sky into the wind to pay the price for her refusal if he even could if they werent all to pay that price for the dragon that was coming down upon them meant the end of everything kim knew it and so did every person on the ridge or on the bloody plain below stricken with a guilt that numbed her senses kim watched imraithnimphais fight desperately to hold her place in the air against the annihilating whirlwind of the dragons approach there was a hand gripping her shoulder gereints she had no idea how the old shaman knew what shed done but nothing about gereint could surprise her anymore it was clear that he did know and was seeking even here at the end to comfort heras if she had any claim or right to comfort blinking tears from her eyes she saw the monstrous jointed greyblack wings of the dragon pound the air the sun was lost a huge rushing blackness lay over the land the dragon opened its mouth kim saw tabor let fell his sword and then unbelieving stupefied she saw the glorious creature he rode gift of the goddess shining doubleedged begin to move forward into the maelstrom straight toward the obliterating vastness of the dragon of maugrim beside her gereint was still on his feet despite the force of the wind stonyfaced waiting someone cried out in fear and awe the horn of imraithnimphais was a dazzling thing of glory at the edge of night and then it was a blur moving almost too fast to be seen as she found from somewhere in her being an even greater more defiant dimension of speed and kim finally realized what was happening and just how the price would be paid teyrnon paul schafer cried suddenly at the top of his voice screaming it over the wind quickly be ready the mage threw him a startled glance but barak without questions asked fought to his feet closed his eyes and braced himself and in that instant they saw tabor thrown free then imraithnimphais met the dragon and a fireball exploded in the sky too bright to look upon teyrnon paul screamed again i see him the mage shouted back sweat was pouring down his face his hands were outstretched to their fullest extent reaching power surged from them in shimmering waves as he struggled to break the fall of the boy tumbling helplessly earthward from so high the dragon crashed to the ground with a sound like a mountain falling all around kim people tumbled like dominoes to the trembling earth somehow gereint kept his balance staying upright beside her one hand still on her shoulder and so too did teyrnon and barak but as kim looked up she saw that tabor was still falling if slowly spinning like some discarded toy hes too far teyrnon cried in despair i cant stop him he tried though and barak shaking in every limb fought to source the magic that could break that terrible fall look said paul out of the corner of her eye kim saw a flashing movement on the plain she turned a raithen of daniloth was streaking westward over the ground tabor fell headfirst slowed by teyrnons magic but unconscious unable to help himself the raithen shot over the ground like a golden and silver brother of imraithnimphais herself on its back arthur pendragon let fall the king spear and rose to stand in the stirrups the raithen gathered itself and leaped and as it did arthur stretched forward and up toward the boy spinning down out of the sunlight and with his strong hands he caught tabor as he fell and cradled him against his chest as the raithen slowed and stopped racing in his wake lancelot leaned sideways in his saddle and reclaimed the fallen spear then together the two of them sped southward up the rise of land to halt on the ridge where kim stood and gereint and all the others watching there he is all right i think the warrior said tersely tabor was ash white but seemed otherwise unhurt kim could see him breathing she looked at arthur there was blood all over his body one deep gash above his eye was bleeding freely partially blinding him kim moved forward and waited until he had handed tabor down to be taken by a great many hands then she made arthur dismount while she tended his wound as best she could she could see the ruin of lancelots palm even through the glove he wore but there was nothing really that she or anyone else could do about that behind her jaelle and sharra were dealing with tabor and loren had knelt beside barak who had collapsed they would recover she knew they both would though tabor would carry an inner wound that only time might salve if time were granted them if they were allowed to go forward from today impatiently arthur endured her ministrations he was speaking constantly as she worked on him relaying crisp instructions to the auberei gathered around one of them he sent to ivor with word of his youngest son down on the plain the army of light was battling again with a passion and hope that the afternoon had not yet seen glancing down kim saw aileron carving a lethal swath through the urgach and wolves with diarmuids men beside him moving forward and to the east struggling to link with the dwarves in the center we have a chance now teyrnon said gasping with fatigue tabor has given us a chance i know said arthur he turned away from kim preparing to race back down then she saw him stop beside him lancelots face had gone ashen as pale as tabors was kim followed their gaze and felt her heart thud with a pain beyond words what is it gereint asked urgently tell me what you see tell him what she saw she saw at this moment even as hope seemed to have been reborn out of fiery death an end to hope reinforcements she said a great many gereint a very great many coming from the north to join their army too many shaman i think there are too many there was a silence on the ridge then there must not be gereint said calmly arthur turned at the quiet words there was a passion in his eyes beyond anything kim had seen there before he said in echo you are right shaman there must not be and the raithen leaped down the ridge bearing the warrior back to war for one second only lancelot lingered kim saw him look as if against his will to guinevere who was gazing back at him not a word was said between them but a farewell was in the air and a love that even now was still denied the solace and release of being spoken then he too drew his sword again and stormed back to the battle down below beyond the battlefield north of it the plain of andarien was lost to sight dark with the roiling movements of the advancing second wave of rakoths army a wave kim saw almost as large as the first had been and the first had been too large the dragon was dead but that hardly seemed to matter it had only bought them time a little time shaped in fire to be paid with blood but leading to the same ending which was the dark are we lost asked jaelle looking up from where she knelt by tabor kim turned to her but it was paul who made reply among all the people gathered there perhaps he said in a voice that suddenly carried more than his own cadences it is likely im afraid but there is one last random thread left for us among all the weavings of this day and i will not concede dominion to the dark until that thread is lost even as he spoke kims own knowledge came sweeping over her in an image like a dream she looked at jennifer for an instant and then her gaze went north beyond the battlefields beyond the thunderous approach of maugrims reinforcementsthey had been seen now down below there were cries of harsh wild triumph rising everywherebeyond the blackened line of fireravaged earth that marked where the dragon had flown beyond all these far far beyond kim looked toward a place shed only seen in a vision given her by eilathen rising from his lake so long ago to starkadh chapter the laughter had frightened him darien passed a cold fitful night shot through with dreams he could not remember when the morning came with the sun came warmth it was summer even here in the northlands he was still afraid though and irresolute now that he had come to the end of his journey when he went to wash his face in the river the water was oily and something bit his finger drawing blood he backed away for a long time he lingered there hiding under the bridge reluctant to move movement would be such a decisive such a final thing it was eerily silent the ungarch ran sluggishly without sound aside from whatever had bit him there was no sign of life anywhere not since the dragon had passed away to the south a black shape in blackness not since the laughter of his father no birds sang even on a morning in midsummer it was a place of waste of desolation and across the river stood his fathers towers challenging the sky so black they seemed to swallow the light it was worse somehow in daylight there were no obscuring shadows to blunt the impact of starkadhs oppressiveness fortress of a god with its huge brutal piled stones blank and featureless save for a scattered handful of almost invisible windows set far up crouching under the bridge darien looked at the exposed path leading up to the iron doors and fear was within him like a living thing he tried to master it to seek strength from an image of finn a vision of his brother dealing with this terror it didnt work however hard he tried he couldnt even picture finn in this place the same thing happened when he tried to draw courage from a memory of lancelot in the sacred grove that didnt help either it couldnt be superimposed he stayed there lonely and afraid and all the while unconsciously his hand kept returning to stroke the lifeless gem upon his brow the sun rose higher in the sky to the east rangat gleamed its upper shopes dazzlingly white awesome inaccessible darien didnt know why but it was after he looked at the mountain that he found himself on his feet he walked out from his hiding place to stand in the open under the brilliant sun and he set foot on the valgrind bridge it seemed to him that the whole world for miles around reverberated to the ringing of his tread he stopped his heart pounding then realized that it was not so the sound was small and slight as he was its echoes were only magnified in the chambers of his mind he went on he crossed the river ungarch and stood at last before the doors of starkadh he was not seen though he was utterly unshielded there in the bleak flatness of that landscape a boy in an illfitting if beautifully knitted sweater with a dagger in his hand his fair hair held back by some circlet about his brow his eyes were very blue in the sunlight a moment later they were red and then the boy had gone an owl white as the vanished snows flapped swiftly upward to land on the narrow sill of a window slit halfway up the black face of starkadh had that been seen there would have been an alarm it was not seen there were no guards what need had there ever been for guards about this place in his owl shape darien perched uneasily on the window ledge and looked within there was no one there he ruffled his feathers fighting back a stiffing apprehension and then his eyes flared again and he was once more in his own form he slipped cautiously down from the window and so set foot at last in the fortress where he had been conceived a long long way below his mother had lain in a chamber deep in the bowels of this place and on a morning much like this one rakoth maugrim had come to her and had done what he had done darien looked around it was as if it was always night within these walls the single window let in hardly any sunlight the daylight seemed to die where it reached starkadh a green fitful illumination was cast by lights set in the walls there was an overpowering stench in the room and as dariens eyes adjusted to the baleful texture of the light he was able to make out the shapes of halfconsumed carcasses on the floor they were svart alfar and their dead bodies stank he understood suddenly where he was and why there was a window here this was the place where the swans might return to feed he remembered the smell of the ones he had killed it was all around him now the foul putrescence made him gag he stumbled toward the inner door his foot squashed something soft and oozing as he went he didnt look to see what it was he opened the door and almost fell into the corridor gasping heedless if he was seen and he was seen a single urgach massive and sharpclawed turned five feet away from him it grunted in disbelieving shock and opened its mouth to bellow an alarm and died darien straightened his eyes receded back to blue he lowered the arm hed thrust forward at the urgach and took a deep breath power coursed through him triumphant and exhilarating he had never felt so strong the urgach was gone there was no sign it had ever even been there he had obliterated it with one surge of his power he listened for the sound of footsteps there were none no alarm seemed to have been raised it wouldnt matter darien thought his fear had vanished in its place was a rushing sensation of might he had never known how strong he was he had never been this strong he was in his fathers fortress the place of his own conception the hearthstone then of his own red power he was a worthy son an ally even an equal perhaps bringing more than a dwarvish dagger as a gift he was bringing himself in this place he could blast urgach to nothingness with a motion of his hand how could his father not welcome him to his side in a time of war darien closed his eyes let his inner senses reach out and found what he was looking for far above him there was a presence infinitely different from dariens awareness of urgach and svart alfar all through the fortress a presence unlike any other the aura of a god he found the stairway and began to climb there was no fear in him now there was power and a kind of joy the sheath of the knife gleamed blue in his hand the circlet was dull and dead his hand no longer went up to touch it not since hed killed the urgach he killed two more as he went up exactly the same way with the same completely effortless flexing of his hand feeling the power course outward from his mind he sensed how much more lay in reserve had he known about this he thought had he known how to tap into this power he could have blasted the demon of the sacred grove into fragments all by himself he wouldnt have needed lancelot or any other guardian his mother sent he didnt even break stride at the thought of her she was a long way off and had sent him away had sent him here and here he was more than he had ever imagined he could be he went up tireless climbing stairway after twisting stairway he wanted to run but he forced himself to go slowly that he might come with dignity bearing his gift offering all he was even the green lights along the walls no longer seemed so cold or alien he was darien dan rakoth returning home he knew exactly where he was going as he climbed the aura of his fathers power grew stronger with every stride then at the turning of a stair almost the last darien paused a rumbling tremor rolled northward along the earth shaking the foundations of starkadh and a moment later there came a cry from above a wordless snarl of balked desire of soulconsuming rage it was too great too brutal a sound it was worse than the laughter had been dariens surging hope quailed before the hatred in that cry he stood still gasping fighting back the horror that rolled over him in waves his power was still with him he knew what had happened the dragon was dead the fall of nothing else in fionavar could have so shaken the earth the trembling of the fortress walls went on for a long time then it passed and there was silence again with a different texture to it darien stood rooted to the spot where he was and a thought born of lonely hope bloomed in his mind he will need me even more now the dragon is lost he took one step upon the last stairway and as he did he felt the hammer of a god fall upon his mind and with the hammer there came a voice come darien heard the sound became his universe it obliterated everything else the whole of starkadh resonated to it i am aware of you i would see your face he wanted to go there he had been going there but now his feet were independent of his will he could not have resisted however hard he tried regardless of his rising power in his mind with bitterest irony he remembered his own arrogance of the moments before an equal to maugrim he had thought himself there were no equals to rakoth maugrim and on that realization he ascended the final stair of starkadh and came out into a vast chamber ringed about entirely with glass though it had seemed as black as all the other walls when viewed from outside dariens mind rocked and spun dizzily at the perspective of that window he was seeing the battle in andarien beyond those high windows of starkadh the battle plain far to the south lay beneath his feet it was as if he were flying over it and a moment later he realized that this was exactly so the windowsby exercise of a power he couldnt even begin to fathomwere showing the vision of the swans circling over andarien and the swans were the eyes of maugrim who was here who turned now at last huge mighty beyond the telling in this seat of his power rakoth maugrim the unraveller who had entered into the worlds from outside the walls of time from beyond the weavers halls with no thread of tapestry marked with his name faceless he turned from the window to the one who had come who had dared come and darien trembled then in every limb and would have fallen had his body not been held upright by the red glance of maugrim he saw the blood drip black and smoking from the stump of his fathers hand then the hammer of before became as nothing nothing at all as he felt his mind battered by the probing of the unraveller he could not move or speak terror was a clawed thing in his throat the will of rakoth was all about him it was everywhere driving pounding on the doors of his being demanding that he give way hammering a single question over and over again until darien thought he would go mad who are you his father screamed soundlessly endlessly beating about all the entrances to dariens soul there was nothing at all darien could do except keep him out and he did motionless literally paralyzed he stood in the presence of the darkest god in all the worlds and held maugrim at bay his own power was gone he could do nothing assert nothing he was as nothing in this place except for one single thing he was strong enough as none anywhere in any world had ever been to hold to his mind in starkadh to keep his secret he could hear the question being screamed at him it was the question he had come here to answer to offer the knowledge as a gift but because it was being demanded in this way because maugrim would strip it from him as a rag from a wound leaving him raw and naked beneath darien said no within his soul exactly as his mother had done within these halls though she had not been as strong she was only mortal if a queen and in the end she had been broken or not quite you will have nothing of me that you do not take she had said to rakoth maugrim and he had laughed and set about taking everything from her but he had not she had been open to him utterly maugrim had stripped and ravaged her soul and when he was done he had left her a broken reed to be enjoyed and killed but she had not been broken somehow there had been a spar left in her soul to which the memory of love still could cling and kimberly had found her holding to that spar and had brought her out to bear the child who stood here now refusing to surrender his mind or his soul rakoth could kill him darien knew as easily as he himself had killed the urgach or the swans but there was somethinghe wasnt sure what but there was something saved from the wreckage of his life in this resistance and then as the worldloom shuttled slowly about the axis of that chamber with everything all of time suspended as in a balance maugrim stopped the whirlwind of his assault and darien found that he could move if he wished to and could speak rakoth maugrim said aloud not even galadan lord of the andain could hold his mind against my will in this place there is nothing you can do to me i can end your life in ten thousand different ways even as we stand here speak before you die who are you why have you come and so darien thought dazed there was still a way still a chance he thought he could hear respect of a kind he had proved himself he was very very young and he had no guidance here at all and had not had any since finn had gone away he had been rejected by everyone and everything even by the light he wore upon his brow cernan of the beasts had asked why hed been allowed to live manning the walls of his mind darien whispered i have come to offer you a gift he held out the sheathed dagger hilt foremost and even as he did the hammer descended again in an unspeakable shocking assault upon his mind as if maugrim were a ravenous beast raging about fragile walls bludgeoning away at dariens soul screaming in fury at being denied but denied he was for a second time and for a second time he stopped he was holding the dagger now and had unsheathed it he had come nearer to darien he was huge he had no face the talons of his one hand caressed the blueveined blade he said i have no need of gifts whatever i want from today to the end of time and beyond i shall be able to take why should i want a bauble of the treacherous dwarves what is a blade to me you have one thing only that i desire and i shall have it before you die i want your name darien had come to tell him to offer all he was and might be so that someone somewhere might be glad of his presence he could speak now he could move and see he looked beyond rakoth out the windows of that place and he saw what the black swans saw far to the south he saw the battlefield with such clarity that he could make out individual faces fighting there his father had no face with a shock of recognition he saw lancelot battling with blood all over his hand swinging his sword at the side of a greybearded man who wielded a spear that shone behind them a phalanx of men some mounted some on foot were struggling to hold their ground against stupefying numbers of the dark among themand darien had to blink to be sure that he saw truea man he knew gripped a rusty spear he remembered shahar his other father who had been so much away but who had swung him in the air and held him when hed come home he was not a fighter darien could see that but he labored in the wake of his leaders with a desperate determination the vision shiftedthe eyes of another swanand he saw the lios alfar beleaguered in another part of the field he recognized one of them from the morning beneath the summer tree there was blood in the silver hair yet another perspective a ridge of land this time south of the battlefield and on the ridge stood his mother darien felt suddenly as if he could not breathe he looked upon her from so impossibly far away and he read the sorrow in her eyes the awareness of doom descending and he realized a white fire igniting in his heart that he did not want her to die he did not want any of them to die not lancelot or shahar or the grey man with the spear not the whitehaired seer standing behind his mother he was sharing their grief he realized it was his own pain it was the fire running through him it was his he was one of them he saw the innumerable loathsome hordes descending upon the dwindling army of light the urgach the svart alfar the slaugs all the instruments of the unraveller they were foul and he hated them he stood there looking down upon a world of war and he thought of finn in the end here at the very end it came back to finn who had said that darien was to try to love everything except the dark he did he was one of that besieged army the army of light freely uncoerced he finally numbered himself among them his eyes were shining and he knew that they were blue and so there in that moment in the deepest stronghold of the dark darien made his choice and rakoth maugrim laughed it was the laughter of a god the laughter that had resounded when rangat had sent up the hand of fire darien didnt know about that he hadnt been born then what he knew terrified was that hed given himself away the window of the chamber still showed the high ridge of land above the battle it showed his mother standing there and rakoth had been watching as darien looked upon her the laughter stopped maugrim stepped very close darien couldnt move slowly his father raised the stump of his severed hand and held it over dariens head the black drops of blood fell and burned on dariens face he couldnt even scream maugrim lowered his arm he said you need not tell me anything now i know everything there is to know you thought to bring me a gift a toy you have done more you have brought me back my immortality you are my gift it was to have been so once but not like this and not now not anymore but darien stood there frozen in his place by the will of rakoth maugrim and heard his father say you do not understand do you they were all fools fools beyond belief i needed her dead that she might never bear a child i must not have a child did none of them see a child of my seed binds me into time it puts my name in the tapestry and i can die and then came the laughter again brutal crescendos of triumph rolling over him in waves when it ended maugrim stood only inches away from darien looking down upon him from his awesome height from within the blackness of his hood he said in a voice colder than death older than the spinning worlds you are that son i know you now and i will do more than kill you i will thrust your living soul out beyond the walls of time i will make it so that you have never been you are in starkadh and in this place i have the power to do that had you died outside these walls i might have been lost not now you are lost you have never lived i will live forever and all the worlds are mine today all things in all the worlds there was nothing nothing at all that darien could do he couldnt even move or speak he could only listen and hear the unraveller say again all things in all the worlds starting with that toy of the lios that you wear i know what it is i would have it before i blast your soul out of the tapestry he reached forth with his minddarien felt it touch him againto claim the circlet as he had claimed the dagger and take it unto himself and it came to pass in that moment that the spirit of lisen of the wood for whom that shining thing of light had been made so long ago reached out from the far side of night from beyond death and performed her own last act of absolute renunciation of the dark in that stronghold of evil the circlet blazed it flared with a light of sun and moon and stars of hope and worldspanning love a light so pure so dazzlingly incandescent a light so absolute that rakoth maugrim was blinded by the pain of it he screamed in agony his hold on darien broke only for an instant which was enough for in that instant darien did the one thing the only thing that he could do to manifest the choice hed made he took one step forward the circlet a glorious radiance on his brow rejecting him no longer he took the last step on the darkest road and he impaled himself upon the dagger his father held upon lokdal seithrs gift to colan a thousand years ago and rakoth maugrim blinded by lisens light mortal because hed fathered a son killed that son with the dagger of the dwarves and he killed without love in his heart dying darien heard his fathers last scream and knew it could be heard in every corner of fionavar in every world spun into time by the weavers hand the sound that marked the passing of rakoth maugrim darien was lying on the floor there was a bright blade in his heart with fading sight he looked out the high window and saw that the fighting had stopped on the plain so far away it became harder to see the window was trembling and there was a blurring in front of his eyes the circlet was still shining though he reached up and touched it for the last time the window began to shake even more violently and the floor of the room a stone crashed from above another all around him starkadh was beginning to crumble it was falling away to nothingness in the ruin of maugrims fall he wondered if anyone would ever understand what had happened he hoped so so that someone might come in time to his mother and tell her of the choice hed made the choice of light and of love it was true he realized he was dying with love killed by lokdal flidais had told him what that part meant as well the gift he might have been allowed to give but hed marked no ones forehead with the pattern on the haft and in any case he thought he would not have wanted to burden any living creature with his soul it was almost his last thought his very last was of his brother tossing him among the soft banks of snow when hed still been dari and finn had still been there to love him and to teach him just enough of love to carry him home to the light chapter dave heard the last scream of rakoth maugrim and then he heard the screaming stop there was a moment of silence of waiting and then a great rumbling avalanche of sound rolled down upon them from far in the north he knew what that was they all did there were tears of joy in his eyes they were pouring down his face he couldnt stop them he didnt want to stop them and suddenly it was easy he felt as if a weight had been stripped away from him a weight he hadnt even known he was bearinga burden he seemed to have carried from the moment hed been born into time he and everyone else cast forth into worlds that lay under the shadow of the dark but rakoth maugrim was dead dave didnt know how but he knew it was true he looked at tore and saw a wide helpless smile spreading across the other mans face he had never seen tore look like that and suddenly dave laughed aloud on the battlefield for the sheer joy of being alive in that moment in front of them the svart alfar broke and ran the urgach milled about in disorganized confusion slaug crashed into each other grunting with fear then they too turned from the army of light and began to flee to the north which was no haven anymore they would be hunted and found dave knew they would be destroyed already the dalrei and the lios alfar were racing after them for the first time in that long terrible day dave heard the lios begin to sing and his heart swelled as if it would burst to hear the glory of their song only the wolves held firm for a time on the western flank but they were alone now and outnumbered and the warriors of brennin led by arthur pendragon on his raithen wielding the shining king spear as if it were the light itself were cutting through them like sickles through a field of harvest grain dave and tore laughing crying thundered after the urgach and the svart alfar sorcha was with them riding beside his son the slaug should have been faster than their horses but they werent the sixlegged monsters seemed to have become feeble and purposeless they stumbled careened in all directions threw their riders fell it was easy now it was glorious the lios alfar were singing all around and the setting sun shone down upon them from a cloudless summer sky wheres ivor tore shouted suddenly and levon dave felt a quick spasm of fear but then it passed he knew where they would be he pulled up his horse and the other two did the same they rode back across the bloodied plain strewn with the bodies of the dying and the dead back to the ridge of land south of the battlefield from a long distance away they could see the aven kneeling beside a body that would be his youngest son they dismounted and walked up the ridge in the late afternoon light a serenity seemed to have gathered about that place levon saw them hell be all right he said walking over dave nodded then he reached out and pulled levon to him in a fierce embrace ivor looked up he released tabors hand and came over to where they stood there was a brightness in his eyes shining through his weariness he will be all right he echoed thanks to the mage and to arthur he will be all right and to pwyll said teyrnon quietly he was the one who guessed i would never have caught him without that warning dave looked for paul and saw him standing a little way apart from everyone else farther along the ridge even now he thought he considered walking over but was reluctant to intrude there was something very selfcontained very private about paul in that moment what happened someone said dave looked down it was mabon of rhoden lying on a makeshift pallet not far away the duke smiled at him and winked then he repeated does anyone know exactly what happened dave saw jennifer coming toward them there was a gentle radiance in her face but it did not hide the deeper well of sorrow in her eyes before anyone spoke dave had an unexpected glimmer of understanding it was darien said kim approaching as well but i dont know how i wish i did so do i said teyrnon but i could not see far enough to know what happened there i did said a third voice very gently very clearly they all turned to gereint and it was the old blind shaman of the plain who gave voice to dariens dying wish in the soft light and the deeply woven peace that had come he said i thought there might be a reason for me to fly with tabor this was it i could not fight in battle but i was far enough north standing here to send my awareness into starkadh he paused and asked gently where is the queen dave was confused for a second but jennifer said here i am shaman gereint turned to the sound of her voice he said he is dead my lady i am sorry to say that the child is dead but through the gift of my blindness i saw what he did he chose for the light at the last the circlet of lisen blazed on his brow and he threw himself upon a blade and died in such a way that maugrim died with him lokdal kim exclaimed of course rakoth killed without love and so he died oh jen you were right after all you were so terribly right she was crying and dave saw that jennifer lowell who was guinevere was weeping now as well though silently in mourning for her child who had taken the darkest road and had come at last to the end of it alone and so far away dave saw jaelle the high priestess no longer so coldly arrogantit showed even in the way she movedwalk over to comfort jennifer to gather her in her arms there were so many tilings warring for a place in his heart joy and weariness deep sorrow pain an infinite relief he turned and walked down the slope of the ridge he picked his way along the southern edge of what had been so little time ago the battlefield whereon the light was to have been lost and would have been were it not for jennifers child guineveres child he was wounded in many places and exhaustion was slowly catching up to him he thought of his father for the second time that day standing there on the edge of the battle plain looking out upon the dead but one of them was not dead would the old estrangement never leave him paul was wondering even here even now in the moment when the towers of darkness fell would he always feel this way and the answer that came back to him within his mind was in the form of another question what right had he even to ask he was alive by sufferance of mórnir he had gone to the summer tree to die named surrogate by the old king ailell who had told him about the price of power during a chess game that seemed centuries ago he had gone to die but had been sent back he was still alive twiceborn he was lord of the summer tree and there was a price to power he was marked named to be apart and in this moment while all around him quiet joy and quiet sorrow melded with each other paul was vibrating with the presence of his power in a way he never had before there was another thing left to happen something was coming not the war kim had been right about that as she had been right about so many things his was not a power of war it never had been he had been trying hard to make it so to find a way to use it channel it into battle but from the very beginning what hed had was a strength of resistance of opposition denial of the dark he was a defense not a weapon of attack he was the symbol of the god an affirmation of life in his very existence his being alive he had not felt the cold of maugrims winter walking coatless in a wild night later his had been the warning of the soulmonger at sea the cry that had brought liranan to their defense and then again a second time to save their lives upon the rocks of the anors bay he was the presence of life the sap of the summer tree rising from the green earth to drink the rain of the sky and greet the sun and within him now with the war over maugrim dead the sap was beginning to run there was a trembling in his hands an awareness of growth of something building deep and very strong the pulsebeat of the god which was his own he looked down on the quiet plain to the north and west aileron the high king was riding back with arthur on one side and lancelot on the other the setting sun was behind the three of them and there were coronas of light in their hair these were the figures of battle paul thought the warriors in the service of macha and nemain the goddesses of war just as kimberly had been with the summoning baelrath on her hand as tabor and his shining mount had been his gift of dana born of the red full moon as even dave martyniuk was with his towering passion in battle with ceinwens gift at his side ceinwens gift paul was quick all his life he had had an intuitive ability to make connections that others would never even see he was turning even as the thought flared in his mind like a brand he was turning looking for dave a cry forming on his lips he was almost almost in time so too was dave when the halfburied feral figure leaped from the pile of bodies daves reflexes overrode his weariness he spun his hands going up to defend himself had the figure been thrusting for his heart or throat dave would have turned him back but his assailant was not looking to take his life not yet a hand flashed out precise unerring at this last supreme moment a hand that reached for daves side not for his heart or throat that reached for and found the key to what it had so long sought there was a tearing sound as a cord ripped dave heard paul schafer cry out up on the ridge he clawed for his axe but it was too late it was much too late rising gracefully from a rolling fall ten feet away galadan stood under the westering sun on the bloodied ground of andarien and he held oweins horn in his hand and then the wolflord of the andain who had dreamt a dream for so many years who had followed a neverending questnot for power not for lordship over anyone or anything but for pure annihilation for the ending of all thingsblew that mighty horn with all the power of his bitter soul and summoned owein and the wild hunt to the ending of the world kim heard paul shout his warning and then in that same moment all other sounds seemed to cease and she heard the horn for the second time its sound was light she remembered that it could not be heard by the agents of the dark it had been moonlight on snow and frosty distant stars the night dave had sounded it before the cave to free the hunt it was different now galadan was sounding it galadan who had lived a thousand years in lonely arrogant bitterness after lisen had rejected him and died tool of maugrim but seeking ever to further his own design his one unvarying design the sound of the horn as he sent his soul into it was the light of grieving candles in a shadowed hollow place it was a halfmoon riding through cold windblown clouds it was torches seen passing far off in a dark wood passing but never coming near to warm with their glow it was a bleak sunrise on a wintry beach the pale haunted light of glowworms in the mists of llychlyn marsh it was all lights that did not warm or comfort that only told a tale of shelter somewhere else for someone else then the sound ended and the images faded galadan lowered the horn there was a dazed expression on his face he said incredulously i heard it how did i hear oweins horn no one answered him no one spoke they looked to the sky overhead and in the moment owein was there and the shadowy kings of the wild hunt and before them all unsheathing a deadly sword with the rest of them rode the child on pale iselen the child that had been finn dan shahar and who now was death they heard owein cry in wild chaotic ecstasy they heard the moaning of the seven kings they saw them weave like smoke across the light of the sun owein hold cried arthur pendragon with all the ringing command his voice could carry but owein circled over his head and laughed you cannot bind me warrior we are free we have the child it is time for the hunt to ride and already the kings were swooping down wildly destructive invulnerable the random thread of chaos in the tapestry already it seemed their swords were shining with blood they would ride forever and kill until there was nothing left to kill but even in that moment kim saw them falter rein in their plunging smoky steeds she heard them lift their ghostly voices in wailing confusion and she saw that the child was not with them in their descent finn seemed to be in pain in distress his pale horse plunging and rearing in the reddening light of the sunset he was shouting something kim couldnt make it out she didnt understand in the temple leila screamed she heard the sound of the horn it exploded in her brain she could hardly form a thought but then she understood and she screamed again in anguish as the connection was made once more suddenly she could see the battle plain she was in the sky over andarien jaelle was on the ridge of land below with the high king guinevere all of them but it was to the sky she looked and she saw the hunt appear owein and the deadly kings and the child who was finn whom she loved she screamed a third time aloud in the temple and at the summit of her mind voice in the sky far to the north finn no come away it is leila do not kill them come away she saw him hesitate and turn to her there was white pain a splintering all through her mind she felt shredded into fragments he looked at her and she could read the distance in his eyes how far away he washow far beyond her reach too far he did not even reply he turned away she heard owein mock the warrior saw the sky kings draw their burning swords there was fire all around her there was blood in the sky on the temple walls finns shadowy white horse bared teeth at her and carried finn away leila tore desperately free of whoever was holding her shalhassan of cathal staggered back he saw her stride stumble almost fall she righted herself reached the altar claimed the axe in the name of the goddess no one of the priestesses cried in horror a hand before her mouth leila did not hear her she was screaming and far away she lifted danas axe which only the high priestess could lift she raised that thing of power high over her head and brought it crashing thundering echoing down upon the altar stone and as she did she cried out again building with the power of the axe the power of dana climbing on top of them as upon a mighty wall to hurl the mind command finn i command you in the name of dana in the name of light come away come to me now in paras derval she dropped to her knees in the temple letting the axe fall in the sky over andarien she watched she had nothing left she was empty a shell if this was not enough it had all been waste all bitterest waste finn turned he pulled his plunging horse fought her around to face leilas disembodied spirit again the horse reared in enraged resistance she was all smoke and fire she wanted blood finn clutched the reins with both hands battling her to a standstill in the air he looked at leila and she saw that he knew her now that he had come back far enough to know so she said softly over the mind link they had shared with no power left in her only sorrow only love oh finn please come away please come back to me she saw his smoky shadowy eyes widen then in a way that she remembered from before from what he once had been and then just before she fainted she thought she heard his voice in her mind saying one thing only but the only thing that mattered her name there wasnt even the tracest flicker in her ring and kim knew that there wouldnt be she was powerless empty of all save pity and grief which didnt count for anything a part of her mind was savagely despairingly aware that it was she who had released the hunt to ride on that night at the edge of pendaran how had she not seen what would come and yet she also knew without oweins intercession by the adein river the lios and the dalrei would all have died she would never have had time to reach the dwarves aileron and the men of brennin fighting alone would have been torn apart prydwen would have returned from cader sedat to find the war lost and rakoth maugrim triumphant owein had saved them then to destroy them now it seemed so went her thoughts in the moment finn pulled his white horse away from the others in the sky and began to guide her south kim put her hands to her mouth she heard jaelle whisper something on a taken breath she couldnt hear what it was she did hear owein cry aloud shouting after finn the sky kings wailed finn was fighting his horse which had reacted to oweins cry the horse was thrashing and bucking in the high reaches of the air lashing out with her hooves but finn held firm rocking on the horses back he sawed at the reins forcing her southward away from the kings from owein from the blood of the coming hunt again jaelle murmured something and there was hearts pain in the sound finn kicked at his balking horse she screamed with defiant rage the wailing of the kings was like the howling of a winter storm they were smoke and mist they had fiery swords they were death in the reddening sky then the wailing changed everything changed kim cried aloud in helpless horror and pity for in the distance west toward the setting sun iselen threw her rider as imraithnimphais had thrown hers but not out of love and finn dan shahar flung free from a great height shadow and smoke no longer becoming a boy again mortal even as he fell regaining his shape recaptured by it crashed headlong to the plain of andarien and lay there very still no one broke this fall kim watched him plummet to the earth and saw him lying there crumpled and she had a vivid aching memory of the winter night by pendaran wood when the wandering fire she carried had woken the wild hunt do not frighten her i am here finn had said to owein who had been looming over kim on his black horse and finn had come forward and had mounted up upon pale white iselen among the kings and had changed had become smoke and shadow himself the child at the head of the hunt no more he was no longer iselens rider in the sky sweeping between the stars he was mortal again and fallen and very probably dead but his fall meant something or it might mean something the seer in kim seized upon an image and she stepped forward to give it voice loren was before her though with the same awareness holding amairgens staff high in the air he looked up at owein and the seven kings the kings were moaning aloud the same words over and over and the sound of their voices whistled like wind over andarien iselens riders lost the wild hunt cried in fear and despair and for all her sorrow kim felt a quickening of hope as loren cast his own voice over the sound of the kings in the air owein he cried the child is lost again you cannot ride you cannot hunt along the reaches of the sky behind owein and his black horse the kings of the wild hunt were wheeling and circling in frenzy but owein held black cargail motionless over lorens head and when he spoke his voice was cold and pitiless it is not so he said we are free we have been summoned to power by power there is none here who can master us we will ride and slake our loss in blood he lifted his sword and its blade was red in the light and he made wild cargail to rear back high above them black as night the wailing of the kings changed from grief to rage they ceased their frightened circling in the sky and drew their own grey horses into place behind cargail and so it was all meaningless kim thought she looked from the hunt away to the twisted body of finn where it lay crumpled on the earth it had not been enough his fall dariens diarmuids kevins death rakoths overthrow none of it had been enough and it was galadan here at the last who would have his long desire white iselen riderless flashed in the sky behind the riders of the hunt eight swords swung free nine horses lashed out with their hooves as the hunt readied itself to ride through sunset into the dark listen cried brendel of the lios alfar and even as he spoke kim heard the sound of singing coming over the stony ground from behind them even before she turned she knew who it had to be for she knew that voice over the ruined plain of andarien covering ground with huge giant strides came ruana of the paraiko to bind the wild hunt as connla had bound them long ago owein slowly lowered his sword behind him the kings fell silent in the sky and in that silence they all heard the words ruana sang as he came near the flame will wake from sleep the kings the horn will call but though they answer from the deep you may never hold in thrall those who ride from oweins keep with a child before them all then he was among them chanting still in the deep tuneless voice he strode to the forefront of the ridge past where loren stood and he stopped looking up at owein and his chanting ceased then in the wide silence ruana cried sky king sheath your sword i put my will upon you and i am one whose will you must obey i am heir to connla who bound you to your sleep by the words you have heard me chanting even now owein stirred he said defiantly we have been summoned we are free and i shall bind you back ruana replied deep and sure connla is dead but the power of his binding lives in me for the paraiko have never yet killed and though we are changed now and forever changed that much of what we were i still command you were only released from your long sleep by the coming of the child the child is lost owein lost as he was lost before when connla first laid you to rest i say it again sheath your swords by the power of connlas spell i put my will upon you for one moment a moment as charged with power as any since the worlds were spun owein was motionless in the air above them then slowly very slowly his hand came down and he laid his sword to rest in the scabbard at his side with a cold sighing sound the seven kings did the same owein looked down upon ruana and he said half demanding half in plea it is not forever and ruana said quietly it cannot be forever my lord owein neither by connlas spell nor by your place in the tapestry the hunt will always be a part of the weavers worldsall of them you are the randomness that makes us free but only in binding you to sleep can we live to sleep only sky king you will ride again you and the seven kings of the hunt and there will be another child before the end of days where we will be we children of the weavers hand i know not but i tell you now and i tell you true all the worlds will be yours again as once they were before the tapestry is done his deep voice carried the cadences of prophecy of truth that had mastered time he said but for now here in this place you are subject to my will because the child is lost again only because of that said owein with a bitterness that cut through the air as keenly as his unsheathed blade might have done only because of that ruana agreed gravely and kim knew then how narrow had been their escape she looked to where finn had fallen and saw that a man had gone over to that place and was kneeling beside the boy she didnt know at first who it was and then she guessed owein spoke again and now the bitterness was gone replaced by a quiet resignation he said do we go to the cave again connlas heir even so ruana replied from the ridge looking up into the sky you are to go there and lay you down upon your stone beds again you and the seven kings and i will follow to that place and weave connlas spell a second time to bind you to your sleep owein lifted his hand for a moment he remained so a grey shadow on a black horse the red jewels in his crown gleaming in the sunset then he bowed to ruana bound to the giants will by what finn had done and lowered his hand and suddenly the wild hunt was flashing away south toward a cave at the edge of pendaran wood near to a tree forked by lightning thousands and thousands of years ago last of them all riderless iselen flew her white tail streaming behind her like a comet visible even after the horses of the kings were lost to sight dazed by the intensity of what had just happened kim saw jaelle going swiftly along the ridge to where finn lay paul schafer said something crisply to aileron and then set out after the high priestess kim turned away from them and looked up a long way up at ruanas face his eyes were as she remembered deeply quietly compassionate he gazed down upon her waiting she said ruana how did you come in time so narrowly in time he shook his head slowly i have been here since the dragon came i have been watching from behindi would not come nearer to war than that but when starkadh fell when the war was over and the wolflord blew the horn i realized what had drawn me here what ruana what drew you here seer what you did in khath meigol changed us forever as i watched my people set out for eridu it came to me that the baelrath is a power of war a summons to battleand that we would not have been undone by it as we had been only to journey east away from war to the cleansing of the raindead necessary as that might be i did not think it was enough kim said nothing there was a tightness in her throat ruana said and so i took it upon myself to come west instead of east to journey to wherever the war might be and so to see if there was a truer part the paraiko should play in what was to come something drove me from within there was anger in me seer and there was hatred of maugrim and neither of those had i ever felt before i know that kim said i grieve for it ruana again he shook his head grieve not the price of our sanctity would have been the wild hunt riding free and the deaths of all living peoples gathered here it was time seer of brennin past tune for the paraiko to be truly numbered among the army of light i am forgiven then she asked in a small voice you were forgiven in the kanior she remembered the ghostly images of kevin and ysanne moving among all the thronging dead of the paraiko honored among them reclaimed with them by the deep spell of ruanas song she nodded i know she said around the two of them there was silence kim looked up at the grave whitehaired giant you will have to go now to follow them to the cave soon he replied but there is something yet to happen here i think and i will stay to see and with his words a dormant awareness came back to life within kimberly as well she looked past ruana and saw galadan on the plain ringed about by a great many men most of whom she knew they had swords drawn and arrows trained on the wolflords heart but not one of them moved or spoke nor did galadan near to the circle arthur stood with guinevere and lancelot off to the east paul schafer for whom they were waiting at the high kings command knelt by the body of finn dan shahar when leila lifted the axe jaelle knew it how could the high priestess not know it was the deepest sacrilege there was and somehow it didnt surprise her at all she heardevery priestess in fionavar heardwhen leila slammed the axe down on the altar stone and ringingly commanded finn to come to her a command sourced in the blood power of danas axe and jaelle had seen the shadowy figure of the boy on his pale horse in the sky begin to ride away and she saw him fall then the lone paraiko came among them and he put the binding of connlas spell upon the hunt and jaelle saw them flash away to the south only when they were gone did she let herself go west to where finn lay she walked at first but then began to run wanting for leilas sake to be in time she felt the circlet that held back her hair slip off she didnt stop to pick it up and as she ran her hair blowing free she was remembering the last time this link had been forged when leila in the temple had heard green ceinwen turn back the hunt by the bloodied banks of the adein jaelle remembered the words she herself had spoken then spoken in the voice of the goddess there is a death in it she had said knowing it was true she came to the place where he lay his father was there already she remembered shahar from when he had been home from war in the months after darien was born while the priestesses of dana privy to the secret had helped vae care for her new child he was sitting on the ground with his sons head in his lap over and over his callused hands were stroking the boys forehead he looked up without speaking at jaelles approach finn lay motionless his eyes closed he was mortal again she saw he looked as he had back in the days of the childrens game the takiena on the green at the end of anvil lane when leila blindfolded had called him to the longest road someone else came jaelle looked over her shoulder and saw that it was pwyll he handed her the silver circlet neither of them spoke they looked down at father and son and then knelt on the stony ground beside the fallen boy he was dying his breath was shallow and difficult and there was blood at the corners of his mouth jaelle lifted an edge of her sleeve and wiped the blood away finn opened his eyes at the touch she saw that he knew her she saw him ask a question without words very carefully speaking as clearly as she could jaelle said the hunt has gone one of the paraiko came and he bound them back to the cave by the spell that laid them there she saw him nod it seemed that he understood he would understand jaelle realized he had been one with the wild hunt but now he was only a boy again with his head in his fathers lap and dying where he lay his eyes were still open though he said so softly she had to bend close to hear what i did was all right then she heard shahar make a small sound deep in his chest through her own tears she said it was more than all right finn you did everything right every single thing from the very beginning she saw him smile there was blood again and once more she wiped it away with the sleeve of her robe he coughed and said she didnt mean to throw me you know it took jaelle a moment to realize that he was talking about his horse she was afraid finn said she wasnt used to flying so far from the others she was only afraid oh child shahar said huskily spare your strength finn reached up for his fathers hand his eyes closed and his breathing slowed jaelles tears followed one another down her cheeks then finn opened his eyes again looking directly at her he whispered will you tell leila i heard her that i was coming jaelle nodded half blind i think she knows but i will tell her finn he smiled at that there was a great deal of pain in his brown eyes but there was also a quiet peace he was silent for a long time having little strength left in him but then he had one more question and the high priestess knew it was the last because he meant it to be dari he asked she found that this time she couldnt even answer her throat had closed completely around this grief it was pwyll who spoke he said with infinite compassion he too did everything right finn everything he is gone but he killed rakoth maugrim before he died finns eyes widened at that for the last time there was joy in them and a grieving pain but at the end there was peace again without border or limitation just before the dark oh little one he said and then he died holding his fathers hand there was a legend that took shape in after days a tale that grew perhaps because so many of those who lived through that time wanted it to be true a tale of how dariens soul which had taken flight some time before his brothers was allowed by intercession to pause in the timelessness between the stars and wait for finn to catch up to him and then the story told of how the two of them passed together over the walls of night that lie all about the living worlds toward the brightness of the weavers halls and dariens soul was in the shape hed had when he was small when he was dari and the eyes of his soul were blue and finns were brown as they went side by side toward the light so the legend went afterward born of sorrow and hearts desire but jaelle the high priestess rose that day from finns side and she saw that the westering sun had carried the afternoon well over toward twilight then pwyll also rose and jaelle looked upon his face and saw power written there so deeply and so clearly that she was afraid and it was as the lord of the summer tree the twiceborn of mórnir that he spoke with all the griefs and joys of this day pwyll said seeming almost to be looking through her there is one thing left to be done and it is mine to do i think he walked past her slowly and she turned and saw by the light of the setting sun that everyone was gathered on the plain about the figure of galadan they were motionless like statues or figures caught in time leaving shahar alone with his son she followed after pwyll carrying her silver circlet in her hand above her head as she walked down to the plain she heard the quick invisible wings of his ravens thought and memory she didnt know what he was about to do but in that moment she knew another thing a truth in the depths of her own heart as she saw the circle of men make way for pwyll to pass within facing the wolflord of the andain standing beside loren with ruana at her other side kim watched paul walk into the circle and she had a sudden curious mental imagegone as soon as it came to her of kevin laine laughing carelessly in convocation hall before anything had happened anything at all it was very quiet in andarien in the red of the setting sun the faces of those assembled glowed with a strange light the breeze was very soft from the west all around them lay the dead in the midst of the living paul schafer faced galadan and he said we meet for the third time as i promised you we would i told you in my own world that the third time would pay for all his voice was level and low but it carried an infinite authority to this hour kim saw paul had brought all of his own driven intensity and added to that now was what he had become in fionavar especially since the war was over because she had been right his was not a power of battle it was something else and it had risen within him now he said wolflord i can see in any darkness you might shape and shatter any blade you could try to throw i think you know that this is true galadan stood quietly attending to him carefully his scarred aristocratic head was high the slash of silver in his black hair gleamed in the waning light oweins horn lay at his feet like some discarded toy he said i have no blades left to throw it might have been different had the dog not saved you on the tree but i have nothing left now twiceborn the long cast is over kim heard and tried not to be moved by the weariness of centuries that lay buried in his voice galadan turned and it was to ruana that he spoke for more years than i can remember he said gravely the paraiko of khath meigol have troubled my dreams in my sleep the shadows of the giants always fell across the image of my desire now i know why it was a deep spell connla wove so long ago that its binding could still hold the hunt today he bowed without any visible irony to ruana who looked back at him unblinking saying nothing waiting once more galadan turned to paul and a second time he repeated it is over i have nothing left if you had hopes of a confrontation now that you have come into your power i am sorry to disappoint you i will be grateful for whatever end you make of me as things have fallen out it might as well have come a very long time ago i might as well have also leaped from the tower it was upon them kim knew she bit her lip as paul said quietly completely in control it need not be over galadan you heard oweins horn nothing truly evil can hear the horn will you not let that truth lead you back there was a murmur of sound quickly stilled galadan had suddenly gone white i heard the horn he admitted as if against his will i know not why how should i come back twiceborn where could i go paul did not speak he only raised one hand and pointed to the southeast there far off on the ridge a god was standing naked and magnificent the rays of the setting sun slanted low across the land and his body glowed red and bronze in that light and there was a shining brightness to the branching tines of the horns upon his head the stag horns of cernan only an act of will kim realized kept galadan steady on his feet when he saw that his father had come there was no color in his face at all paul said absolute master of the moment voice of the god i can grant you the ending you seek and i will if you ask me again but hear me first lord of the andain he paused a moment and then not without gentleness said lisen has been dead this thousand years but only today when her circlet blazed to the undoing of maugrim did her spirit pass to its rest so too has amairgens soul now been released from wandering at sea two sides of the triangle galadan they are gone finally truly gone but you live yet and for all that you have done in bitterness and pride you still heard the sound of light in oweins horn will you not surrender your pain lord of the andain give it over today has marked the very ending of that tale of sorrow will you not let it end you heard the hornthere is a way back for you on this side of night your father has come to be your guide will you not let him take you away and heal you and bring you back in the stillness the clear words seemed to fall like drops of the lifegiving rain paul had bought with his body on the tree one after another gentle as rain drop by shining drop then he was silent having forsworn the vengeance he had claimed so long agoand claimed a second time in the presence of cernan by the summer tree on midsummers eve the sun was very low it hung like a weight in a scale far in the west something moved in galadans face a spasm of ancient unspeakable neverspoken pain his hands came up as if of their own will from his sides and he cried aloud if only she had loved me i might have shone so bright then he covered his face with his fingers and wept for the first and only time in a thousand years of loss he wept for a long time paul did not move or speak but then from beside kim ruana suddenly began deep and low in his chest a slow sad chanting of lament a moment later with a shiver kim heard ratenniel lord of the lios alfar lift his glorious voice in clear harmony delicate as a chime in the evening wind and so the two of them made music in that place for lisen and amairgen for finn and darien for diarmuid dan ailell for all the dead gathered there and all the dead beyond and for the firstfallen tears of the lord of the andain who had served the dark so long in his pride and bitter pain at length galadan looked up the singing stopped his eyes were hollows dark as gereints he faced paul for the last time and he said you would truly do this let me go from here i would said paul and not a person standing there spoke to gainsay his right to do so why because you heard the horn paul hesitated then and because of another thing when you first came to kill me on the summer tree you said something do you remember galadan nodded slowly you said i was almost one of you paul went on quietly with compassion you were wrong wolflord the truth is you were almost one of us but you didnt know it then you had put it too far behind you now you know you have remembered there has been more than enough killing today go home unquiet spirit and find healing then come back among us with the blessing of what you always should have been galadans hands were quiet at his sides again he listened absorbing every word then he nodded his head once very gracefully he bowed to paul as his father once had done and moving slowly he walked from the ring of men they made way for him on either side kim watched him ascend the slope and then walk south and east along the higher ground until he came to where his father stood the evening sun was upon them both by its light she saw cernan open wide his arms and gather his broken wayward child to his breast one moment they stood thus then there seemed to kim to be a sudden flaw of light upon the ridge and they were gone she looked away to the west and saw that shahar only a silhouette now against the light was still sitting on the stony ground with finns head cradled in his lap her heart felt too large for her breast there was so much glory and so much pain all interwoven together and never to be untied she feared it was over though with this there had to have come an ending then she turned back to paul and realized that she was wrong completely wrong she looked at him and she saw where his own gaze fell and so she looked as well at last to where arthur pendragon had been standing quietly all this time guinevere was beside him her beauty the simplicity of it was so great in that moment that kim found it hard to look upon her face next to her but a little way apart and a little way behind lancelot du lac leaned upon his sword bleeding from more wounds than kim could number his mild eyes were clear though and grave and he managed to smile when he saw her looking at him a smile so gentle from one unmatched of any man living or dead or ever to come that kim thought it might break her heart she looked at the three of them standing together in the twilight and half a hundred thoughts went through her mind she turned back to paul and saw that there was now a kind of shining to him in the dark all thoughts went from her nothing had prepared her for this she waited and heard him say as quietly as before arthur the end of war has come and you have not passed from us this place was named camlann and you stand living in our presence still the warrior said nothing the heel of his spear rested on the ground and both of his broad hands were wrapped about its shaft the sun went down in the west the evening star named for lauriel seemed to shine more brightly than it ever had before there was a faint glow yet to the western sky but soon it would be full dark some men had brought torches but they had not lit them yet paul said you told us the pattern warrior how it has always been each and every time you have been summoned arthur it has changed you thought you were to die at cader sedat and you did not then you thought to find your ending in battle with uathach and you did not i think i was supposed to find it there arthur said his first words i think so too paul replied but diarmuid chose otherwise he made it become otherwise we are not slaves to the loom not bound forever to our fate not even you my lord arthur not even you after so long he paused it was utterly silent on the plain it seemed to kim that a wind arose then that appeared to come from all directions or from none she felt in that moment that they stood at the absolute center of things at the axletree of worlds she had a sense of anticipation of a culmination coming that went far beyond words it was deeper than thought a fever in the blood another kind of pulse she was aware of the tacit presence of ysanne within herself then she was aware of something else a new light shining in the darkness oh dana jaelle breathed a prayer no one else spoke in the east a full moon rose over fionavar for the second time on a night that was not a full moon night this time she was not red not a challenge or a summons to war she was silver and glorious as the full moon of the goddess was meant to be bright as a dream of hope and she bathed andarien in a mild and beneficent light paul didnt even look up nor did the warrior their eyes never left the others face and arthur said in that silver light in that silence his voice an instrument of bonedeep selfcondemnation twiceborn how could it ever change i had the children slain and have paid full fullest price paul replied without hesitation in his voice now they suddenly heard thunder look up warrior he cried look up and see the moon of the goddess shining down upon you hear mórnir speak through me feel the ground of camlann beneath your feet arthur look about you listen dont you see it has come after so long you are summoned now to glory not to pain this is the hour of your release thunder was in his voice a glow as of sheet lightning in his face kim felt herself trembling she wrapped her arms about herself the wind was all around them growing and growing even as paul spoke even as the thunder rolled and it seemed to kim looking up that the wind was carrying stars and the dust of stars past her eyes and then pwyll twiceborn who was lord of the summer tree turned away from all of them and he strode a little way to the west facing the distant sea with the bright moon at his back and they heard him cry in a mighty voice liranan sea brother i have called you three times now once from the shore and once from the sea and once in the bay of the anor lisen now in this hour i summon you again far from your waves in the name of mórnir and in the presence of dana whose moon is above us now i bid you send your tides to me send them liranan send the sea that joy may come at last at the end of a tale of sorrow so long told i am sourced in the power of the land brother and mine is the voice of the god i bid you come as he spoke paul stretched forth his hands in a gesture of widest gathering as if he would encompass all of time all the weavers worlds within himself then he fell silent they waited a moment passed and another paul did not move he kept his hands outstretched as the wind swirled all around him strong and wild behind him the full moon shone before him the evening star kim heard the sound of waves and over the barren plain of andarien silver in the light of the moon the waters of the sea began moving in higher and higher they rose though gently guided and controlled pauls head was high his hands were stretched wide and welcoming as he drew the sea so far into the land from linden bay kim blinked there were tears in her eyes and her own hands were trembling again she smelled salt on the evening air saw waves sparkle under the moon far far off she saw a figure shining upon the waves with his hands outstretched wide as pauls were she knew who this had to be wiping away her tears she strained to see him clearly he shimmered in the white moonlight and it seemed to her that all the colors of the rainbow were dancing in the robe the sea god wore on the high ridge northwest of them she saw that shahar still cradled his son but the two of them seemed to kim to be alone on some promontory now on an island rising from the waters of the sea an island such as glastonbury tor had once been rising from the waters that had covered the somerset plain waters over which a barge once had floated bearing three grieving queens and the body of arthur pendragon to avalon and even as she shaped this thought kim saw a boat coming toward them over the waves long and beautiful was that craft with a single white sail filling with the strange wind and in the stern steering it was a figure she knew a figure to whom she had granted under duress his hearts desire the waters had reached them now the world had changed all the laws of the world under a full moon that should never have been riding in the sky the stony plain of andarien lay undersea as far inland as the place where they stood east of the battlefield and the silvered waters of liranan had covered over the dead paul lowered his arms he said nothing at all standing quite motionless the winds grew quiet and borne by those quiet winds flidais of the andain who had been taliesin once in camelot long ago brought his craft up to them and lowered the sail it was very very still then flidais stood up in the stern of his boat and he looked directly at kimberly and into the stillness he said from the darkness of what i have done to you there shall be light do you remember the promise i made you when you offered me the name i remember kim whispered it was very hard to speak she was smiling though through her tears it was coming it had come flidais turned to arthur and bowing low he said humbly with deference my lord i have been sent to bring you home will you come aboard that we may sail by the light of the loom to the weavers halls all around her kim heard men and women weeping quietly for joy arthur stirred there was a glory in his face as understanding finally came to him and then even in the very moment it appeared the moment he was offered release from the cycle of his grief kim saw that shining fade her hands closed at her sides so hard the nails drew blood from her palms arthur turned to guinevere there might have been a thousand words spoken in the silence of their eyes under that moon a tale told over so many times in the chambers of the heart that there were no words left for the telling and especially not now not here with what had come she moved forward with grace with infinite care she lifted up her mouth to his and kissed him full upon the lips in farewell then she stepped back again she did not speak or weep or ask for anything at all in her green eyes was love and only love she had loved two men only in all her days and each of them had loved her and each the other but divided as her love was it had also been something else and was so still a passion sustaining and enduring without end to the worlds end arthur turned away from her so slowly it seemed the weight of time itself lay upon him he looked to flidais with an anguished question in his face the andain wrung his hands together and then drew them helplessly apart i am only allowed you warrior he whispered we have so far to go the waters are so wide arthur closed his eyes must there always be pain kim thought could joy never ever be pure she saw that lancelot was weeping and it was then precisely then that the dimensions of the miracle were made manifest it was then that grace descended for paul schafer spoke again and he said not so it is allowed i am deep enough to let this come to pass arthur opened his eyes and looked incredulous at paul who nodded quietly sure it is allowed he said again so there was joy after all the warrior turned again to look upon his queen the light and sorrow of his days and for the first time in so very long they saw him smile and she too smiled for the first time in so very long and said asking only now now that it was vouchsafed them will you take me with you where you go is there a place for me among the summer stars through her tears kim saw arthur pendragon walk forward then and she saw him take the hand of guinevere in his own and she watched the two of them go aboard that craft floating on the waters that had risen over andarien it was almost too much for her too rich she could scarcely breathe she felt as if her soul were an arrow loosed to fly silver in the moonlight never falling back then there was even more the very last gift the one that sealed and shaped the whole beneath the shining of danas moon she saw arthur and guinevere turn back to look at lancelot and she heard paul say again with so deep a power woven into his voice it is allowed if you will it so all of the price has been paid with a cry of joy wrung from his great heart arthur instantly stretched forth his hand oh lance come he cried oh come for a moment lancelot did not move then something long held back so long denied blazed in his eyes brighter than any star he stepped forward he took arthurs hand and then guineveres and they drew him aboard and so the three of them stood there together the grief of the long tale healed and made whole at last flidais laughed aloud for gladness and swiftly drew upon the line that lifted the white sail there came a wind from the east then just before the boat began to draw away kim saw paul finally move he knelt down beside a grey shape that had materialized at his side for one moment he buried his face deep in the torn fur of the dog that had saved him on the treesaved him that the wheel of time might turn and find this moment waiting in andarien farewell great heart kim heard him say i will never forget it was his own voice this time no thunder in it only a rich sadness and a very great depth of joy which were within her too exactly those two things as cavall leaped in one great bound to land at arthurs feet even as the boat turned to the west and thus did it come to pass what arthur had said in cader sedat to the dog that had been his companion in so many wars that there might come a day when they need not part it had come under the silver shining of the moon that long slender craft caught the rising of the wind and it carried them away arthur and lancelot and guinevere past the promontory it sailed and from that solitary height shahar raised one hand in farewell and all three of them saluted him then it seemed to those that watched from the plain that that ship began to rise into the night not following the curving of the earth but tracking a different path farther and farther it went rising all the while upon waters of a sea that belonged to no world and to all of them for as long as she possibly could kim strained her eyes to make out guineveres fair hairjennifers hairshining in the bright moonlight then that was lost in the far darkness and the last thing they saw was the gleaming of arthurs spear like a new star in the sky part vflowerfire chapter no man living could remember a harvest like the one that came to the high kingdom at the end of that summer in cathal as well the granaries were full and the gardens of larai rigal grew more extravagantly beautifuldrenched in perfume riotous with coloreach passing day on the plain the eltor swifts ran over the rich green grass and the hunting was easy and joyous under the wide sky but nowhere did the grass grow so deep as on ceinwens mound by celidon even in andarien the soil had grown rich againliterally overnight with the receding of the waves that had come to bear the warrior away there was talk of settling there again and in sennett strand in taerlindel of the mariners and in cynan and seresh they spoke of building ships to sail up and down the long coast past the anor lisen and the cliffs of rhudh to sennett and linden bay there was talk of many things as that summer came to an end words woven of peace and a quiet joy through the first weeks after the battle there had been little time to celebrate the army of cathal had ridden north under their supreme lord and shalhassan had taken charge with matt sörenfor the king of the dwarves would not let his people rest until the last of the servants of maugrim were slainof cleaning out the remnants of the urgach and the svart alfar that had fled the bael andarien the dalrei badly ravaged by the wars withdrew to celidon to take council and the lios alfar made their way back to daniloth daniloth but no longer the shadowland two months after the battle that ended the war after the dwarves and the men of cathal had finished their task men as far south as paras derval had seen on a night glittering with stars a glow rise up in the north and they had cried aloud for wonder and joy to see the land of light regain its truest name and it came to pass that in that time with the harvest gathered and stored aileron the high king sent his messengers riding forth all through his land and to daniloth and larai rigal and celidon and over the mountains to banir lok to summon the free peoples of fionavar to a week of celebration in paras derval a celebration to be woven in the name of the peace won at last and to honor the three who remained of loren silvercloaks five strangers and to bid them a last farewell riding south with the dalrei to what was to be his own party dave still had no clear idea of what he was going to do he knewbeyond even his own capacity to feel insecurethat he was welcome and wanted here even loved he also knew how much he loved these people but it wasnt as simple as that nothing ever seemed to be not even now with all that had happened to him the ways he had changed and the things that had made him change the images of his parents and his brother had been drifting through his dreams every night of late he remembered too how thoughts of josef martyniuk had been with him all through the last battle in andarien there were things to be worked out there dave knew and part of what hed learned among the dalrei was how important it was to resolve those tilings but the other thing hed learned here was joy a richness of belonging such as hed never known all of which meant that there was a decision to be made and very soonfor it had been decided that after the celebration week was over jaelle and teyrnon sharing out the powers of dana and mórnir would jointly act to send them home through the crossing if they wanted to go it was beautiful here on the plain riding southwest over the wide grasslands seeing the great swifts flash past in the distance under the high white clouds and the mild endofsummer sun it was too beautiful to be thinking wrestling with the shadows and implications of his dilemma and so he let it slip from him for a time he looked around it seemed that the whole of the third tribe and a great many others of the dalrei were coming south with him at the high kings invitation even gereint was here riding in one of the chariots that shalhassan had left behind on his way south to cathal on either side of dave tore and levon rode easily almost lazily through the afternoon they smiled at him when he caught their eye but neither had said much of anything on this journey unwilling he knew to pressure him in any way but such a realization took him right back to the decision he had to make and he didnt want to deal with that instead he let his mind return to images of the weeks gone by he remembered the feasting and the dancing under the stars and between the fires burning on the plain a dance of the ride of ivor to the adein another of the courage of the dalrei at andarien other dances still intricately woven of individual deeds of glory in the war and more than once the women of the dalrei shaped the deeds of davor of the axe in battle against the dark and more than once afterward all through the mild nights of that summer with rangat an unmarred glory in the north there had been women who came to dave after the fires had died for another sort of dance not liane though ivors daughter had danced for them all between the fires but never with dave in his room at night once he might have regretted that found in it a source of longing or pain but not now not anymore for a great many reasons even in this there had been a joy to be savored amid the healing time of that summer on the plain he had been honored and apprehensive both when tore had come to him a few weeks after the return to celidon to make his request it had taken a long night of rehearsal with levon drilling him over and over and laughingly plying him with sachen in between sessions before dave had felt ready to go stand the next morning with something of a hangover to complicate things before the aven of the dalrei and say what was to be said hed done it though hed found ivor walking amid a number of the chieftains in the camp at celidon levon had told him that the thing was to be done as publicly as possible and so dave had swallowed hard and stepped in front of the aven and had said ivor dan banor i am sent by a rider of honor and worth with a message for you aven tore dan sorcha has named me as his intercedent and bids me tell you in the presence of all those here that the sun rises in your daughters eyes there had been a number of marriages all over fionavar that summer after the war and a great many proposals were done after the old fashion with an intercedentan act of homage in a real sense to diarmuid dan ailell who had revived the tradition by proposing in this way to sharra of cathal a number of marriages and one of them the third tribe celebrated not long after the morning dave had spoken those words for the aven had given his consent with joy and then liane had smiled the secret smile they all knew so well and said quite simply yes of course of course i will marry him i always meant to which was as maddeningly unfair levon commented afterward as anything his sister had ever said tore didnt seem to mind at all hed seemed dazed and incredulous all through the ceremony in which cordeliane dal ivor had become his wife ivor had cried and sorcha too not leith but then no one expected her to it had been a wonderful night and a wonderful summer in almost every way dave had even ridden with the riders on an eltor hunt again levon had tutored him this time in the use of a blade from horseback and one morning at sunrise dave had ridden out with the hunters and had picked an eltor buck from a racing swift and had galloped alongside of it and leapednot trusting himself to throw the bladefrom his horse to the back of the eltor and had plunged the blade into its throat he had rolled and risen up from the grass and saluted levon and the hunt leader and all the others had returned his salute with shouted praise and blades uplifted high a glorious summer among people he loved on the rolling plain that was theirs and now he had a decision to make and he couldnt seem to make it a week later he still hadnt made up his mind in fairness to himself there hadnt been much time for introspection there had been banquets of staggering sumptuousness in the great hall of paras derval there had been music again and of a different sort this time for the lios alfar were among them now and one night ratenniel their lord had lifted his own voice to sing the long tale of the war just past woven into that song had been a great many things shaped equally of beauty and of pain from the very beginning when loren silvercloak had brought five strangers to fionavar from another world ratenniel sang of paul on the summer tree of the battle of wolf and dog the sacrifice of ysanne he sang the red moon of dana and the birth of imraithnimphais dave had looked along the table then to see tabor dan ivor slowly lower his head jennifer in starkadh dariens birth the coming of arthur guinevere the waking of the wild hunt as finn dan shahar took the longest road he sang maidaladan kevin in dun maura red flowers at dawn in the melting snow ivors ride to the adein battle there the lios coming and owein in the sky the soulmonger at sea and the shattering of the cauldron at cader sedat lancelot in the chamber of the dead the paraiko in khath meigol and the last kanior across the room ruana sat by kimberly and listened in an expressionless silence ratenniel went on he encompassed all of it brought it to life again under the stained glass windows of the great hall he sang jennifer and brendel at the anor lisen kimberly with the baelrath at calor diman lancelot battling in the sacred grove and amairgens ghost ship passing sennett strand a thousand years ago and then at the end in shadings of sorrow and joy ratenniel sang to them of the bael andarien itself diarmuid dan ailell battling with uathach killing him at sunset and dying tabor and his shining mount rising to meet the dragon of maugrim battle and death on a wasted plain and then far off in an evil place alone and afraid and it was all there all in the golden voice darien choosing the light and killing rakoth maugrim dave wept his heart ached for so much glory and so much pain as ratenniel came to the end of his song galadan and oweins horn finn dan shahar falling from the sky to let ruana bind the hunt and at the very last arthur and lancelot and guinevere sailing away in gladness on a sea that seemed to rise until it reached the stars the tears of the living flowed freely in paras derval that night as they remembered the dead and the deeds of the dead but it had been a week woven mostly of laughter and joy of sachen and winewhite from south keep red from gwen ystratof clear bluesky days crammed with activity and nights of feasting in the great hall followed for dave by quiet walks beyond the tents of the dalrei outside the walls of the town looking up at the brilliant stars with his two brothers by his side but to settle the matter that was in his mind dave knew he needed to be alone and so finally on the very last day of the festival he slipped away by himself on his favorite black horse he looped oweins horn on its new leather cord about his neck and set out to ride north and west to do one thing and try to resolve another it was a route he had taken before in the cold of the winter snows at evening when kim had woken the hunt with the fire she carried and he had summoned them with the horn it was summer now end of summer shading toward fall the morning was cool and clear birds sang overhead soon the colors of the leaves would begin to change to red and gold and brown he came to a curve in the path and saw the tiny jewellike lake set in the valley below he rode past on the high ridge of land noting the empty cottage far below he remembered the last time they had ridden by this place two boys had come out behind that cottage to look up at them two boys and both of them were dead and together they had acted to let all the peace of this morning come to be he shook his head wondering and continued riding northwest angling across the recently harvested fields between rhoden and north keep there were farmhouses scattered on either side some people saw him passing and waved to him he waved back then around noon he crossed the high road and knew he was very near a few minutes later he came to the edge of pendaran wood and he saw the fork of the tree and then the cave there was an enormous stone in front of it again exactly as there had been before and dave knew who lay asleep in the darkness there he dismounted and he took the horn into his hand and walked a little way into the wood the light was dappled here the leaves rustled above his head he wasnt afraid though not this time not as he had been the night hed met flidais the great wood had slaked its anger now the lios alfar had told them it had to do with lancelot and darien and with the final passing of lisen the blazing of her circlet in starkadh dave didnt really understand such things but one thing he did understand and it had brought him with the horn back to this place he waited with a patience that was another new thing in him he watched the shadows flicker and shift on the forest floor and in the leaves overhead he listened to the sounds of the forest he tried to think to understand himself and his own desires it was hard to concentrate though because he was waiting for someone and then he heard a different sound behind him his heart racing despite all his inward preparation he turned kneeling as he did so with his head lowered you may rise said ceinwen of all men you should know that you may rise he looked up and saw her again in green as she always was with the bow in her hand the bow with which shed almost killed him by a pool in faelinn grove not all need die she had said that night and so hed lived to be given a horn to carry an axe in war to summon the wild hunt to return again to this place the goddess stood before him radiant and glorious though muting the shining of her face that he might look upon her without being stricken blind he rose as she bade him he took a deep breath to slow the beating of his heart he said goddess i have come to return a gift he held out the horn in a hand that he was pleased to see did not tremble it is a thing too powerful for me to hold too deeply powerful i think for any mortal man ceinwen smiled beautiful and terrible i thought you would come she said i waited to see had you not i would have come for you before you went away i gave you more than i meant to give with this horn and then in a gentler tone what you say is not wrong davor of the axe it must be hidden again to wait for a truer finding many years from now many many years we would have died by adein without it dave said quietly does that not make it a true finding she smiled again inscrutable capricious she said you have grown clever since last we met i may be sorry to see you go there was nothing he could say to that he extended the horn a little toward her and she took it from his hand her fingers touched his palm and he did tremble then with awe and memory she laughed deep in her throat dave could feel himself flushing but there was something he had to ask even if she laughed after a moment he said would you be as sorry to see me stay i have been trying for a long time now to decide i think im ready to go home but another part of me despairs at the thought of leaving he spoke as carefully as he could with more dignity than hed thought he possessed she did not laugh the goddess looked upon him and there was a strangeness in her eyes half cold half sorrowing she shook her head dave martyniuk she said you have grown wiser since that night in faelinn grove i had thought you knew the answer to that question without my telling it you cannot stay and you should have known you cannot something jogged in daves mind an image another memory just before she spoke again in the half second before she told him why he understood what did i say to you that night by the pool she asked her voice cool and soft like woven silk he knew it had been hidden somewhere in his mind all along he supposed no man of fionavar may see ceinwen hunt that was what shed said he had seen her hunt though he had seen her kill a stag by the moonlit pool and had seen the stag rise from its own death and bow its head to the huntress and move away into the trees no man of fionavar dave knew the answer to his dilemma now there was had only ever been one answer he was going home the goddess willed it so only by leaving fionavar could be preserve his life only by leaving could he allow her not to kill him for what he had seen within his heart he felt one stern pang of grief and then it passed away leaving behind a sorrow he would always carry but leaving also a deep certitude that this was how it was because it was the only way it could ever have been had he not been from another world ceinwen could not have let him live she could never have given him the horn in her own way dave saw in a flash of illumination the goddess too was trapped by her nature by what she had decreed and so he would go there was nothing left to decide it had been decided long ago and that truth had been within him all the time he drew another breath deep and slow it was very quiet in the woods no birds were singing now he remembered something else then and he said it i swore to you that night that first time that i would pay whatever price was necessary if you will see it is as such then perhaps my leaving may be that price again she smiled and this time it was kind i will see it as such the goddess said there will be no other price exacted remember me there was a shining in her face he opened his mouth but found he could not speak it had come home to him with his words and hers he was leaving it would all be put behind him now it had to be memory would be all he had to carry back with him and forward through his days for the last time he knelt before ceinwen of the bow she was motionless as a statue looking down upon him he rose up and turned to go from among the shadows and dappled light between the trees hold the goddess said he turned back afraid not knowing what now would be asked of him she gazed at him in silence for a long time before she spoke tell me dave martyniuk davor of the axe if you were allowed to name a son in fionavar a child of the andain what name would your son carry into time she was so bright and now there were tears in his eyes making her image shimmer and blur before him and there was something shining like the moon in his heart he remembered a night on a mound by celidon south of the adein river under the stars of spring returned he had lain down with a goddess on the new green grass he understood and in that moment just before he spoke giving voice to the brightness within him something flowered in his mind more fiercely than the moon in his heart or even the shining of ceinwens face he understood and there at the edge of pendaran wood dave finally came to terms with himself with what he once had been in all his bitterness and with what he had now become goddess he said over the tightness in his throat if such a child were born and mine to name i would call him kevin for my friend for the last time she smiled at him it shall be so ceinwen said there was a dazzle of light and then he was alone he turned and went back to his horse and mounted up for the ride back back to paras derval and then a long long way beyond to home paul spent the days and nights of that last week saying his own goodbyes unlike dave or even kim he seemed to have formed no really deep attachments here in fionavar it was partly due to his own nature to what had driven him to cross in the first place but more profoundly it was inherent in what had happened to him on the summer tree marking him as one apart one who could speak with gods and have them bow to him even here at the end after the war was over his remained a solitary path on the other hand there were people he cared about and would miss he tried to make a point of spending a little time with each of them in those last days one morning he walked alone to a shop he knew at the end of anvil lane near to a green where he could see that the children of paras derval were playing again though not the takiena he remembered the shop doorway very well though his images were of winter and night the first time jennifer had made him bring her here the night darien was born and then another night after kim had sent them back to fionavar from stonehenge he had walked coatless but not cold in the winter winds from the heat of the black boar where a woman had died to save his life and his steps had led him here to see the door swinging open and snow piling in the aisles of the shop and an empty cradle rocking in a cold room upstairs he could still reach back to the terror hed felt in that moment but now it was summer and the terror was gone destroyed in the end by the child whod been born in this house whod lain in that cradle paul entered the shop it was very crowded for this was a time of festival and paras derval was thronged with people vae recognized him right away though and then shahar did as well they left two clerks to deal with the people buying their woolen goods and led paul up the stairs there was very little really that he could say to them the marks of grief even with the months that had passed were still etched into both of them shahar was mourning for finn who had died in his arms but vae paul knew was grieving for both her sons for dari too the blueeyed child shed raised and loved from the moment of his birth he wondered how jennifer had known so well whom to ask to raise her child and teach him love aileron had offered shahar a number of posts and honors within the palace but the quiet artisan had chosen to return to his shop and his craft paul looked at the two of them and wondered if they were young enough to have another child and if they could bear to do so after what had happened he hoped so he told them he was leaving and that hed come to say goodbye they made some small conversation ate some pastry vae had made but then one of the clerks called upstairs with a question about pricing a bale of cloth and shahar had to go down paul and vae followed him in the shop she gave him awkwardly a scarf for the coming fall he realized then that he had no idea what season it was back home he took the scarf and kissed her on the cheek and then he left the next day he went riding south and west with the new duke of seresh niavin had died at the hands of a mounted urgach in andarien the new duke riding with paul looked exactly as he always had big and capable brownhaired with the hook of his broken nose prominent in a guileless face as much as anything else that had happened since the war paul was pleased by what aileron had done in naming coll to rank it was a quiet ride coll had always been taciturn by nature it had been erron and carde or boisterous blustering tegid who had drawn out the laughter hidden in his nature those three and diarmuid who had taken a fatherless boy from taerlindel and made him his righthand man for part of the way their road carried them past towns they had galloped furiously through so long ago with diar on a clandestine journey to cross saeren into cathal when the road forked toward south keep they continued west instead by unspoken agreement and early in the afternoon they came to a vantage point from where they could look into the distance at walled seresh and the sea beyond they stopped there looking down do you still hate him paul asked the first words spoken in a long time he knew coll would understand what he meant i would have him cursed in the name of all the gods and goddesses there are he had said to paul very late one night long ago in a dark corridor of the palace and had named aileron which was treason then now the big man was slowly shaking his head i understand him better and i can see how much he has suffered he hesitated then said very softly but i will miss his brother all the rest of my days paul understood he felt the same way about kevin exactly the same way neither of them said anything else paul looked off to the west to where the sea sparkled in the bright sun there were stars beneath the waves he had seen them in his heart he bade farewell to liranan the god who had called him brother coll glanced over at him paul nodded and the two of them turned and rode back to paras derval the next evening after the banquet in the hallcathalian food that time prepared by shalhassans own master of the kitchenhe found himself in the black boar with dave and coll and all the men of south keep those who had sailed prydwen to cader sedat they drank a great deal and the owner of the tavern refused to let any of diarmuids men pay for their ale tegid of rhoden not one to let such largess slip past him drained ten huge tankards to start the proceedings and then gathered speed as the night progressed paul got a little drunk himself which was unusual and perhaps as a result his memories refused to go away all night long he kept hearing rachels song in his mind amid the laughter and the embraces of farewell the next afternoon the last but one he spent in the mages quarters in the town dave was with the dalrei but kim had come with him this time and the two of them spent a few hours with loren and matt and teyrnon and barak sitting in the garden behind the house loren silvercloak no longer a mage now dwelt in banir lok as principal adviser to the king of dwarves teyrnon and barak were visibly pleased to have the other two staying with them if only for a little while teyrnon bustled happily about in the sunshine making sure everyones glass was brimming tell me said barak a little slyly to loren and matt do you think the two of you might be able to handle a pupil for a few months next year or will you have forgotten everything you know matt glanced at him quickly have you a disciple already good very good we need at least three or four more we teyrnon teased matt scowled habits die hard some i hope will never die they need never die teyrnon said soberly you two will always be part of the council of the mages who is our new disciple loren asked do we know him for reply teyrnon looked up at the secondfloor window overlooking the garden boy he shouted trying to sound severe i hope you are studying and not listening to the gossip down here a moment later a head of brown unruly hair appeared at the open window of course im studying said tabor but honestly none of this is very difficult matt grunted in mock disapproval loren struggling to achieve a frown growled fiercely teyrnon give him the book of abhar and then well see whether or not he finds studying difficult paul grinned and heard kim laugh with delight to see who was smiling down on them tabor she exclaimed when did this happen two days ago the boy replied my father gave his consent after gereint asked me to come back and teach him some new things next year paul exchanged a glance with loren there was a genuine easing in this an access to joy the boy was young it seemed he would recover more than that paul had an intuitive sense of the rightness even the necessity of tabors new path what horse on the plain however swift could ever suffice now for one who had ridden a creature of dana across the sky later that afternoon walking back to the palace with kim paul learned that she too would be going home they still didnt know about dave on the next morning the last he went back to the summer tree it was the first time hed been there alone since the three nights he had hung upon it as an offering to the god seeking rain he left his horse at the edge of mórnirwood not far though this he didnt know from the place of aideens grave where matt had taken jennifer early one morning in kevins spring he walked the remembered path through the trees seeing the morning sunlight begin to grow dim and increasingly aware with every step he took of something else since the last battle in andarienwhen he had released galadan from the vengeance hed sworn and channeled his power for healing instead to bring the rising waters that ended the cycle of arthurs griefsince that evening paul had not sought the presence of the god within himself in a way hed been avoiding it but now it was there again and as he came to the place where the trees of the godwood formed their double corridor leading him inexorably back into the glade of the tree paul understood that mórnir would always be within him he would always be pwyll twiceborn lord of the summer tree wherever he went he had been sent back the reality of that was a part of him and would be until he died again and thinking so he came into the glade and saw the tree there was light here for the sky showed above the clearing mild and blue with scattered billowy clouds he remembered the white burning of the sun in a blank heaven he looked at the trunk and the branches they were as old as this first world he knew and looking up within the thick green leaves he saw without surprise that the ravens were there staring back at him with bright yellow eyes it was very still no thunder only deep within his pulse that constant awareness of the god it was not a thing paul realized then from which he could ever truly hide even if he wanted to which was what hed been trying to do through the sweet days of this summer he could not unsay what he had become it was not a thing that came and then went he would have to accept that he was marked and set apart in a way he always had been selfcontained and solitary too much so it was why rachel had been leaving him the night she died on the highway in the rain he was a power brother to gods it was so and would always be so he thought of cernan and galadan wondering where they were both of them had bowed to him no one did so now nor did mórnir manifest himself any more strongly than through the beating of his pulse the tree seemed to be brooding sunk deep into the earth into the web of its years the ravens watched him silently he could make them speak he knew how to do that now he could even cause the leaves of the summer tree to rustle as in a storm wind and in time if he tried hard enough he could draw the thunder of the god he was lord of this tree this was the place of his power he did none of these things he had come for no such reason only to see the place for a last time and to acknowledge within himself what had indeed been confirmed in silence he stepped forward and laid one hand upon the trunk of the summer tree he felt it as an extension of himself he drew his hand away and turned and left the glade overhead he heard the ravens flying he knew they would be back and after that there was only the last farewell hed been delaying it in part because even now he did not expect it to be an easy exchange on the other hand the two of them for all the brittleness had shared a great deal since first shed taken him down from the tree and drawn blood from his face in the temple with the nails of her hand so he returned to his horse and rode back to paras derval and then east through the crowded town to the sanctuary to say goodbye to jaelle he tugged on the bell pull by the arched entranceway chimes rang within the temple a moment later the doors were opened and a greyrobed priestess looked out blinking in the brightness then she recognized him and smiled this was one of the new things in brennin as potent a symbol of regained harmony in its own way as would be the joint action of jaelle and teyrnon this evening sending them home hello shiel he said remembering her from the night hed come after dariens birth to seek aid they had barred his way then demanding blood not now shiel flushed at being recognized she gestured for him to enter i know you have given blood she said almost apologetically ill do so again if you like he said mildly she shook her head vigorously and sent an acolyte scurrying down the curved corridors in search of the high priestess waiting patiently paul looked beyond shiel to his left he could see the domed chamber andstrategically placed to be visiblethe altar stone and the axe the acolyte came back and with her was jaelle he had thought he might be kept waiting or sent for but she so seldom did what he expected pwyll she said i wondered if you would come her voice was cool will you take a glass of wine he nodded and followed her back along the hallway to a room that he remembered she dismissed the acolyte and closed the door she went to a sideboard and poured wine for both of them her motions brisk and impersonal she gave him a glass and sank down into a pile of cushions on the floor he took the chair beside the door he looked at her an image of crimson and white the fires of dana and the whiteness of the full moon there was a silver circlet holding back her hair he remembered picking it up on the plain of andarien he remembered her running to where finn lay this evening then she asked sipping her wine if you will he said is there a difficulty because if there no no she said quickly i was only asking we will do it at moonrise there was a little silence broken by pauls quiet laughter we really are terrible arent we he said shaking his head ruefully we never could manage a civil exchange she considered that not smiling though his tone had invited it that night by the anor she said until i said the wrong thing you didnt he murmured i was just sensitive about power and control you found a nerve were trained to do that she smiled though and he realized she was mocking herself a little i did my share of goading paul admitted one of the reasons i came was to tell you that a lot of it was reflex my own defenses i wanted to say goodbye and to tell you that i have a great deal of respect for you it was difficult choosing words she said nothing looking back at him her green eyes clear and bright well he thought hed said it what hed come to say he finished his wine and rose to his feet she did the same i should go he said wanting to be elsewhere before one of them said something that was wounding and so spoiled even this goodbye ill see you this evening i guess he turned to the door paul she said wait not pwyll paul something stirred like a wind within him he turned again she had not moved her hands were crossed in front of her chest as if she were suddenly cold in the midst of summer are you really going to leave me jaelle asked in a voice so strained he needed a second to be sure of what hed heard and then he was sure and in that instant the world rocked and shifted within him and around him and everything changed something burst in his chest like a dam breaking a dam that had held back need for so long that had denied the truth of his heart even to this moment oh my love he said there seemed to be so much light in the room he took one step another then she was within the circle of his arms and the impossible flame of her hair was about them both he lowered his mouth and found her own turned up to his kiss and in that moment he was clear at last it was all clear he was in the clear and running like his running pulsebeat the clear hammer of his heart he was translucent not lord of the summer tree then but only a mortal man long denied long denying himself touching and touched by love she was fire and water to his hands she was everything he had ever desired her fingers were behind his head laced through his hair drawing him down to her lips and she whispered his name over and over and over while she wept and so they came together then at the last the children of the goddess and the god they subsided among the scattered cushions and she laid her head against his chest and for a long time they were silent as he ran his fingers ceaselessly through the red fall of her hair and brushed her tears away at length she moved so that she lay with her head in his lap looking up at him she smiled a different kind of smile from any he had seen before you would really have gone she said not a question he nodded still half in a daze still trembling and incredulous at what had happened to him i would have he confessed i was too afraid she reached up and touched his cheek afraid of this after all you have done he nodded again of this perhaps more than anything when he asked when did you her eyes turned grave i fell in love with you on the beach by taerlindel when you stood in the waves speaking to liranan but i fought it of course for many reasons you will know them it didnt come home to me until you were walking back from finn to face galadan he closed his eyes opened them felt sorrow come over to shadow joy can you do this he said how may it be allowed you are what you are she smiled again and this smile he knew it was the one he imagined on the face of dana herself inward and inscrutable she said i will die to have you but i do not think it need happen that way neatly she rose to her feet he too stood up and saw her go to the door and open it she murmured something to the acolyte in the corridor and then turned back to him a light dancing in her eyes they waited not for long the door opened again and leila came in clad in white she looked from one of them to the other and then laughed aloud oh good she said i thought this might happen paul felt himself flushing then he caught jaelles glance and both of them burst out laughing can you see why shell be high priestess now jaelle asked smiling then more soberly added from the moment she lifted the axe and survived leila was marked by the goddess to the white of the high priestess dana moves in ways no mortal can understand nor even the others among the gods i am high priestess in name only now after i sent you through the crossing i was to relinquish my place to leila paul nodded he could see a pattern shaping here only a glimmering of it but it seemed to him that the warp and weft of this followed back to their source would reach dun maura and a sacrifice made on the eve of maidaladan and thinking of that he found that there were tears in his own eyes he had to wipe them away he who had never been able to weep he said kim is going home or i would never say this but i think i know a cottage by a lake halfway between the temple and the tree where i would like to live if it pleases you it pleases me jaelle said quietly more than i can tell you ysannes cottage will bring my life full circle and lay a grief to rest i guess im staying then he said reaching for her hand i guess im staying after all she was learning something kim realized learning it the hardest way discovering that the only thing harder for her to deal with than power was its passing away the baelrath was gone she had surrendered it but before that it had abandoned her not since calor diman and her refusal there had the warstone so much as flickered on her hand so late last night quietly with no one else in the room no one else to know she had given it to aileron and he as quietly had sent for jaelle and entrusted the stone to the custody of the priestesses of dana which was right kim knew shed thought at first that he would give it to the mages but the wild power of the baelrath was closer far to dana than it was to the skylore amairgen had learned it was a measure of ailerons deepening wisdom one of the marks of the changing nature of things that the high king would surrender a thing of so much power to the high priestess and that she would agree to guard it in his name and thus had the warstone passed from her which left kimberly on this last afternoon walking with her memories amid the strand of trees west of ysannes cottage dealing with loss and sorrow it should not be so she told herself sternly she was going home and she wanted to go home she wanted her family very badly more than that even she knew it was right for her to be crossing back she had dreamt it and so had ysanne in those first days it is in my heart as well that there may be need of a dreamer in your world too the old seer had said and kim knew it was still true she had seen it herself so need and rightness had come together with her own desire to draw her back this should have made things easy and clear but it was not so how in truth could it ever be when she was leaving so much behind and all her thoughts and feelings seemed to be complicated made even more blurred and difficult by the hollow of absence within her when she looked at the finger where the warstone had been for so long she shook her head trying to pull herself out of this mood she had so many blessings to count so many riches the first running deeper than anything else was the fact of peace and the unravellers passing from the worlds at the hands of the child whose name she had dreamt before hed even been born she walked through the green woods in sunlight thinking of darien and then of his mother and arthur and lancelot whose grief had come to an end another blessing another place where joy might flower in the heart and for herself she was still a seer and she still carried and always would a second soul within her as a gift beyond words or measurement she still wore the vellin bracelet on her wristmatt had refused absolutely to take it back it would serve no real purpose in her world she knew save for memorywhich in its own way was as good a purpose as any deep in the woods alone reaching painfully toward an inner peace kim stopped and stood in silence for a time listening to the birds overhead and the sighing of the breeze through the leaves it was so quiet here so beautiful she wanted to hold this to herself forever thinking so she saw a flash of color on the ground off to her right and realized even before she moved that she was being given a final gift she walked over following as it happened the steps that finn and darien had taken on their last walk together in the depths of winter then she knelt as they had knelt beside the bannion growing there bluegreen flower with red at its center like a drop of blood at the heart they had left it that day gathering other flowers to take back to vae but not this one and so it had remained for kim to take it for herself tears welling at the richness of the memory it stirred her first walk in this wood with ysanne looking for this flower then a night by the lake under stars when eilathen summoned by flowerfire had spun the tapestry for her the bannion was beautiful seacolored around the brilliant red she plucked it carefully and placed it in her white hair she thought of eilathen of the bluegreen glitter of his naked power he too was lost to her even if she had wanted to summon him if only to bid farewell be free of flowerfire now and evermore ysanne had said at the end releasing him from guardianship of the red warstone the bannion was beautiful but powerless it seemed to be a symbol of what had passed from her what she could no longer do magic had been given to her that starry night by this lake and it had rested in her for a tune and had gone it would be better for her in every way to be in her own world she thought to be removed from the sharpness of these images she rose and started back thinking of loren who had to be dealing with the same withdrawal just as she realized suddenly matt had dealt with it for all the years hed spent in paras derval fighting the pull of calor diman the two of them had come full circle together she thought there was a pattern in that more beautiful and more terrible than any mortal weaving could ever be she came out from the trees and walked down to the lake it was slightly choppy in the summer breeze there was the hint of a chill overture to the coming of fall kim stepped out onto the flat surface of the rock that jutted out over the water just as she had done before with ysanne when the seer had summoned the water spirit under the stars eilathen was down there she knew far down among his twining corridors of seastone and seaweed amid the deep silence of his home inaccessible lost to her she sat on the stone and wrapped her arms about her drawnup knees trying to number blessings to shape sadness into joy for a long time she sat there looking out over the waters of the lake it had to be late afternoon she knew she should be starting back it was so hard to leave though rising up and walking from this place would be an act as lonely and as final as any shed ever done so she lingered and in time there was a footfall on the rock behind her and then someone crouched down by her side i saw your horse by the cottage dave said am i intruding she smiled up at him and shook her head im just saying my goodbyes before this evening so was i he said gathering and dispersing pebbles youre coming home too i just decided he said quietly there was a calmness an assurance in his voice shed not heard before of all of them kim realized dave had changed the most here she and paul and jennifer seemed to have really just gone further into what theyd already been before they came and kevin had remained exactly what he always was with his laughter and his sadness and the sweetness of his soul but this man crouching beside her burned dark by the summer sun of the plain was a very far cry from the one shed met that first evening in convocation hall when shed invited him to come sit with them and hear lorenzo marcus speak she managed another smile im glad youre coming back she said he nodded quietly selfpossessed looking at her in a calm silence for a moment then his eyes flickered with a certain amusement that was also new tell me he said what are you doing on friday night a little breathless laugh escaped her oh dave kim said i dont even know when friday night is he laughed too then the laughter passed leaving an easy smile he stood up smoothly and held out a hand to help her up saturday then he asked his eyes holding hers and bursting within her then like another kind of flowerfire kim had a sudden feeling a flashing certainty that everything was going to be all right after all it was going to be much more than all right she gave him both her hands and let him help her rise here ends the darkest road and with it the fionavar tapestry
