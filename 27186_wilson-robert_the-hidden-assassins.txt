think i can the city of londonthursday rd march he stood across the street from the entrance to the underground car park his face was indiscernible beyond the greasy fake furlined rim of the green parkas hood he walked backwards and forwards hands shoved deep down into his pockets one of his trainers was coming apart and the lace of the other dragged and flapped about the sodden frayed bottom of his faded jeans which seemed to suck on the wet pavement he was muttering he could have been any one of the hundreds of unseen people drawn to the city to live at ankle height in underground passages to scuff around on cardboard sheets in shop doorways to drift like lost souls in the limbo of purgatory amongst the living and the visible with their real lives and jobs and credit on their cards and futures in every conceivable commodity including time except that he was being seen as we are all being seen as we have all become walkerson with bit parts in the endlessly tedious movie of everyday life often in the early mornings he was the star of this grainy blackandwhite documentary with barely an extra in sight and only the sporty traffic of the early traders and far east fund managers providing any action later as the sandwich shops opened and the streets filled with bankers brokers and analysts his role reverted to local colour and he would often be lost in the date or the flickering numbers of time running past like all cctv actors his talent was completely missable his reality tv potential would remain undiscovered unless for some reason it was perceived that his part was crucial and the editor of everyday life suddenly realized that he had occupied the moment when the little girl was last seen or the young lad was led away or as so often happens in the movies briefcases were exchanged there was none of that excitement here the solitary male or female under the hood not even that was clear moved in the tide of extras sometimes with them sometimes against he was extra to the extras and worse than superfluous he was getting in the way he did this for hour after hour week after week month afterhe was only there for a month for four weeks he muttered and shuffled across the cracks in the pavement opposite the underground car park and then he was gone reality tv rolled on without him without ever realizing that a star of the silent screen had been in its eye for just over hours had there been a soundtrack it would not have helped even if a mike had been placed within the horrible greasy hood of the parka it would have clarified nothing all that would have registered was the mutterings of a marginalized moron telling himself the colour model and registration number of apparently random cars and the time they passed his patch of pavement it was surely the obsessive work of a lunatic what sort of sophisticated surveillance equipment would have been able to pick up that the eyes deep inside the darkness of the hood were only choosing cars that went into the underground car park of the building across the street and even if there was equipment that could have made that connection would it also have been able to discover that the stream of uninteresting data was being recorded on to the hard disk of a palmsized dictaphone in the inside pocket of the parka only then would the significance of this superfluous human being have been realized and the editor of everyday life if he was being attentive that morning might have sat up in his chair and thought here we have a star in the making sevillemonday th june hrs dead bodies are never pretty even the most talented undertaker with a genius for maquillage cannot bring the animation of life back to a corpse but some dead bodies are uglier than others they have been taken over by another life form bacteria have turned their juices and excretions into noxious gas which slithers along the bodys cavities and under the skin until its drum tight over the corruption within the stench is so powerful it enters the central nervous system of the living and their revulsion reaches beyond the perimeter of their being they become edgy its best not to stand too close to people around a bloater normally inspector jefe javier falcon had a mantra which he played in the back of his mind when confronted by this sort of corpse he could stomach all manner of violence done to bodiesgunshot craters knife gashes bludgeon dents strangulation bruises poisoned pallorbut this transformation by corruption the bloat and stink had recently begun to disturb him he thought it might just be the psychology of decadence the mind troubled by the slide to the only possible end of age except that this wasnt the ordinary decay of death it was to do with the corruption of the bodythe heats rapid transformation of a slim girl into a stout middleaged matron or as in the case of this body that they were excavating from the rubbish of the landfill site beyond the outskirts of the city the metamorphosis of an ordinary man to the taut girth of a sumo wrestler the body had stiffened with rigor mortis and had come to rest in the most degrading position worse than a defeated sumo wrestler tipped from the ring to land head first in the front row of the baying crowd his modesty protected by the thick strap of his mawashi this man was naked had he been clothed he might have been kneeling as a muslim supplicant his head even pointed east but he wasnt and so he looked like someone preparing himself for bestial violation his face pressed into the bed of decay underneath him as if unable to bear the shame of this ultimate defilement as he took in the scene falcon realized that he wasnt playing his usual mantra and that his mind was occupied by what had happened to him as hed taken the call alerting him to the discovery of the body to escape the noise in the cafe where hed been drinking his cafe solo hed backed out through the door and collided with a woman theyd said perdon exchanged a startled look and then been transfixed the woman was consuelo jimenez in the four years since their affair falcon had only had a glimpse of her four or five times in crowded streets or shops and now hed bumped into her they said nothing she didnt go into the cafe after all but disappeared quickly back into the stream of shoppers she had however left her imprint on him and the closed shrine in his mind devoted to her had been reopened earlier the medico forense had stepped carefully through the rubbish to confirm that the man was dead now the forensics were concluding their work bagging anything of interest and removing it from the scene the medico forense still masked up and dressed in a white boiler suit paid his second visit to the victim his eyes searched and narrowed at what they found he made notes and walked over to where falcon was standing with the duty judge juez juan romero i cant see any obvious cause of death he said he didnt die from having his hands cut off that was done afterwards his wrists have been very tightly tourniqueted there are no contusions around the neck and no bullet holes or knife wounds hes been scalped and i cant see any catastrophic damage to the skull he might have been poisoned but i cant tell from his face which has been burnt off with acid time of death looks to be around fortyeight hours ago juez romeros dark brown eyes blinked over his face mask at each devastating revelation he hadnt handled a murder investigation for more than two years and he wasnt used to this level of brutality in the few murders that had come his way they didnt want him recognized did they said falcon any distinguishing marks on the rest of the body let me get him back to the lab and cleaned up hes covered in filth what about other body damage asked falcon he must have arrived in the back of a refuse truck to end up here there should be some marks not that i can see there might be abrasions under the filth and ill pick up any fractures and ruptured organs back at the forensic institute once ive opened him up falcon nodded juez romero signed off the levantamiento del cadaver and the paramedics moved in and thought about how they were going to manipulate a stiffened corpse in this position into a body bag and on to the stretcher farce crept into the tragedy of the scene they wanted to cause as little disturbance as possible to the bodys noxious gases in the end they opened up the body bag on the stretcher and lifted him still prostrate and placed him on top they tucked his wrist stumps and feet into the bag and zipped it up over his raised buttocks they carried the tented structure to the ambulance watched by a gang of municipal workers whod gathered to see the last moments of the drama they all laughed and turned away as one of their number said something about taking it up the arse for eternity tragedy farce and now vulgarity thought falcon the forensics completed their search of the area immediately around the body and brought their bagged exhibits over to falcon weve got some addresses on envelopes found close to the body said felipe three have got the same street names it should help you to find where he was dumped we reckon thats how he ended up in that body position from lying foetally in the bottom of a bin were also pretty sure he was wrapped in this said jorge holding up a large plastic bag stuffed with a grimy white sheet theres traces of blood from his severed hands well match it up later he was naked when i first saw him said falcon there was some loose stitching which we assume got ripped open in the refuse truck said jorge the sheet was snagged on one of the stumps of his wrists the medico forense said the wrists were well tourniqueted and the hands removed after death they were neatly severed too said jorge no hack jobsurgical precision any decent butcher could have done it said felipe but the face burnt off with acid and scalpedwhat do you make of that inspector jefe there must have been something special about him to go to that trouble said falcon whats in the bin liner some gardening detritus said jorge we think it had been dumped in the bin to cover the body were going to do a wider search of the area now said felipe perez spoke to the guy operating the digger who found the body and there was some talk of a black plastic sheet they might have done their postmortem surgery on it sewed him up in the shroud wrapped him in the plastic and then dumped him and you know how much we love black plastic for prints said jorge falcon noted the addresses on the envelopes and they split up he went back to his car stripping off his face mask his olfactory organ hadnt tired sufficiently for the stink of urban waste not to lodge itself in his throat the insistent grinding of the diggers drowned out the cawing of the scavenging birds wheeling darkly against the white sky this was a sad place even for an insentient corpse to end up subinspector emilio perez was sitting on the back of a patrol car chatting to another member of the homicide squad the exnun cristina ferrera perez who was well built with the dark good looks of a s matinee idol seemed to be of a different species to the small blonde and rather plain young woman whod joined the homicide squad from cadiz four years ago but whereas perez had a tendency to be bovine in both demeanour and mentality ferrera was quick intuitive and unrelenting falcon gave them the addresses from the envelopes listing the questions he wanted asked and ferrera repeated them back before he could finish they sewed him into a shroud he said to cristina ferrera as she went for the car they carefully removed his hands burnt his face off scalped him but sewed him into a shroud i suppose they think theyve shown him some sort of respect said ferrera like they do at sea or for burial in mass graves after a disaster respect said falcon right after theyve shown him the ultimate disrespect by taking his life and his identity theres something ritualistic and ruthless about this dont you think perhaps they were religious said ferrera raising an ironic eyebrow you know a lot of terrible things have been done in gods name inspector jefe falcon drove back into the centre of seville in strange yellowing light as a huge storm cloud which had been gathering over the sierra de aracena began to encroach on the city from the northwest the radio told him that there would be an evening of heavy rain it was probably going to be the last rain before the long hot summer at first he thought that it might be the physical and mental jolt hed had from colliding with consuelo that morning which was making him feel anxious or was it the change in the atmospheric pressure or some residual edginess left from seeing the bloated corpse on the dump as he sat at the traffic lights he realized that it ran deeper than all that his instinct was telling him that this was the end of an old order and the ominous start of something new the unidentifiable corpse was like a neurosis an ugly protrusion prodding the consciousness of the city from a greater horror underneath it was the sense of that greater horror with its potential to turn minds move spirits and change lives that he was finding so disturbing by the time he arrived back at the jefatura after a series of meetings with judges in the edificio de los juzgados it was seven oclock and evening seemed to have come early the smell of rain was as heavy as metal in the ionized air the thunder still seemed to be a long way off but the sky was darkening to a premature night and flashes of lightning startled like death just missed perez and ferrera were waiting for him in his office their eyes followed him as he went to the window and the first heavy drops of rain rapped against the glass contentment was a strange human state he thought as a light steam rose from the car park just at the moment life seemed boring and the desire for change emerged like a brilliant idea along came a new sinister vitality and the mind was suddenly scrambling back to what appeared to be prelapsarian bliss what have you got he asked moving along the window to his desk and collapsing in the chair you didnt give us a time of death said ferrera sorry fortyeight hours was the estimate we found the bins where the envelopes were dumped theyre in the old city centre on the corner of a culdesac and calle boteros between the plaza de la alfalfa and the plaza cristo de burgos when do they empty those bins every night between eleven and midnight said perez so if as the medico forense says he died some time in the evening of saturday rd june said ferrera they probably wouldnt have been able to dump the body until three in the morning on sunday where are those bins now weve had them sent down to forensics to test for blood traces but we might be out of luck there said perez felipe and jorge have found some black plastic sheeting which they think was wrapped around the body did any of the people you spoke to at the addresses on the envelopes remember seeing any black plastic sheeting in the bottom of one of the bins we didnt know about the black plastic sheeting when we interviewed them of course you didnt said falcon his brain not concentrated on the details still drifting about in his earlier unease why do you think the body was dumped at three in the morning saturday night near the alfalfayou know what its like around thereall the kids in the bars and out on the streets why choose those bins if its so busy maybe they know those bins said perez they knew that they could park down a dark quiet culdesac and what the collection times were they could plan dumping the body would only take a few seconds any apartments overlooking the bins well go around the apartments in the culdesac again tomorrow said perez the apartment with the best view is at the end but there was nobody at home a long pulsating flash of lightning was accompanied by a clap of thunder so loud that it seemed to crack open the sky above their heads they all instinctively ducked and the jefatura was plunged into darkness they fumbled around for a torch while the rain thrashed against the building and drove in waves across the car park ferrera propped a flashlight up against some files and they sat back more lightning left them blinking with the window frame burnt on to their retinae the emergency generators started up in the basement the lights flickered back on falcons mobile vibrated on the desktop a text from the medico forense telling him that the autopsy had been completed and he would be free from am to discuss it falcon sent a text back agreeing to see him first thing he flung the mobile back on the desk and stared into the wall you seem a little uneasy inspector jefe said perez who had a habit of stating the obvious while falcon had a habit of ignoring him we have an unidentified corpse which could prove to be unidentifiable said falcon marshalling his thoughts trying to give perez and ferrera a focus for their investigative work how many people do you think were involved in this murder a minimum of two said ferrera killing scalping severing hands burning off features with acidyes why did they cut off his hands when they could have easily burnt off his prints with acid something significant about his hands said perez falcon and ferrera exchanged a look keep thinking emilio said falcon anyway it was planned and premeditated and it was important that his identity was not known why because the identity of the corpse will point to the killers said perez most victims are killed by people or said falcon if there was no obvious link the identity of the victim andor knowledge of his skills might jeopardize a future operation said ferrera good now tell me how many people you really think it took to dispose of that body in one of those bins said falcon theyre chest high to a normal person and the whole thing has got to be done in seconds three to deal with the body and two for lookout said perez if you tipped the bin over to the edge of the car boot it could be done with two men said ferrera anybody coming down calle boteros at that time would be drunk and shouting you might need a driver in the car three maximum three or five what does that tell you its a gang said perez doing what drugs he said cutting off his hands burning off his face drug runners dont normally sew people into shrouds said falcon they tend to shoot people and there was no bullet holenot even a knife wound it didnt seem like an execution said ferrera more like a regrettable necessity falcon told them they were to revisit all the apartments overlooking the bins first thing in the morning before everybody went to work they were to establish if there was black plastic sheeting in any of the bins and if a car was seen or heard at around three in the morning on sunday down in the forensic lab felipe and jorge had the tables pushed back and the black plastic sheet laid out on the floor the two large bins from calle boteros were already in the corner taped shut jorge was at a microscope while felipe was on all fours on the plastic sheet wearing his custommade magnifying spectacles weve got a blood group match from the victim to the white shroud and to the black plastic sheet we hope to have a dna match by tomorrow morning said jorge it looks to me as if they put him face down on the plastic to do the surgery he gave falcon the measurements between a saliva deposit and some blood deposits and two pubic hairs which all conformed to the victims height were running dna tests on those too he said what about the acid on the face that must have been done elsewhere and rinsed off theres no sign of it any prints no fingerprints just a footprint in the top left quadrant said felipe jorge has matched it to a nike trainer as worn by thousands of people are you going to be able to look at those bins tonight well take a look but if he was well wrapped up i dont hold out much hope for blood or saliva said felipe have you run a check on missing persons asked jorge we dont even know if he was spanish yet said falcon im seeing the medico forense tomorrow morning lets hope there are some distinguishing marks his pubic hair was dark said jorge grinning and his blood group was o positiveif thats any help keep up the brilliant work said falcon it was still raining but in a discouragingly sensible way after the reckless madness of the initial downpour falcon did some paperwork with his mind elsewhere he turned away from his computer and stared at the reflection of his office in the dark window the fluorescent light shivered pellets of rain drummed against the glass as if a lunatic wanted to attract his attention falcon was surprised at himself hed been such a scientific investigator in the past always keen to get his hands on autopsy reports and forensic evidence now he spent more time tuning in to his intuition he tried to persuade himself that it was experience but sometimes it seemed like laziness a buzz from his mobile jolted him a text from his current girlfriend laura inviting him to dinner he looked down at the screen and found himself unconsciously rubbing the arm which had made contact with consuelos body in the entrance of the cafe he hesitated as he reached for the mobile to reply why suddenly was everything so much more complicated hed wait until he got back home the traffic was slow in the rain the radio news commented on the successful parading of the virgin of rocio which had taken place that day falcon crossed the river and joined the metal snake heading north he sat at the traffic lights and scribbled a note without thinking before filtering right down calle reyes catolicos from there he drove into the maze of streets where he lived in the massive rambling house hed inherited six years ago he parked up between the orange trees that led to the entrance of the house on calle bailen but didnt get out he was wrestling with his uneasiness again and this time it was to do with consuelowhat hed seen in her face that morning theyd both been startled but it hadnt just been shock that had registered in her eyes it was anguish he got out of the car opened the smaller door within the brassstudded oak portal and went through to the patio where the marble flags still glistened from the rain a blinking light beyond the glass door to his study told him that he had two phone messages he hit the button and stood in the dark looking out through the cloister at the bronze running boy in the fountain the voice of his moroccan friend yacoub diouri filled the room he greeted javier in arabic and then slipped into perfect spanish he was flying to madrid on his way to paris next weekend and wondered if they could meet up was that coincidence or synchronicity the only reason hed met yacoub diouri one of the few men hed become close to was because of consuelo jimenez that was the thing about intuition you began to believe that everything had significance the second message was from laura who still wanted to know if he would be coming for dinner that night it would be just the two of them he smiled at that his relationship with laura was not exclusive she had other male companions she saw regularly and that had suited himuntil now when for no apparent reason it was different paella and spending the night with laura suddenly seemed ridiculous he called her and said that he wouldnt be able to make dinner but that he would drop by for a drink later there was no food in the house his housekeeper had assumed he would go out for dinner he hadnt eaten all day the body on the dump had interrupted his lunch plans and ruined his appetite now he was hungry he went for a walk the streets were fresh after the rain and full of people he didnt really start thinking where he was going until he found himself heading round the back of the omnium sanctorum church only then did he admit that he was going to eat at consuelos new restaurant the waiter brought him a menu and he ordered immediately the pan de casa arrived quickly thinly sliced ham sitting on a spread of salmorejo on toast he enjoyed it with a beer feeling suddenly bold he took out one of his cards and wrote on the back i am eating here and wondered if you would join me for a glass of wine javier when the waiter came back with the revuelto de setas scrambled eggs and mushrooms he poured a glass of red rioja and javier gave him the card later the waiter returned with some tiny lamb chops and topped up his glass of wine shes not in he said ive left the card on her desk so that she knows you were here falcon knew he was lying it was one of the few advantages of being a detective he ate the chops feeling privately foolish that hed believed in the synchronicity of the moment he sipped at his third glass of wine and ordered coffee by pm he was out in the street again he leaned against the wall opposite the entrance to the restaurant thinking that he might catch her on the way out as he stood there waiting patiently he covered a lot of ground in his head it was amazing how little thought hed given to his inner life since hed stopped seeing his shrink four years ago and when an hour later he gave up his vigil he knew precisely what he was going to do he was determined to finish his superficial relationship with laura and if his world of work would let him he would devote himself to bringing consuelo back into his life sevilletuesday th june hrs consuelo jimenez was sitting in the office of her flagship restaurant in the heart of la macarena the old workingclass neighbourhood of seville she was in a state of heightened anxiety and the three heavy shots of the macallan which shed taken to drinking at this time of night were doing nothing to alleviate it her state had not been improved by bumping into javier early in the day and it had been made worse by the knowledge that hed been eating his dinner barely ten metres from where she was now sitting his card lay on the desk in front of her she was in possession of a terrible clarity about her mental and physical state she was not somebody who having fallen into a trough of despair lost control of her life and plunged unconsciously into an orgy of selfdestruction she was more meticulous than that more detached so detached that at times shed found herself looking down on her own blonde head as the mind beneath stumbled about in the wreckage of her inner life it was a very strange state to be in physically in good shape for her age mentally still very focused on her business beautifully turned out as always buthow to put this she had no words for what was happening inside her all she had to describe it was an image from a tv documentary on global warming vital elements of an ancient glaciers primitive structure had melted in some unusually fierce summer heat and without warning a vast tonnage of ice had collapsed in a protracted roar into a lake below she knew from the ghastly plummet in her own organs that she was watching a prefigurement of what might happen to her unless she did something fast the whisky glass travelled to her mouth and back to the desk transported by a hand that she did not feel belonged to her she was grateful for the ethereal sting of the alcohol because it reminded her that she was still sentient she was playing with a business card turning it over and over rubbing the embossed name and profession with her thumb her manager knocked and came in were finished now he said well be locking up in five minutes theres nothing left to do hereyou should go home that man who was here earlier one of the waiters said he was outside are you sure hes gone im sure said the manager ill let myself out of the side door she said giving him one of her hard professional looks he backed off consuelo was sorry he was a good man who knew when a person needed help and also when that help was unacceptable what was going on inside consuelo was too personal to be sorted out in an afterhours chat between proprietor and manager this wasnt about unpaid bills or difficult clients this was abouteverything she went back to the card it belonged to a clinical psychologist called alicia aguado over the last eighteen months consuelo had made six appointments with this woman and failed to turn up for any of them shed given a different name each time shed made these appointments but alicia aguado had recognized her voice from the first call of course she would she was blind and the blind develop other senses on the last two occasions alicia aguado had said if ever you have to see me you must call i will fit you in wheneverearly morning or late at night you must realize that i am always here when you need me that had shocked consuelo alicia aguado knew even consuelos iciest professional tone had betrayed her need for help the hand reached for the bottle and refilled the glass the whisky vaporized into her mind she also knew why she wanted to see this particular psychologist alicia aguado had treated javier falcon when shed run into him in the street it had been like a reminder but a reminder of what the fling shed had with him she only called it a fling because thats what it looked like from the outsidesome days of dinners and wild sex but shed broken it off becauseshe writhed in her chair at the memory what reason had she given him because she was hopeless when in love she turned into somebody else when she got into a relationship whatever it was shed invented something unanswerable refused to see him or answer his calls and now he was back like an extra motivation she hadnt been able to ignore a recent and more worrying psychological development which had started to occur in the brief moments when she wasnt working with her usual fierce almost manic drive when distracted or tired at the end of the day sex would come into her mind but like a midnight intruder she imagined herself having new and vital affairs with strangers her fantasies drifted towards rough possibly dangerous men and assumed pornographic dimensions with herself at the centre of almost unimaginable goings on shed always hated porn had found it both disgustingly biological and boring but now however much she tried to fight it with her intelligence she was aware of her arousal saliva in her mouth the constriction of her throat and it was happening again now even with her mind apparently engaged she kicked back her chair tossed aguados card into the gaping hole of her handbag lunged at her cigarettes lit up and paced the office floor smoking too fast and hard these imaginings disgusted her why was she thinking about such trash why not think about her children her three darling boysricardo matias and darioasleep at home in the care of a nanny in the care of a nanny she had promised that she would never do that after raul her husband their father had been murdered she had been determined to give them all her attention so that they would never feel the lack of a parent and look at her nowthinking of fucking while they were at home in another persons care she didnt deserve to be a mother she tore her handbag off the desk javiers card fluttered to the floor she wanted to be out in the open breathing the rainrinsed air the five or six shots of the macallan shed drunk meant that she had to walk up to the basilica macarena to get a taxi to do this she had to pass the plaza del pumarejo where a bunch of drunks and addicts hung out all day every day and well into the night the plaza under a canopy of trees still dripping from the earlier storm had a raised platform with a closed kiosk at one end and at the other near the shuttered bodega de gamacho a group of a dozen or so burntout cases the air was cool around consuelos bare legs which were numbed by the whisky she had not considered how obtrusive her peachcoloured satin suit would be under the street lamps she walked behind the kiosk and along the pavement by the old palacio del pumarejo some of the group were standing and boozing gathered around a man who was talking while others slumped on benches in a stupor the wiry central figure in a black shirt open to the waist was familiar to consuelo his talk to this unsavoury audience was more of an oration because he had a politicians way with words he had long black hair eyebrows angled sharply into his nose and a lean hard pockmarked face she knew why the group around him hung on his words and it had nothing to do with the content it was because under those satanic eyebrows he had very bright light green eyes which stared out of his dark face alarming whoever they settled on they gave the powerful impression of a man who had quick access to a blade he drank from a bottle of cheap wine which hung by his side with his forefinger plugged into its neck a month ago while consuelo was waiting to cross the road at a traffic light hed approached her from behind and muttered words of such obscenity that theyd entered her mind like a shiv consuelo had remonstrated loudly when it happened but unlike the usual perpetrators who would slink off into the crowds of shoppers ignoring her hed got up close and silenced her with those green eyes and a quick wink that made her think he knew something about her that she herself did not i know your sort hed said and touched the corner of his mouth with the point of his tongue his bravado had paralysed her vocal cords that and the horrible little kiss hed blown her which found its way to her neck like a horsefly consuelo distracted by these memories had slowed to a halt a member of the group spotted her and jerked his head in her direction the orator stepped towards the railing holding the bottle up letting it dangle from his forefinger fancy a drink he said we havent got any glasses but ill let you suck it off my finger if you want a low gurgling laugh came from the group which included some women startled consuelo began walking again the man jumped off the raised platform the steel tips on the heels of his boots hammered the cobbles he blocked her path and started to dance an extremely suggestive sevillana with much pelvic thrusting the group backed him up with some flamenco clapping come on dona consuelo he said lets see you move you look as if youve got a decent pair of legs on you she was shocked to hear him use her name terror slashed through her insides tugging something strangely exciting behind it muscles quivered in the backs of her thighs disparate thoughts barged into each other in her mind why the hell had she put herself in such a position she wondered how rough his hands would be he looked strongpotentially violent the sheer perversity of these thoughts jolted her back to the reality she had to get away from him she veered off down a side street walking as fast as her kitten heels would permit on the cobbles he was behind her steel tips leisurely clicking fucking hell dona consuelo i only asked you for a dance he shouted after her a mocking inflexion on her title now youre leading me astray down this dark alley for gods sake have some selfrespect woman dont go showing your eagerness so early on weve barely met we havent even danced consuelo kept going breathing fast all she had to do was get to the end of the street turn left and shed be at the gates of the old city and there would be traffic and peoplea taxi back to her real life at home in santa clara an alley appeared on her left she saw the lights of the main road through the buildings leaning into each other she darted down it shit the cobbles were wet and all over the place it was too dark and her heels were slipping she wanted to scream when his hand finally landed on her shoulder but it was like in those dreams where the need to yell the neighbourhood awake produced only a strangled whimper he pushed her towards the wall whose whitewash hung off in brittle flakes and crackled as her cheek made contact her heart thundered in her chest have you been watching me dona consuelo he said his face appearing over her shoulder the sourness of his winy breath in her nostrils have you been keeping a little eye out for me perhapssince you lost your husband your beds been a bit cold at night she gasped as he slipped his hand between her bare legs it was rough an automatic reflex clamped her thighs shut he sawed his hand up to her crotch a voice in her head remonstrated with her for being so stupid her heart walloped in her throat while her brain screamed for her to say something if its money you want she said in a voice that whispered to the flaking whitewash well he said pulling his hand away how much have you got i dont come cheap you know especially for the sort of thing you like he took her handbag off her shoulder flipped it open and found her wallet a hundred and twenty euros he said disgusted take it she said her voice still stuck under her thyroid thank you thank you very much he said dropping her handbag to his feet but thats not enough for what you want come back with the rest tomorrow he pressed against her she felt his obscene hardness against her buttocks his face came over her shoulder once more and he kissed her on the corner of her mouth his wine and tobacco breath and bitter little tongue slipping between her lips he pushed himself away a gold ring on his finger flashed in the corner of her eye he stepped back kicked her handbag down the street fuck off whore he said you make me sick the steel tips receded consuelos throat still throbbed so that breathing was more like swallowing without being able to achieve either she looked back to where hed gone confused at her escape the empty cobbles shone under the yellow light she pushed away from the wall snatched up her handbag and ran slipping and hobbling down the street to the main road where she hailed a cab she sat in the back with the city floating past her pallid face her hands shook too much to light the cigarette shed managed to get into her mouth the driver lit it for her at home she found money in her desk to pay for the taxi she ran upstairs and checked the boys in their beds she went to her own room and stripped off and looked at herself in the mirror he hadnt marked her she showered endlessly soaping and resoaping herself rinsing herself again and again she went back to her desk in her dressing gown and sat in the dark feeling nauseous head aching waiting for dawn when it was the earliest possible acceptable moment she phoned alicia aguado and asked for an emergency appointment sevilletuesday th june hrs juez esteban calderon was not on business the urbane and highly successful judge had told his wife ines that he was working late before going to dinner with a group of young state judges who had come down from madrid on a training course he had worked late and he had gone to the dinner but hed excused himself early and was now taking his favourite little detour down the side of the san marcos church to reach the penthouse of promise which overlooked the church of santa isabel he usually enjoyed smoking a cigarette at the edge of the small floodlit plaza looking from within the darkness at the fountain and the massive portal of the church it calmed him after long days spent with prosecutors and policemen and kept him out of the way of some bars around the corner which were frequented by colleagues if they saw him there it would get back to ines and thered be awkward questions he also needed a few moments to rein in his quivering sexual tension which started every morning when he woke up and imagined the long coppery hair and mulatto skin of his cuban girlfriend marisa moreno who lived in the penthouse just visible from where he was sitting his cigarette hissed in a puddle where hed tossed it half smoked he took off his jacket a breeze sprayed droplets of water from the orange trees on to his back and he caught his breath at the lash of its sudden chill he kept to the wall of the church until he was in the darkness of the narrow street his finger hovered over the top button of the entry phone as an accumulation of half thoughts made him hesitate subterfuge infidelity fear sex dizziness and death he scratched at the air above the button these unusual thoughts made him feel that he was on the brink of something like a great change what to do either step over the edge or fall back he swallowed some thick bitter saliva from his fast smoking the sensuality of the lash of raindrops across his back reached that nexus of nerves in the base of his spine the unease disappeared his recklessness made him feel alive again and his cock leapt in his pants he hit the buzzer its me he said to the crackle of marisas voice you sound thirsty not thirsty he said clearing his throat the twoman lift didnt seem to have enough air and he started panting its stainless steel panels reflected the absurd shape of his arousal and he rearranged himself he brushed back his thinning hair loosened his flamboyant tie and knocked on her door it opened a crack and marisas amber eyes blinked slowly the door fell open she was wearing a long orange silk shift which nearly reached the floor it was fastened with a single amber disc between her flat breasts she kissed him and slipped a cube of ice from between her lips into his confused mouth and something like a firework went off in the back of his head she held him at bay with a single finger on his sternum the ice cooled his tongue she gave him an appraising look from crown to crotch and admonished him with a raised eyebrow she took his jacket and hurled it into the room he loved this whorish stuff she did and she knew it she dropped to her haunches undid his belt and tugged his trousers and underpants down then eased him profoundly into the coolness of her mouth calderon braced himself in the doorframe and gritted his teeth she looked up at his agony with wide eyes he lasted less than a minute she stood turned on her heel and strode back into her apartment calderon pulled himself together he didnt hear her hawking and spitting in the bathroom he just saw her reappear from the kitchen carrying two chilled glasses of cava i thought you werent coming she said looking at the thin gold wafer of watch on her wrist and then i remembered my mother telling me that the only time a sevillano wasnt late was for the bulls calderon was too dazed to comment marisa drank from her flute twenty gold and silver bracelets rattled on her forearm she lit a cigarette crossed her legs and let the shift slip away to reveal a long slim leg orange panties and a hard brown stomach calderon knew that stomach its paperthin skin hard wriggling muscularity and soft coppery down hed laid his head on it and stroked the tight copper curls of her pubis esteban he snapped out of the natural revolutions of his mind have you eaten he asked nothing else coming to him conversation not being one of the strengths of their relationship i dont need any feeding she said taking a shelled brazil nut from a bowl and putting it between her hard white teeth im quite ready to be fucked the nut went off in her mouth like a silenced gun and calderon reacted like a sprinter out of the blocks he fell into her snakelike arms and bit into her unnaturally long neck which seemed stretched like those of african tribal women in fact for him that was her attraction part sophisticate part savage shed lived in paris modelling for givenchy and travelled across the sahara with a caravan of tuaregs shed slept with a famous movie director in los angeles and lived with a fisherman on the beach near maputo in mozambique shed worked for an artist in new york and spent six months in the congo learning how to carve wood calderon knew all this and believed it because marisa was such an extraordinary creature but he didnt have the first idea of what was going on in her head so like a good lawyer he clung to these few dazzling facts after sex they went to bed which for marisa was a place to talk or sleep but not for the writhings and juices of sex they lay naked under a sheet with light from the street in parallelograms on the wall and ceiling the cava fizzed in glasses balanced on their chests they shared an ashtray in the trough between their bodies shouldnt you have gone by now said marisa just a little bit longer said calderon drowsy what does ines think youre doing all this time asked marisa for something to say im at a dinnerfor work youre just about the last person in the world who should be married she said why do you say that well maybe not after all you sevillanos are very conservative is that why you married her part of it what was the other part she asked pointing the cone of her cigarette at his chest the more interesting part she burnt a hair off one of his nipples the smell of it filled his nostrils careful he said feeling the sting you dont want ash all over the sheets she rolled back from him flicked her cigarette out on to the balcony i like to hear the parts that people dont want to tell me about she said her coppery hair was splayed out on the white pillow he hadnt been able to look at her hair without thinking of the other woman hed known with hair of the same colour it had never occurred to him to tell anybody about the late maddy krugman except the police in his statement he hadnt even talked to ines about that night she knew the story from the newspapers the surface of it anyway and that was all shed wanted to know marisa raised her head and sipped from her flute he was attracted to her for the same reason that hed been attracted to maddy the beauty the glamour the sexiness and the complete mystery but what was he to her what had he been to maddy krugman that was something that occupied his spare thinking time especially those hours of the early morning when he woke up next to ines and thought that he might be dead i dont really give a fuck why you married her said marisa trying a welltested trick well thats not whats interesting im not sure i need to know what is interesting said marisa most men who think theyre fascinating only ever talk about themselvestheir successes this wasnt one of my successes said calderon it was one of my greatest failures hed made a snap decision to tell her candour was not one of his strongest suits in his society it had a way of coming back on you but marisa was an outsider he also wanted to fascinate her having always been the object of fascination to women hed understood completely he had the uncomfortable feeling of being ordinary with exotic creatures like maddy krugman and marisa moreno here he thought was an opportunity to intrigue the intriguers it was about four years ago and id just announced my engagement to ines he said i was called to a situation which looked like a murdersuicide there were some anomalies which meant that the detective who by a coincidence happened to be the exhusband of ines wanted to treat it as a double murder investigation the victims neighbours were american the woman was an artist and stunningly beautiful she was a photographer with a taste for the weird her name was maddy krugman and i fell in love with her we had a brief but intense affair until her insane husband found out and cornered us in an apartment one night to cut a long and painful story short he shot her and then himself i was lucky not to get a bullet in the head as well they lay in silence voices came up over the balcony rail from the street a warm breeze blew at the voile curtains which billowed into the room bringing the smell of rain and the promise of hot weather in the morning and thats why you married ines maddy was dead i was very badly shaken ines represented stability did you tell her youd fallen in love with this woman we never talked about it and what nowfour years later i feel nothing for ines said calderon which was not quite the whole truth he did feel something for her he hated her he could hardly bear to share her bed had to steel himself to her touch and he couldnt understand why he had no idea where it came from she hadnt changed she had been both good to him and for him after the maddy incident this feeling of dying he had when he was with her in bed was a symptom of what he could not say well esteban youre a member of a very large club have you ever been married you are joking said marisa i watched the soap opera of my parents marriage for fifteen years that was enough to warn me off that particular bourgeois institution and what are you doing with me asked calderon fishing for something but not sure what it doesnt get more bourgeois than having an affair with a state judge being bourgeois is a state of mind she said what you do means nothing to me it has no bearing on us were having an affair and it will carry on until it burns out but im not going to get married and you already are you said i was the last person in the world who should be married said calderon people get married if they want to have kids and fit into society or if theyre suckers they marry their dream i didnt marry my dream said calderon i married everybody elses dream i was the brilliant young judge ines was the brilliant and beautiful young prosecutor we were the golden couple as seen on tv you dont have any children said marisa get divorced its not so easy why not its taken you four years to find out that youre incompatible said marisa get out now while youre still young youve had a lot of lovers i might have been to bed with a lot of men but ive only had four lovers and how do you define a lover asked calderon still fishing someone i love and who loves me sounds simple it can beas long as you dont let life fuck it up the question burned inside calderon did she love him but almost as soon as it came into his mind he had to ask himself whether he loved her they cancelled each other out hed been fucking her for nine months that wasnt quite fair or was it marisa could hear his brain working she recognized the sound men always assumed their brains were silent rather than grinding away like sabotaged machinery so now youre going to tell me said marisa that you cant get a divorce for all those bourgeois reasonscareer status social acceptance property and money that was it thought calderon his face going slack in the dark that was precisely why he couldnt get a divorce he would lose everything he had only just scraped his career back together again after the maddy debacle being related to the magistrado juez decano de sevilla had helped but so had his marriage to ines if he divorced her now his career might easily drift his friends would slip away he would lose his apartment and he would be poorer ines would make sure of all that there is of course a bourgeois solution to that said marisa what said calderon turning to look at her between her upturned nipples suddenly hopeful you could murder her she said throwing open her hands easy peasy calderon smiled at first not quite registering what she had said his smile turned into a grin and then he laughed as he laughed his head bounced on marisas taut stomach and it bounced higher and higher as her muscles tightened with laughter he sat up spluttering at the brilliant absurdity of her idea me the leading juez de instruccion in seville killing his wife ask her exhusband for some advice said marisa her stomach still contracting with laughter he should know how to commit the perfect murder sevilletuesday th june hrs manuela falcon was in bed but not sleeping it was in the morning she had the bedside light on knees up flicking through vogue but not reading not even looking at the pictures she had too much on her mind her property portfolio the money she owed to the banks the mortgage repayments the lack of rental income the lawyers fees the two deeds due to be signed this morning which would release her capital into beautifully fluid funds of cash for gods sake relax said angel waking up in bed next to her still groggy with sleep and nursing a small cognacinduced hangover what are you so anxious about i cant believe youve asked that question said manuela the deeds this morning angel zarrias blinked into his pillow hed forgotten look my darling he said rolling over you know that nothing happens even if you think about it all the time it only happens yes i know angel it only happens when it happens but even you can understand that theres uncertainty before it happens but if you dont sleep and you churn it over in your head in an endless washing cycle it has no effect on the outcome so you might as well forget about it handle the horror if it happens but dont torture yourself with the theory of it manuela flicked through the pages of vogue even more viciously but she felt better angel could do that to her he was older he had authority he had experience its all right for you she said gently you dont owe six hundred thousand euros to the bank but i also dont own nearly two million euros worth of property i own one million eight hundred thousand euros worth of property i owe six hundred thousand to the bank the lawyers fees areforget it lets not talk about numbers they make me sick nothing has any value until its sold which is what youre about to do said angel in his most solid reinforced concrete voice anything can happen she said turning a page so viciously she tore it but it tends not to the markets nervous which is why youre selling nobodys going to withdraw in the next eight hours he said struggling to sit up in bed most people would kill to be in your position with two empty properties no rent and four thousand a month going out well clearly im looking at it from a more advantageous perspective manuela liked this however hard she tried she couldnt get angel to participate in her catalogue of imagined horrors his objective authority made her feel quite girlish she hadnt yet got to the point of recognizing what their relationship had become how it fitted with her powerful needs all she knew was that angel was a colossal comfort to her relax said angel pulling her to him kissing the top of her head wouldnt it be great to be able to compress time and just be in tomorrow evening now she said snuggling up to him with money in the bank and the summer free lets have a celebratory dinner at salvador rojo tonight i was thinking that myself she said but i was too superstitious to book it we could ask javier he could bring laura so you can have someone to flirt with how very considerate of you he said kissing her head again when angel and manuela had met it seemed that the only thing holding her life together was her legal battle over javiers right to have inherited the house in which he was living theyd met in her lawyers office where angel was sorting out his late wifes estate as soon as theyd shaken hands shed felt something cave in high up around her stomach and no man had ever done that to her before they left the lawyers office and went for a drink and having never looked at older men having always gone for boys she immediately saw the point older men looked after you you didnt have to look after them the more she found out about angel the more she fell for him he was a phenomenally charming man a committed politician sometimes a little too committed right wing conservative a catholic a lover of the bulls and from an established family in politics hed been able to broker agreements between fanatically opposed factions just because neither party wanted to be disliked by him hed been someone in the partido popular in andalucia but had quit in a fury over the impossibility of getting anything to change recently hed joined forces in a public relations capacity with a smaller rightwing party called fuerza andalucia which was run by his old friend eduardo rivero he contributed a political column for the abc newspaper and was also their highly respected bullfight commentator with all these talents at his disposal it hadnt taken him long to bring javier and manuela back together again all energy expended on court cases like yours is negative energy angel had told her that negative energy dominates your life so that the rest of it has to go on hold the only way to restart your life is to bring positive energy back into it and how do i do that shed asked looking at this huge source of positive energy in front of her with her big brown eyes court cases use up resources not just financial ones but physical and emotional ones too so you have to be productive he said what do you want from your life at the moment that house shed said despite being pretty keen on angel right then too its yours javier has offered it to you theres the small matter of one million euros but he hasnt said you cant have it said angel and its much more productive to make money in order to buy something you really want than to throw it away on useless lawyers hes not useless she said and ran out of steam there were a few thousand other reasons she had stacked up against angels stunningly simple logic but the source of most of them was her miserable emotional state which was not something she wanted to peel back for him to see so she agreed with him sold her veterinary practice at the beginning of borrowed money against the property she had inherited in el puerto de santa maria and invested it in sevilles booming property market after three years of buying renovating and selling she had forgotten about javiers house the court case and that hollow feeling at the top of her stomach she now lived with angel in a penthouse apartment overlooking the majestic treelined plaza cristo de burgos in the middle of the old city and her life was full and about to be even sweeter how did it go last night asked manuela i can tell you wound up on the brandy gah said angel wincing at some gripe in his intestines no smoking for you until after coffee this morning maybe my breath could become a cheap form of renewable energy said angel fingering some sleep out of his eye in fact everyones breath could because all we do is spout hot alcoholic air is the master of positive energy getting a little bit bored with his cronies not bored theyre my friends said angel shrugging its one of the advantages of age that we can tell each other the same stories over and over and still laugh age is a state of mind and youre still young said manuela maybe you should go back to the commercial side of your public relations business forget politics and all those selfimportant fools and finally she reveals what she thinks of my closest friends i like your friends its justthe politics said manuela endless talk but nothing ever happens maybe youre right said angel nodding the last time there was an event in this country was the horror of th march and look what happened the whole country pulled together and by due process of democracy kicked out a perfectly good government then we bowed down to the terrorists and pulled out of iraq and after that we sank back into the comfort of our lives and drank too much brandy exactly said angel looking at her with his hair exploded in all directions you know what someone was saying last night was this the interesting bit she said teasing him on we need a return to benevolent dictatorship said angel throwing up his hands in mock exasperation you might find yourselves out on a limb there said manuela people dont like turmoil with troops and tanks on the streets they want a cold beer a tapa and something stupid to watch on tv my point entirely said angel slapping his stomach nobody listened weve got a population dying of decadence so morally moribund that they no longer know what they want apart from kneejerk consumption and my cronies think that theyll be loved if they do these people the favour of mounting a coup i dont want to see you on television standing on a desk in parliament with a gun in your hand ill have to lose some weight first said angel calderon came to with a jolt and a sense of real panic left over from a dream he could not recollect he was surprised to see marisas long brown back in the bed beside him instead of iness white nightdress hed overslept it was now am and he would have to go back to his apartment and deal with some very awkward questions from ines his frantic leap from the bed woke marisa he dressed shaking his head at the slug trails of dried semen on his thigh take a shower said marisa no time anyway shes not an idiotso you tell me no shes not said calderon looking for his other shoe but as long as certain rules are obeyed then the whole thing can be glossed over this must be the bourgeois protocol for affairs outside marriage thats right said calderon irritated by her you cant stay out all night because that is making a complete joke out of the institution whats the cutoff point between a serious marriage and a joke one asked marisa three oclockthree thirty no thats ok i think by four oclock its ridiculous by four thirty it is a complete joke by six six thirtyits a farce by six its a tragedy said calderon searching the floor madly where is my fucking shoe under the chair said marisa and dont forget your camera on the coffee table ive left a present or two on it for you he threw on his jacket pocketed the camera dug his foot into his shoe how did you find my camera he asked kneeling down by the bed i went through your jacket while you were asleep she said i come from a bourgeois family i kick against it but i know all the tricks dont worry i didnt erase all those stupid shots of your lawyers dinner to prove to your very intelligent wife that you werent out all night fucking your girlfriend well thanks very much for that and i havent been naughty no i told you i left some presents on the camera for you just dont let her see he nodded suddenly in a hurry again they kissed going down in the lift he tidied himself up got everything tucked away and rubbed his face into life to prepare for the lie which he practised even he saw the two micro movements of his eyebrows which javier falcon had told him was the first and surest sign of a liar if he knew that then ines would know it too no taxis out at this early hour of the morning he should have called for one he set off at a fast walk memories ricocheted around his mind which seemed to dip in and out of his consciousness the lie the truth the reality the dream and it came back to him with the same sense of panic hed had on waking in marisas apartment his hands closing around iness slim throat he was throttling her but she wasnt turning puce or purple and her tongue wasnt thickening with blood and protruding she was looking up at him with her eyes full of love and yes she was stroking his forearms encouraging him to do it the bourgeois solution to awkward divorcesmurder absurd he knew from his work with the homicide squad that the first person to be grilled in a murder case was the spouse the streets were still wet from last nights rain the cobbles greasy he was sweating and the smell of marisa came up off his shirt it occurred to him that hed never felt guilty he didnt know what it was other than a legal state since hed been married to ines hed had affairs with four women of whom marisa had lasted the longest hed also had onenight stands or afternoons with two other women and there was the prostitute in barcelona but he didnt like to think of that hed even had sex with one of these women whilst having an affair with another as a married man which must make him a serial philanderer except it didnt feel like philandering there was supposed to be something enjoyable about philandering it was romantic wasnt itin the eighteenthcentury sense of the word but what hed been doing was not enjoyable he was trying to fill a hole which with every affair grew bigger so what was this expanding void now that would be a thing to answer if he could ever find the time to think about it he slipped on a cobble half fell scuffed his hand on the pavement it pulled him out of his head and on to more practical business hed have to have a shower as soon as he got in marisa was in his sinuses maybe he should have had a shower before he left but then there would have been the smell of marisas soap then another revelation what did he care why the grand pretence ines knew theyd had fightsnever about his affairs but about ridiculous stuff which was a cover for the unmentionable she could have got out she could have left him years ago but shed stayed that was significant the graze on his hand was stinging his thoughts made him feel stronger he wasnt afraid of ines she could strike fear into others hed seen her in court but not him he had the upper hand he fucked around and she stayed his apartment block on calle san vicente appeared before him he opened the door with a flourish he didnt know whether it was the conclusion hed arrived at his stinging hand or the fact that he tripped up on the stairs because the decorators those idle sods had pushed their dustsheets to one side rather than clearing them awaybut he began to feel just a little bit cruel the firstfloor apartment was silent it was am he went to his study and emptied the pockets of his suit on to his desk in the dark he took off his jacket and trousers and left them on a chair and went to the bathroom ines was asleep he stripped off his pants and socks threw them in the laundry basket and showered ines was not asleep she lay with her shiny dark eyes blinking in the sepia light as morning crept through the louvred shutters she had been awake since am when shed found her husbands side of the bed vacant shed sat up in bed arms folded across her flat chest her brain seething shed run the marathon of her thoughts for two hours her insides molten with rage at the humiliation of finding his undented pillow but then she would suddenly feel weak at the thought of facing this latest demonstration of his infidelity because thats what it wasa demonstration in those hours she realized that the only area of her life that was functioning was her work which now bored her not that the work had changed in any way but her perspective had she wanted to be a wife and mother she wanted to live in a big old house with a patio inside the city walls she wanted to go for walks in the park meet her friends for lunch take her children to see her parents none of that had happened after the american bitch had been removed from the scene she and esteban had come together had in her mind grown closer she had stopped using contraceptives without telling him wanting to surprise him but her periods kept coming with plodding regularity shed gone for a checkup and been pronounced a perfectly healthy female of the species after sex one morning shed saved a sample of his sperm and taken it for a fertility test the result was that he was a man of exceptional virility had he known he would have framed the result and hung it next to their wedding photograph the sale of her apartment had gone through quickly shed banked the money and started looking for her dream home but esteban loathed the houses that she wanted to buy and refused to look at them the property market boomed the money shed got for her apartment now looked paltry her dream became an impossibility they lived in his very masculine aggressively modern apartment on the calle san vicente and he became angry if she tried to change a single detail he wouldnt even let her put a chain on the door but that was because he didnt want to have to be let in by her reeking of sex after a night out their sex life began to falter she knew he was having affairs from the tireless grind of his lovemaking and the paucity of his ejaculations she tried to be more daring he made her feel foolish as if her proposed games were ridiculous then suddenly hed taken up her offer to play games but given her debasing roles seemingly inspired by internet porn she subjected herself to his ministrations hiding her pain and shame in the pillow at least she wasnt fat she inspected herself minutely in the mirror every day it satisfied her to see the deflation of her bust her individual ribs and her concave thighs sometimes she would feel dizzy in court her friends told her shed never get pregnant she smiled at them her pale skin stretched tight over her beautiful face her aura frighteningly beatific ines was toying with the idea of a massive confrontation when she heard esteban put his key in the lock her stickthin forearms seemed to have grown more hair and they made her feel curiously weak she sank down into the bed and pretended to be asleep she heard him empty his pockets and go to the bathroom the shower came on she ran barefoot to his study saw his suit and sniffed it over like a dog cigarettes perfume old sex her eyes were riveted to the digital camera she touched it with her knuckle still warm she burned to know what was on its memory the shower door rolled open she ran back to bed and lay with her heart beating fast as a cats his weight tipped her featherlight frame in the bed she waited for his breathing to settle into the pattern that she knew was his sleep her heart slowed her mind cooled she slid out of the bed he didnt move in the study she pressed the cameras quickview button and caught her breath as a miniature marisa appeared on the screen she was naked on the sofa legs apart hands covering her pubis ines pressed again marisa naked kneeling and looking backwards over her shoulder the whore she pressed again and again and only found her husbands alibi of the judges dinner she went back to the whore who was she the black bitch she had to know iness laptop was in the hall she took it into the kitchen and booted it up in the greybar time she went back to his study and scoured the shelves for the download lead back to the kitchen opened up the camera plugged in the lead connected it to her laptop total concentration the icon appeared on the screen the software automatically loaded she clicked on import and clenched her fist as she saw she was going to have to download fiftyfour shots to get the ones she wanted she stared at the screen willing it to process faster she heard only the breathing of the computers fan and the flickering of the hard disk she didnt hear the bedclothes stir she didnt hear his bare foot on the wooden floor she didnt even hear his question properly his voice did turn her round she was conscious of her cotton nightdress on the points of her shoulders its hem brushing the tops of her thighs as she took in the fullfrontal nudity of her husband standing in the frame of the kitchen door whats going on he asked what said ines her eyes unable to look anywhere other than his treacherous genitals he repeated his question the adrenaline spike was so powerful she wasnt sure that her heart could cope with the sudden surge after nearly twenty years experience in the criminal element calderon could recognize terror when he saw it the wide eyes the mouth neither open nor closed the paralysed facial muscles whats going on he asked for a third time but with no sleep in his voice pure weight nothing she said keeping her back to the laptop but unable to stop the reflex action of her arms fanning out to prevent him from seeing her laptop calderon swept her aside not roughly but she was so light she had to stop her fragile ribs from cracking against the edge of the black granite work surface he saw his camera the lead the thumbnails of the lawyers dinner appearing in the photo library and then plink plink two shots of marisa my present to you it was embarrassing incriminating and worse it was the little boy being found out who is she asked ines her finger ends white against the black granite his look was murderous and in no way offset by the ridiculousness of his nudity who is she that you can stay out all night leaving your wife alone in the marital bed the words incensed him which was iness calculation her fear had vanished she wanted something from himhis concentrated attention who is she that you can whore with her until six in the morning in defiance of your marital vows another calculated sentence using some of the oratory she employed in court he turned on her with the slow intent of an animal whos found a rival on his territory the thickness around his belly the shrivelled penis the slim thighs should have made him laughable but his head was dipped down and his eyes looked up from under his brow his rage was palpable still ines couldnt help herself the taunts leapt from her lips do you fuck her like you fuck me do you make her shout with pain ines did not finish because she was unaccountably on the floor with her feet pedalling against the white marble tiles trying to fight air back into her lungs she focused on his toes the knuckles crimped as they gripped he kicked her his big toe invaded her kidney she bit on air she was shocked it was the first time hed ever hit her shed provoked him shed wanted a reaction but she had been shocked by his restraint shed thought he would lash out backhand her across the face to shut that taunting uxorial mouth fatten her lip bruise her cheek she wanted to wear the badge of his violence to show the world what he was really like and draw some daily remorse from him until the damage faded but hed hit her under the arch of her ribs kicked her in the side her chest creaked as she found the motor memory to breathe again she felt her husbands hand at the back of her head stroking you see he did love her now for the remorse and the tenderness this was just another flingbut he wasnt stroking her he was reaching into her hair he was sheafing it his nails dug into her scalp he shook her head as if she were a dog caught by the scruff and stood up from his crouch she hadnt found her feet and she hung from his hand he dragged her from the kitchen hauled her down the corridor and flung her at the bed she bounced and rolled off to the side three strides and he was on her again she scrambled under the bed it hadnt worked out as shed thought his hand reached for her under the bed grabbing at her nightdress she flinched away from it his face appeared hideous with rage he stood up his feet moved off she watched them as if they were loaded weapons they left the room he swore and slammed the door her scalp burned her fear was overriding all other emotions she couldnt scream she couldnt cry under the bed was good there were childhood memories of safety of observing in secrecy but they couldnt contain her confusion her brain lunged at what she wanted to be certainties but they wouldnt support her instead she found herself trying to accommodate his behaviour she had proved his infidelity to him she had humiliated him he was angry because he felt guilty that was natural you lashed out at the one you loved that was it wasnt it he didnt want to be whoring with that black bitch he just couldnt help himself he was an alpha male a virile highoctane performer she shouldnt be so hard on him she held on to her side and squeezed her eyes shut at a jab of pain in her kidney the door swung open the feet came back into the room his presence made her shrink he took fresh socks and pants from the drawer and put them on he stepped into a pair of trousers and took a crisp white shirt ironed by the laundry where he still sent his clothes he shook it out and drove his arms into the sleeves shot the cuffs he whipped a crimson tie into a perfect knot he was efficient vigorous and precise he rammed those brutal feet into a pair of shoes threw on a jackethis savagery now perfectly disguised im working late tonight he said his tone back to normal the apartment door clicked shut ines crawled out from under the bed and flopped against the wall she sat with her legs splayed out her hands helpless by her sides the first sob jolted her away from the wall sevilletuesday th june hrs falcon came to in the profound darkness of his shuttered bedroom he lay there in his private universe contemplating last nights events after the disappointment at consuelos restaurant the drink with laura had gone better than expected theyd agreed to see each other as friends she was only a little offended that he was ending their affair with as hed told her no other prospect in sight he showered and put on a dark suit and white shirt and folded a tie into his pocket he had meetings planned all morning after hed been to see the medico forense it was a morning of shimmering brilliance with not a cloud in the sky the rain had cleansed the atmosphere of all that puzzling electricity a temperature gauge outside in the street told him it was c while the radio warned that a great heat was about to descend on seville and by evening they should expect temperatures in excess of c the forensic institute was next to the hospital de la macarena behind the andalucian parliament which itself looked across the road to the basilica de la macarena just inside the old city walls at am falcon was early but the medico forense had already arrived dr pintado had the file open on his desk and was reminding himself of the detail of the autopsy they shook hands sat down and he resumed his reading what i concentrated on in this case he said still scanning the pages apart from the cause of death which was straightforwardhe was poisoned with potassium cyanidewas giving you as much help as possible on the identification of the body potassium cyanide said falcon thats not exactly in keeping with the ruthlessness of the postmortem operations was it injected no ingested said pintado other things on his mind the facei might be able to help you with that or rather i have a friend who is interested in helping you remember i was telling you about a case i handled in bilbao where they made a facial model from a skull found in a shallow grave it cost a fortune thats right and you dont get resources like that for any old murder so how much does your friend cost hes free and who is he hes a sort of sculptor but hes not that interested in the body just faces would i have heard of him no hes strictly amateur his name is miguel covo hes seventyfour years old and retired said pintado but hes been working with faces for nearly sixty years he builds them out of clay makes moulds for wax and carves them out of stone although thats quite a recent development whats he proposing and why is it free well hes never done this kind of thing before but he wants to try said pintado i let him take a plaster cast of the head last night ok so theres no decision said falcon hell make up a halfdozen models do some sketches and then start working up the face hell paint it too and give it hairreal hair his studio can give you the creeps especially if he likes you and introduces you to his mother ive always got on well with mothers he keeps her in a cupboard said dr pintado just a model of her i mean it would be cruel to keep a woman in her nineties in a cupboard she died when he was small which was when his fascination with faces started he wanted the photographs of her to be more real so he recreated her it was the only time he fashioned a body shes in that cupboard with real hair makeup her own clothes and shoes so hes weird too of course he is said pintado but likeably weird you might not want to invite him to dinner with the comisario and his wife though why not said falcon it would make a change from the opera anyway hell call you when he has something butnot tomorrow what else have you got its all helpful but not as helpful as a physical image said pintado i worked with a guy who did forensics on mass graves in bosnia and i learnt a bit from him the first thing is dental ive made a full set of digital xrays and notes about each tooth hes had extensive orthodontic work done to get the teeth all straight and looking perfect how old is this guy mid forties and normally youd have that sort of work done in your early teens exactly and there wasnt a lot of orthodontic work being done in spain in the mid seventies most likely it was done in america said pintado apart from that theres nothing much else to go on dentally hes had no major work done and only a molar missing on the lower right side have you found any distinguishing marks on the outside of the bodymoles birthmarks no but i did come across something interesting on his hands forgive me doctor but i know they were severed but i checked the lymph nodes to see what was deposited there said pintado im sure our friend had a small tattoo on each hand i dont suppose theres a snapshot of it in the lymph node asked falcon lymph nodes are quite clever about killing bacteria and neutralizing toxins but their talent for recreating images from tattoo ink introduced into the bloodstream via the hand is extremely limited there was a trace of ink and that was all what about surgery theres good news and bad there said pintado hes had surgery but it was a hernia operation which is just about the worlds most common procedure his was also the most common type of inguinal hernia so he has a scar on the right side of his pubis id guess it was about three years old but ill get one of the vascular surgeons to come over and confirm that for me then well take a look at the mesh they used to patch the hernia and hopefully hell be able to tell me who supplied it then you can find the hospitals they supplyand i know its going to take a lot of work and time maybe he had that done in america as well said falcon like i said good news and bad what about his hair asked falcon they scalped him he had hair that was at least long enough to cover his collar how do you get that hes been on the beach this year said pintado turning some photographs around for falcon to look at you can see the tan lines on his arms and legs but if you turn him over you dont see any tan line at the back of his neck in fact if you look its quite white compared to the rest of his back which to me means that it rarely sees the sun would you describe him as white asked falcon his skin colour didnt look northern european to me no hes oliveskinned do you think he was spanish without doing any genetic testing i would say that he was mediterranean any scars nothing significant said pintado hed sustained a fracture to his skull but its years old anything interesting about the structure of his body that would give us an idea of what he did well he wasnt a bodybuilder said pintado spine shoulder and elbows indicate a deskbound sedentary life id say that his feet didnt spend much time in shoes the heels are more splayed than usual with a lot of hardened skin as you said he liked the sun said falcon he also smoked cannabis and i would say he was a regular user which could be thought of as unusual in someone in his mid forties said pintado kids smoke dope but if youre still doing it in your forties its because its your milieuyoure an artist or a musician or hanging out with that sort of crowd so hes a desk worker with long hair who spent time in the sun not wearing shoes and smoking dope a hardworking hippy they might have been like that in the seventies but its not the profile of a modernday drug smuggler said falcon and potassium cyanide would be an unusual method of execution for people with mm handguns in their waistbands the two men sat back from the desk falcon flicked through the photographs from the file hoping that something else might jump out at him he was already thinking about the university and the bellas artes but he didnt want to confine himself at this early stage in this momentary silence the two men looked up at each other as if they were on the brink of the same idea from beyond the grey walls of the facultad de medicina came the unmistakable boom of a significant explosion not far away gloria alanis was ready for work by this time she would normally be on her way to her first client meeting thinking how much as it receded in the rearview mirror she hated the drab seventies apartment block where she lived in the barrio of el cerezo she was a sales rep for a stationery company but her area of operation was huelva on the first tuesday of every month there was a meeting of the sales team at the head office in seville followed by a teambuilding exercise a lunch and then a miniconference to show and discuss new products and promotions it meant that for one day during the month she could put breakfast on the table for her husband and two children she could also take her eightyearold daughter lourdes to school while her husband delivered their threeyearold son pedro to the preschool which was visible from the back window of their fifthfloor apartment on this morning instead of hating her apartment she was looking down on the heads of her children and husband and feeling an unusual sensation of warmth and affection early in the week her husband sensed this grabbed her and pulled her on to his lap fernando she said warning him in case he tried anything too salacious in front of the children i was thinking he whispered in her ear his lips tickling her lobe its always dangerous when you start doing that she said smiling at the children who were now interested i was thinking there should be more of us he whispered gloria fernando lourdes pedro and youre crazy she said loving those lips on her ear saying these things we always talked about having four didnt we but that was before we knew how much two cost she said now we work all day and still dont have enough money to get out of this apartment or take a holiday i have a secret he said she knew he didnt if its a lottery ticket i dont want to see it its not a lottery ticket she knew what it was wild hope my god he said suddenly looking at his watch hey pedro weve got to get going man tell us the secret said the children he lifted gloria up and put her on her feet if i tell you that its not a secret any more he said you have to wait for the secret to be revealed tell us now this evening he said kissing lourdes on the head and taking pedros tiny hand gloria went to the door with them she kissed pedro who was staring at his feet and not much interested she kissed her husband on the mouth and whispered on his lips i hate you by this evening youll love me again she went back to the breakfast table and sat opposite lourdes there were another fifteen minutes before they had to leave they spent a few minutes looking at one of lourdes drawings before going to the window fernando and pedro appeared below in the car park in front of the preschool they waved fernando held pedro above his head and he waved back having delivered the boy to school fernando walked off between the apartment blocks to the main road to catch the bus to work gloria turned back into the room lourdes was already at the table working on another drawing gloria sipped her coffee and played with her daughters silky hair fernando and his secrets he played these games to keep them amused and their hopes up that they would eventually be able to buy their own apartment but the property prices had exploded and they now knew that they would be renting for the rest of their lives gloria was never going to be anything other than a rep and though fernando kept saying he was going to take a plumbing course he still needed to make the money he did as a labourer on the construction site theyd been lucky to find this apartment with such a cheap rent they were lucky to have two healthy children as fernando said we might not be rich but we are lucky and luck will serve us better than all the money in the world she didnt immediately associate the shuddering tremor beneath her feet with the booming crash that came from the outside world it was a noise so loud that her rib cage seemed to clutch at her spine and drive the air out of her lungs the coffee cup jumped out of her hand and broke on the floor mama screamed lourdes but there was nothing for gloria to hear she saw only her daughters wideeyed horror and grabbed her terrible things happened simultaneously windows shattered cracks and giant fissures opened up in the walls daylight appeared where it shouldnt level horizons tilted doorframes folded solid concrete flexed the ceiling crowded the floor walls broke in half water spurted from nowhere electricity crackled and sparked under broken tiles a wardrobe shot out of sight gravity showed them its remorselessness mother and daughter were falling their small fragile bodies were hurtling downwards in a miasma of bricks steel concrete wire tubing furniture and dust there was no time for words there was no sound because the sound was already so loud it rendered everything else silent there wasnt even any fear because it had all become grossly incomprehensible there was just the sickening plummet the stunning impact and then a vast blackness as of a great receding universe what the fuck was that said pintado falcon knew exactly what it was hed heard an eta car bomb explode when he was working in barcelona this sounded big he kicked back his chair and ran out of the institute without replying to pintados question he punched the jefaturas number into his mobile as he left his first thought was that it was something in the santa justa station the highspeed ave arriving from madrid the railway station was less than a kilometre away to the southeast of the hospital diga said ramirez theres been a bomb jose luis i heard it even out here said ramirez im at the institute it sounded close get me some news hold it falcon ran past the receptionist the mobile pressed to his ear listening to ramirezs feet pounding down the corridor and up the stairs and people shouting in the jefatura the traffic had stopped everywhere drivers and passengers were getting out of their cars looking to the northeast at a plume of black smoke the reports were getting said ramirez panting is that theres been an explosion in an apartment block on the corner of calle blanca paloma and calle los romeros in the barrio of el cerezo wheres that i dont know it it must be close because i can see the smoke ramirez found a wall map and gave rapid instructions is there any report of a gas leak asked falcon knowing this was wildly optimistic like the socalled power surge on the day of the london underground bombings im checking the gas company falcon sprinted through the hospital people were running but there was no panic no shouting they had been training for this moment everyone in a white coat was making for the casualty department orderlies were sprinting with empty trolleys nurses ran with boxes of saline plasma was on the move falcon slammed through endless double doors until he hit the main street and the wall of sound a cacophony of sirens as ambulances swung out into the street the main road was miraculously clear of traffic as he crossed the empty lanes he saw cars pulling up on to pavements there were no police this was the work of ordinary citizens who knew that this stretch of road had to be kept clear to ferry the wounded ambulances careered down the street two abreast whooping and delirious with lights flashing queasily in air that was filling with a greypink dust and smoke that billowed out from behind the apartment blocks at the crossroads bloodstained people stumbled about on their own or were being carried or walked towards the hospital with handkerchiefs tissues and kitchen roll held to foreheads ears and cheeks these were the superficially wounded victims the ones sliced by flying glass and metal the ones some distance from the epicentre who would never make it into the top flight of disaster statistics but who might lose the sight in an eye or their hearing from perforated eardrums bear facial scars for the rest of their lives lose the use of a finger or a hand never walk again without a limp they were being helped by the lucky ones those who didnt even have a scratch as the air whistled with flying glass but who had the images burned on to their minds of someone they knew or loved who had been whole seconds before and was now sliced torn bludgeoned or broken in the blocks of flats leading up to calle los romeros the local police were evacuating the buildings an old man in bloody pyjamas was being led by a boy who had realized his importance a young man holding a crimsonflashed towel to the side of his head stared through falcon his face horribly partitioned by rivulets of blood coagulating with dust he had his arm around his girlfriend who appeared unhurt and was talking at full tilt into her mobile phone the air more dustfilled by the moment was still splintering to the sound of breaking glass as it fell from high shattered windows falcon called ramirez again and told him to organize three or four buses to act as improvised ambulances to ferry the lightly wounded from all these blocks of apartments down the road to the hospital the gas company have confirmed that they supply buildings in that area said ramirez but theres been no report of a leak and they ran a routine test on that block only last month for some reason this doesnt feel like a gas explosion said falcon were getting reports that a preschool behind the destroyed building has been badly damaged by flying debris and there are casualties falcon pressed on up through the walking wounded there were still no signs of serious damage to buildings but the people floating around calling and looking for family members in the spaces at the foot of the emptying apartment blocks were phantasmal dustcovered not themselves the light had turned strange as the sun was scarfed by smoke and a reddish fog there was a smell in the air which was not immediately recognizable to anyone who didnt know war it clogged the nostrils with powdered brick and concrete raw sewage open drains and a disgusting meatiness the atmosphere was vibrant but not with any discernible sound although people were making noisetalking coughing vomiting and groaningit was more of an airborne tinnitus brought about by a collective human alarm at the proximity of death lines of fire engines lights flashing were backed up all the way to avenida san lazaro there wasnt a pane of intact glass in the apartment buildings on the other side of calle los romeros a bottle bank was sticking out of the side of one of the blocks like a huge green plug a wall that ran down the street opposite the stricken building had been blown on to its back and cars were piled up in a garden as if it was a scrapyard the torn stumps of four trees lined the road other vehicles parked on calle los romeros were buried under rubble roofs crumpled windscreens opaque tyres blown out wheel trims off there were clothes strewn everywhere as if thered been a laundry drop from the sky a length of chainlink fencing hung from a fourthfloor balcony firemen had clambered up the nearest cascade of rubble and had their hoses trained on the two remaining sections of what had been a complete lshaped building what was now missing was a twentyfivemetre segment from the middle of it the colossal explosion had brought down all eight floors of the block to form a stack of reinforced concrete pancakes to a height of about six metres framed by the ragged remains of the eight floors of apartments and just visible through the mist of falling dust was the roof of the partially devastated preschool and the apartment blocks beyond whose facades were patched with black and gaping glassless windows a fireman appeared on the edge of a broken room on the eighth floor and in the wartorn air made a sign to show that the building was now clear of people a bed fell from the sixth floor its frame crunched into the piled debris while its mattress bounced off wildly in the direction of the preschool on the other side of the rubble further down calle los romeros was the fire chiefs car but no sign of any officers falcon walked along the collapsed wall and made his way around the block to see what had happened to the preschool the end of the building closest to the explosion had lost two walls part of the roof had collapsed and the rest was hanging ready to drop firemen and civilians were propping the roof while unblinking women stared on in appalled silence hands holding their faces as if to stop them from dropping off in disbelief on the other side at the entrance to the school it was worse four small bodies lay side by side their faces covered with school pinafores a large group of men and women were trying to control two of the mothers of the dead children covered in dust they were like ghosts fighting for the right to go back to the living the women were screaming hysterically and clawing madly against hands trying to prevent them from reaching the inert bodies another woman had fainted and was lying on the ground surrounded by people kneeling to protect her from the swaying and surging crowd falcon looked around for a teacher and saw a young woman sitting on a mat of broken glass blood trickling down the side of her face weeping uncontrollably while a friend tried to console the inconsolable a paramedic arrived to give her wounds some temporary dressing are you a teacher asked falcon of the womans friend do you know where the mother of the fourth child is the woman dazed looked across at the collapsed apartment block shes in there somewhere she said shaking her head only firemen moved around inside the preschool their boots crunching over debris and glass more props came in to support the shattered roof the fire chief was in an undamaged classroom at the back of the school giving a report to the mayors office on his mobile all gas and electricity to the area has been cut off and the damaged building has been evacuated two fires have been brought under control he said weve pulled four dead children out of the preschool their classroom was in the direct path of the explosion and took its full force so far weve had reports of three other deaths two men and a woman who were walking along calle los romeros when the explosion occurred my men have also found a woman who seems to have died from a heart attack in one of the apartment blocks opposite the destroyed building its too difficult to say how many wounded there are at the moment he listened for a moment longer and closed down the phone falcon showed his id youre here very early inspector jefe said the fire chief i was in the forensic institute it sounded like a bomb from there is that what you think to do that sort of damage theres no doubt in my mind that it was a bomb and a very powerful one at that any idea how many people were in that building ive got one of my officers working on that at the moment there were at least seven he said the only thing we cant be sure of is how many were in the mosque in the basement the mosque thats the other reason why im sure this was a bomb said the fire chief there was a mosque in the basement with access from calle los romeros we think that morning prayers had just finished but were not sure if anyone had left were getting conflicting reports on that from the outside sevilletuesday th june hrs desperation had brought consuelo to calle vidrio early the children were being taken to school by her neighbour now she was sitting in her car outside alicia aguados consulting room getting cold feet about the emergency appointment shed arranged only twentyfive minutes earlier she walked the street to calm her nerves she was not someone who had things wrong with her at precisely am having stared at the second hand of her watch chipping away at the secondswhich showed her how obsessive she was becomingshe rang the doorbell dr aguado was waiting for her as she had been for many months she was excited at the prospect of this new patient consuelo walked up the narrow stairs to the consulting room which had been painted a pale blue and was kept at a constant temperature of c although consuelo knew everything about alicia aguado she let the clinical psychologist explain that she was now blind due to a degenerative disease called retinitis pigmentosa and that as a result of this disability she had developed a unique technique of reading a patients pulse why do you need to do that asked consuelo knowing the answer but wanting to put off the moment when they got down to work because im blind i miss out on the most important indicators of the human body which is physiognomy we speak more to each other with our features and bodies than we do with our mouths think how little you would glean from a conversation just by hearing words only if someone was in an extreme state such as fear or anxiety would you understand what they were feeling whereas if you have a face and body you pick up on a whole range of subtleties you can tell the difference between someone who is lying or exaggerating someone whos bored and someone who wants to go to bed with you reading the pulse which i learnt from a chinese doctor and have adapted to my needs enables me to pick up on nuance that sounds like an intelligent way of saying that youre a human polygraph i dont just detect lies said aguado its more to do with undercurrents translating feeling into language can defeat even the greatest of writers so why should it be any easier for an ordinary person to tell me about their emotions especially if theyre in a confused state this is a beautiful room said consuelo already shying away from some of the words shed heard in aguados explanation undercurrents reminded her of her fears of being dragged out into the ocean to die of exhaustion alone in a vast heaving expanse there was too much noise said aguado you know how it is in seville noise was becoming so much of a distraction for me in my state that i had the room doubleglazed and soundproofed it used to be white but i think my patients found white as intimidating as black so i opted for tranquil blue lets sit down shall we they sat in the sshaped lovers seat facing each other she showed consuelo the tape recorder in the armrest explaining that it was the only way for her to review her consultations aguado asked her to introduce herself give her age and any medication she was on so that she could check it was recording properly can you give me a brief medical history since when anything significant since you were bornoperations serious illnesses childrenthat sort of thing consuelo tried to drink the tranquillity of the pale blue walls into her mind she had been hoping for some miraculous surgical strike on her mental disturbances a fabulous technique to yank open the tangled mess and smooth it out into comprehensible strands in her turmoil it hadnt occurred to her that this was going to be a process an intrusive process you seem to be struggling with this question said aguado im just coming to terms with the fact that youre going to turn me inside out nothing leaves this room said aguado we cant even be heard the tapes are locked up in a safe in my office its not that said consuelo i hate to vomit i would rather sweat out my nausea than vomit up the problem this is going to be mental vomiting most people who arrive at my side are here because of something intensely private so private that it might even be a secret from themselves said aguado mental health and physical health are not dissimilar untreated wounds fester and infect the whole body untreated lesions of the mind are no different the only difficulty is that you cant just show me the infected cut you might not know what or where it is the only way for us to find out is by bringing things from the subconscious to the surface of the conscious mind its not vomiting its not expelling poison you bring perhaps painful things to the surface so that we can examine them but they remain yours if anything its more like sweating out your nausea than vomiting ive had two abortions said consuelo decisively the first in the second in both were performed in a london clinic i have had three children ricardo in matias in and dario in those are the only five occasions i have been in hospital are you married not any more my husband died said consuelo stumbling over this first obstacle used to obfuscation of the fact rather than natural openness he was murdered in was that a happy marriage he was thirtyfour years older than me i didnt know this at the time but he married me because i reminded him physically of his first wife who had committed suicide i didnt want to marry him but he was insistent i only agreed when he said that he would give me children quite soon after the marriage he found out or allowed himself to realize that my likeness to his wife stopped at the physical we still stayed together we respected each other especially in business he was a diligent father but as for loving me making me happyno did you hear that asked aguado something outside a big noise like an explosion i didnt hear anything i know about your husbands case of course said aguado it was truly terrible that must have been very traumatic for you and the children it was but its not directly linked to why im sitting here said consuelo that investigation was necessarily intrusive i was a prime suspect he was a wealthy influential man i had a lover the police believed i had a motive my life was turned inside out by the investigation nasty details of my past were revealed such as i had appeared in a pornographic movie when i was seventeen to raise money to pay for my first abortion aguado forced consuelo to relive that ugly slice of her life in great detail and didnt let her stop until shed explained the circumstances of the next pregnancy with a dukes son which had led to the second abortion what do you think of pornography asked alicia i abhor it said consuelo i especially abhorred my need to be involved in it in order to find the money to terminate a pregnancy what do you think pornography is the filming of the biological act of sex is that all it is sex without emotion you described quite strong emotions when you were telling me of disgust and revulsion yes for your partners in the movie no no not at all said consuelo we were all in the same boat us girls and the men needed us to perform its not a highly sexually charged atmosphere on a porn set we were all high on dope to help us get over what we were doing consuelos enthusiasm for her account waned she wasnt getting to the point so who were these strong feelings of anger aimed at asked aguado myself said consuelo hoping that this partial truth might be enough when i asked you what pornography was i dont believe you were telling me what you actually thought said aguado you were giving me a socially acceptable version try answering that question again its sex without love said consuelo hammering the chair its the antithesis of love the antithesis of love is hate its selfhate what else its the desecration of sex what do you think of men and women being filmed having sex with multiple partners asked aguado its perverted what else what do you mean what else i dont know what else you want how often have you thought about the movie since it came to light in your husbands murder investigation i forgot about it until today whats that supposed to mean this isnt a social situation sra jimenez i realize that you mustnt be concerned with what i think of you in that respect said aguado but i dont know what youre trying to get me to admit why are we talking about pornography it was something that came to light in my husbands murder investigation i asked you whether your husbands murder had been traumatic said aguado i see what do you see that the movie coming to light was more traumatic for me than my husbands death not necessarily it was bound up in a traumatic event and in that highly emotionally charged period it made its mark on you consuelo struggled in silence the tangled mess was not unravelling but becoming even more confused youve made appointments with me several times recently and youve never appeared for them said aguado why did you come this morning i love my children said consuelo i love my children so much it hurts where does it hurt asked aguado leaping on to this new revelation youve never had children alicia aguado shrugged it hurts me in the top of my stomach around my diaphragm why does it hurt cant you ever just accept something said consuelo i love them it hurts were here to examine your inner life i cant feel it or see it all i have to go on is how you express yourself and the pulse thing thats what raises the questions said aguado what you say and what i feel in your blood dont always match up are you telling me i dont love my children no im asking you why you say it hurts what is causing you the pain joder its the fucking love that hurts you stupid bitch said consuelo tearing her wrist away ripping her blabbing pulse out from under those questioning fingertips im sorry im really sorry that was unforgivable dont be sorry said aguado this is no cocktail party youre telling me said consuelo look ive always been very firm about telling the truth my children will confirm that this is a different type of truth there is only one truth said consuelo with missionary zeal theres the real truth and the presentable truth said aguado theyre often quite close together but for a few emotional details youve got me wrong there doctor im not like that ive seen things ive done things and ive faced up to them all that is why youre here youre calling me a liar and a coward youre telling me i dont know who i am im asking questions and youre doing your best to answer them but youve just told me that what im saying and what youre feeling in my pulse dont match therefore you are calling me a liar i think weve had enough for today said aguado thats a lot of ground to have covered in the first session id like to see you again very soon is this a good time of day for you the morning or late afternoon is probably the best time in the restaurant business you think im coming back for any more of this shit said consuelo heading for the door swinging her bag over her shoulder think againblind bitch she slammed the door on the way out and nearly went over on her heel in the cobbled street she got into her car jammed the keys into the ignition but didnt start the engine she hung on to the steering wheel as if it was the only thing that would stop her falling off the edge of her sanity she cried she cried until it hurt in exactly the same place as it did when she was watching her children sleeping angel and manuela were sitting out on the roof terrace in the earlymorning sunshine having breakfast manuela sat in a white towelling robe examining her toes angel blinked with irritation as he read one of his articles in the abc theyve cut a whole paragraph said angel some stupid subeditor is making my journalism look like the work of a fool i can hear myself getting fat said manuela barely thinking her whole being consumed by the business that was to take place later that morning im going to have to spend the rest of my life in a tracksuit im wasting my time said angel im just messing about writing drivel for idiots no wonder they cut it im going to paint my nails said manuela what do you think pink or red or something wild to distract people from my bottom thats it said angel tossing the newspaper across the terrace im finished with this shit and that was when they heard it a distant but significant boom they looked at each other all immediate concerns gone from their minds manuela couldnt stop herself from saying the obvious what the hell was that that said angel getting to his feet so suddenly that the chair collapsed beneath him was a large explosion but where the sound came from the north oh shit angel shit shit shit shit shit what said angel expecting to see her with red nail polish all over her foot it cant possibly have slipped your mind already said manuela weve been up half the night talking about it the two properties in the plaza moraviawhich is north of where were standing now it wasnt that close said angel that was outside the city walls thats the thing about journalists said manuela theyre so used to having their fingers on the pulse that they think they know everything even how far away an explosion is id have saidoh my god do you think that was in the estacion de santa justa thats east she said pointing vaguely over the rooftops north is the parliament building he said looking at his watch there wont be anybody there at this time apart from a few expendable cleaners said manuela angel stood in front of the tv flicking from channel to channel until he found canal sur we have some breaking news of a large explosion to the north of sevillesomewhere in the area of el cerezo eyewitnesses say that an apartment block has been completely destroyed and a nearby preschool has been badly damaged we have no reports of the cause of the explosion or the number of casualties el cerezo said angel whats in el cerezo nothing said manuela cheap apartment blocks its probably a gas explosion youre right its a residential area not every loud noise you hear has to be a bomb after march th and the london bombings our minds move in natural directions said angel opening up a street map of seville well youre always wanting something to happen and now it has youd better find out if it was gas or terrorism but whatever you do angel dont give el cerezo is two kilometres from here he said cutting through her rising hysteria you said it yourself its a cheap residential area its got nothing to do with what youre trying to sell in the plaza moravia if that was a terrorist bomb it doesnt matter where it went offthe whole city will be nervous one of my buyers is a foreigner making an investment investors react to this kind of thing ask me if you likei am one did the madrid property market crash after march th asked angel keep calm manuela it was probably gas the bomb could have detonated accidentally while they were preparing it she said they might have blown themselves up because they realized that they were about to be raided by the police call javier said angel stroking the back of her neck hell know something falcon called his immediate boss the jefe de brigada de policia judicial comisario pedro elvira to give his initial report that the fire chief was almost certain this level of destruction was caused by a significant bomb and gave the number of casualties so far elvira had just come out of a meeting with his boss sevilles most senior policeman the jefe superior de la policia de sevilla comisario andres lobo who had appointed him to lead the entire investigative operation he also confirmed that the magistrado juez decano de sevilla had just appointed esteban calderon as the juez de instruccion in charge of directing the investigation three companies had been contacted to supply demolition crews to start removing the rubble and to work with rescue teams who were already on their way to try to find any survivors as quickly as possible falcon made a number of requests aerial photography before the huge crime scene became too contaminated by the rescue and demolition operation he also asked for a large police presence to cordon off nearly a square kilometre around the building so that they could investigate every vehicle in the vicinity if it was a bomb it had to have been transported and the vehicle could still be there when they started searching suspect vehicles they would also need a team of forensics and a unit from the bomb squad elvira confirmed everything back to him and hung up the fire chief was a man in his moment hed trained for this terrible day and brought the immediate calamity under control in less than ninety minutes he accompanied falcon to the edge of the destruction on the way he ordered a crew of firemen to stop work on supporting the roof of the destroyed classroom so that the bomb squad could see how the explosion had affected the building he talked falcon through the architecture of the destroyed apartment block and how enormous the explosion must have been to blow out the four main supporting pillars for that section the effect of that would have brought the sudden and phenomenal weight of all the reinforced concrete floors on to the skin walls between each storey there would have been an accumulative weight and acceleration as each level fell from a greater and greater height nobody could have survived that collapse he said were praying for miracles here why are you so certain that this couldnt have been a gas explosion apart from the fact that theres been no reported leak and weve only had to deal with two small fires the mosque in the basement is in daily use gas is heavier than air and would accumulate at the lowest point a large enough quantity of gas couldnt have accumulated without anybody noticing he said added to that the gas would have had to collect in a big enough space before exploding its power would be dissipated our main problem would have been incendiary rather than destruction there would have been a massive fireball which would have scorched the whole area there would have been burns victims a bomb explodes from a small confined source it therefore has far more concentrated destructive power only a very large bomb or several smaller bombs could have taken out those reinforced concrete supporting pillars most of the dead and injured weve seen so far have been hit by flying debris and glass all the windows in the area have been blown out its all consistent with a bomb blast at the edge of the destruction the light was bruised and sickly yellow the pulverized brick and concrete formed a fine dust which clogged the throat and nostrils with the stench of decay from within the stacked floors came the repetitive desperate sounds of mobile phone jingles the same customized tunes begging to be answered here rather than being an irritant they had personality the fire chief shook his head its the worst thing he said listening to someone elses hope fading away falcon almost jumped as his own mobile vibrated against his thigh manuela he said walking away from the fire chief are you all right little brother she asked yes but im busy i know she said just tell me one thing was it a bomb weve had no confirmation i dont want the official communique she said im your sister i dont want angel running off to the abc with a quote from the inspector jefe at the scene this is for my ears only dont be ridiculous just tell me javier we think it was a bomb fuck falcon hung up in a fury without saying goodbye men women and children had died and been injured families had been destroyed along with homes and possessions but manuela still needed to know which way the property market was going to tip sevilletuesday th june hrs a figure sprinted between falcon and the fire chief as he closed down his mobile the man stumbled into the rubble at the foot of the fallen building picked himself up and ran at the stacked pancakes of the reinforced concrete floors his scale was strangely diminished by the vastness of the collapse he seemed like a puppet as he dithered to the left and right trying to find a purchase point in the tangle of cracked concrete bristling steel rods ruptured netting and shattered brick the fire chief shouted at him he didnt hear he plunged his hands into the wreckage swung his body up and hooked his leg over a thick steel rod but he was a horribly human mixture of crazed strength overwhelmed by futility by the time they got to him he was hanging helpless his palms already torn and bloody his face distorted by the rawness of his pain they lifted him off his ghastly perch like soldiers removing a comrade from the wire of the front line no sooner had they got him down than he recovered his strength and lunged at the building once more falcon had to tackle him around the legs to hold him back they scrabbled over the rubble like an ancient articulated insect until falcon managed to crawl up the mans body and clasp his arms to his chest you cant go in there he said his voice rasping from the dust the man grunted and flexed his arms against falcons embrace his mouth was wide open his eyes stared into the mangled mess of the building and sweat beaded in fat drops on his filthy face who do you know who is in there asked falcon on the back of the mans grunting came two wordswife daughter which floor asked the fire chief the man looked up at them blinking as if this question demanded some complicated differential calculus gloria said the man lourdes but which floor asked the fire chief the mans head went limp all fight gone falcon released him and rolled him on to his back do you know anybody else in there apart from gloria and lourdes asked falcon the mans head listed to one side and his dark eyes took in the damaged end of the preschool he sat up got to his feet and trod robotically through the rubble and household detritus between the apartment block and the preschool falcon followed the man stood at the point where there should have been a wall the classroom was a turmoil of broken furniture and shards of glass and on the far wall fluttering in a breeze were childrens paintingsbig suns mad smiles hair standing on end the mans feet crunched through the glass he tripped and fell heavily over a twisted desk but righted himself immediately and made for the paintings he pulled one off the wall and looked at it with the intensity of a collector judging a masterpiece there was a tree a sun a high building and four peopletwo big two small in the bottom righthand corner was a name written in an adult handpedro the man folded it carefully and put it inside his shirt the three men went into the main corridor of the school and out through the entrance the local police had arrived and were trying to clear a path for the ambulance to remove the four bodies of the dead children taken from the destroyed classroom two of the mothers kneeling at the feet of their children gave a hysterical howl at this latest development the third mother had already been taken away a woman with a thick white bandage on the side of her face through which the blood underneath was just beginning to bloom recognized the man fernando she said the man turned to her but didnt recognize her im marta pedros teacher she said fernando had lost the power of speech he took the painting out of his shirt and pointed at the smallest figure martas motor reflexes seemed to malfunction and she couldnt swallow what was in her throat nor articulate what was in her mind instead her face just caved in and she only managed to squeeze out a sound of such brutality and ugliness that it left fernandos chest shuddering it was a sound uncontrolled by any civilizing influence it was grief in its purest form before its pain had been made less acute by time or more poignant by poetry it was a dark guttural heaving clot of emotion fernando was not affronted he folded the painting up and put it back in his shirt falcon led him by the arm to the four small bodies the ambulance was backing up the rest of the crowd had been squeezed out of the scene two paramedics appeared with two body bags each they worked quickly because they knew the situation would be better with those pitiful bodies removed falcon held fernando around the shoulders as the paramedics uncovered each body and placed it in a body bag he had to remind fernando to breathe at the third body fernandos knees buckled and falcon lowered him to the ground where he fell forward on to all fours and crawled around like a poisoned dog looking for a place to die one of the paramedics shouted and pointed a tv cameraman had come around the back through the preschool and was filming the bodies he turned and ran before anybody could react the ambulance moved off the ghostly crowd surged after it and gave up with a final spasm of grief before dissolving into groups with the bereaved women supported from all sides television journalists and their cameramen tried to force their way in to talk to the women they were rebuffed falcon pulled fernando to his feet pushed him back into the preschool out of sight and went to find a policeman to keep journalists away outside a journalist had found a young guy in his twenties with a couple of bloody nicks in his cheek whod been there when the bomb exploded the camera was right in his face inches away the proximity giving the pictures their urgency straight after it happened i mean the noiseyou just cant believe the loudness of that noise it was so loud i couldnt breathe it was like what was it like asked the journalist an eager young woman stabbing the microphone back into his face tell us tell spain what it was like it was like the noise took away all the air what was the first thing you noticed after the explosion after the noise silence he said just a deathly quiet and i dont know whether this was in my head or it actually happened i heard bells ringing church bells yes church bells but they were all crazy as if the shock waves of the explosion were making them ring you know at random it made me sick to hear it it was as if everything had gone wrong with the world and nothing would be the same the rest was lost in the clatter and thump of a helicopters rotor blades thrashing away at the dust in the air it went up higher to take in the whole scene this was the aerial photography falcon had ordered up he posted a policeman at the entrance of the school but found that fernando had disappeared he crossed the corridor to the wrecked classroom empty he called ramirez as he crashed through the broken furniture where are you asked falcon weve just arrived were on calle los romeros is cristina with you were all here the whole squad all of you come round to the preschool now fernando was back at the wall of rubble and collapsed floors he threw himself at it like a madman he tore at the concrete bricks window frames and hurled them behind him rescue teams working on this side roared ramirez over the noise of the helicopter there are dogs in the wreckage get over here fernando had grabbed at the steel netting of a shattered reinforced concrete floor he had his feet braced against the rubble his neck muscles stood out and his carotid arteries appeared as thick as cord falcon pulled him off and they fought for some moments tripping and floundering about in the dust and rubble until they were ghosts of their former selves have you got glorias phone number roared falcon they were panting in the choking atmosphere their sweating faces caked with grey white and brown dust which swirled around them from the choppers blades the question transfixed fernando despite hearing all these mobile phones ringing his mind was so paralysed with shock he hadnt thought of his own he ripped it out of his pocket he squeezed life into the starter button the helicopter moved off leaving an immense silence fernando blinked his brain fluttering like torn flags trying to remember his pin it came to him and he thumbed in glorias number he stood up from his kneeling position and walked towards the wreckage he held a hand up as if demanding silence from the world from his left came the faint tinny sound of some cuban piano thats her he roared moving left she was on this side of the building whenwhen i last saw her falcon got to his feet and made a futile attempt to dust himself down just as his homicide squad turned up he stayed them with his hand and moved towards the tinkling piano which he recognized as a song called lagrimas negrasblack tears shes there roared fernando shes in there baena a junior detective from falcons squad ran back and fetched a rescue team with a dog the team pinpointed the spot from where the ringing tone was coming and managed to get fernando to tell them that his wife and daughter had been on the fifth floor they gave him steady looks when he released that information in the face of his radiant hope not one of them had the heart to tell him that the fall with three storeys coming down on top meant that at this moment they were praying only shes in there he said to their still expressionless faces that mobile is always with her shes a sales rep lagrimas negras was her favourite song falcon nodded to cristina ferrera and they guided fernando back to the preschool and got a nurse to clean him up and dress his cuts falcon called the homicide squad into the school latrines he washed his hands and face and looked at them in the mirror this is going to be the most complicated investigation that any of us have ever been involved in and that includes me said falcon nothing is straightforward in terrorist attacks we know that from what happened on march th in madrid there are going to be a lot of people involvedthe cnis intelligence agents the cgis antiterrorist squad the bomb disposal teams and usand thats just on the investigative side what weve got to do is keep it clear in our minds what we as the homicide squad are trying to achieve ive already asked for a police cordon to keep the site clear for us theyre in place said ramirez theyre working on getting the journalists out falcon turned to face them shaking his wet hands by now you all know that there was a mosque in the basement of that block our job is not to speculate on what happened and why our job is to find out who went into that mosque and who came out and what went on inside it in the last twentyfour hours and then fortyeight hours and so on we do that by talking to every possible witness we can find our other crucial task is to find out about every vehicle in the vicinity the bomb was big it would have had to be transported to this place if that vehicle is still here we have to find it at the moment the first task is going to be difficult with all the occupants of the apartments evacuated from their buildings so our priority is to identify all vehicles and their owners jose luis will divide you up and you will search every sector starting with cars closest to the collapsed building cristina youll stay with me for the moment and remember everybody here is suffering in some way whether theyve lost somebody or seen them injured whether theyve had their home destroyed or their windows smashed youve got a heavy workload and youre going to be under a lot of pressure with or without the media on your backs youll get more information by being sensitive and understanding than by treating this as the usual process youre all good people which is why youre in the homicide squadnow go out there and find out what happened they filed out ferrera stayed behind falcon washed his hair under the tap and then wiped his face and hands his name is fernando his wife and daughter were in the collapsed apartment block his son was one of the children killed in the blast find out if he has any other family and if not any close friends not anybody will do he left home after his breakfast to find out half an hour later that hes lost everything when it comes home to him hes going to lose his mind and you want me to stay with him i cant afford that i want you to make sure hes safely delivered into the hands of a trauma team who should be along any minute he needs his predicament explained hes lost the ability to articulate hell want to stay here until the bodies are found but dont lose track of him i want to know where he ends up they left the latrines a bomb squad team was picking its way through the shattered classroom like mineral fossickers looking for valuable rocks they filled polypropylene sacks with their finds there were two more teams outside working furiously so that the machinery could move in to start the demolition task and the search for survivors cristina ferrera went into the classroom where the nurse was just finishing dressing fernandos cuts she knew why falcon had chosen her for this job the nurse was doing her best with fernando but he wasnt responding his brain was teeming with bigger darker fish the nurse finished and packed up cristina asked her to send someone from a trauma team as soon as possible she sat on a chair by the blackboard at some distance from fernando she didnt want to crowd him even though it was obvious that he was living inside his head at an intensity that excluded the outside world grief darkened as quickly as hope lightened his face like clouds passing over fields who are you he asked after some minutes as if noticing her for the first time im a policewoman my name is cristina ferrera there was a man before who was he that was my boss javier falcon hes the inspector jefe of the homicide squad hes got some work on his hands hes a good man said ferrera an unusual man hell get to the bottom of it we all know who it is though dont we not yet the moroccans its too early to say you ask around weve all thought about it ever since march th weve watched them going in there and weve been waiting into the mosque you mean the mosque in the basement thats right theyre not all moroccans who go to mosques you know plenty of spaniards have converted to islam i work in construction he said uninterested in her balanced approach i put together buildings like that much better buildings than that i work with steel in seville yes i build apartments for rich young professionalsthats what im told anyway fernandos head had been turned upside down and now he was trying to put the furniture straight except that occasionally he noticed the furnitures emptiness and it tipped his mind back into the abyss of loss and grief he tried to talk about building work but got lost in moments of imagination as he saw his wife and daughter falling through steel and concrete he wanted to get out of himself out of his body and head and intowhere where could the mind go for respite a helicopter battering the air overhead knocked his thoughts into another pattern do you have children he asked a boy and a girl she said how old the boys sixteen the girls fourteen good kids he said not a question more of a hope theyre both being difficult at the moment she said their father died about three years ago its not been easy for them im sorry he said but wanting her tragedy to bury his own for a while how did he die he died of a rare type of cancer thats hard for your kids fathers are good for them at that age he said they like to try things out on their mothers to give themselves the confidence to rebel against the world thats what gloria told me anyway they need fathers to show them its not as easy as they think you might be right gloria says im a good father your wife yes my wife he said can you tell me about your own kids she asked he couldnt there were no words for them he measured them out with a hand up from the floor he pointed out of the window at the destroyed apartment block and finally he pulled the painting out from his shirt that said it allsticks and triangles a tall rectangle with windows a round green tree and behind it a massive orange sun in a blue sky a colossal crane arrived preceded by a bulldozer which cleared the land in between the destroyed block and the preschool two tipper trucks manoeuvred around the back of the crane and a digger began to scoop rubble and dump it in the tippers in the cleared land the crane settled its feet and a team of men in yellow hard hats began preparing the rig around the front of the building on calle los romeros a change of clothes had arrived from the jefatura for falcon the rest of the homicide squad were busy working with the local police identifying vehicles and their owners comisario elvira had turned up in full uniform and was being given a tour of the site by the fire chief as he moved around his assistant called all the team leaders involved in the operation to a meeting in one of the classrooms in the preschool as the entourage headed for the preschool a woman approached elvira and gave him a list with twelve names on it and who are these people asked elvira they are the names of all the men in the mosque at the time of the explosion not including the imam abdelkrim benaboura she said my name is esperanza im spanish my partner who is also spanish was in the mosque i represent the wives mothers and girlfriends of these men we are in hiding the women especially the moroccan women are scared that people may think that their husbands and sons were in some way responsible for what has happened theres a mobile number on the back of the list we would ask you to call us when you have some news of theirof anything she moved away and the pressure of time and lack of personnel meant that elvira let her go unfollowed calderon made his way through the crowd to falcon i didnt realize it was you javier he said shaking him by the hand how did you get into that state i had to stop someone from throwing himself into the wreckage to rescue his wife and daughter so this is the big one said calderon not bothering to engage with what falcon had said its finally happened to us they continued to the school where the police judges fire brigade bomb squad rescue services trauma units medical services and demolition gangs were all represented elvira made it clear that nobody was allowed to say a word until he had delivered the plan of action to focus their attention he asked the leader of the bomb squad to give a brief report on the initial analyses of fragments from the blast they showed that the apartment block had been devastated by a bomb of extraordinary power most probably situated in the basement of that section of the building and whose explosive was probably of military rather than commercial quality this expert opinion silenced the assembled company completely and elvira was able to hammer out a coordinated plan in about forty minutes at the end of the meeting ramirez headed falcon off as he was making for the latrines to change his clothes weve got something he said talk me through it while i change as soon as he was dressed falcon found comisario elvira and juez calderon and asked ramirez to repeat what hed just told him in the immediate vicinity of the building excluding vehicles buried in the rubble weve found three stolen cars plus this van said ramirez its parked right outside the preschool here its a peugeot partner registered in madrid theres a copy of the koran on the front seat we cant see in the back because its a closed van and the rear windows have been shattered but the owner of the vehicle is a man called mohammed soumaya sevilletuesday th june hrs the car park was directly behind the destroyed building and next to the preschool there were some trees which provided a canopy to a sitting area near calle blanca paloma on one side and a fivestorey apartment block on the other there was only one access road to the car park while calderon elvira falcon and ramirez made for the peugeot partner elviras assistant logged on to the police terror suspects list and entered mohammed soumayas details he was in the lowest risk category which meant that he had no known connections to any body organization or persons with either terror or radical islamic background the only reason he was on the list was that he fitted the most basic terrorist profile under forty years of age a devout muslim and single elviras assistant entered the names from the list of all the men in the mosque at the time of the explosion which had been given by the spanish woman esperanza there was no mohammed soumaya among them he patched the names through to the cnithe spanish intelligence agency two breakdown vehicles were working in the car park to remove cars whose owners had been identified and screened most of these cars had windows smashed and bodywork damage from flying debris the peugeot partners two rear windows were opaque with shattered glass and the rear doors were dented the side windows were clear and the windscreen which had been facing away from the explosion was intact the copy of the koran a new spanish edition was visible on the front passenger seat two forensics in white hooded boiler suits and latex gloves were standing by there was a discussion about booby traps and a bomb squad team was called over along with a dog handler the dog found nothing interesting around the car the underside and engine compartment were inspected and found clear the bomb squad man picked the glass out of one of the smashed rear windows and inspected inside the rear doors were opened and shots taken of the empty interior and its carpeted floor a fine crystalline white powder which covered an area of about cm by cm had been spilled on the floor the excited sniffer dog leapt in and immediately sat down by the powder one of the forensics took a handheld vacuum cleaner with a clear plastic flask attached and hoovered up the powder the flask was removed from the vacuum cleaner capped and given an evidence number the forensics moved round to the front of the car and bagged the new copy of the koran whose spine was unbroken in the glove compartment they found another copy of the koran this was a heavily used spanish translation with copious notes in the margins it proved to be exactly the same edition as the one found on the front seat this was bagged as were the vehicle documents falcon took a note of the isbn and bar codes of both books under the passenger seat was an empty mineral water bottle and a black cotton sack which contained a carefully folded greenandwhite sash whose length was covered in arabic writing there was also a black hood with eye and mouth holes lets not get too excited until weve had an analysis of that powder in the back said calderon his occupation is shop owner it could just as easily be sugar not if my dog sat down next to it said the bomb squad man hes never wrong wed better get in touch with madrid and have someone visit mohammed soumayas home and business premises said falcon and ramirez moved off to make the call we want detail about his movements over the last fortyeight hours as well youre going to have a job on your hands just to find all these people who had a view of this car park and the front and rear of the destroyed building said calderon as the bomb squad guy said it was a big bomb which means a lot of explosive arrived here possibly in small lots and maybe from a number of different suppliers and at different times were going to need to know whether the mosque or any of the people in the mosque were the subject of surveillance by the cgis antiterrorist squad or the cnis intelligence agents and if they were wed like that information said falcon and by the way where are they i didnt see anybody from the cgi in that meeting the cni are on their way down here now said elvira and the cgi asked calderon theyre in lockdown said elvira quietly what does that mean said calderon it will be explained to us when the cni get here said elvira how much longer will it be before the fire brigade and the bomb squad can declare all these apartment blocks surrounding the destroyed building safe asked falcon at least if people can come back to their homes weve got a chance of building up our information quickly they know that said elvira and theyve told me that they should be letting people back in within the next few hours as long as they dont find anything else in the meantime a contact numbers been issued to the press tv and radio for people to call in with information except that they dont know of the peugeot partners importance yet said falcon were not going to get anywhere until people get back into their apartments the mayor whod been stuck in traffic as the city had ground to a halt finally arrived in the car park he was joined by ministers of the andalucian parliament who had just come from the hospital where theyd been filmed talking to some of the victims a gaggle of journalists had been allowed through the police cordon and they gathered around the officials while camera crews set up their equipment with the destruction providing the devastating backdrop elvira went across to the mayor to give his situation report and was intercepted by his own assistant they talked elvira pointed him across to falcon only three of the twelve names given to us on that list appear on the terror suspect database said the assistant and theyre all in the lowest risk category five of the twelve were over sixtyfive morning prayers isnt such a popular time with the young as most people have to get to work not exactly the classic profile of a terrorist cell said falcon but then we dont know who else was in there yet how many under the age of thirtyfive asked calderon four said the assistant and of those two are brothers one of whom is severely disabled in a wheelchair and another is a spanish convert called miguel botin and the remaining three four including the imam who isnt on the list the woman gave us hes fiftyfive and the other three are in their forties two of them are claiming disability benefit from the state after suffering industrial accidents and the third is another spanish convert well they dont sound like a special forces unit do they said calderon there is one interesting point the imam is on the terror suspect database hes been in spain since september arriving from tunis and before that thats the point i dont have the clearance for that level of information maybe the comisario does he said and went to rejoin the media scrum around the mayor how can somebody be in a lowrisk category and yet have a higher level of clearance for his history asked ramirez lets look at the certainties or the almost certainties said juez calderon we have a bomb explosion whose epicentre seems to be the mosque in the basement of the building we have a van belonging to mohammed soumaya a lowrisk category terroristwho we are not sure was in the building at the time of the blast his van bears traces of explosive according to the bomb squad dog we have a list of twelve people in the mosque at the time plus the imam only three plus the imam make it on to a list of lowrisk category terror suspects we are investigating the deaths of four children in the preschool and three people outside the apartment block at the time of the explosion anything else the hood the sash the two copies of the koran said ramirez we should get all those notes in the margins of the used copy of the koran looked at by an expert said calderon now what are the questions we want answered did mohammed soumaya drive this van here if not who did if that powder is confirmed as explosive then what was it why was it being gathered here and why did it detonate said falcon while we wait to hear from madrid about soumaya well build up a picture of what happened in and around this mosque over the last week we can start by asking people whether they remember this van arriving how many people were in it did they see it being unloaded and so on can we get a shot of soumaya ramirez who was on the phone again trying to sort out someone to look at the copy of the koran nodded and twirled an index finger to show that he was on to it a policewoman came from the wreckage site and informed calderon that the first body in the collapsed building had been foundan old woman on the eighth floor they agreed to reconvene in a couple of hours ramirez came off the phone as cristina ferrera arrived from the preschool it was agreed that ramirez would continue working on the vehicle identification with subinspector perez serrano and baena falcon and cristina ferrera would start trying to find the occupants of the fivestorey apartment building with the best view of the car park where the peugeot partner had been left they went down the street towards the police cordon where a group of people had gathered waiting to be able to get back into their apartments how was fernando by the time you left him asked falcon i didnt catch his surname fernando alanis she said he was more or less under control considering what had happened to him weve exchanged numbers has he got anybody he can go to not in seville she said his parents are up north and too old and sick his sister lives in argentina his wifes family didnt approve of the marriage friends his life was his family she said does he know what hes going to do ive told him he can come and stay with me you didnt have to do that cristina hes not your responsibility you knew id offer though didnt you inspector jefe she said if the situation demanded it i was going to put him up at my place said falcon youve got to go to work the kidsyou dont have any room he needs a sense of what hes lost she said and whod look after him at your place my housekeeper said falcon you wont believe me but i really did not intend for that to happen we have to pull together or we let them win by falling apart she said and you always choose me for this type of workonce a nun always a nun i dont remember saying that but you remember thinking it and didnt you say that we werent just foot soldiers in the fight against crime said ferrera but that were here to help as well were the crusading detectives of andalucia jose luis would laugh in your face if he heard you say that said falcon and you should be very wary of using words like that in this investigation fernando was already accusing the moroccans she said ever since march th theyve been watching them go into that mosque and wondering thats the way peoples minds naturally work these days and they like to have their suspicions confirmed said falcon we cant take their prejudices into this investigation we have to examine the facts and keep them divorced from any natural assumptions if we dont well make the sort of mistakes they made right from the beginning in the madrid bombings when they blamed eta already there are confusing aspects to the evidence that weve found in the peugeot partner explosives copies of the koran and a green sash and black hood dont sound confusing to me said ferrera why two copies of the koran one brandnew cheap spanish edition and the other heavily used and annotated but exactly the same edition the extra copy was a gift why leave it in full view on the front seat this is seville people usually leave their cars completely empty said falcon we need more information on these books i want you to find out where they were bought and if there was a credit card or cheque used he tore the page from his notebook with the isbns and bar codes recopied them and gave ferrera the torn page what are we trying to find out from the occupants of this apartment block keep it simple everybodys in shock if we can find witnesses well bring them to this car park ask whether they saw the peugeot partner arrive if they saw anybody getting out of it how many what age and if they took anything out of the back at the police cordon falcon called out the address of the apartment block an old man in his seventies came forward and a woman in her forties with a bruised face and a plastered arm in a sling falcon took the old man ferrera the woman as they passed the entrance to their block a bomb squad man and a fireman confirmed that the building was now clear falcon showed the old man the peugeot partner and took him back up to his thirdfloor apartment where the living room and kitchen were covered in glass all the blinds in shreds the chairs fallen over photographs on the floor and the soft furniture lacerated with brown foam already protruding from the holes the old man had been lying on his bed in the back of the apartment his son and daughterinlaw had already left for work with the kids who were too old for the preschool so nobody had been hurt he stood in the midst of his wrecked home with his left hand shaking and his old rheumy eyes taking it all in so youre here on your own all day said falcon my wife died last november he said what do you do with yourself i do what old guys do read the paper take a coffee look at the kids playing in the preschool i wander about talk to people and choose the best time to smoke the three cigarettes i allow myself every day falcon went to the window and pulled the ruined blinds away do you remember seeing that van the world is full of small white vans these days said the old man so i cant be sure whether i saw the same van twice or different vans in two separate instances on the way to the pharmacy i saw the van for the first time driving from left to right down calle los romeros with two people in the front it pulled into the kerb by the mosque and that was it what time about ten thirty yesterday morning and the next time about fifteen minutes later on the way back from the pharmacy i saw a white van pull into the parking area but not in that spot it was on the other side facing away from us and only one guy got out did you see him clearly he was dark id have said he was moroccan there are a lot of them around here he had a round head closecropped hair prominent ears age about thirty he looked fit he had a tight black tshirt on and he was muscled i think he was wearing jeans and trainers he locked the car and went off through the trees to calle blanca paloma did you see the van when it arrived in the position it is now no all i can tell you is that it was there by six thirty in the evening my daughterinlaw parked next to it i also remember that when i went for coffee after lunch the van had left its position on the other side there arent so many cars during the day except for the ones belonging to teachers lined up in front of the school so i dont know how but i noticed it old guys notice different things to other people and there were two men when it was going along calle los romeros thats why i cant be sure if it was the same van on which side of the van did your daughterinlaw park her car to the left as were looking at it said the old man her door was blown open by the wind and knocked into it did the van move again at all no idea once people are around me i dont notice a thing falcon took the daughterinlaws name and number and called her as he walked upstairs he talked her through the conversation hed just had with her fatherinlaw and asked her if shed had a look at the van when her door had knocked into it i checked it just to make sure i hadnt dented it did you glance in the window probably did you see anything on the front passenger seat no nothing you didnt see a book definitely not it was just a dark seat ferrera was coming out of the fourthfloor apartment as he hung up they went downstairs in silence was your witness injured in the blast asked falcon she says she fell down the stairs last night but shes got no bruises on her arms or legs just the ones on her face said ferrera angrily and she was scared not of you yes of me because i ask questions and one question leads to another and if any of it somehow gets back to her husband its another reason for him to beat her you can only help the ones that want to be helped said falcon there seems to be more of it about these days said ferrera exasperated anyway she did see the van arrive in its current position theres a woman on the same shift at the factory where she works who lives in one of the blocks further down her street they meet for a chat under the trees on calle blanca paloma they walked past the van at pm just as it had arrived two guys got out they were talking in arabic they didnt take anything out of the back they went up to calle los romeros and turned right descriptions both late twenties one with a shaved head black tshirt the other with more of a square head with black hair cut short at the sides and combed back on top she said he was very good looking but had bad teeth he wore a faded denim jacket white tshirt and she remembers he had very flashy trainers did she see the van move again from that position she keeps an eye on this car park looking out for when her husband comes home she said it hadnt moved by the time he came in at pm the police were letting people through the cordon so that they could get back into their homes to start clearing up the damage there was a large crowd gathered outside the chemists at the junction of calle blanca paloma with calle los romeros they were angry with the police for not letting them back into any part of the block attached to the destroyed building which was still too dangerous falcon tried talking to people in the crowd but they couldnt give a damn about peugeot partners pneumatic drills started up on the other side of the block falcon and ferrera crossed calle los romeros to another apartment building whose glass was more or less intact the apartments on the first two floors were still empty on the third floor a child led falcon into a living room where a woman was sweeping up glass around a pile of cardboard boxes she had moved in at the weekend but the removal company hadnt been able to deliver until yesterday he asked his question about the white van and the two guys do you think id be sitting on the balcony watching the traffic with all this lot to unpack she said ive had to give up two days work because these people cant deliver on time do you know who was in here before you it was empty she said nobody had been living here for three months the letting agency on avenida san lazaro said we were the first to see it was there anything left here when you first arrived asked falcon looking out of the livingroom balcony on to calle los romeros and the rubble of the destroyed building there was no furniture if thats what you mean she said there was a sack of rubbish in the kitchen what sort of rubbish people have been killed children have been killed she said aghast pulling her own child to her side and youre asking me what sort of rubbish i found here when i moved in police work can seem like a mysterious business said falcon if you can remember noticing anything it might help as it happens i had to tie the bag up and throw it out so i know that it was a pizza carton a couple of beer cans some cigarette butts ash and empty packets and a newspaper the abc i think anything else thats very good because now we know that although this place was empty for three months somebody had been here spending quite some time in this apartment and that could be interesting for us he crossed the landing to the apartment opposite a woman in her sixties lived there your new neighbour has just told me that her apartment had been empty for the last three months he said not quite empty she said when the previous family moved out about four months ago some very smart businessmen came round on maybe three or four occasions then about three months ago a small van turned up and unloaded a bed two chairs and a table nothing else after that young men would turn up in pairs and spend three or four hours at a time during the day doing god knows what they never spent the night there but from dawn until dusk there was always someone in that apartment did the same guys come back again or were they different every time i think there might have been as many as twenty did they bring anything with them briefcases newspapers groceries did you ever talk to them of course i asked them what they were doing and they just said that they were having meetings she said i wasnt that worried they didnt look like druggies they didnt play loud music or have parties in fact quite the opposite did their routine change over the months nobody came during semana santa and the feria did you ever see inside the apartment when they were there in the beginning i offered them something to eat but they always very politely refused they never let me inside and they never let on about what these meetings were about they were such straight conservative young men i thought they might be a religious group what happened when they left one day a van arrived and took away the furniture and that was it when was that last fridaythe second of june falcon called ferrera and told her to keep at it while he went to talk to the letting agency down the street on avenida de san lazaro the woman in the letting agency had been responsible for selling the property three months ago and renting it out at the end of last week it had not been bought by a private buyer but a computer company called informaticalidad all her dealings were through the financial director pedro plata falcon took down the address ramirez called him as he was walking back up calle los romeros towards the bombed building comisario elvira has just told me that the madrid police have picked up mohammed soumaya at his shop he lent the van to his nephew he was surprised to hear that it was in seville his nephew had told him he was just going to use it for some local deliveries said ramirez theyre following up on the nephew now his name is trabelsi amar are they sending us shots of him weve asked for them said ramirez by the way theyve just installed an arabic speaker in the jefatura after receiving more than a dozen calls from our friends across the water they all say the same thing and the translation is we will not rest until andalucia is back in the bosom of islam have you ever heard of a company called informaticalidad asked falcon never said ramirez totally uninterested theres one last bit of news for you theyve identified the explosive found in the back of the peugeot partner its called cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine and whats that otherwise known as rdx research and development explosive said ramirez in a wobbly english accent its other names are cyclonite and hexogen its topquality military explosivethe sort of thing youd find in artillery shells sevilletuesday th june hrs ferrera had found one occupant whod given her a sighting of the peugeot partner late yesterday afternoon monday th june the van had stopped on calle los romeros opposite the mosque and two men had unloaded four cardboard boxes and some blue plastic carrier bags the only description of the men was that they were young and well built and were wearing tshirts and jeans the boxes were heavy enough that they could only be carried one at a time everything was taken into the mosque both men came out and drove away in the van falcon told her to keep looking for witnesses and if necessary to go down to the hospital back in the car park the mayor and the deputies from the andalucian parliament had gone and comisario elvira and juez calderon were coming to the end of an impromptu press conference another body had been found on the seventh floor the rescue workers had not made contact with anybody alive in the rubble pneumatic drills were being used to expose the steel netting in the reinforced concrete floors and oxyacetylene torches and motorized cutters were breaking up the floors into slabs these slabs were being lifted away by the crane and put into tippers with each piece of information given more questions came at them elvira was visibly irritated by it all but calderon was playing at the top of his game and the journalists loved him they were more than happy to concentrate on the goodlooking charismatic calderon when finally elvira took his leave and headed into the preschool where theyd set up a temporary headquarters in the undamaged classrooms at the back the journalists recognized falcon and came after him preventing him from following elvira microphones butted his face cameras were thrust between heads whats the name of the explosive again where did it come from are the terrorists still alive is there a cell still operating in seville what have you got to say about the evacuations in the city centre has there been another bomb has anybody claimed responsibility for the attack falcon had to force his way out of the scrum and it took three policemen to push the journalists back from the preschool entrance falcon was straightening himself up in the corridor when calderon burst through the roaring crowd at the gates joder he said remaking his tie theyre like a pack of jackals ramirez just told me about the explosive they keep asking me about that i havent heard anything the common name is rdx or hexogen hexogen said calderon wasnt that what the chechen rebels used to blow up those apartment blocks in moscow back in the military use it in artillery shells i remember there was some scandal about the chechens using recycled explosives from a government scientific research institute which had been bought by the mafia who then sold it to the rebels russian military ordnance being used to blow up their own people sounds like a typical russian scenario its not going to be easy for you said calderon hexogen can come from anywhererussia a muslim chechen terrorist group an arms dump in iraq any third world country where theres been a conflict where ordnance has been left behind it might even be american this stuff falcons mobile vibrated it was elvira calling them into a meeting with the centro nacional de inteligencia and the antiterrorist squad of the comisaria general de informacion there were three men from the cni the boss was a man in his sixties with white hair and dark eyebrows and a handsome exathletes face he introduced himself only as juan his two juniors pablo and gregorio were younger men who had the bland appearance of middle managers in their dark suits they were barely distinguishable although pablo had a scar running from his hairline to his left eyebrow falcon was uncomfortably aware that pablo had not taken his eyes off him since hed walked into the room he began to wonder whether theyd met before there was only one representative from the antiterrorism unit of the cgi his name was inspector jefe ramon barros a short powerfully built man with closecropped grey hair and perfect teeth which added a sinister element to his brutal and furious demeanour comisario elvira asked falcon to give a resume of his findings so far he started with the immediate aftermath of the bomb and moved on quickly to the discovery of the peugeot partner its contents and the times it was seen by witnesses in the car park weve since discovered that the fine white powder taken from the rear of the van is a military explosive known as hexogen which my colleague juez calderon has told me was the same type of explosive used by chechen rebels to blow up two apartment blocks in moscow in you cant believe everything you read in the newspapers said juan theres considerable doubt now that it was the chechen rebels were not great believers in conspiracy theories in our own back yard but when it comes to russia it seems that anything is possible there is a natural inclination after such a catastrophic attack as this to make comparisons to other terrorist attacks to look for patterns what weve learnt from the mistakes we made after march th is that there are no patterns its the governments business to quell panic by offering some kind of order to a terrified public its our job to treat every situation as unique carry on inspector jefe none of the sevillanos liked this patronizing little speech and they looked at the cni man in his expensive loafers lightweight suit and stiff heavy silvery tie and decided that the only thing hed said that didnt mark him out as a typical visiting madrileno was his admission of a mistake if it wasnt chechen rebels who was it asked calderon not relevant juez calderon said juan proceed inspector jefe it might be interesting from the point of view of sources for the hexogen said calderon who was not a man to be brushed off easily weve found a van with traces of explosive and islamic paraphernalia the chechens are known to have access to russian military ordnance and have the sympathy of the muslim world in most peoples minds those rebels were responsible for the destruction of the moscow apartment blocks if any of these connections have been proven invalid by the intelligence community then perhaps the inspector jefe should know about them now the source of the explosives will be an important area of his investigation his investigation said juan our investigation this is going to be a concerted effort the grupo de homicidios is not going to crack this case on its own this hexogen will have been imported the cni has the international connections to find out where it came from nevertheless said calderon embarking on some of his own pomposity this is where the investigation begins and if the inspector jefe is about to pursue an avenue of enquiry with incorrect or misleading information then perhaps he should be told calderon was aware that this was irrelevant in terms of information for the purposes of the investigation but he also knew that a demonstration of power was required to put juan in his place calderon was the leading juez de instruccion and he was not going to have his authority undermined by an outsider especially a madrileno we cannot be certain said juan exasperated by the posturing but a theory is being given credibility that the russian security service the fsb were themselves responsible for the outrage and that they successfully managed to frame the chechens just prior to the explosion putin had become director of the fsb the country was in turmoil and there was the perfect opportunity for a power play the fsb provoked a war in chechnya and dagestan the prime minister lost his job and putin took over at the beginning of the moscow apartment explosions gave him the opportunity to start a patriotic campaign he was the fearless leader who would stand up to the rebels by the beginning of putin was acting president of russia the hexogen used by the fsb was supposed to have come from a scientific research institute in lubyanka where the fsb has its headquarters as you can see juez calderon my explanation does not help us very much here but it does illustrate how very quickly the world can become a dangerous and confusing place silence while the sevillanos considered the reverberations of the explosion in their own city to places like chechnya and moscow falcon continued his briefing about the peugeot partner the two men seen unloading goods for the mosque the men believed to have been in the mosque at the time of the explosion and the latest revelations about the owner of the vehicle and his nephew trabelsi amar who had borrowed it anything else asked juan while elviras assistant entered the name of trabelsi amar into the terrorist suspects database just one thing to clear up before i continue with the investigation said falcon did the cni or the cgi have the mosque under surveillance what makes you think that we might have done asked juan falcon briefed them on the mysterious welldressed young men from informaticalidad who had frequented the nearby apartment over the past three months that is not the way we would run a surveillance operation and ive never heard of informaticalidad what about the antiterrorism unit inspector jefe barros asked elvira we did not have the mosque under active surveillance said barros who seemed to be restraining great anger under preternatural calm ive heard of informaticalidad theyre the biggest suppliers of computer software and consumables in seville they even supply us one final question about the imam said falcon were told he arrived here from tunis in september and that he is in the lowest risk category for terrorist suspects but his history required a higher authority for clearance his file is incomplete said juan what does that mean as far as we know hes clean said juan he has been heard to speak out against the coldblooded indiscriminate nature of the madrid bombings we understand from his visa application that part of the reason he came to seville was to attempt a healing of the wounds between the catholic and muslim communities he saw that as his duty we were only concerned about gaps in his history that we could not fill these gaps occurred in the s when a lot of muslims went to afghanistan to fight with the mujahedeen against the russians some returned radicalized to their homes in the s and others later became the taliban the imam would have been in his thirties at the time and therefore a prime candidate in the end the americans vouched for him and we allowed him a visa so this bomb has killed a potential sympathizer five men over the age of sixtyfive a man under thirtyfive who was in a wheelchair two spanish converts and two men in their forties collecting disability benefits which leaves only two under the age of thirtyfive ablebodied and of north african origin said elvira can the cni offer a theory as to why this strangely mixed group of people who we have just been told were not under active surveillance should be storing highquality military explosive and why it should have been detonated silence the grinding gears of the machinery outside reached them the thunder of rubble dropping into empty tippers the hiss and scream of hydraulics the low roar of the cranes unwinding cable all punctuated by the pneumatic drills staccato stabbing reminded these men of the purpose of their meeting and the disaster that had befallen this city trabelsi amar is not on any terrorist suspect database and hes an illegal alien said elviras assistant breaking the silence do you believe that explosives could have been stored in the mosque without the knowledge of the imam asked calderon theres an outside chance that he didnt recognize what it was said juan as you know hexogen looks like sugar the trace left on the floor indicates that the packaging wasnt exactly hermetically sealed its possible that the explosive was in those cardboard boxes which the inspector jefe has told us were seen being unloaded yesterday but for the hexogen to actually explode would require a detonator said falcon from the way in which they were moving it around it must be a stable product it is said juan then that means they must have been working on making bombs and accidentally detonated it said falcon i doubt they could be doing that in secret in a mosque of that size with thirteen other people in it i havent seen the plans but it cant be more than ten by twenty metres so the imam is complicit in that scenario said juan well have to talk to the americans about abdelkrim benaboura and well find a photo id and a history for trabelsi amar if soumaya is identifying amar as his nephew then that doesnt sound to me like deep terrorist cover hes probably got photographs said falcon we have to consider the possibility that this van was not being driven by him it could have been stolen or for whatever reason given to another party to transport goods to seville trabelsi amars function could have been simply to provide a van which would not be reported stolen well make sure the cgi in canillas communicate with the local police in madrid who are interviewing mohammed soumaya said juan which sounded like he was undermining inspector jefe barros who was still boiling in silence its one of the complications of these terrorist operations that the people we know about are active only in so far as they use up our time and resources as was the case with march th where none of the operatives were known terrorists or had any links to known radical islamic organizations they came out of nowhere to perform their tasks but youre in a better position now than you were then said elvira since and the evidence of connections made by islamic terrorist cell members in spain you mean alqaeda members said elvira we dont like to use the name alqaeda because it implies an organization with a hierarchy along western lines this is not the case said juan its useful for the media to have this name to hang on islamic terrorism but we dont use it in the service we have to remind ourselves not to be complacent as i was saying since and the evidence of connections made by islamic terrorist cell members in spain with the perpetrators of the twin towers and washington dc attacks there has been considerable stepping up of activities but as you say there seems to be an unending stream of young operatives who you dont know about and who can be organized at a distance to perform terrorist acts said calderon that surely is the problem as youve seen from the investigations into the london bombings there is extraordinary cooperation between all the secret services said juan our proximity to north africa makes us vulnerable but gives us opportunities as well in the two years since the madrid train bombings we have achieved considerable penetration into morocco algeria and tunisia we hope to improve our ability to pick up sleeping cells by intercepting the signals that might eventually activate them we are not perfect but neither are they you dont hear about our successes and its too early to say whether we are dealing here with one of our failures you said that in this scenario the imam is complicit said falcon does this mean you are looking at other scenarios all we can do is prepare ourselves for eventualities said juan in the last two years we have been examining a domestic phenomenon which first came to light on the internet i hesitate to call this phenomenon a group because we have found no evidence of organization or communication for that matter what we have found are newsletter pages on a website called wwwvomitorg this was thought to be an american site because it first appeared in the english language but the cia and mi have just recently told us they now believe vomit stands for victimas del odio de musulmanos islamistas y terroristas whats the content of the newsletter its an updated list of all terrorist attacks carried out by islamic extremists since the early s it gives a short account of the attack the number of victims both dead and injured followed by the number of people directly affected by the death or injury of a person close to them does that mean they are contacting the victims families asked elvira if they are the victims seem to be unaware of it said juan victims get approached by the media the government the social services the policeand as yet we havent found anyone who has been able to tell us that theyve been contacted by vomit did this start in after the madrid bombings said elvira the british first came across the pages in june by september it also included muslim on muslim attacks such as suicide bombings against police recruiting offices in iraq and since the beginning of there has also been a section on muslim women who have been the victims of honour killings or gang rapes in these cases they only report on the type of attack and number of victims presumably the posting of these pages on the web is completely anonymous said calderon who didnt wait for an answer there must have been a muslim reaction to this surely the al jazeera news channel did a piece on these web pages back in august and there was a huge internet response in which various arabsponsored websites enumerated arab victims of israeli american european russian far eastern and australian aggression some of them were extreme and went back in history to the crusades the expulsion of the moors from spain and the defeat of the ottoman empire none of the websites came up with as powerful a banner as vomit and a lot of them couldnt resist spouting an agenda so although they were read avidly in the arab world they didnt penetrate the west at all so what makes you think that vomit has gone from being a passive unorganized internet phenomenon into an active operational entity asked falcon we dont said juan we review their web pages daily to see if theres any incitement to violence disrespect shown to islam or attempts at recruitment to some kind of cause but theres nothing except the clocking up of attacks and their victims have you spoken to victims of the madrid bombings asked falcon there is no common theme of vengeance amongst them the only anger was directed at our own politicians and not against north africans in general or islamic fanatics specifically most of the victims recognized that many muslims had also been killed in the bombings they saw it as an indiscriminate act of terror with a political goal did any of them know about vomit yes but none of them said they would seek membership if it existed said juan however we do know that there is anger out there from fanatical rightwing groups with strong racist views and antiimmigration policies we are keeping an eye on them the police handle their violent activities at a local level they are not known to have a national organization or to have planned and carried out attacks of this magnitude and religious groups some of these fanatically rightwing groups have religious elements too if they advertise themselves in any way we know about them what concerns us is that they might be learning from their perceived enemies so the other possible scenariothat this was an organized attack against a muslim communityis based solely on what that its about time there was a reaction against islamic terrorism asked calderon each terrorist atrocity is unique the circumstances that prevail at the time make it so said juan at the time of the march th attack aznars government were expecting an eta attempt to disrupt the forthcoming elections a couple of months earlier on christmas eve two bombs of kilos each had been discovered on the irunmadrid intercity train both bombs were classic eta devices and had been set to explode two minutes before their arrival in the chamartin station another eta bomb was found on the track of the zaragozacaspebarcelona line which was set to explode on new years eve on th february as everybody in this room knows the guardia civil intercepted two eta operatives in a transit van which contained kilos of titadine destination madrid everything was pointing to a major attack on the railway system prior to the elections on th march which would be planned and carried out by eta that was the information and the extrapolation from it was sent to the government by the cni said calderon keen to stick it in and it was wrong juez calderon we were wrong said juan even after listening to the tapes of the koran found in the renault kangoo van near the alcala de henares station and the discovery of the detonators not previously used by eta and the fact that the explosive was not titadine as customarily used by eta but goma eco we still couldnt believe that eta was not behind it that is the very point i am making and it is why we should consider all scenarios in this present attack and not allow our minds to harden around a core of received opinion we must work step by step until we have the unbreakable line of logic that leads to the perpetrators we cant leave people in the dark while we do this said calderon the media the politicians and the public need to know that something is happening that their safety is assured terror breeds confusion comisario elvira as leader of this investigation has that responsibility as do the politicians our job is to make sure that they have the right information said juan weve already started looking at this attack with a historical mindthe apartment bombs in moscow the discovery of islamic paraphernalia in a white vanand we cant afford to do that the media already knows what was found in the peugeot partner van said calderon we cannot prevent them from drawing their conclusions how do they know that asked juan there was a police cordon we dont know said calderon but as soon as the vehicle was removed and the journalists allowed into the car park comisario elvira and i were fielding questions about the hexogen the two copies of the koran a hood the islamic sash and plenty of other stuff that wasnt even in the van there were a lot of people out in that car park said falcon my officers the forensics the bomb squad the vehicle removal men were all in the vicinity of that first inspection of the van journalists do their job the cameras were supposed to be kept away from the bodies of the children in the preschool but one guy found his way in there as weve seen before said juan breathing down his irritation its very difficult to dislodge first impressions from the publics mind there are still millions of americans who believe that saddam hussein was responsible in some way for most of seville will now believe that they have been the victim of an islamic terrorist attack and we might not be able to come close to confirming the truth of the matter until we can get into the mosque which could be days of demolition work away perhaps we should look at the unique circumstances which led to this event said falcon and also look at the future to see if theres anything that this bombing might be seeking to influence from my own point of view the reason i was very early on to the scene here was that i was at the forensic institute discussing the autopsy of a body found on the main rubbish dump on the outskirts of seville falcon gave the details of the unidentifiable corpse found yesterday this could of course be an unconnected murder said falcon however it is unique in the crime history of seville and it does not appear to be the work of a single person but rather a group of killers who have gone to extreme lengths to prevent identification have there been any other murders with similar attempts to prevent identification asked juan not in spain this year according to the police computer said falcon we havent checked with interpol yet our investigation is still very new are there any elections due the andalucian parliamentary elections last took place in march said calderon the town hall elections were in so they are due next march the socialists are currently in office juan took a folded piece of paper out of his pocket before we left madrid we had a call from the cgi who had just been informed by the editor of the abc that they had received a letter with a seville stamp on the envelope the letter consisted of a single sheet of paper and a printed text in spanish we have since discovered that this text comes from the work of abdullah azzam a preacher best known as the leading ideologue of the afghan resistance to the russian invasion it reads as follows this duty will not end with victory in afghanistan jihad will remain an individual obligation until all other lands that were muslim are returned to us so that islam will reign again before us lie palestine bokhara lebanon chad eritrea somalia the philippines burma southern yemen tashkent he paused looking around the room and andalucia sevilletuesday th june hrs the meeting broke up with the news that another body had been found in the rubble calderon left immediately the three cni men spoke intently amongst themselves while falcon and elvira discussed resources inspector jefe barros of the cgi stared into the floor his jaw muscles working over some new humiliation after ten minutes the cni conferred with elvira falcon and barros were asked to leave the room barros paced the corridor avoiding falcon some moments later elvira called falcon back in and the cni men moved towards the door saying that they would conduct a detailed search of imam abdelkrim benabouras apartment is that information going to be shared asked falcon of course said juan unless it compromises national security id like one of my officers to be present in the light of whats just been said we have to do it now and youre all too busy they left falcon turned to elvira hands open questioning this state of affairs theyre determined not to make a mistake this time round said elvira and they want all the credit for it too futures are at stake here and to what extent do you have control over what they do those words national security are the problem said elvira for instance they want to talk to you on a matter of national security which means im told nothing other than it has to be private and at length thats not going to be easy today theyll make time for youat night whenever and national security is the only clue theyve given theyre interested in your moroccan connections said elvira and have asked to interview you interview me said falcon that sounds like its for a job and ive already got one of those with plenty of work in it where are you going now im tempted to be present at the search of the imams apartment said falcon but i think im going to follow up the informaticalidad lead thats a very strange way to use an apartment for three months so youre keeping an open mind on this unlike our cni friends said elvira nodding at the door i thought juan was very eloquent on the subject thats how they want everybody else to think so that theyve got all their bases covered said elvira but theres no doubt in my mind that they believe theyve hit on the beginning of a major islamic terrorist campaign to bring andalucia back into the islamic fold why else would they want to talk to you about your moroccan connections we dont know what they know i know that theyre seeking redress and greater glory said elvira and that worries me and what was going on with inspector jefe barros asked falcon he was present but nothing more as if hed been told he was allowed to attend but not to say a word theres a problem which they will explain to you directly all i have been told by the head of the cgi in madrid is that for the moment the seville antiterrorism unit cannot contribute to this investigation consuelo sat in her office in the restaurant in la macarena she had kicked off her shoes and was curled up foetally on her new expensive leather office chair which rocked her gently backwards and forwards she had a ball of tissue in her hands which was crammed into her mouth she bit against it when the physical pain became too much her throat tried to articulate the emotion but it had no reference points her body felt like ruptured earth spewing up sharp chunks of magma the television was on she had not been able to bear the silence of the restaurant the chefs werent due to start preparing the lunch service until am she had tried to walk her extreme agitation out of herself but her tour of the spotless kitchen with its gleaming stainless steel surfaces its knives and cleavers winking encouragement at her had terrified rather than calmed shed walked the dining rooms and the patio but none of the smells the textures not even the obsessive order of the table settings could fill this aching emptiness pressing against her ribs she had retreated to her office locked herself in the volume of the television was turned low so that she couldnt make out the words but she took comfort from the human murmur she looked out of the corner of her eye at the images of destruction playing on the screen there was the sharp smell of vomit in the room as shed just thrown up at the sight of the tiny bodies under their pinafores outside the preschool tears tracked mascara down her cheeks the mouth side of the ball of tissue was slimy with sharp saliva something had been levered open the lid was no longer on whatever it was she had inside her and she who had always prided herself on her courage to face up to things could not bear to take a look she squeezed her eyes shut at a new rising of pain the chair empathized with the shudder of her body her throat squealed as if there was something sharp lodged across it the destroyed apartment block flickered on the screen in the corner of her eye she couldnt bear to switch off the tv and live with the only other occupant of the silence even though the buildings collapse was an appalling replication of her own mental state only a few hours ago she had been more or less whole she had always imagined the gap between sanity and madness as a yawning chasm but now found it was like a border in the desert you didnt know whether youd crossed it or not the tv pictures changed from the piles of rubble to a body bag being lifted into a cradle stretcher to the wounded staggering down pavements to the jagged edges of shattered windows to the trees stripped of all their leaves to cars upside down in gardens to a road sign speared into the earth these tv news editors must be professionals in horror every image was like a slap to the face knocking a complacent public into the new reality then calm returned a presenter stood in front of the church of san hermenegildo he had a friendly face consuelo turned up the sound in the hope of good news the camera zoomed in on the plaque and dropped back down to the presenter who was now walking and giving a brief history of the church the camera remained tight on the presenters face there was an inexplicable tension in the scene something was coming the suspense transfixed consuelo the presenters voice told them that this was the site of an old mosque and the camera cut to the apex of a classic arabic arch its focus pulled wide to reveal the new horror written in red over the doors were the words ahora es nuestra now it is ours the screen filled again with another montage of horror women screaming for no apparent reason blood on the pavements in the gutter thickening the dust a body with the terrible sag of lifelessness being lifted out of the ruins she couldnt bear the sight of any more these cameramen must be robots to handle this horror she turned the tv off and sat in the silence of the office the images had jolted her the lid seemed to have slipped back over the darkness welling inside her chest her hands trembled but she no longer needed to bite on the ball of tissue the shame of her first consultation with alicia aguado came back to her consuelo pressed her hands to her cheekbones as she remembered her words blind bitch how could she have said such a thing she picked up the phone alicia aguado was relieved to hear consuelos voice her concern raised emotion in consuelos throat nobody ever cared about her she stumbled through an apology ive been called worse than that said aguado given that were the most inventive insulters in the world you can imagine the special reserves that are drawn on when it comes to psychologists it was unforgivable all will be forgiven as long as you come and see me again sra jimenez call me consuelo after what weve been through all formality is out of the window she said when can you see me id like to see you tonight but it wont be possible before pm tonight im very concerned about you i wouldnt normally ask but but what i think youve reached a very dangerous point dangerous dangerous to whom you have to promise me something consuelo said aguado you have to come directly here to me after work and when our consultation is over you must go straight home and have somebodya relative or a friendto be there with you silence from consuelo i could ask my sister i suppose she said its very important said aguado i think youve realized the extreme vulnerability of your state so i would recommend that you confine yourself to home work and my consulting room can you just explain that to me not now over the phone face to face this evening she said remember come straight to me you must resist all temptations to any diversion however strong the urge manuela falcon sat in angels big comfortable chair in front of the television she was now incapable of movement with not even the strength to reach for the remote and shut down the screen which was transferring the horror images directly to her mind the police were evacuating el corte ingles in the plaza del duque after four reports of suspicious packages on different floors of the department store two sniffer dogs and their handlers arrived to patrol the building the image cut to a deserted crossroads in the heart of the city with shoes scattered over the cobbles and people running towards the plaza nueva manuela felt pale with just the minimum quantity of blood circulating around her head and face to maintain basic oxygenation and brain function her extremities were freezing despite the open door to the terrace and the temperature outside steadily rising the telephone had rung once since angel had left for the abc offices where he hoped to put his finger to the thready pulse of a convulsing city shed had the strength then to answer it her lawyer had asked whether shed seen the television and then told her that the sevillana buyer had pulled out with an excuse about her black money not being ready and that she would have to postpone the signing of the deed thats not going to stop her from losing her deposit said manuela still able to raise some aggression have you been listening to what canal sur have been reporting said the lawyer theyve found a van with traces of a military explosive in the back the editor of the abc in madrid was sent a letter from alqaeda saying that they would not rest until andalucia was back in the islamic fold theres some security expert saying that this is the start of a major terrorist campaign and therell be more attacks in the coming days fucking hell said manuela jamming a cigarette into her mouth lighting it so that deposit your buyer might lose is looking like a cheap way out for her what about the germans lawyer has he called yet not yet but hes going to manuela had clicked off the phone and let it fall in her lap she smoked on automatic with great fervour and the nicotine surge enabled her to call angel whose mobile was off they couldnt find him in the abc offices which sounded like the trading floor in the first minutes of a black day for the markets her lawyer called again the german has pulled out ive called the notarys office and all deed signings have been cancelled for the day theres been an announcement on the tv and radio the jefe superior de la policia and the chief of the emergency services have told us to only use mobile phones if absolutely necessary the workshop was in a courtyard up an old alleyway with massive grey cobbles off calle bustos tavera marisa moreno had rented it purely because of this alleyway on bright sunny days such as this one the light in the courtyard was so intense that nothing could be discerned from within the darkness of the twentyfivemetre alleyway the cobbles were like pewter ingots and drew her on her attraction to this alleyway was that it coincided with her vision of death its arched interior was not pretty with crappy walls a collection of fuse boxes and electric cables running over crumbling whitewashed plaster but that was the point it was a transference from this messy material world to the cleansing white light beyond there was however disappointment in the courtyard to find that paradise was a brokendown collection of shabby workshops and storage houses with peeling paint wroughtiron grilles and rusted axles it was only a fiveminute walk from her apartment on calle hiniesta to her workshop which was another reason shed rented somewhere too big for her needs she occupied the first floor accessed via an iron staircase to the side it had a huge window overlooking the courtyard which gave light and great heat in the summer marisa liked to sweat that was the cuban in her she often worked in bikini briefs and liked the way the wood chips from her carving stuck to her skin that morning shed left her apartment and taken a coffee in one of the bars on calle vergara the bar was unusually packed with all heads turned to the television she ordered her cafe con leche drank it and left refusing all attempts by the locals to involve her in any debate she had no interest in politics she didnt believe in the catholic church or any other organized religion and as far as she was concerned terrorism only mattered if you happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time in the studio she worked on staining two carvings and polishing another two ready for delivery by midday she had them rolled in bubblewrap and was down in the courtyard waiting for a taxi a young mexican dealer who had a gallery in the centre on calle zaragoza had bought the two pieces he was part aztec and marisa had had an affair with him a few months before shed met esteban calderon he still bought every carving she made and paid cash on delivery every time to see them greet each other you might have thought they were still seeing each other but it was more of a blood understanding his aztec and her african esteban calderon knew nothing of this hed never seen her workshop she didnt have any of her work in her apartment he knew she carved wood but she made it sound as if it was in the past that was the way she wanted it she hated listening to westerners talking about art they didnt seem to grasp that appreciation was the other way around let the piece talk to you marisa dropped off her two finished pieces and took her money she went to a tobacconist and bought herself a cuban cigara churchill from the romeo y julieta brand she walked past the archivo de las indias and the alcazar the tourists were not quite as numerous as usual but still there and seemingly oblivious to the bomb which had gone off on the other side of the city proving her point that terrorism only mattered if it directly affected you she walked through the barrio santa cruz and into the murillo gardens to indulge in her aftersales ritual she sat on a park bench unscrewed the aluminium cap of the cylinder and let the cigar fall into her palm she smoked it under the palm trees imagining herself back in havana ines had pulled herself together after fifteen minutes weeping her stomach couldnt take it any more the tensing of her abdominals was agony she had crawled to the shower pulled off her nightdress and slumped in the tray keeping her burning scalp out from under the fine needles of water after another quarter of an hour she had been able to stand although not straight because of the pain in her side she dressed in a dark suit with a highcollared cream blouse and put on heavy makeup there was no bruising to disguise but she needed a full mask to get through the morning she found some aspirin which took the edge off the pain so that she could walk without being creased over to one side normally she would walk to work but that was out of the question this morning and she took a taxi that was the first she knew of the bomb the radio was full of it the driver talked nonstop she sat in the back silent behind her dark glasses until the driver unnerved by her lack of response asked if she was ill she told him she had a lot on her mind that was enough at least he knew she was hearing him he went into a long soliloquy about terrorism how the only cure for this disease was to get rid of the lot of them who asked ines muslims africans arabsthe whole lot get shot of them all spain should be for the spanish he said what we need now are the old catholic kings they understood the need to be pure they knew what they had to do so youre including the jews in this mass exile she asked no no no que no the jews are all right its these moroccans algerians and tunisians theyre all fanatics they cant control their religious fervour what are they doing blowing up an apartment block what does that prove it proves how powerful indiscriminate terror can be she said feeling her whole chest about to burst open were no longer safe in our own homes the palacio de justicia was frantic as usual she slowly went up to her office on the second floor which she shared with two other fiscales state prosecutors she was determined not to show the pain each step unleashed in her side having wanted to wear the badge of his violence she now wanted to disguise her agony the mask of her makeup got her through the first excited minutes with her colleagues who were full of the latest rumour and theory with hardly a fact between them nobody associated ines with emotional wreckage so they glided over the surface and went back to their work unaware of her state there were cases to prepare and meetings to be attended and ines got through it all until the early afternoon when she found herself with a spare halfhour she decided to go for a walk in the murillo gardens which were just across the avenue the gardens would calm her down and she wouldnt have to listen to any more conjecture about the bomb she had the little grenade attack in her relationship to consider she knew a breather in the park wasnt going to help her sort it out but at least she might be able to find something around which to start rebuilding her collapsed marriage over the last four years when things had been going wrong for ines in her marriage she played herself a film loop it was the edited version of her life with esteban it never started with their meeting each other and the subsequent affair because that would mean the film started with her infidelity and she did not see herself as somebody who broke her marriage vows in her movie she was unblemished she had rewritten her private history and cut out all images that did not meet with her approval this was not a conscious act there was no facing up to unfortunate episodes or personal embarrassments they were simply forgotten this movie would have been immensely dull to anyone who was not ines it was propaganda no better than a dictators glorious biopic ines was the courageous fiancee who had picked up her husbandtobe after the nasty little incident that they never talked about given him the care and attention he needed to get his career back on trackand so it went on and it worked for her after each of his discovered infidelities shed played the movie and it had given her strength or rather it had given her something to record over estebans previous aberration so that she only suffered from one of his infidelities at a time and not the whole history this time as she sat on the park bench playing her film something went wrong she couldnt hold the images it was as if the film was jumping out of the sprockets and letting an alien image flood into her private theatre someone with long coppery hair dark skin and splayed legs this visual interference was shorting out her internal comfort loop ines gathered the amnesiac forces of her considerable mind by pressing her hands to the sides of her head and blinkering her eyes it was then that she realized that it was something on the outside forcing its way in reality was intruding the copperhaired darkskinned whore shed seen only this morning naked on her husbands digital camera was sitting opposite her smoking a cigar without a care in the world marisa didnt like the way the woman sitting on the bench on the other side of the shaded pathway was looking at her she had the intensity of a lunatic about her not the ravingintheasylum type but a more dangerous version too thin too chic too shallow shed come across them at the mexican dealers gallery openings all on the verge of a nervous breakdown they filled the air with highpitched chatter to keep the real world from bursting through the levee as if by chanting their consumer mantras the great nothing that was going on in their lives would be kept at bay in the gallery she tolerated their presence as they might buy her work but out in the open she was not going to have one of these cabras ricas ruining her expensive cigar what you looking at said marisa youre ruining my cigar you know that it took a moment for ines fluttering her eyelids in astonishment to realize that this was directed at her then the adrenaline kicked into her prosecutorial system here was a confrontation she was good at those im looking at you la puta con el puro said ines the whore with the cigar marisa uncrossed her legs and leaned forward with her elbows on her knees to get a good look at her heavily madeup adversary she didnt stop to think too long hey look you bonyassed bitch im sorry if im on your patch but im not working im just enjoying a cigar the insult slashed across iness face leaving it red with outrage the blood dimmed iness vision at the edges and played havoc with her oralcerebral linkage im a fucking lawyer she roared and the people in the park stopped to look lawyers are the biggest whores of them all said marisa is that why you paint your face like that to hide the pox ines leapt to her feet forgetting her injuries even in her fury she felt that twinge in her side the bumping of her bruised organs and it was that which stopped her from a full physical onslaught that and the force field of marisas languid muscularity and impassive vocal brutality you are the whore she said pointing a spindly white finger at marisas lustrous mulatto sheen youre the one fucking my husband the shock that registered in marisas face encouraged ines who had misread it as consternation how much is he paying you asked ines it doesnt look as if its much more than euros a night and thats a disgrace thats not even minimum wage or does he throw in the copper wig and buy you a fat cigar to keep you happy when hes not there marisa instantly recovered from the revelation that this was the pale pathetic stringy little wife that esteban couldnt bear to go back to shed also seen that wince of pain as ines had got to her feet and guessed at the hurt being disguised by the clownish panstick shed seen beaten women in the poverty of havana and she could spot vulnerability at a hundred metres and she had the ruthlessness to open it up and reveal it to its owner and the rest of the world just remember ines she said that when hes beating you its because hes been fucking me so beautifully all night that he cant bear the sight of your disappointed little face in the morning the sound of her name coming out of the mulattos mouth made ines catch her breath with a loud cluck thereafter the words sliced through her with the ferocity of blasted glass the arrogance of her own anger disappeared she felt the shame of being stripped naked in public with all eyes on her marisa saw the fight go out of her and watched the sag in iness shoulders with some satisfaction she felt no pity shed suffered much worse when shed lived in america in fact the thin white hand with which ines now held her side no longer able to disguise the pain only made marisa think of other possibilities fate had brought them together and now it was up to one to shape the destiny of the other sevilletuesday th june hrs a group of workmen had formed around the section of the building where fernando had pinpointed his wifes position from the sound of her mobile phone fernando was on his haunches with his hands clasped over the top of his head trying to exert additional gravitational force as if there was the possibility that more tragedy might carry him away like a childs lost heliumfilled balloon the crane loomed over the scene with its wristthick steel cable taut and creaking there were workmen on ladders using motorized handheld saws capable of ripping through concrete and steel with a noise that went through falcon taking shreds with it they had inserted hydraulic props and thick scaffolding planks to keep the collapsed floors apart as they carved out a tunnel chunks of concrete were coughed from the hole within clouds of dust and showers of sparks spewed out as the saws teeth bit into steel the goggled workmen grey as ghosts plunged further in until the unbearable sound stopped and there was a call for more props and planks the sun beat down the sweat tracked dark rivulets through the grey dust on the workmens faces once the props and planks were inserted the saws started up again making all humans aware of the savagery of their metal teeth the workmen were off the ladders now kneeling on pads strapped to their knees staring into the tangled skeleton of the building embraced by claws of steel rods jutting from the shattered concrete he knew he should move away that the sight of the confused guts of the building was not good preparation for the task at hand but falcon was caught up in the drama and was feeding a profound sense of anger at the tragedy only ramirez calling wrenched him out of his distraction were getting reports of a blue transit van that was parked outside the front of the building yesterday morning said ramirez there seems to be confusion about the numbers of people in it some say two others three and still others four they brought in tool boxes a plastic box of some sort of electrical supplies and insulation tubing carried in rolls over their shoulders nobody remembers any company name on the side of the van and it all went into the mosque theres confusion there too said ramirez most of the people were talking to dont live in the building they were just passersby some didnt know there was a mosque in the basement were getting snapshots of what happened ive got perez working on the residents list hes down at the hospital serrano and baena are working the surrounding blocks and people in the street wheres cristina she should still be working those blocks on calle los romeros said falcon what we need to find is someone who was inside the mosque in the last fortyeight hours to corroborate what were hearing about on the outside what about that woman esperanza who gave comisario elvira the listdidnt she leave a number call her and get some names and addresses those women must know hasnt anybody from the moroccan community approached the comisario yet somebody turned up with the mayor said falcon you know what its like theyve got to contain the media before they can give us any practical help you remember that mosque they wanted to build over in los bermejales said ramirez a huge place big enough for seven hundred worshippers there was a protest group organized by the locals called los vecinos de los bermejales thats right they had a website too called wwwmezquitanograciascom there were a lot of accusations about xenophobia racism and antimuslim activity especially after march th maybe we should look up some of the personalities from that dispute said ramirez or is that too obvious keep working on what happened inside and outside the building in the last fortyeight hours said falcon in the end there are two possibilities explosives were brought here by terrorists and accidentally exploded or an antimuslim group has planted a bomb and set it off there are a lot of complications within those scenarios but those are the two basic concepts lets work with the information we find rather than getting distracted by the possibilities falcon hung up the saws had stopped the workmen were shovelling out rubble by hand two more props planks and lights were called for men ran up the ladders with the equipment props were passed in torches were trained into the hole a single saw ripped into some steel and stopped a length of metal rod was flung out followed by more rubble four paramedics leaned against their ambulance waiting for their turn in the drama two cradle stretchers with straps were brought to the foot of the ladders by the rescue teams fernando was concentrating on his breathing under orders from his trauma counsellor there was a shout for a doctor a medico forense stepped up the ladder with his bag and crawled down the tunnel there was silence apart from the rumble of the insulated diesel generators the diggers had stopped work the drivers were out of their cabs watching there was a collective need to wring some hope out of this calamitous day another shout this time for a stretcher the doctor backed out on all fours and came down the ladder while two men from the rescue services dragged the stretcher up the other ladder fernando came off his haunches and in seconds was on the doctor holding him by the sleeves of his shirt the doctor grasped fernando by the shoulders and spoke directly into his eyes the tension in their strange embrace made them look like judoists struggling for the upper hand fernandos hands fell to his sides the doctor put his arm around him and beckoned the counsellor fernando leaned into him like a lost child the doctor spoke to the trauma counsellor over fernandos shoulder the doctor trotted over to the paramedics who radioed through to the hospital he talked directly with the emergency room the paramedics reversed the ambulance up to the ladders opened the double doors prepared the trolley with a head neck and spine immobilizer turned on the oxygen charged the defibrillator the workmen whod plunged into the hole after the doctor had backed out now called the rescue workers in with the stretcher the medico forense joined falcon just as calderon came round from the front of the building have we got a survivor in there asked calderon the woman is dead said the doctor but her child is hanging on shes breathing and theres a thready pulse the mother seems to have fallen with her body protecting the child as much as possible from the debris falling on top of them the problem is to get the girl out the mothers back is facing the rescue workers so theyve got to lift the child up and over her body and theres no room in there if the child has a spinal injury just the movement could cause permanent paralysis but if she stays there much longer shell die the workmen roared from the mouth of the hole and held their thumbs up the rescue workers slid the steel cradle stretcher out mounted it on the ladders sliders and lowered it to the paramedics who lifted the girl out on the count and fitted her into the immobilizer two television crews came running pursued by local police the medico forense made a full report to calderon the pneumatic drills saws and diggers started up again as if galvanized by this thin slice of hope falcon got into the ambulance cab the trolley was lifted into the back followed by fernando a cameraman was pushed back roughly by one of the workmen the door closed on a womans microphone the driver leapt into his seat and set the siren off he drove slowly over the rough ground until he got back on to the tarmac photojournalists stormed the side and back of the ambulance holding cameras up to the windows and flashing away the lurid lights hysterical siren and the sprinting journalists left pedestrians gaping and slackfaced the news of a survivor travelled faster than the ambulance and there was a media scrum battling it out with a dozen local policemen and hospital orderlies at the entrance to the hospital the ambulance ramp was clear and they got the girl out and through the swing doors before the newsmen could get near her fernando was sucked in after her the media rounded on falcon who theyd seen in the ambulance cab and he steadied their hysteria by informing them that the girl had been removed from the destroyed building showing signs of life a doctor would make a full statement once hed completed his examination falcon held up his hand and pushed back the barrage of questions that followed ten minutes later hed picked up his car from the forensic institute and was easing his way out through a gaggle of journalists still desperate for his final words he crossed the river and went into the old expo ground he found informaticalidad in an office that fronted a large warehouse on calle albert einstein he showed his police id to the woman in reception and told her he wanted an immediate interview with pedro plata in connection with a murder investigation he gave her his stoniest policemans stare and she phoned through sr plata was in a board meeting but would make himself available in a few minutes she took him through security to an office with glass walls on all sides the receptionist was still the only visible person there was a lack of movement in the building as if business was slow even dead pedro plata arrived with the receptionist who set down two coffees and left he had only been responsible for buying the property so could offer no help in explaining how it had been used any reason why you bought it rather than rented it only if you assure me this is not going to get back to the tax authorities or be used against this company in any way my job is finding murderers we had some black money to get rid of and its use wasnt discussed at a board meeting not one i attended said plata it was diego torress idea hes the human resources director youd best talk to him more time leaked past the chill of the air conditioning and his exposure in the glass office made him feel like an arctic zoo animal diego torres arrived and before hed even sat down falcon asked him how theyd used the apartment we try to encourage our employees to think creatively not just about our business but business in general said torres where will the next opportunities come from is there another strand that we can attach to our core business is there another business out there that could improve our own or help it to grow is there a totally different project that could be worth investing in these sorts of things and you think you can achieve that by investing in a small apartment in an anonymous block in a poor neighbourhood of seville that was a conscious decision said torres our employees complained that they never had time to think creatively they were always too busy with the work at hand they came to us demanding brainstorming time a lot of companies offer this and it normally consists of sending employees away to an expensive country club where they attend meetings and seminars listen to gurus spouting common sense and charging a fortune interspersed with tennis swimming and staying up until five in the morning partying they must have been very disappointed by your solution said falcon how many employees did you lose none from that project but theres always a certain amount of churn in the sales teams its hard work with demanding targets we pay well but we expect results a lot of young guys think they can handle the pressure but they burn out or lose their drive its a young persons business there are no sales reps over thirty youre telling me you didnt lose anybody when you showed them that apartment in el cerezo were not stupid inspector jefe said torres we gave them a sweetener the idea was that they should take the brainstorming seriously we put them in a place outside their normal environment with no distractions not even a decent cafe to go to so that they would concentrate on the task they went in pairs and we swapped the people around they were told it was a finite project three months maximum and they wouldnt have to spend more than four hours at a time in the apartment they were also told that they would be a part of any of their projects which received board approval was that the sweetener were not that tough on them said torres the sweetener was a fully paid break in a beach hotel with golf and tennis during the feriaand they wouldnt have to do any work we let them bring their girlfriends too and boyfriends torres blinked as if that little comment had shortcircuited something in his brain falcon thought torres might be inferring something inappropriate from his remark until he remembered that only men had been seen going into the apartment you do employ women dont you sr torres the receptionist who showed you in here is how do you recruit sr torres we advertise at business schools and through recruitment agencies give me some names and telephone numbers said falcon handing him his notebook how many people have you fired in the last year none two years none we dont fire people they leave its cheaper that way said falcon id like a list of all the people who have left your employ in the last year and id also like the names and addresses of all the men who frequented that apartment in calle los romeros why we have to know whether they saw anything while they were there especially in the last week it might not be so easy for you to interview my sales reps youll have to make it easy were looking for people who are responsible for the deaths of four children and five adultsso far and the first fortyeight hours of an investigation are critical when would you like to start two members of my squad will begin contacting your sales reps as soon as youve given me their names and phone numbers said falcon and why by the way did you insist on your employees being there in the hours of daylight those are the hours they work anyway they sell from nine in the morning until eight at night while businesses are open then theres the paperwork team meetings course studies product information classes twelvehour days are the short ones let me have a list with addresses and phone numbers of all the board members too now along with those other lists i asked for said falcon i am busy too sr torres so if you could bring them to me in the next ten minutes it would be appreciated torres stood and went to shake falcons hand id like you to bring me the lists sr torres said falcon ill have more questions by then torres left falcon went to the toilet there was an electronic plaque above each urinal which streamed quotes from the bible and inspirational business maxims informaticalidad extracted the best out of its employees by embracing them in a culture not unlike a religious sect the receptionist was waiting for him outside the toilets it looked as if shed been sent to make sure he didnt roam too freely around the corridors despite all the offices being controlled by security key pads she took him back to torres who was waiting with the lists is informaticalidad part of a holding company asked falcon were in the hightechnology division of a spanish company based in madrid called horizonte they are owned by a us investment company called iit who are they who knows said torres the i bit is indianapolis investment interests incorporated and it is information technology i think they started out investing only in hitech but theyre broader based than that now torres walked him back to reception how many ideas and projects did your reps come up with while they were in calle los romeros fifteen ideas which have already been incorporated into our working practices and four projects which are still in the planning stage have you ever heard of a website called wwwvomitorg never said torres and let the door slowly close back in his car falcon checked his mobiles for calls informaticalidads building a steel cage covered in tinted glass reflected its surroundings on top of the building were four banners with company logos informaticalidad quirurgicalidad ecograficalidad and finally a slightly larger placard featuring a huge pair of spectacles with a horizon running through them and above the word optivision high technology robotic surgical instruments ultrasound machines and laser equipment for correcting visual defects this company had access to the internal workings of the body they could see inside you remove and implant things and make sure you saw the world the way they saw it it disturbed falcon sevilletuesday th june hrs as falcon pulled away car rippling along the glass facade of the building he put a call through to mark flowers who was euphemistically known as a communications officer in the us consulate in seville he was a cia operative who after had been pulled out of retirement posted to madrid and transferred to seville falcon had met him during an investigation back in they had stayed in touch or rather falcon had become one of flowers sources and in return received intelligence and a more direct and proactive line to the fbi returning your call mark said falcon we should talk have you got anything for me nothing it came out of the blue im working on stuff can you get some information for me on a company called iit thats indianapolis investment interests incorporated in information technology sure said flowers when can we meet tonight late our people want to interview me said falcon if you come afterwards you might be able to give me some advice falcon hung up the radio news gave its latest summary of events a group called the martires islamicos para la liberacion de andalucia had called both tve and rne to claim responsibility for the attack el corte ingles had been evacuated and there was a stampede in the calle tetuan because of a bomb scare all roads out of seville especially the motorway south towards jerez de la frontera were jammed with traffic falcon had to resist the image of a vast dust cloud on the outskirts of seville thick with panicked cattle beneath as he drove back across the river his mobile vibrated ramirez wanting to know where he was weve found somebody whos a regular at the mosque he said he goes there every evening after work for prayers well see you in the preschool falcon came into the barrio of el cerezo from the north to avoid any traffic around the hospital in the preschool he photocopied the lists of personnel from informaticalidad and gave them to ramirez with orders for two members of the squad to start interviewing the sales reps to see if theyd noticed anything ramirez introduced the moroccan man who was called said harrouch he was a cook born in in larache in northern morocco the demolition work was too loud for them to talk in any of the classrooms none of which had any glass in the windows so they moved to the mans apartment nearby harrouchs wife made them mint tea and they sat in a room facing away from the destroyed building youre a cook for a manufacturing company in the poligono industrial calonge said ramirez what hours do you work seven in the morning until five in the afternoon he said they let me go back home when they heard about the bomb do you go to the mosque at a regular time i manage to get there some time between half past five and a quarter to six every day on the weekends i go five times a day do you just pray or do you spend time there at the weekends theres tea and ill sit around and talk the man was calm he sat back from the table with his hands clasped across his stomach he blinked slowly with long lashes and no wariness of either policeman how long have you lived in seville nearly sixteen years he said i came over in to work on the expo site i never went back do you like living here in this neighbourhood i preferred living in the old city he said it was more like home how are the people here you mean the spanish people he asked theyre all right most of them some of them dont like so many of us moroccans being here you dont have to be diplomatic said ramirez tell us how it really is after the madrid train bombings a lot of people are very suspicious of us said harrouch they might have been told that not every north african is a terrorist but it doesnt help when there are so many of us about the imam has done his best to explain to local people that terrorism is a problem with an extreme minority and that he himself does not agree with their radical interpretations of islam and does not approve of it in his mosque it hasnt helped they are still suspicious i tell them that even in morocco you would struggle to find anyone who actively approves of what these few fanatics are doing but they dont believe us of course if you go to a teahouse in tangier you will hear people getting angry about what the americans and the israelis are doing you will see protests on the streets about the plight of the palestinians but that is just talk and demonstration it doesnt mean were all about to strap bombs to our chests and go out and kill our own people were killed in the suicide bombings in casablanca in may and muslims died on those trains in madrid in and in london in but they dont remember that thats the nature of terror isnt it sr harrouch said falcon the terrorist wants people to know that this can happen in any place at any time to anybodychristian muslim hindu or buddhist this seems to be the state we are in now here in seville people can no longer feel safe in their homes what we want to find out as soon as possible is who wants us to be terrified or if thats too difficult why they want us to be terrified but of course everybody will assume it is us said harrouch putting his fingertips to his chest as i left work this morning i was insulted in the street by people who can only think in one way when they hear that a bomb has gone off on th march the government automatically thought it was eta said ramirez we know that there are antimuslim groups said falcon weve all heard of vomit for instance said harrouch then registering the policemens surprise we spend a lot of time on the internet thats how we communicate with our families back in morocco we only found out about it this morning said falcon but it isnt directed at you is it said harrouch its designed to show that islam is a religion of hate which is not true we see vomit as just another way that the west has devised to set out to humiliate us but it isnt the west that has created that website said ramirez its another fanatical minority within the west the fact is sr harrouch its going to take time for us to reach the basement where the mosque was located said falcon drawing the discussion back to business were going to have to wait days for any forensic information from the site of the actual bomb what we have to rely on for the moment is witness accounts who was seen going in and out of that building over the last seventytwo hours so far we have had a sighting of two vehicles a white peugeot partner with two moroccan men who were seen delivering cardboard boxes of sugar said harrouch suddenly animated i was there when they brought it in yesterday it was sugar it was clearly printed on the sides of the boxes and they had plastic carrier bags of mint it was for the tea did you know those two men asked ramirez had you seen them before no i didnt know them he said id never seen them before so who did know them who did they make contact with imam abdelkrim benaboura what did they do with this sugar and mint they took it into the storeroom at the back of the mosque were these men introduced to anybody no do you know where they came from asked falcon someone said they were from madrid how long did they stay in the mosque talking to the imam they were still there when i left at seven oclock could they have spent the night there its possible people have slept in the mosque before do you remember when they arrived asked ramirez about ten minutes after i came in from work so about a quarter to six can you tell us exactly what they did they came in each carrying a box with a carrier bag of mint on top they asked for the imam he came out of his office and showed them the storeroom they stowed the boxes and then went back outside and brought another two boxes in then what they left emptyhanded i think so said harrouch but they came back a few minutes later i think they went off to park their car when they returned they went into the imams office and they hadnt come out again by the time i left did you hear anything of their conversation harrouch shook his head falcon sensed the mans nausea at the endless questions about seemingly unimportant detail harrouch somehow felt he was compromising these two men who he believed had just delivered sugar and nothing more falcon told him not to worry about the questions they were asked only to see if they squared with other witness accounts did you hear any talk of other outsiders whod turned up that morning asked ramirez outsiders workmen delivery peoplethat sort of thing the electricians came at some stage something had gone wrong with the electrics on saturday night we were in the dark with just candles all sunday and when i came in from work yesterday all the lights were back on i dont know what happened or what work was done youll have to ask someone who was there in the morning ramirez asked him for some names and checked them off against the list of men given to elvira by the spanish woman esperanza the first three names harrouch gave him were on the list and therefore probably dead in the mosque the fourth name lived in an apartment in a nearby street how well do you know the imam hes been with us nearly two years he reads a lot ive heard his apartment is full of books but he still gives us as much of his time as he can said harrouch i told you he was not a radical he never said anything that could be construed as extreme and he even made his position clear on suicide bombing that in his view the koran did not regard it as permissible and remember there were spanish converts to islam in the mosque who would not tolerate anything extreme so if he was preaching radical islam to younger people said ramirez do you think you would know about it in a neighbourhood like this it wouldnt be possible to keep it secret apart from these two men who delivered the sugar and mint have you ever seen the imam with any other strangers i mean people from out of town or from abroad i saw him with spanish people he was very aware of the image of islam in the light of what has been happening in the last few years he made efforts to communicate with catholic priests and spoke at their meetings to reassure them that not all north africans were terrorists do you know anything about his history hes algerian originally he arrived here from tunis he must have spent some time in egypt because he talked about it a lot and hes mentioned studying in khartoum how did he learn spanish asked falcon the countries you mention have either french or english as the alternative to arabic he learnt it here the converts taught him said harrouch he was a good linguist he spoke quite a few what other languages asked ramirez german he spoke german said harrouch whod gone back on the defensive does that mean hed spent time in germany asked ramirez i suppose he did but that doesnt have to mean anything said harrouch just because the bombers came from hamburg it doesnt mean that any muslim whos been to germany is also a radical i hope youre not forgetting that it was the mosque that was bombed and there were more than ten people in it and most of them were older men with wives and children and not young radical extreme bombmakers i would say that we were the target of an attack all right sr harrouch said falcon calming him you should know that were looking at all the possibilities you mentioned vomit are you aware of any other antimuslim groups who you think would go to such extremes there were some very unpleasant demonstrations against the building of our mosque in los bermejales said harrouch maybe you dont rememberthey slaughtered a pig on the proposed site of the mosque back in may last year theres a very vociferous protest group we know about them said ramirez well be taking a close look at their activities did you ever feel that you were being watched or under some kind of surveillance asked falcon has anybody joined the mosque recently who you didnt know or who in your opinion behaved strangely people are suspicious of us but i dont think anybody was watching us ramirez checked the descriptions of the two men from the peugeot partner with the men harrouch had seen bringing boxes into the mosque harrouch answered with his mind elsewhere they got up to leave now i remember there was something else that happened last week said harrouch someone told me that the mosque had been inspected by the council because were technically a public building we have to conform to certain rules about fire and safety and two men came round last week without any warning and went through everythingdrains plumbing electricsthe lot sevilletuesday th june hrs what did you make of him falcon asked ramirez as they made their way back to the preschool for a meeting with comisario elvira and juez calderon the difficulty with these people is not disentangling the truth from the lies i dont think sr harrouch is a liar hes been an immigrant for sixteen years and hes developed the knack for telling you the story which will give him the least amount of trouble and makes his people appear in the best possible light said ramirez he says the imam has never preached a radical word in his life but he faltered over the imams linguistic ability why wasnt he happy about revealing the languages the imam could speak because it was german not only the hamburg connection but it also means hes moved around europe its making the imam look more suspicious he was straight about the two young guys turning up with their cardboard boxes of sugar said ramirez he was very emphatic about that he was reluctant to reveal anything more about them though he wanted to be able to say he knew them but he couldnt he wanted to be able to stand up for them in some way but if theyre just shifting sugar around whats the problem why does he feel the need to protect them loyalty to other muslims said falcon or repercussions said ramirez even if they dont know each other theres a sense of allegiance said falcon sr harrouch is a decent hardworking man and hed like us to think that all his people are the same when something like this bombing happens they feel embattled and the instinct is to put up the defences all around even if he ends up defending the sort of people he may abhor elvira and calderon had been joined by gregorio from the cni there have been some developments in madrid said elvira gregorio will explain weve been working on the notes found in the margins of the copy of the koran from the peugeot partner said gregorio in the meantime copies of the notes were faxed up to madrid and they made comparisons with the handwriting of the vans owner mohammed soumaya and his nephew trabelsi amar they dont match do the notes reveal anything asked calderon are there any extremist views our expert on the koran says that the owner of this book has made interesting rather than radical interpretations of the text said gregorio have you found trabelsi amar yet asked ramirez he was still in madrid said gregorio nodding he was just keeping out of the way of his uncle until he got the van back which was supposed to be this evening when he heard about the bomb he went into hiding which was obviously not part of the plan because the best hiding place he could think of was a friends house not some prearranged safe house the local police picked him up a couple of hours ago has he identified the people he lent the van to asked ramirez yes hes very scared said gregorio the cgis antiterrorist squad in madrid say he hasnt been behaving like a terrorist at all hes been happy to tell them the whole story lets start with the names said ramirez the shavenheaded guy is djamel hammad thirtyone years old born in tlemcen in algeria his friend is smail saoudi thirty years old born tiaret in algeria both were resident in morocco and still should be what sort of records have they got those are their original names theyve operated under a lot of pseudonyms they were mediumto highrisk terror suspects by which i mean they were not likely to actually carry out attacks but they have been suspected of document forgery recce and logistical work they both have relatives who have been active in the giathe armed islamic group and how did trabelsi amar get to know them theyre all illegal immigrants they came across the straits together on the same shipment hammad and saoudi made him their friend they got him to madrid and helped him with his documents then they called in the favour didnt he find their slicknesssuspicious asked calderon it was convenient for him not to said gregorio trabelsi amar is not very bright whats the story with the van asked ramirez amar has been working for his uncle making deliveries he also did a few things on the side to make himself some extra cash he ran errands some of them were for hammad and saoudi then they asked to borrow the van the first time for an afternoon the second time for a whole day it all happened gradually so that when they asked to borrow the van to go to seville for three days and said theyd give him trabelsi amar just saw the money how did he explain that to his uncle mohammed asked ramirez he rented the van from him for a day said gregorio he might not be bright but he could still work out that he didnt have to do anything and hed be up on the deal so presumably he knows where hammad and saoudi live theyre searching the apartment as we speak when exactly did amar go into hiding asked ramirez when he heard about the bomb or once it was reported that the peugeot partner had been found as soon as he heard about the bomb said gregorio so hed probably worked out already that his new friends werent just ordinary guys what about their relationship with the imam abdelkrim benaboura asked falcon apart from the fact that they were all algerians the only connection we can see at the moment was that benaboura was born in tlemcen which doesnt mean much weve found out more about the imam from a member of the mosque than we have from the cni and the cgi put together said falcon we still dont have the authority to access any more information said gregorio and that includes juan who as youve probably gathered is a very senior officer the imam is a player of some sort said ramirez im sure of it what about this group the mila who according to the television news have claimed responsibility for the blast asked falcon its not a group weve ever heard of having an active terrorist dimension said gregorio weve heard about their intention to liberate andalucia but weve never taken it seriously with the current military setup in this country its just not possible for anyone but a major power to secure a region of spain for themselves the basques havent achieved it and they dont even have to invade and what did the cgi in madrid know about hammad and saoudi being in spain asked calderon they didnt said gregorio its not as easy as it sounds to trace unknown radicals in a huge constantly changing immigrant population some of whom are legal and others whove been smuggled across the straits we know for instance that some of these people come over perform two or three tasks in this country and then move on to be replaced by others from france germany or the netherlands quite often they have no idea of the purpose of what theyre doing they deliver a package drive a person somewhere raise some money from stolen bank cards travel on a train at certain times to report on passenger numbers and time spent at how many stations or theyre asked to look at a building and report on its security situation even if we catch them and extract their task from them which is not easy all we end up with is a little strip of footage that could be one of a hundred operations that might make up a major attack or might just be something that ends up on the cuttingroom floor does anyone have any opinion about what hammad and saoudi might have been doing asked falcon we dont know enough we hope to know more after weve searched their apartment said gregorio what about the hood and the islamic sash said ramirez isnt that what operatives wear when they videotape themselves before a suicide mission no comment from the cgi on that said gregorio based on the interview with trabelsi amar they think the guys were logistical and nothing more ramirez gave a report on the deliveries to the mosque the council visit last week the power cut on saturday night and the electricians repair work performed on monday morning falcon held back on disclosing his findings from the interview with diego torres of informaticalidad until they had more information from interviews with the sales reps do we know anything more about the explosive used asked calderon the bomb squad have given me this report said elvira based on their preliminary investigation of the site the distance from the epicentre to the furthest flung pieces of debris and the extent of the destruction of the first three floors of the building their conservative estimate is that three times the quantity of hexogen was exploded than was necessary if the intention was to destroy the apartment block do they deduce anything from that asked calderon or is that left up to our inexpert assuming thats what theyre prepared to put in writing at the moment said elvira verbally they tell me that to destroy a building of this size with demolition knowledge easily found on the internet they would need as little as twenty kilos of hexogen they say that hexogen is commonly used in demolition work but primarily to shear through solid steel girders twenty kilos expertly positioned in an ordinary reinforced concrete building would wreck the whole block not just the section that was actually destroyed they deduce from this that the explosive was located in one place in the basement of the building more towards the back than the front hence the damage done to the preschool they thought that it could have been as much as one hundred kilos of hexogen that exploded well that sounds like enough to start a serious bombing campaign in seville said calderon and if this is a group with plans to liberate the whole of andalucia you probably havent seen the latest news said elvira but were on red alert all over the region theyve evacuated the cathedral in cordoba and the alhambra and generalife in granada there are now special patrols going through the tourist resorts on the costa del sol and there are more than twenty roadblocks along the n the navy are off the coast and there are air force fighters on all major airstrips more than forty helicopters are running up and down the main arterial routes through andalucia zapatero is taking this threat very seriously indeed well he has the demise of his predecessors political ambitions as an example said calderon and nobody wants to be the prime minister who lost andalucia to the muslims after more than five hundred years of spanish rule they werent quite ready to laugh at calderons cynicism the sense of all that activity described by elvira was too powerful and as if to reinforce his words a helicopter passed rapidly overhead like the latest despatch to a new crisis point falcon broke the silence the cgi antiterrorist squad in madrid think that hammad and saoudi were providing logistical support for an unknown cell that was going to carry out an attack or series of attacks clearly a delivery of some sort was made on monday th june a single hood and sash were found in the delivery vehicle possibly indicating that either hammad or saoudi might become operatives it also might indicate that one of them was going to return the van to madrid so that trabelsi amar had his van back as arranged what history can show us is that prior to the march th attacks in madrid two cell members went up to aviles to pick up explosives on the th and th february they allowed themselves a full ten days to prepare for the attacks in our scenario here we are being asked to believe that the hexogen in raw powder form was delivered on monday and that on the same night they started preparing bombs so that they were all ready to go on tuesday morning then at approximately am there was an accident and the explosion occurred i realize that this is not impossible and in the history of terrorism there probably exists an incidence of delivery preparation and attack being carried out within twentyfour hours but if youre a group planning the liberation of andalucia this doesnt seem very likely whats the scenario you envisage asked gregorio i dont im just picking holes i was trying to find a line of logic but there were too many breaks i dont want our investigation to go down a single path within the first twelve hours of the incident said falcon were probably going to have to wait two or three days to get forensic information from the mosque and until that time i think we should keep both possibilities open that there was an accident in the bombmaking procedure or that this was an attack on the mosque why would someone want to attack the mosque asked calderon revenge extreme xenophobia political or business motivation or perhaps a combination of all four said falcon terror is just a tool to bring about change look at the havoc wreaked by this bomb terror focuses peoples attention and creates opportunities for powerful people the population of this city is already fleeing with that sort of panic unimaginable things become possible the only way to contain panic said comisario elvira is to show people that we are in control even if we arent said juez calderon even if we dont have the first idea where to look whoever is behind this whether its islamic militants or other forces theyve planned their media assault said falcon the abc received the abdullah azzam text in a letter with a seville stamp tve tells us that the mila have called to claim responsibility would they be claiming responsibility for blowing up a mosque and killing their own people asked calderon thats an everyday occurrence in baghdad said elvira if you send something like azzams text to the abc then youre expecting to launch an attack imminentlynot even within twentyfour hours said gregorio as far as i know islamic militants have never advertised their exact intentions all the big ones have come out of the blue with the intention of killing and maiming as many people as possible gregorio took a call on his mobile and asked to leave weve had this preliminary report from the bomb squad about the explosion said falcon but what about the explosive where does it come from and what are all these different names for it hexogen is the german name cyclonite is american rdx is british and i think the italians call it t said elvira they might each have signatures which enables them to identify the origin but theyre not going to tell us we could use some shots of hammad and saoudi said ramirez if theyre into document fraud therell probably be a load of photographs in their apartment in madrid said falcon has there been an update on the demolition work outside yet theyre still saying fortyeight hours minimum and thats if they dont come across anything to slow them down juez calderon took a call announced the discovery of another body and left falcon made eye contact with ramirez and he left the room still no news on the cgi asked falcon i expected to be pooling resources and efforts with the antiterrorist unit and the only person weve seen is inspector jefe ramon barros who doesnt say very much and appears humiliated im told that their job is more to do with gathering data at this stage said comisario elvira what about some lower level people to help with the interviewing not possible this sounds like something you cant talk about all im going to say is that since march th one aspect of counterterrorism measures has been to check that our own organizations are clean said elvira dont tell me said falcon the seville branch is under investigation nobody is giving any detail but as far as i can gather the cni ran a test on the seville antiterrorism unit and did not get the right result they believe they have been compromised in some way there are some highlevel discussions going on now as to whether they should be allowed to participate in this investigation or not youre not going to get any active help from the madrid cgi either theyre working flatout on their own informer network and theyve got the whole hammad and saoudi mess to sort through will we be getting informer feedback from the seville cgi network not for the moment said elvira im sorry to be so reticent but the situation is delicate i dont know what the members of the antiterrorism unit are being told to make them believe that they are not under suspicion but the cni are trying to play it both ways they dont want the mole if he exists to know that theyre on to him but neither do they want him endangering the investigation without them knowing who he is ideally they want to find him and then release the cgi into the investigation and give themselves the chance of using him that sounds like a risky manoeuvre thats why its taking so long to decide the politicians are involved now said elvira outside the grind of machinery had become the acceptable ambient noise men moved like aliens in a grey lunar landscape over the stacked pancakes of the floors with snakes of pneumatic hose trailing behind they were followed by masked men with oxyacetylene torches and motorized saws swinging above them was the cranes writhing cable the hammering growling and howling the clatter of falling rubble the momentous gonging as sections of floor were dropped into the tippers kept the curious crowds at bay only a few tv crews and photojournalists remained with their cameras trained on the destruction in the hope of zooming in on a crushed body a bloodied hand a spike of bone another helicopter stuttered overhead and wheeled away to fly over the nearby andalucian parliament as he trotted down calle los romeros falcon called ramirez to get the name of the worshipper mentioned by sr harrouch who used the mosque in the mornings he was called majid merizak ramirez offered to join him but falcon preferred to be alone for this one the reason that majid merizak was not one of the casualties in the mosque was that he was ill in bed he was a widower who was looked after by one of his daughters she hadnt been able to prevent her father from heading down the stairs to find out what had happened only his partial collapse had done that now he was in a chair head thrown back wildeyed and panting with the television on full blast because he was nearly deaf the apartment stank of vomit and diarrhoea hed been up most of the night and was still weak the daughter turned off the television and forced her father to wear his hearing aid she told falcon that her fathers spanish was poor and falcon said that they could conduct the interview in arabic she explained this to her father who looked confused and irritable with too much happening around him once his daughter had checked that the hearing aid was functioning properly and had left the room majid merizak sharpened up you speak arabic he asked im still learning part of my family is moroccan he nodded and drank tea through falcons introduction and visibly relaxed on hearing falcons rough arabic it had been the right thing to do merizak was far less wary than harrouch had been falcon warmed him up with questions about when he attended the mosquewhich was every morning without fail and he stayed there until the early afternoon then he asked about strangers last week asked merizak and falcon nodded two young men came in on tuesday morning close to midday and two older men came in on friday morning at ten oclock thats all and youd never seen them before no but i did see them again yesterday who the two young men whod come in last tuesday merizaks description fitted that of hammad and saoudi and what did they do last tuesday they went into the imams room and talked with him until about one thirty and what about yesterday morning they brought in two heavy sacks it took two of them to carry one sack what time was this about ten thirty the same time that the electricians arrived said merizak yes of course there were the electricians as well id never seen them before either where did the two young men put these sacks in the storeroom next to the imams office do you know what was in the sacks couscous thats what it said on the side has anyone made a delivery like that before not in those quantities people have brought in bags of food to give to the imamyou know its part of our duty to give to those less fortunate than ourselves when did they leave they stayed about an hour what about the men who came in on friday they were inspectors from the council they went all over the mosque they discussed things with the imam and then they left what about the power cut that was on saturday night i wasnt there the imam was on his own he said that there was a big bang and the lights went out thats what he told us the following morning when we had to pray in the dark and the electricians came in on monday to fix it a man came on his own at eight thirty then three other men came two hours later to do the work were they spanish they were speaking spanish what did they do the fuse box was burned out so they put in a new one then they put in a power socket in the storeroom what sort of work was that they cut a channel in the brickwork from a socket in the imams office through the wall and into the storeroom they put in some grey flexible tubing fed in the wire and then cemented it all up merizak had seen the blue transit van which he described as battered but he hadnt seen any markings or the registration number how did the imam pay for the work cash do you know where he got the phone number of this company no would you recognize the electricians council inspectors and two young men if you saw them again yes but i cant describe them to you very well youve been listening to the news they dont know what theyre talking about said merizak it makes me very angry a bomb explodes and it is automatically islamic militants have you ever heard of los martires islamicos para la liberacion de andalucia the first time was on the news today its an invention of the media to discredit islam have you ever heard of the imam preaching militant ideology in the mosque quite the opposite im told that the imam was a very capable linguist he learnt spanish very quickly they said his apartment was full of french and english books he spoke german too he spoke on the telephone using languages id never heard before he told me that one of them was turkish some people came here in february and stayed with him for a week and that was another strange language somebody said it was pashto and that the men were from afghanistan sevilletuesday th june hrs the offices of the abc newspaper a glass cylinder on the isla de la cartuja had been as close to bedlam as a hysterical business like journalism could get angel zarrias watched from the edge of the newsroom as journalists roared down telephones bawled at assistants and harangued each other through the flickering computer screens the phone lines stretched to snapping point and the triangles formed by hands slapped to foreheads angel was watching the open door of the editors office he was biding his time this was the newshounds moment it was their job to find the stories which the editor would knit together to construct the right image and tone for the new history of a city in crisis on the way from manuelas apartment to the abc offices hed asked the taxi to drop him off in a street near the maestranza bullring where his friend eduardo rivero lived and which also housed the headquarters of his political party fuerza andalucia hed been dining with eduardo rivero and the new sponsors of fuerza andalucia last night a momentous decision had been made which he hadnt been able to share with manuela until it became official today he had also not been able to tell her that he was now going to be working more for fuerza andalucia than the abc he had a lot more important things on his mind than grumbling about samesex marriages in his daily political column riveros impressive house bore all the hallmarks of his traditional upbringing and thinking its facade was painted to a deep terracotta finish the window surrounds were picked out in ochre and all caged in magnificent wroughtiron grilles the main door was three metres high built out of oak varnished to the colour of chestnuts and studded with brass medallions it opened on to a huge marbleflagged patio in which rivero had departed briefly from tradition by planting two squares of box hedge in the centre of each was a statue to the left was apollo and to the right dionysus and in between was the massive bowl of a white marble fountain whose restrained trickles of water held the house despite these pagan idols in a state of religious obeisance the front of the house was the party headquarters with the administration below and the policymaking and political discussions going on above angel took the stairs just inside the main door which led up to riveros office they were waiting for him rivero and his secondincommand the much younger jesus alarcon unusually he and rivero were sitting together in the middle of the room with the bosss wood and leather armchair empty behind his colossal english oak desk they all shook hands rivero the same age as angel seemed remarkably relaxed he wasnt even wearing a tie his jacket was hanging off the back of his chair he was smiling beneath an ebullient white moustache he did not look as if scandal had come anywhere near him like any good journalist angel youve arrived at the crucial moment said rivero a decision has been made i dont believe it said angel well youll have to believe it because its true said rivero id like you to meet the new leader of fuerza andalucia jesus alarcon effective as from five minutes ago i think thats a bold and brilliant decision said angel shaking them both by the hand and embracing them and one youve been keeping very quiet the committee voted on it last night before we met for dinner said rivero i didnt want to break the news until i had asked jesus and hed accepted something was going to have to happen before the campaign and with this mornings explosion that campaign will be starting todayand what better way to kick it off than with a new leader alarcons expression was a mask of seriousness that bore all the weight and lines of the gravity that the situation demanded but it could not hide what came shining out from within his grey suit dark tie and white shirt could not contain his sense of achievement he was the schoolboy at the prizegiving whod already been told that he had won the top award angel zarrias had known jesus alarcon since the year when hed been introduced to him by his old friend lucrecio arenas the chief executive officer of the banco omni in madrid in the last six years angel had drawn jesus into eduardo riveros orbit and gradually eased him into positions of greater importance within the party angel had never had any doubt about alarcons brains his political commitment or astuteness but as an old pr man he had been worried by his lack of charisma but the final wresting of the leadership from riveros trembling clutches had wrought an extraordinary change in the younger man physically he was the same but his confidence had become dazzlingly palpable angel couldnt help himself he embraced jesus once again as the new leader of fuerza andalucia as you know said rivero in the last three elections there has been steady growth in our share of the vote but it has only grown to a maximum of per cent and that is not enough for us to be the chosen partner of the partido popular we need a new kind of energy at the top i have the business experience said alarcon breaking in with his newfound confidence to raise our funding to unprecedented levels but this is of limited significance in a torpid political atmosphere what this mornings event has given us is a unique opportunity to focus voters minds on the real and perceivable threat of radical islam it gives our immigration policy new bite where before even after th march it was dismissed as extreme and out of step with the ways in which contemporary societies were developing if we spend the next eight months getting that message across to the population of andalucia then we stand a chance of a substantial increase in our share of the vote come so we have the right ideology for the time and i can raise the money to make it heard across the region we dont think that its a coincidence that the first call after the explosion in el cerezo this morning should be from you angel said rivero you more than anybody else know what would make an enormous impression on the population of andalucia tomorrow morning angel sat back in his chair ran his fingers through his hair and hissed air out from between his clenched teeth he knew what rivero wanted and it was a tall order under the circumstances just think of the impact it would have said rivero nodding at jesus his face his profile and his ideas in the pages of abc sevilla on the day after such a catastrophe as this we would tread izquierda unida into the dust and make the partido andalucista writhe in their beds at night are you ready for what i can do for you asked angel im more prepared for it than at any time in my life said alarcon and handed him his cv angel had sat in the back of the cab on the way to the abc offices leafing through alarcons cv jesus alarcon was born in cordoba in hed been accepted at madrid university at the age of seventeen to study philosophy political history and economics as a staunch catholic he despised the atheistic creed of communism and believed that the best way to break ones enemy was to know them he went to berlin university to study russian and russian political history he was thereand a photograph existed to support thiswhen the wall came down in it wasnt supposed to have happened like that and the crucial event had left him bereft of a cause at the same time his fathers business collapsed and he died soon after his mother followed her husband into the grave six months later and jesus applied to insead in paris to do an mba by christmas he was working for mckinseys in boston and in the following four years became one of their analysts and consultants in central and south america in he moved to lehman brothers to join their mergers and acquisitions team there he changed his sphere of operations to the european union and built up a powerful list of investors looking to buy into the booming spanish economy in his life changed again when he met a beautiful sevillana called monica abellon whose father had been one of jesuss leading clients monicas father effected an introduction to lucrecio arenas who headhunted him for the secretive banco omni and he moved to madrid where monica was working as a model it was in the year that angel totally fed up with the partido popular had taken on some pr work for banco omni clients lucrecio arenas convinced that hed discovered a future leader of spain in jesus alarcon was eager for his new find to cut his teeth in regional politics and had enlisted angels help as soon as angel introduced alarcon to eduardo rivero and the other fuerza andalucia committee members they welcomed him into the fold recognizing one of their own jesus alarcon was a traditionalist a practising catholic a man who loathed communism and socialism a believer in the power of business to do good in society and also a lover of the bulls he was twenty years younger than any of them he was good looking if a little on the dull side but he made up for it by having the beautiful monica abellon as his wife and two gorgeous children in the abc offices angel went to work on the dossier and archives in an hour hed put together a page the editor was never going to look at more than that the headline this man has answers the main shot was part of a photograph hed found of jesus in a business magazine about spains future jesus was supposedly looking up to a sun which was probably a photographers lighting umbrella and his face was shining with hope and belief in the future he also had shots of jesus with the stunning monica and the couple with their children there was a sub headline which said the new leader of fuerza andalucia believes in our future the writing was in note form and described not just the radical immigration policy of fuerza andalucia but also vital economic and agrarian reforms that were necessary to make andalucia a force in the future it included jesuss employment profile which showed that he was economically sensible internationally connected and had the contacts in industry to make his ideas work there was a lull in activity just before lunch at around two oclock the traffic into the editors office had calmed angel made his move were probably going to have to cut your column for at least the next few days said the editor when he saw angel crossing his threshold of course said angel nobody wants political gossip at a time like this what do you want with me then said the editor interested now he knew that angel hadnt come for a fight most of the stuff in tomorrows newspaper is going to be hard news and a lot of it will be heartrending with reports on the destruction of the preschool and the dead children the only positive stories will be about the excellence of the emergency services and ive heard that theres a survivor youll be writing a leader that captures the mood of the city that reacts to the receipt of abdullah azzams text and that declares that we might not have moved so far forward since th march as everybody would like to think well angel now youve told me my job said the editor you can get on with telling me what youre proposing a vision of hope he said handing over the page hed just created in this time of crisis theres a young energetic capable man in the wings who could make andalucia a safe and prosperous place to live the editor scanned the page took it all in nodded and grunted so the rumours about eduardo rivero are true im not sure what youre referring to come off it angel said the editor flinging out a dismissive fist he was caught with his pants down i dont think theres any truth in that with an underage girl there was talk of a dvd nobodys seen it the rumblings have been very loud and now this said the editor waving the page in the air if it wasnt for the bomb id have someone digging in the dirt after your old friend look this has been in the pipeline for a long time said angel with this bomb going off he just feels that its time to stand down and let somebody younger take the party to the next stage hes going to be seventy at the end of this year so we have the first political casualty of the bomb thats not how we should be thinking about it said angel its precipitated change and its saying that change is what we have to do if we want to survive this challenge to our liberty youre serious angel whats happened to the great deflator the man with the sharpened nib who pops those hotair egos perhaps my cynicism is another casualty of the bomb well youre always complaining that nothing happens said the editor and nowyou believe in this guy and yet youve barely written a word about him before as youve just pointed out my column was primarily for puncturing egos said angel jesus alarcon hasnt had time to develop an ego that needs to be punctured hes quietly taken fuerza andalucia from being an organization with a small debt to one with regular contributions from members and businesses hes done amazing if uncharismatic work so what makes you think hes got the personality for it i saw him this morning said angel hes learnt a lot but can you learn charisma charisma is just an intense form of selfbelief said angel jesus alarcon has always been confident hes ambitious hes dealt with serious personal setbacks which to me are a far more powerful measure of the man than his ability to broker international finance deals he has the inner steel and common sense that our last prime minister had you know politics its like boxing its all very well to have the fast hands and fancy footwork but even the greatest fighters get hit very hard and if you cant absorb punishment youre finished jesus alarcon has all those qualities and after the conferring of the leadership i can now see emerging that indefinable quality that will make people want to follow him all right said the editor thinking positively about it a new face for a new era write me a profile and by the way i agree with you about charisma it is an intense form of selfbelief but theres something both blinding and blind about it too its closest friend can quite quickly become corruptionthe belief that you can do anything with impunity i hope jesus alarcon does not have the makings of a tragic figure hes not a hollow man said angel hes suffered and come through it get him to remember that suffering said the editor every politician should have the words of the president of the terrorists victims association pilar manjon ringing in their ears they only think of themselves the madrid police and forensics had been working hard in the apartment used by djamel hammad and smail saoudi taped to the underside of a gas bottle theyd found a selection of stolen and forged ids and passports with pictures of the two men whose descriptions fitted those given by trabelsi amar and the seville homicide squad theyd also discovered in smalldenomination notes in three separate packages hidden around the apartment dna was currently being generated from hairs bristles and pubic hairs found in the bathroom an empty pad on the kitchen table had revealed indentations which proved to be complicated directions to a property southwest of madrid not far from a village called valmojado the isolated house near the rio guadarrama was found to be empty with no evidence of recent habitation the police concluded that it was a staging posta place to pick up and leave materialand nothing more the property had been rented in the name of a spaniard whose id was false the owners had been paid six months in advance which had made them reluctant to ask too many questions the forensics were still conducting their search of the premises but so far not a trace of explosive had been found the guardia civil had questioned a number of locals including shepherds and reckoned that in the four months it had been rented it had been visited by a white van five times three of those visits corresponded roughly to the times trabelsi amar had lent the peugeot partner to hammad and saoudi there was a complication with this scenario which was that the directions to the isolated house found in the madrid apartment were freshly written in hammads handwriting which would imply that their visit on sunday at around midday was their first this in turn implied that the other two times theyd borrowed trabelsi amars van theyd lent it to others who had gone to the farmhouse a clearer indication that the isolated farmhouse was being visited by people other than hammad and saoudi came from eyewitness reports that as many as six different people including one woman had been seen going there this information had an adrenalizing effect on the cgi in madrid who concluded that hammad and saoudi were acting within a much larger network than at first thought they contacted all the major intelligence agencies but none of them had picked up any chatter about a planned attack in spain the fear now was that hammad and saoudis logistical work was part of a wider effort the cgi with the help of the guardia civil were now trying to find hammad and saoudis route from madrid to the isolated house near valmojado and then down to seville they wanted to know if they had made any other stopoversanonymouslooking meetings in roadside bars other visits to isolated houses or worse other deliveries to for instance a location in another major andalucian city that was the primary content of a sevenpage report drafted by several senior officers of the counterterrorism unit and sent by the madrid cgi to comisario elvira in the damaged preschool in seville there was a conclusion attached which had been written by the director of the cni and had also reached the hands of prime minister zapatero on the basis of our own findings and the reports received so far from the offices of the cgi and taken in conjunction with the preliminary reports from the bomb squad and the police on the ground at the site of the disaster we can only conclude at this point that we have come across an islamic terrorist network who were planning an attack or more likely a series of attacks with the intention of destabilizing the political and social fabric of the region of andalucia whilst the investigating bodies have so far uncovered some anomalies to the usual modus operandi of radical islamic groups they have not brought to our attention any suspicious activity or even stated intention of any other group that might want to inflict damage on the muslim population of andalucia we therefore recommend that the government take the necessary steps to protect all major cities in the region the noise of demolition work reasserted itself in the room after comisario elvira finished the reading of the report inspector jefe falcon and juez calderon were sitting on small childrens desks arms folded ankles crossed and staring into the ground which had now been swept clear of glass plastic sheeting which had been stretched across the empty window frames revealed an indistinct outside world that ballooned and lurched with the hot breeze blowing from the south they seem to have made up their minds dont they said calderon having told us not to disappear exclusively down one path thats just what theyve done themselves theres no mention of the vomit website or of any other antimuslim groups given all the stuff theyve just found in the madrid apartment of hammad and saoudi and the hexogen deposit in the rear of the peugeot partner and the islamic paraphernalia in the front said elvira who could blame them it doesnt look good for the islamic radicals at the moment said falcon but the bomb squad havent got to the epicentre of the explosion yet theres still vital forensic information to come ive also spoken to the forensics going over the peugeot partner and so far all theyve come up with is that a new tyre had been fitted to the rear drivers side and the spare had a puncture what theyve found in the madrid apartment and the existence of the isolated house could be interpreted as terrorist activity or illegal immigrant activity weve been told that hammad and saoudi have a track record of logistical involvement but what does that mean if theyd been caught with something then wed know about it if theyve been named by others thats questionable information my reading of this document said elvira flapping the paper derisively in front of him is that its something that has been drafted for the politicians so that they can appear knowledgeable and decisive on a day of crisis the cni and cgi have stuck to the known facts theyve mentioned anomalies but have given no detail vomit and other groups arent mentioned because theres nothing to support their involvement the mila doesnt appear either despite its mention on the news its because theyve got no intelligence to offer on any of them are we allowed to talk about the cgi said falcon purposely disingenuous calderons secrecy radar was on to it in a flash elvira threw up his hands needless to say this cant go out of this room said elvira but seeing as youre the instructing judge controlling this investigation you should know that there have been some concerns about the reliability of the seville branch of the cgi a decision from above has not yet been taken to allow them to fully enter the battle their agents have been in touch with their informer network and have drafted reports but we havent seen anything yet theyve been denied access to our reports and they know nothing about certain pieces of evidence such as the heavily annotated copy of the koran which as far as i know has been kept out of the news thats a big blow to the investigation said calderon shouldnt we have heard about this before now i dont have clearance to tell either of you said elvira so what is it about this heavily annotated copy of the koran thats so important asked calderon i dont know but its received a very high level of interest from the cni said elvira anyway that doesnt concern us right now when was the last time you heard from your squad recently enough to be able to say that weve got a pretty clear picture of what happened here in the last fortyeight hours some of which is connected to occurrences in the week before the explosion falcon now had at least two witnesses to each of the significant events that preceded the blast hammad and saoudi had first been seen at the mosque on tuesday th may at they arrived on foot and stayed talking to the imam until pm the two other events of that week were the visit from council inspectors at am on friday nd june and a power cut some time on saturday rd june at night when the imam had been in the mosque alone this led to an electrician turning up at am on monday th june to assess the damage and the work involved he returned with two labourers at am to repair the blown fuse box and also install a power socket in the storeroom next to the imams office the second visit from the electrician coincided with hammad and saoudis arrival in the peugeot partner and the unloading of two large polypropylene sacks which were believed to contain couscous they stayed about an hour the electricians left just before lunch at about pm hammad and saoudi returned at pm with four heavy cardboard boxes believed to contain sugar and some carrier bags of mint all of which went into the storeroom they were still there at pm and so far nobody had seen them leave the premises and what are your areas of concern in all that we have witnesses to the arrivals and departures of all these people said falcon but we havent been able to make contact with the electrician in order to get this done as quickly as possible ive asked my squad who are already overloaded with interview work to coordinate with local police and get them to visit every electricians outlet or workshop within a square kilometre of the explosion so far weve come up with nothing all we know is that three men arrived in a blue transit van with no markings and we have no witnesses for the registration number do you want the media to make an announcement asked elvira not yet i want to do more footwork on this what else i have other members of my squad tied up interviewing the informaticalidad sales reps none of them has come back to me with anything significant but i have yet to talk to them and find out what the story was there is that it my greatest concern at the moment apart from the undiscovered electrician is that the council have no record of sending any inspectors to the mosque or any other part of this building or even this barrio on friday nd june or any day for that matter in the last three months sevilletuesday th june hrs before the three men left the bombsite for the night calderon gave an update on the deaths and injuries four children had died of head wounds and internal bleeding in the preschool seven children had been seriously woundedranging from the loss of a leg below the knee to severe facial lacerations eighteen children had been lightly wounded mainly cut by flying glass two men and a woman who had been passing by the building on calle los romeros had been killed either by flying debris or falling masonry an elderly woman had died of a heart attack in an apartment across the road there were thirtytwo seriously injured people who had been either inside or around buildings close to the stricken block and there were three hundred and fortythree lightly injured from the rubble they had so far removed two men and two women who were dead and young lourdes alanis who had survived the list of missing in the mosque including the imam numbered thirteen apart from them this gave a total so far of twelve dead thirtynine seriously injured and three hundred and sixtyone lightly injured the demolition crews were now removing the remaining slabs of concrete from what had been the fifth floor the whole area was under floodlights as they prepared to work all night an airconditioned tent had been erected on some wasteground between the preschool and another block of apartments to handle forensic evidence another tent was being erected to deal with the bodies and body parts which would eventually be coming out of the crushed mosque the judges homicide squad forensics and emergency services had worked out a duty roster so that there would be someone on site all night from each group it was still light and very warm as elvira falcon and calderon left the preschool just before pm a group of people had gathered in a corner of the playground hundreds of candles flickered on the ground amidst bouquets of flowers banners and placards had been pinned up on the chainlink fencingno mas muertes paz solo los inocentes han caido por el derecho de vivir sin violenciano more death peace only the innocents have fallen for the right to live without violence but the largest banner of all was written in red against a white backgroundodio eterno al terrorismoeternal hate to terrorism in the bottom righthand corner was written vomit falcon asked if anybody had seen the person who had unfurled this banner but nobody had it was this banner which had drawn people to that part of the playground and so it had become a natural place for the locals to pay tribute to the fallen they stood in the violet light of a sun that was beginning to set on this catastrophic day and with the machinery inexorably clawing away at the piled rubble their murmured prayers guttering candles and the already wilting flowers were both pathetic and touching as pitiful and moving as the futile deaths of all humans in the vast grotesqueness of war as the lawmen backed away from the shrine elviras mobile rang he took the call and handed it to falcon it was juan from the cni saying that they had to meet tonight falcon said he would be home in an hour the hospital was calm after the frenetic activity of the day in the emergency room they were still picking glass out of peoples faces and suturing lacerations there were patients in the waiting room but there was no longer the horror of the triage nurse wading through the victims skidding on blood looking into the wide dark eyes of the injured silently pleading falcon showed his police id and asked for lourdes alanis who was in the intensive care unit on the first floor through the glass panels of the intensive care unit fernando was visible at his daughters bedside holding her hand she was hooked up to machines but seemed to be breathing on her own the doctor in the icu said she was making good progress she had sustained a broken arm and a crushed leg but no spinal injuries their main concern had been her head injuries she was still in a coma but a scan had revealed no evidence of brain damage or haemorrhaging as they talked fernando left the icu to go to the toilet falcon gave him a few minutes and went in after him he was washing his hands and face who are you he asked looking at falcon via the mirror suspicious knowing he wasnt a doctor we met earlier today by your apartment block my name is javier falcon im the inspector jefe of the homicide squad fernando frowned shook his head he didnt remember does this mean that youve caught the people who destroyed my family no were still working on that you wont have to look very far that rat hole is crawling with them with who fucking moroccans he said those fucking bastards weve been looking at them all this time ever since th march and weve been thinkingwhens the next time going to be we always knew that there was going to be a next time who is we alright me thats what ive been thinking said fernando but i know im not alone i didnt think the relations between the communities were so bad said falcon thats because you dont live in the communities said fernando ive seen the news full of nice comfortable people telling you that everything is all right that muslims and catholics are communicating that theres some kind of healing process going on i can tell you its all bullshit we live in a state of suspicion and fear even though you know that very few members of the muslim population are terrorists thats what were told but we dont know it said fernando and whats more we have no idea who they are they could be standing next to me in the bar drinking beer and eating jamon yes you see some of them even do that eat pig and drink alcohol but it seems that theyre just as likely to blow themselves up as the one who spends his life with his nose to the floor in the mosque i didnt come here to make you angry said falcon youve got enough to think about without that you didnt make me angry i am angry ive been angry a long time two years and three months ive been angry said fernando gloria my wife he stopped his face came apart his mouth thickened with saliva he had to support himself against the basin as the physical pain worked its way through it took some minutes for him to pull himself together gloria was a good person she believed in the good that exists in everyone but her belief didnt protect her it didnt protect our son the people she spoke up for killed her in the same way that they killed the ones they hate and who hate them anyway thats enough i must get back to my daughter i know you didnt have to come and find me here youve got a lot on your plate so i thank you for thatfor your concern and i wish you well in your investigation i hope you find the killers before i do i want you to call me said falcon giving him his card at any time day or night for whatever reason if youre angry depressed violent lonely or even hungry i want you to call me i didnt think you people were supposed to get personally involved i also want you to tell me if youre ever contacted by a group who call themselves vomit so its important on two levels that we keep in touch they left the toilet and shook hands outside where on the other side of the glass his daughters life was readable in green on the screens fernando hesitated as he leaned against the door only one politician spoke to me today he said i saw them all parading themselves before the cameras with the victims and their families this was while they were operating on lourdes skull so i had time to look at their ridiculous antics only one person found me who was that jesus alarcon said fernando id never heard of him before hes the new leader of fuerza andalucia what did he say to you he didnt say anything he listenedand there wasnt a camera in sight the sky darkened to purple over the old city like the discoloration around a recent wound that had begun to hurt in earnest falcon drove on automatic his mind buried deep in intractable problems a bomb explodes killing maiming and destroying what is left after the dust clears and the bodies are taken away is a horrendous social and political confusion where emotions rise to the surface and like wind on the susceptible grass of the plain influence can blow peoples minds this way and that turn them from beersippers into chestthumpers the three cni men were waiting for him outside his house on calle bailen he parked his car in front of the oak doors they all shook hands and followed him through to the patio which was looking a little dishevelled these days encarnacion his housekeeper wasnt as capable as she used to be and falcon didnt have the money for the renovation required and anyway hed grown to enjoy living in the encroaching shabbiness of his surroundings he dragged some chairs out around a marbletopped table on the patio and left the cni men to listen to the water trickling in the fountain he came back with cold beers olives capers pickled garlic crisps bread cheese and jamon they ate and drank and talked about spains chances in the world cup in germany always the samea team full of genius and promise which was never fulfilled do you have any idea why we want to talk to you asked pablo who was more relaxed now less intensely observant something to do with my moroccan connections so i was told youre a very interesting man to us said pablo we dont want to hide the fact that weve been looking at you for some time now im not sure that ive got the right mentality for secret work any more if youd asked me five years ago then you might have found the ideal candidate who is the ideal candidate asked juan someone who is already hiding a great deal from the world from his family from his wife and from himself a few state secrets on top wouldnt be such a burden we dont want you to be a spy said juan do you want me to deceive no we think deceiving would be a very bad idea under the circumstances youll understand better what we want by answering a few questions said pablo wresting the interview back from his boss dont make them too difficult said falcon ive had a long day tell us how you came to meet yacoub diouri that could take some time said falcon were not in any hurry said pablo and as if at some prearranged signal juan and gregorio sat back took out cigarette packs and lit up it was one of those occasions after a long day with a little beer and food inside him that made falcon wish he was still a smoker i think you probably know that just over five years ago on th april i ran a murder investigation into the brutal killing of an entrepreneur turned restaurateur called raul jimenez youve got a policemans memory for dates said juan youll find that date written in scar tissue on my heart when im dead said falcon its got nothing to do with being a policeman it had a big impact on your life said pablo falcon took another fortifying gulp of cruzcampo the whole of spain knows this story it was all over the newspapers for weeks said falcon a little irritated with the knowingness with which the questions had started coming at him we werent in spain at the time said juan weve read the files but its not the same as hearing it for real my investigation into raul jimenezs past showed that hed known my father the artist francisco falcon theyd started a smuggling business together in tangier during and after the second world war it meant they could establish themselves and start families and francisco falcon could begin the process of turning himself into an artist and what about raul jimenez said pablo didnt he meet his wife when she was very young raul jimenez had an unhealthy obsession with young girls said falcon taking a deep breath knowing what they were after it wasnt so unusual in those days in tangier or andalucia for a girl to get married at thirteen but in fact her parents made raul wait until she was seventeen they had a couple of children but they were difficult births and the doctor recommended that his wife didnt have any more in the runup to moroccan independence in the s raul became involved with a businessman called abdullah diouri who had a young daughter raul had sex with this girl and i think even got her pregnant this would not have been a problem had he done the honourable thing and married the girl in muslim society he would have just taken a second wife and that would have been the end of it as a catholic it was impossible to complicate matters further despite doctors orders his wife became pregnant with their third child in the end raul took the cowards way out and fled with his family abdullah diouri was incensed when he discovered this and wrote a letter to francisco falcon in which he told him of rauls betrayal and expressed his determination to be avenged which he achieved five years later the third child a boy called arturo was kidnapped on his way back from school in southern spain raul jimenezs way of dealing with this terrible loss was to deny the boys existence it devastated the family his wife committed suicide and the children were damaged one of them beyond repair was it that sad story that made you decide to try to find arturo thirtyseven years after he had disappeared asked pablo as you know i met rauls second wife consuelo while investigating his murder about a year later we started a relationship and during that time we revealed to each other that the one thing that still haunted us about her husbands murder case and all that surfaced with it was the disappearance of arturo there was still a part of us that imagined the eternally lost sixyearold boy that was in july said pablo when did you start looking for arturo in september of that year said falcon neither of us could believe that abdullah diouri would have killed the child we thought he would have drawn him into his family in some way and what was driving you asked juan the lost boyor something else i knew very well i was looking for a fortythreeyearold man had something happened to your relationship with consuelo jimenez in the meantime asked pablo it finished almost as soon as it started but im not going to discuss that with you didnt consuelo jimenez break off the relationship asked pablo she broke it off said falcon throwing up his hands realizing that the whole of the jefatura knew what had happened she didnt want to get involved and you were unhappy i was very unhappy about it so what was your motive in looking for arturo asked juan consuelo refused to see me or speak to me she cut me out of her life not unlike what raul had tried to do with arturo said juan if you like juan took a pickled garlic and bit into it with a light crunch i realized that the only way id be able to see her again under the right circumstances rather than as a mad stalker was to do something extraordinary i knew that if i found arturo she would have to see me again it was the way we had connected in the first place and i knew it would stir something in her and did it work asked juan fascinated by falcons torment sevilletuesday th june hrs a warm breeze made a circuit of the patio and stirred up a large dead and driedout plant in a far dark corner of the cloister i think it would be better to approach this chronologically said pablo why dont you tell us how you found arturo jimenez the rustle and rattle of the plants dead leaves had drawn falcons gaze to its desiccated corner he had to get rid of that plant because my search for arturo was motivated by this hope for reconciliation with consuelo i imagined it as a sort of quest it was a little more straightforward than that i was lucky to have some help said falcon i went to fes with a member of my new moroccan family he found a guide who took us to abdullah diouris house deep in the medina apart from a magnificently carved door the house looked like nothing from the outside but the door opened into a paradise of patios pools and miniature gardens which had been allowed to decay from some greater former glory there were tiles missing and cracked paving and the latticework around the gallery was broken in places the servant who let us in told us that abdullah diouri had died some twenty years ago but that his memory lived on as he had been a great and kind man we asked to speak to any of the sons but he told us that only women lived in this house the sons had dispersed throughout morocco and the middle east so we asked if one of the women would be willing to speak to us about this delicate matter that had occurred some forty years ago he took our names and left he returned after quarter of an hour and told my moroccan relative to stay at the door while he took me on a long trip through the house we ended up on the first floor with a view through some repaired latticework on to a garden below he left me there and after a while i realized that there was somebody else in the room a woman dressed in black her face totally veiled pointed me to a seat and i told her my story fortunately id talked to my moroccan family about what i was intending to do so i knew i had to be very careful about how i related this story it had to be from the moroccan perspective what did that entail asked juan that raul jimenez had to be the villain of the piece and abdullah diouri the saviour of the family honour if i sullied the name of the patriarch in any way if i made him out to be a criminal a kidnapper of children i would get nowhere it was good advice the woman listened to me in silence still as a statue under a black dustsheet at the end of my story a gloved hand came out of her robe and dropped a card on to a low table between us then she got up and left on the card was printed an address in rabat with a telephone number and the name yacoub diouri a few minutes later the servant came back and returned me to the front door well not quite the holy grail said juan but worthy of something moroccans love mystery said falcon abdullah diouri was a very devout muslim and yacoub later told me that the fes household was kept in that state in honour of the great man none of the sons could stand the place which was why it was so run down and it had been given over exclusively to the women of the family so you had an address in rabat said pablo i stayed the night in meknes and called yacoub from there he already knew who i was and what i wanted and we agreed to meet in his house in rabat the next day as you probably know he lives in a huge modern place built in the arab style in the embassy zone on the edge of the city there must be two hectares of land with an orange grove gardens tennis courts swimming poolsa small palace he has liveried servants rose petals in the fountainsthat kind of thing i was taken to a huge room overlooking one of the swimming pools with cream leather sofas all around i was given some mint tea and left to stew for half an hour until yacoub turned up did he look like raul id seen shots of raul when he was a younger man in tangier and less battered by life there were similarities but yacoub is a different animal altogether rauls wealth never managed to get rid of the andaluz peasant whereas yacoub is a very sophisticated individual wellread in spanish french and english he speaks german too his business demands it he makes clothes for all the major manufacturers in europe hes got dior and adolfo dominguez on his client list yacoub was a cheetah to rauls gnarled old lion so how did that first meeting go asked pablo we hit it off immediately which doesnt happen to me very often said falcon these days i seem to find it hard to get on with people of my own class and background while i seem to have a talent for engaging with misfits whys that asked juan i suppose living with my own horrors has given me the ability to understand the complexities of others or at least not to take things at face value said falcon whatever yacoub and i became friends in that first meeting and although we dont see very much of each other we still are in fact he called me last night to say he wanted to meet in madrid at the weekend did yacoub know your story hed read it in the press at the time of the francisco falcon scandal it was big news over there that the famous falcon nudes were actually painted by the moroccan artist tariq chefchaouni im surprised some journalist hadnt tried to track him down before said pablo they had said falcon but they didnt get any further than the outside of abdullah diouris house in fes you said yacoub was a misfit said gregorio he doesnt sound like one successful businessman married two children devout muslim he seems to fit in perfectly well thats how it looks from the outside but from the moment i first met him i knew he was restless said falcon he was happy with where he was and yet he felt he didnt belong there hed been torn away from his own family and yet abdullah diouri had made him a part of his and given him the family name his real father had never come to search for him and yet he was treated no differently to diouris own sons he told me once that he didnt just respect his kidnapper abdullah diouri he loved him as a father but despite this acceptance from his new family he never lost that terrible feeling of having been abandoned by his own thats what i call a misfit you say hes married said pablo how many wives does he have just the one isnt that unusual for a man such as yacoub diouri asked juan why dont you just ask your question to my face instead of wheedling because were interested in the extent of your relationship with yacoub if hes told you intimate details about himself then that has meaning for us said juan yacoub diouri is homosexual said falcon wearily his marriage is something that is expected of him by his society it is part of his duty as a good muslim to take a wife and have children but his sexual interest is exclusively with men and before you let your prurient interest get carried away i mean men not boys why do you think that detail should be important to us asked juan youre spies and i just wanted you to know that his homosexuality is not an area of vulnerability why are we questioning you about yacoub diouri asked juan first id like to know how yacoub came to tell you he was homosexual said pablo sorry to disappoint you pablo but he didnt make a pass at me said falcon how did you find out about him theres a lot of cooperation between the intelligence services these days said juan prominent devout and monied muslims areobserved yacoub and i were talking about marriage once and i told him that mine hadnt lasted very long that my wife had left me for a prominent judge said falcon i told him about consuelo he told me that his own marriage was just for show and that he was gay and that the fashion industry suited him why because it was full of attractive men who werent looking for a permanent relationship which he couldnt offer silence juan let it be known that it was time to move on so what happened after you became friends with yacoub asked pablo i saw him quite a lot at the beginning several times over three or four months id started learning arabic and went down to see my moroccan family in tangier whenever i could yacoub would invite me over we talked he helped me with my arabic the cni men drank their beers in unison and what happened with consuelo asked juan blowing smoke out into the night air as i explained id already told yacoub about consuelo and my interest in her he was quite happy to come to seville and try to help me out he liked the idea of being a gobetween how long was this after youd split up with consuelo nearly a year you took your time you cant rush these things how did you communicate asked pablo if she wouldnt speak to you i wrote her a letter and asked her if shed like to meet yacoub said falcon she wrote back and said she would very much like to meet him but it would have to be alone you never even got to see consuelo said juan amazed yacoub did his best for me they liked each other he asked her out to dinner on my behalf she refused he offered to play gooseberry she turned him down there were no explanations and that was the end of it said falcon why dont we have another beer and you tell me the purpose of this intrusive and personal examination in the kitchen falcon caught sight of his transparent reflection in the darkened window he hadnt revealed himself to that extent since being in the hands of alicia aguado more than four years ago in fact he hadnt been intimate with anyone other than yacoub since then it hadnt exactly been a relief to talk to strangers like that but it had brought back a powerful resurgence of his feelings for consuelo he even saw himself in the reflection of the window unconsciously rubbing the arm that had brushed against her yesterday he shook his head and opened another litre of beer youre smiling javier said juan as falcon came back after an ordeal like that im impressed im solitary but not depressed said falcon thats not bad going for a middleaged homicide detective said pablo being a homicide detective isnt such a problem for me there arent that many murders in seville and i crack most of them so my work with the homicide squad actually gives me the illusion that problems are being resolved and as you know an illusory state can contribute to sensations of wellbeing said falcon if i were trying to resolve something like global warming or the oceans dwindling fish stocks then id probably be in much worse mental shape what about global terrorism asked pablo how do you think youd cope with that thats not my job i investigate the murder of people by terrorists said falcon i realize that it can be complicated but at least we have a chance at resolution and tragedy brings out the best qualities in most people i wouldnt want your job which is to foresee and prevent terrorist attacks if you succeed you live as unsung heroes if you fail you live with the death of innocents the scourge of the media and the admonishment of comfortable politicians so no thanksif you were thinking of offering me a job not a job exactly said juan we want to know if youd be prepared to provide a connective piece or two for the intelligence jigsaw ive told you that im not really spy material any more in the first instance wed be asking you to recruit you want me to recruit yacoub diouri as an intelligence source asked falcon the cni men nodded gulped beer lit up cigarettes first of all i cant think what yacoub could possibly tell you and secondly why me said falcon surely youve got experienced recruiters who do this sort of thing all the time its not what he can tell us now its what he could tell us if he was to make a certain move said pablo and youre right we do have experienced people but none of them have the special relationship that you do but my special relationship is based on friendship intimacy and trust and what will happen to that if one day i say yacoub will you spy for spain well it wouldnt be just for spain said gregorio it would be for humanity as a whole oh would it really gregorio said falcon ill remember to tell him that when i ask him to deceive his family and friends and give information to someone hes only known for the last four years of his complicated life were not pretending its easy said juan and equally were not going to deny the value of such a contact or that there are moral implications in what were asking of you thank you thats put my mind at rest juan said falcon you said in the first instancedoes that mean theres a second one as well if so youd better tell me i might as well try to digest that with the first lump of gristle youve just thrown me the cni men looked at each other and shrugged weve just been told that theyre going to release the antiterrorism unit of the seville cgi into this investigation said juan we think theres a mole leaking information and we want to know who it is and who hes leaking it to youre going to have to work closely with them your insight would be invaluable i dont know what makes you think i can do this work youve just scored very high points in your interview said pablo what was my score on moral certitude the cni men laughed as one not that they found it funny it was just the relief at having got the ugliness over and done with do i get anything in return for all this asked falcon more money if thats what you want said juan puzzled i was thinking less in terms of euros and more along the lines of trust said falcon like what you tell me things said falcon im not saying yes or no you understand but perhaps you could tell me whats so important about this annotated copy of the koran that we found in the peugeot partner thats not going to be possible at this juncture said pablo were beginning to think that what weve found here in seville said juan overriding his junior officer is the edge of a much larger terrorist plan larger than the liberation of andalucia asked falcon were inclined to think that its a sign of something thats gone wrong in a plan that we know little about said juan what we think we have in our possession in the form of this copy of the koran is a terrorist networks codebook sevilletuesday th june hrs the restaurant was in the middle of the first service to the early tourists before the main rush of locals at pm consuelo left her office to keep her second appointment with alicia aguado she had been out only once to her sisters house for lunch they had talked exclusively about the bomb until the last minutes of the meal when consuelo had asked her if she could be at her home in santa clara at around pm her sister had assumed that there was a problem with the nanny no no shell be there looking after the boys said consuelo its just that ive been told i need someone whos close to me to be there when i get back are you going to the gynaecologist no the psychologist you her sister had said astonished yes ana your sister consuelo is going to see a shrink she said but youre the most sane person ive ever known said ana if youre nuts then what hope is there for the rest of us im not nuts shed said but i could be im on a knifeedge at the moment this woman im going to see will help me but she says i need support when i get home you are the support the effect on her sister was shocking not least because it had been an unsettling realization for both of them that perhaps they werent as close as theyd thought as she left the safety of her office consuelo felt something like panic forming in her stomach and as if on cue she remembered alicia aguados words come straight to me from your work dont be distracted it started up some confusion in her a voice asking why shouldnt i and as she fastened her seat belt her mind swerved away from its earlier objective and she thought about driving past the plaza del pumarejo wondering if he would be there her heart raced and she hit the horn so hard and long that one of the waiters came running out into the street she pulled away and drove straight through the plaza del pumarejo eyes fixed ahead fifteen minutes later she was in the lovers seat in the cool blue room her wrist exposed waiting for alicia aguados inquisitive fingers they talked about the bomb first consuelo couldnt concentrate she was busy trying to hold her fragmentary self together talk of the shattering effects of the bomb was not helping you were a little late said alicia placing her fingers on the pulse did you come straight here i was delayed at work i came as soon as i could get away no distractions none try answering that question again consuelo she stared at her wrist was her heartbeat so transparent she swallowed hard why should this be so difficult shed had no problem all day her eyes filled a tear slipped to the corner of her mouth why are you crying consuelo arent you going to tell me no said aguado its the other way round im just the guide i fought a momentary distraction said consuelo were you reluctant to tell me because it was of a sexual nature yes im ashamed of it of what exactly no reply think about that before our next meeting and decide whether its true said aguado tell me about the distraction consuelo related the incident of the previous night which had finally precipitated her call for help you dont know this man no have you seen him before had some kind of casual contact hes one of those types that walks past women and mutters obscenities she said i dont tolerate that sort of behaviour and i make a scene whenever it happens i want to discourage them from doing it to other women do you see that as a moral duty i do women should not be subjected to this random sexism these men should not be encouraged to indulge in their gross fantasies it has nothing to do with sex its purely a power thing an abuse of power these men hate women they want to verbalize their hate it gives them pleasure to shock and humiliate if there were women foolish enough to get involved with men like that they would be physically abused by them they are wifebeaters in the making so why are you fascinated by this man asked aguado tears again which were combined with a strange sense of collapse of things falling into each other and just as the gravitational pull of all this inner crumpling seemed to be achieving a terminal velocity she felt herself untethered floating away from the person she thought herself to be it seemed to be an extreme form of a phenomenon she referred to as an existential lurch a sudden reflective moment in which the question of what we are doing here on this planet spinning in the void seemed unanswerably huge normally it was over in a flash and she was back in the world but this time it went on and she didnt know whether she was going to be able to get back she leapt to her feet and held herself together in case she came apart its all right said alicia reaching out to her its all right consuelo youre still here come and sit beside me again the chair the socalled lovers chair seemed more like a torturers seat a place where instruments would be inserted to reach unbearably painful clusters of nerves and tweak them to previously unexperienced levels of agony i cant do this she heard herself saying i cant do it she fell into alicia aguados arms she needed the human touch to bring her back she cried and the worst of it was that she had no idea what her suffering was about alicia got her back into the chair they sat fingers intertwined as if they were now indeed lovers i was falling apart said consuelo i lost sighti lost my sense of who i was i felt like an astronaut floating away from the mother ship i was on the brink of madness and what precipitated that sensation your question i dont remember what it was were you asking about a friend or my father perhaps maybe weve talked enough about whats troubling you said aguado lets try to end this on a positive note tell me something that makes you happy my children make me happy if you remember our last consultation was terminated by a discussion about how your children made you feel you said i love them so much it hurts finished consuelo lets think about a state of happiness thats free from pain i dont feel pain all the time its only when i see them sleeping and how often do you watch them sleeping consuelo realized that it had become a nightly ritual watching the boys in their careless sleep was the high point of every day that pain right in her middle had become something she relished all right said consuelo carefully lets try to remember a moment of painfree happiness that shouldnt be too difficult should it alicia i mean here we are in the most beautiful city in spain didnt somebody say to whom god loves he gives a house in seville gods love must come with half a million euros these days let me seedo you ask all your patients this question not all of them how many have been able to give you an answer asked consuelo i imagine psychologists meet a lot of unhappy people theres always something people who love the country might think of the way the sunlight plays on water or the wind in the grasses city people might think of a painting theyve seen or a ballet or just sitting in their favourite square i dont go to the country i used to like art but i lost others remember a friendship or an old flame their hands had come apart and aguados fingers were back on consuelos wrist what are you thinking about now for instance she asked its nothing said consuelo its not nothing said aguado whatever it ishold on to it ines had been sitting in the apartment for over an hour it was some time after pm she had tried to call esteban but as usual his mobile was turned off she was quite calm although inside her head there seemed to be a wire pulled taut to vibrating point she had been to see her doctor but had left just before she was due to be called the doctor would want to examine her and she didnt want to be looked at pried into the incident in the park with the mulatto bitchwhore kept intruding on her internal movie forcing the film out of the gate and jamming her head with other images the lividness of estebans face as it appeared under the bed and the twitching of his bare feet on the cold kitchen floor the kitchen was not a place for her to be the hard edges of its granite work surfaces the chill of the marble floor the distorting mirrors of all the chrome were reminders of the mornings brutality she hated that fascist kitchen it made her think of the guardia civil in jackboots and their hard black shiny hats she couldnt see a child in that kitchen she sat in the bedroom feeling tiny on the huge and empty marital bed the tv was off there was too much talk about the bomb too many images of the site too much blood gore and shattered glass and lives she looked at herself in the mirror over the ordered hairbrushes and cufflink collections a question danced in her brain what the fuck has happened to me by pm she couldnt bear it any longer and went outside she thought she was walking aimlessly but found herself drawn to the young people already beginning to gather in the warm night under the massive trees of the plaza del museo then unaccountably she was in calle bailen and standing in front of her exhusbands house the sight of it brought up a spike of envy she could have had this house or at least half of it if it hadnt been for that bitch of a lawyer javier had hired it was she whod found out that ines had been fucking esteban calderon for months and had asked to her face if shed wanted all that tawdry stuff dragged through the courts and look at her now what a great move shed made married to an abuser of women who when he wasnt sodomizing his wife for purposes of contraception was off with every unpaid whore who waggled her titswhere had all this terrible language come from ines conde de tejada didnt use this sort of language why was her mind suddenly so full of filth but here she was outside javiers house her slim legs in her short skirt trembled she carried on past the doors to the hotel colon and turned back she had to see javier she had to tell him not that shed been beaten not that she was sorry for what she had done no she didnt want to tell him anything she just wanted to be near a man who had loved her who had adored her as she hid in the darkness of the orange trees and prepared herself the door opened and three men came out they went to pick up a taxi outside the hotel colon the door closed ines rang the bell falcon reopened the door and was stunned to see the oddly diminished figure of his exwife hola ines are you all right hola javier they kissed he made way for her they walked to the patio with falcon thinking she looks as small and thin as a child he cleared away the remnants of the cni party and returned with a bottle of manzanilla i should have thought after a day like today youd be exhausted she said and yet here you are having people round for drinks its been a long day said falcon thinking what is this all about hows esteban holding up i havent seen him hes probably still at the site theyre working a roster system through the night said falcon are you all right ines youve asked me that already javier dont i look all right youre not worried about anything are you do i look worried no just a little thin have you lost weight i keep myself in shape it always bewildered falcon who was already running out of things to say to ines how he could ever have been obsessed by her she struck him now as completely banal an expert in chitchat a beautiful presenter of received opinion a snob and a bore and yet before they married theyd had a passionate affair with wild sexual encounters the bronze boy in the fountain had fled from their excesses her heels clicked on the marble flags of the patio he had wanted to get rid of her as soon as hed seen her but there was something about her pitiful frailness her lack of sevillana hauteur that made it hard for him to brush her off into the night hows things he said trying to nod something more interesting into his head which was almost completely taken up with the decision he had to make within the next eight hours hows life with esteban you see more of him than i do she said we havent worked together for a while and you know hes always been ambitious so yes hes always been ambitious she said to fuck every woman that passes under his nose falcons glass of manzanilla stopped on its way to his mouth before continuing he took a good inch off the top i wouldnt know he said avoiding a conversational line that had been common knowledge in the police and judiciary for years dont be so fucking ridiculous javier she said the whole of fucking seville knows hes been dipping his cock in every pussy that comes his way silence falcon wondered if hed ever heard ines use this sort of language before it was as if some fishwife inside her was kicking down the barriers i came across one of his whores today in the murillo gardens she said i recognized her from a shot hed taken of her with his digital camera and she was sitting in front of me on a park bench smoking a cigar as if she was still thinking about sucking his come on ines said falcon im not the person you should be talking to about this why not she said you know me weve been intimate you know him you know what hesthat hes athat i she broke down falcon took the glass out of her hand found some tissues she blew her nose and thumped the tabletop with her fist and tried to dig her heel into the floor of the patio which made her wince she took a walk around the fountain and felt a sudden stabbing pain in her side and had to hold on to herself are you all right ines stop asking me that question she said its nothing just some kidneystone trouble the doctor says i dont drink enough water he fetched her a glass of water and thought about how he was going to manage this situation with mark flowers due any minute his brain stalled on the ludicrous fact that she had come to see him to talk about her husbands incorrigible womanizing what did that mean i wanted to talk to you she said because i have no one else i can talk to my friends arent capable of this level of intimacy im sure some of them have become his conquests my suffering would just be gossip to them nothing more i know you went through a very bad time a few years ago and that has given you the capacity to understand what im going through now im not sure my experiences are comparable said falcon frowning at her selfabsorbed talk the situation expanding out of his control by the moment i know that when we split up you were still in love with me she said i felt very sorry for you he knew shed felt nothing of the sort shed projected all her guilt on to him and taunted him with that horrific mantra about his heartlessness tu no tienes corazon javier falcon are you thinking of leaving esteban he asked carefully panicked by the notion that she might be thinking that he would have her back no no no que no she said it hasnt come to that were made for each other weve been through so much id never leave him he needs me its just its just that there arent enough cliches for the cheated wife to draw on thought falcon its just thathe needs help said ines what was happening today the cni wanted him to persuade his new friend to become a spy his exwife wanted him to encourage her husband with whom hed only ever had a professional relationship to go and see a shrink what do you think javier i think its none of my business he said firmly i still want to know what you think she said her eyes huge in her head youll never persuade estebanor any man for that matterto go to a shrink or a marriageguidance counsellor unless he himself perceives that there is a problem said falcon and most men in these situations rarely see that the problem is theirs hes been whoring around in this marriage sincesince before we got married she said he must see that he needs to change the only thing that will change him is a major trauma in his life which might make him reflect on hisinsatiable needs said falcon unfortunately it might also mean that those close to him now will not remain so i stuck with him through his last crisis with the american bitch and ill stick with him through this she said i know he loves me that was my experience said falcon holding out his hands and realizing that hed just told ines why she wasnt a part of his life any more my problem didnt happen to be womanizing though no it wasnt was it you were so cold javier she said that tone of false concern set his teeth on edge but the doorbell rang saving him from having to dig deeper into his reserves of patience he walked her to the door youre popular tonight said ines i dont know what people see in me said falcon braking hard on the irony we dont see so much of each other these days she said kissing him before he opened the door im sorryif we dont see each other again again said falcon and the doorbell rang once more im sorry she said at pm calderon had arrived at marisas apartment twenty minutes later they lay naked and sexsmeared on the floor by the sofa they were drinking cuba libres chock full of ice and smoking their way through a packet of marlboro lights she straddled him and brushed her hardened nipples against his lips while lowering her pubis until it just tickled the tip of his exhausted penis he filled his hands with her buttocks and bit her nipple a little too hard ai she yelped pushing away from him havent you eaten there hasnt been much time for eating he said why dont i make you some pasta she said standing over him still in her heels legs astride hands on hips cigarette dangling from her plump lips im helmut newton thought calderon sounds good he said she put on a turquoise silk robe and went into the kitchen calderon sipped his drink smoked looked out into the dense warm night and thought this is all right something strange happened to me today said marisa from the kitchen knife working over some onion and garlic i sold a couple of my pieces to one of my dealers he pays cash and i like to treat myself to a nice cigara real one made in havana i sit under the palm trees in the murillo gardens to smoke it because it reminds me of home and it was really hot today the first heat of the summer and id just got myself into a really cool cuban mood marisa could tell from the back of calderons head that he was barely listening to her when this woman sat down in front of me a beautiful woman very slim long dark hair beautiful big eyesmaybe a little too thin now that i think about it her eyes were so big and she was staring at me in this very strange way she had his attention now his head was as still as rock i like to smoke my cigars in peace i dont like mad people looking at me so i asked her what she was staring at she told me she was looking at the whore with the cigarla puta con el puro well nobody calls me a whore and nobody ruins a topquality havana cigar so i gave her a piece of my mindand you know what calderon took a viciously long drag of his cigarette you know what she said to me what said calderon as if a long way off she said youre the whore whos fucking my husband she asked me how much you were paying me and said that it didnt look as if it was more than a night and that youd probably thrown in the copper wig and the cigar to keep me happy can you tell me how the fuck ines knows who i am calderon stood up he was so angry he couldnt speak his lips were pale and his genitals were shrivelled back into their pubic nest as if his rage had taken all available blood to keep it stoked he was clenching and unclenching his fist and staring off into the night with bonesnapping violence ricocheting around his head marisa had seen this trait in physically unimpressive men before the big muscly guys had nothing to prove whereas the fat the puny and the stupid had big lessons to hand out when she heard the shower running marisa stopped preparing the food calderon dressed in ominous silence she asked him what he was doing why he was leaving he whipped his tie up into a tight choleric knot nobody talks to you like that he said and left ines stopped to look in a handpainted tile shop on calle bailen she felt better after seeing javier shed persuaded herself in the short walk after their brief encounter that javier still cared for her how sweet of him to ask her if she was thinking of leaving esteban he still lived in hope after all these years it was sad to have to disappoint him the darkness under the huge trees of the plaza del museo held the murmur of more young people the chinking of beer bottles and the reek of marijuana she walked through them feeling more cheerful the light was on in the apartment which elated her esteban was home he had come back to her they were going to repair the damage she was sure after what had happened this morning that he would see reason and she could persuade him to make an appointment with a psychologist the stairs no longer inspired dread and although the pain in her side meant that she didnt exactly sprint up them she reached the door with a lightness of heart her hair swung on her shoulders as she closed the door she instantly felt his looming presence a smile was already spreading on her face when he sheafed her hair and turned it once around his wrist she toppled backwards falling to her knees and he brought her face up close to the pallor of the pure hatred in his own sevilletuesday th june hrs mark flowers had already eaten his american digestive system had never got used to the spanish custom of not even thinking about dinner until pm he turned down falcons offers of beer and manzanilla and opted for a single malt whisky falcon wolfed down a quickly made sandwich in the kitchen and stuck with the manzanilla it was still very warm and they sat out under the open sky of the patio so what did your own people want to talk to you about asked flowers always a man to get his questions in first theyre trying to persuade me to go into the recruitment business for them and will you do it ive got until am to decide well it was nice of them to wait until you had nothing on your plate said flowers who was always determined to show him that not all americans had undergone an irony bypass i dont know who they want you to recruit but if hes a friend he might not stay a friend thats the way these things work in my experience whys that people react strangely to being asked to become a spy it calls into question your prior relationship did he become my friend just to recruit me it also implies moral duplicity you as the recruiter have a singular purpose which requires asking someone to lie and deceive on your behalf its an odd relationship got any advice its like going out on a date its all in the timing you move in too early and the girl will accuse you of being too fresh you come on too late and you might have bored her shown her your uncertainty its a delicate process and like dating you only get better at it by doing ita lot youve just filled me with confidence mark i havent been out on a date for more than a year some people say its like riding a bicycle said flowers but theres a big difference between an eighteenyearold taking up cycling and a middleaged man going back to it i wish youd change your whisky javier this stuff is like drinking peat bog maybe youd like some coca cola to go with it said falcon flowers chuckled do your people know whether your moroccan friend is safe he asked did i say that i was recruiting a friend and that he was moroccan asked falcon another chuckle from flowers followed by a big snort of whisky you didnt say but given our present circumstances it was a safe bet they seem to have researched him pretty well said falcon giving up quickly on the game thats not how you find out if someone is safe said flowers research is like trying to learn how to succeed in business by reading a selfhelp book i know hes safe well youre a homicide cop so you should know when someone is lying to you said flowers what sort of conversations have you had about terrorism iraq the palestinian question that have led you to believe that your friend is safe none in which the outcome of the conversation has been crucial if thats what you mean i can find thousands of muslims in the tea houses of north africa who would condemn the actions of these extremist groups and their indiscriminate violence but i would struggle to find one who would give me information that might lead to the capture and possible death of a jihadi said flowers its one of the strange contradictions of this kind of spying it takes a profound moral certitude to behave immorally so how do you know hes safe im not sure what i can tell you that would help you believe without sounding foolish said falcon try me we recognized something in each other from the first moment we met what does that mean weve had comparable experiences which have given us a level of automatic understanding still not sure said flowers closing an eye over his raised glass what happens when two people fall in love take it easy javier how do two people sort out all that necessarily complicated communication that lets them know that they will be going to bed together that night you know the problem with that lovers cheat on each other all the time what youre saying mark is that we can never know we can only be as certain as possible the love analogy is right said flowers youve just got to be sure that he doesnt love someone more than you thanks who are we talking about by the way you took your time had i known you were going to be so coy id have taken you out to dinner this isnt my business its cni business do you think youll be able to get out of casablanca airport without my guys spotting you asked flowers im surprised you havent had me followed before silence flowers smiled you knew all along said falcon throwing up his hands why do you play these games with me to remind you that in my world youre an amateur said flowers what are you hoping to get out of yacoub diouri i dont know im not even sure whether im going to accept the task and if i do whether my superiors will allow me to do it what about the investigation here theres a lot still to be done but at least we know what went on inside and outside the mosque in the days leading up to the explosion was that why you wanted me to research iit theyre in the backgroundquite a long way in the background said falcon who filled him in on horizonte and informaticalidad iit are not in fact based in indianapolis said flowers the company headquarters is in columbus ohio due to its proximity to westerville ohio which was where the us temperance movement started and from where national prohibition took off back in the s youre making this sound significant the corporation is owned and actively run by two bornagain christians who discovered their faith through the excesses of their youth said flowers cortland fallenbach was a computer programmer who used to work for microsoft until they let him go due to problems with alcohol and other substances morgan havilland was a salesman for ibm until his sex addiction got out of control and he had to be removed before the company ended up in court on the end of a sexual harassment suit did these guys meet in therapy in indianapolis said flowers and having both worked for the most powerful it corporations in the world they decided to set up a group to invest in hitech companies fallenbach was a software king and havilland understood hardware at first they just invested and took profit from their inside knowledge of the industry later they started buying companies outright merging their strengths and either selling them or setting them up in groups of their own but there was and is one important stipulation if you want to be a part of iit you have to believe in god asked falcon you have to believe in the right god said flowers you have to be a christian that doesnt mean they dont buy companies owned by hindus muslims buddhists or shintoistsif thats what theyre calledit just means that they dont become a part of iit they either strip out what they want and if theyre still valuable they sell them on if theyre not they let them rot into the ground ruthless christians said falcon crusaders might be a good word said flowers very successful crusaders iit has worldwide assets in excess of billion they showed a profit in the first quarter of this year of million what about politics fallenbach and havilland are members of the christian right and therefore deeply republican their ethos though is based on religion as long as you practise the same religion they believe you can understand each other if one is a muslim and the other a christian there will always be fundamental differences which will prevent perfect communication atheists are off the page which means communists are unacceptable agnostics can still be saved is this the level of discussion in board meetings before a takeover sure they take company culture very seriously and religion is the foundation of that culture said flowers where they can get away with it they dont employ women in the workplace otherwise they keep to the bare legal minimum they dont employ homosexuals god hates fagsremember javier i dont remember that line from the bible their success and profitability is a manifestation of their righteousness how active are they outside their own corporation as far as we know its limited to not doing business with people whose principles they dont agree with so they produce a lot of ultrasound equipment for instance and they wont sell to clinics known to perform abortions said flowers as far as any active antireligious movement goes we havent heard of anything do you think informaticalidad using this apartment for brainstorming sessions is weird if you ask me whats weird its companies and governments spending billions of dollars and euros a year on management consultancies who come in and give them the kind of common sense that my grandmother could have told them for free said flowers informaticalidad sound like a company who havent bought into the bullshit industry and have come up with a cheaper and probably more productive solution which leaves them with an asset at the end of it all if you can place any of those informaticalidad brainstormers in the mosque now thats a different story not so far said falcon another thing have you got any information on an organization called vomit vomityes ive seen their website we thought it stood for victims of muslim and islamic terror until one of our operators saw the spanish they can only be accused of not presenting the full picture but thats just a matter of imbalance its not criminal theres no incitement to take revenge no bombmaking advice weapons training or active recruitment to a cause if its just a few geeks with some phones and a computer thats one thing said falcon if its a multibilliondollar corporation with worldwide resources wouldnt that be different first of all i dont see that connection second thered have to be more of a perceived threat to get us to do any digging on vomit said flowers and anyway javier why are you sniffing around the wacky fringes of this attack instead of getting stuck into the guts of it i mean vomit iit the guts of the problem are under a few thousand tons of rubble at the moment said falcon informaticalidad was an unignorable part of the scenario outside the mosque vomit were introduced into the frame by the cni we have some suspicious occurrences in the mosque which have not been adequately explained like what falcon told him about the council inspectors the blown fuse box and the electricians i know what youre thinking said flowers no you dont because i havent decided on a scenario yet myself im keeping an open mind said falcon we know that two terror suspectsdjamel hammad and smail saoudimade deliveries to the mosque which could be innocent or could have been bombmaking material a deposit of hexogenor cyclonite as you call itwas found in the back of their van fucking hell javier said flowers sitting up and you dont call that damning evidence it looks bad said falcon but were not talking about looks here weve got to get beyond appearances is there any more of this whisky im getting the taste for this liquidcharcoal stuff falcon topped him up and gave himself another jolt of manzanilla he sat back feeling as he always did in his conversations with flowersstupid and flayed you know mark you still havent told me anything i couldnt have found out for myself inside half an hour on the internet whereas ive told youeverything i know you like to keep your account with me in the black but id appreciate some real help said falcon why dont you tell me something about the mila or imam abdelkrim benaboura theres a good reason why you dont get as much information from me as i do from you said flowers who let those names flash past him without a flicker im running a station that covers southern spain and its relations with morocco algeria and tunisia i have no idea what is going on in madrid northern spain or southern france i only see a small corner of the whole picture london paris rome and berlin make their contributions but i dont see any of it like you im just a contributor youre making yourself sound very passive im getting information from all sorts of different sources but i have to be very careful how i use it said flowers spying is a game but i never forget that its being played with real people who can get killed so you only get information that doesnt endanger you or any of my other sources if im in any doubt you wont be given it be glad that im not a risktaking station head thanks for that mark now why dont you tell me about los martires islamicos para la liberacion de andalucia i first heard about them at the end of last year as el movimiento rather than los martires my source in algiers told me that they were a disaffected faction of the algerian gia the armed islamic group who had crossed the border into morocco and teamed up with a local group whose goal at the time was the liberation of the spanish enclaves in morocco ceuta and melilla the algerians brought with them a network with operatives already installed in madrid granada malaga and valencia but not seville im coming to that said flowers my source told me that what the moroccans could supply was finance they were cash rich from their connections in the hashish trade in the rif mountains what they didnt have was a network and a strategy both ceuta and melilla are small enclaves well protected and well supplied by the spanish mainland the algerians saw the money and told them to think big liberate andalucia cut off the spanish supply line to ceuta and melilla and this western corner of the islamic kingdom is whole once again youd need an army and a navy to take andalucia and theres the british in gibraltar who might have an opinion on the matter too said flowers but that is not the point the liberation of andalucia is an inspiring ideal that fills the hearts of islamic fanatics with a warm allahinfused glow it is the dream that will draw followers to the cause my source also read the algerians intentions wrong they didnt want access to the hashish trade because of finance they wanted to tap into their smuggling routes to get people and material across to spain has that been happening nobodys been caught said flowers smuggling routes generally exist because theyre allowed to theres a constant stream of hashish from morocco and cocaine from south america coming into the long unpatrollable iberian coastline and theres plenty of money to keep the authorities happy and quiet this talk made falcons sweat run cold the money organization and corruption were all in place to make a devastating campaign on andalucia seem likely rather than crazy what about seville and the mila asked falcon some afghans arrived in morocco in january where in morocco how do your sources get such information why arent we getting it theres no base theres no town hall with posters outside advertising mila meeting tonight i have one source at the wrong level who is able to give me bits and pieces you dont just walk into these groups off the street you have to be vouched for its all to do with family and tribal ties i believe my sources information but im wary of sharing it because hes peripheral to the groups leading council which means it could be invention you see javier being given information doesnt necessarily make the picture any clearer tell me about the afghan connection some afghans arrived offering the group a seville connection they said he was capable of giving recce and logistical support but did not have the capacity to carry out an attack name he couldnt give me one one of the worshippers in the mosque here told me that there had been a visit from a group of afghans and that the imam had spoken to them in pashto id be careful about putting those two pieces of information together without more corroboration said flowers whats the news on abdelkrim benaboura asked falcon he doesnt seem to be high risk and yet theres a clearance problem with his history what does that mean that they dont know who he is from a certain date which is normally around the end of and the beginning of when the us went into afghanistan and the taliban regime broke up and dispersed you have to remember until the us and european intelligence network in the islamic world was negligible we sorted out who was who on our own turf in the years that followed but there were and still are very large gapsas youd expect from an introverted religion that stretches from indonesia to morocco and northern europe to south africa factor in the difficulties of identification given the clothes these people wear the headgear and facial hair and histories are not so easily matched to people you still havent told me anything about abdelkrim benaboura why do the cni think its so important for you to recruit yacoub now right at the moment when youre supposed to be heading the biggest murder enquiry of your career the cni think they might have discovered something even bigger like what they werent prepared to say what have they got thats made them think that you dont miss much mark do you said falcon but flowers didnt answer he was deep in distracted thought until he looked at his watch knocked back his whisky and said he had to go falcon walked him to the door have you tried to recruit yacoub diouri yourself asked falcon something worth remembering said flowers he doesnt like americans now who was that beautiful woman who left just as i arrived my exwife ive got two exwives said flowers its funny how exwives are always more beautiful than wives think about that javier thats all you do mark leave me with more to think about than when you arrived ill give you something else to roll around your brain said flowers the cni planted the story about the mila in the press how about that why would they do that welcome to my wonderful world javier said flowers walking off into the night he stopped at the end of the short avenue of orange trees and turned back to javier who was silhouetted in the doorway one last piece of advice said flowers dont try to understand the whole picturetheres nobody in the world who does sevillewednesday th june hrs manuela lay in bed alone trying to ignore the faint click of angels fingers on the keys of his laptop in another room she blinked in the dark holding back the full contemplation of something very horrible the sale of her villa in el puerto de santa maria an hours drive south from seville on the coast the villa had been left to her by her father and every room was packed with adolescent nostalgia the fact that francisco falcon didnt much like the place and loathed all the neighbours the socalled seville high society had been erased from manuelas memory she imagined her fathers spirit writhing in agony at the proposed sale it was however the only way that she could see of repairing her financial situation the banks had already called her before close of business asking where the funds were that shed told them to expect it was the only solution that had come to her in the death and debt hour of four oclock in the morning the estate agent had told her the obvious the seville property market would be stalled until further notice she had four possible buyers for her villa who were constantly reminding her of their readiness to purchase but could she let it go angel had been calling her all day trying to restrain the excitement in his voice his conversation was full of the ramifications of riveros retirement and the great new hope of fuerza andalucia jesus alarcon who hed been steering around all day after interviewing him for the profile in the abc angels media manipulation had been brilliant hed kept jesus off camera when he visited the hospital and got him to talk privately to the victims and their families his greatest coup had been to get him through to fernando alanis in the intensive care unit jesus and fernando had talked no cameras no reporters and theyd hit it off it couldnt have been better later when the mayor and a camera crew got through to intensive care fernando had mentioned jesus alarcon on camera as the only politician who hadnt sought to make any media capital out of the victims misery it was pure luck but a total masterstroke for angels campaign the mayor had just managed to squeeze back the nervous smile that wanted to creep across his face consuelo couldnt stop herself why should she she couldnt sleep what better way to remember carefree sleep than to watch the experts the calm faces of the innocents eyelids trembling softly breathing deep and dreamless in their beds ricardo was first the fourteenyearold whod reached the gawky age where his face was stretching in odd directions trying to find its adult mould this wasnt such a peaceful age with too many hormones shooting around the body and sexual yearning fighting with football in his mind matias was twelve and seemed to be growing up quicker than his elder brother easier to walk in somebody elses footsteps than to tread out ones own as ricardo had done with no father to guide him consuelo knew where this was heading though ricardo and matias took care of themselves it was dario her youngest at eight years old who drew her in she loved his face his blond hair his ambercoloured eyes his perfect little mouth it was in his room that she sat down in the middle of the floor half a metre from his bed looking into his untroubled features and easing herself into the uneasy state she craved it started in her mouth with the lips that had kissed his baby head she drank it down her throat and felt the twinge in her breasts it settled in her stomach high up around the diaphragm an ache that transmitted its pain from her viscera to the tingling surface of her skin she scoffed at alicia aguados questioning what was wrong with such a love as this fernando alanis sat in the intensive care unit of the hospital de la macarena he watched his daughters vital signs on the monitors grey numbers and green lines that told him good things that she was capable of lighting up a machine if not her father his mind crashed and fell about like a hopeless drunk in a binfilled narrow alleyway one moment it was gasping at the catastrophic destruction of the apartment building the next it was buckling at the sight of four covered bodies outside the preschool he still couldnt quite believe what he had lost was this a mechanism of the mind that suspended things too unbearable to comprehend almost to the point of a barely remembered nig htmare hed been told by people whod survived bad falls from scaffolding that the rush of the ground coming to meet you was not so terrifying the horror was in the eventual awakening and with that he would lurch sickeningly forward to the bruised and battered face of his daughter her oval mouth slack against the clear plastic concertina of tube everything inside him felt too big his organs were jostled by the colossal inflation of hate and despair which had no direction other than to make themselves as uncomfortable as possible he went back to a time when his family and the building had been intact but the thought of the third child hed been proposing made him break down inside he couldnt bear to take himself back to a state that would never exist again he couldnt bear the notion of never seeing gloria and pedro again he couldnt stomach the finality of that word never he concentrated on his daughters beating heart the jumping line bedum bedum bedum the thready skip of the green fuse against the terminal blackness of the monitor made him rear back in his seat it was all too fragile anything could happen in this life and didand had perhaps the answer was to retreat into emptiness feel nothing but that held its terror too the monstrous negativity of the black hole in space sucking in all light he breathed in the air expanded his chest he breathed out his stomach wall relaxed this for the time being was the only way to proceed ines lay where she had fallen she hadnt moved since hed left her body was a miasma of pain from the pummelling it had sustained from his hard white knuckles nausea humped in her stomach hed punched her through her flailing hands one of her fingers had been bent back in an escalation of his fury hed torn off his belt and lashed her with the buckle digging into her buttocks and thighs with each stroke hed told her through clenched teeth neverspeakto my girlfriendlike thatever again do you hear me neveragain shed rolled to the corner of the room to get away from him hed stood over her breathing heavily not so different from when he was sexually aroused their eyes met he pointed his finger at her as if he might shoot her she didnt pick up what he said shed taken in the purity of his hatred from his blank basilisk eyes the colourless lips and his red swollen neck no sooner had he left the apartment than she started to rebuild her illusion his anger was understandable the whore had told him some nonsense and set him against her that was the way these things worked he was just fucking the whore but she wanted more now she wanted to be in the wifes shoes on the wifes side of the bed but she was just the whore so she had to play her little games ines hated the whore a line came into her head from an old conversation with javier most people are killed by people they know because it is only they who are capable of arousing the passionate emotions that can lead to uncontrollable violence ines knew esteban my god did she know esteban calderon shed seen him gilded with the laurel wreath and cringing like the village cur that was why she could arouse such emotions in him only she that old cliche holds true love and hate have the same source he would love her again once that black bitch stopped meddling with his mind she raised herself on to all fours the pain made her gasp blood dripped from her mouth she must have bitten her tongue she crawled up the bed to stand on her feet she unzipped her dress and let it fall unhooking her bra was a torture bending to slip off her panties nearly made her faint she stood in front of the mirror a massive bruise spread across her torso where hed hit her that morning her chest ached through to her spine a crisscross of weals covered her buttocks and upper thighs broken by punctured skin where the buckle had dug in she put a finger to one of these marks and pressed the pain was exquisite esteban in that passionate moment really had given her his fullest attention javier lay in the dark with images from the late news still present in his mind the demolished building under the surgical glare of the floodlights the smashed plateglass windows of a number of shops with moroccan wares for sale the fire brigade spraying a flaming apartment which had been firebombed by kids on the rampage a cut bruised and swollenfaced moroccan boy whod been set upon by neonazi thugs with clubs and chains a butchers selling halal meat with a car rammed through the metal blinds of the store front falcon shunted all the images out of his mind until all that was left was the ultimate remnant of terrordeep uncertainty he cast his mind back to before the bombing looking for a clue amongst all those extraordinary emotions that might help him make sense of what was happening his mind played tricks uncertainty had that effect human beings always believe that an event has been prefigured in some way its the necessary part of rediscovering the pattern mankind cannot bear too much chaos he had the illusion of the impenetrable darkness receding from him like the endlessly expanding universe this was the new certainty the one that sent all the old narratives with which we structured our lives down into the black hole of human understanding we have to be even stronger now that science has told us that time is unreliable and even light behaves differently if you turn your back it was a terrible irony that just as science was pushing back the limits of our comprehension religion the greatest and oldest of human narratives was fighting back was it because of resentment at being found on the discard pile of modern european life that religion was making a stand falcon closed his eyes and concentrated on relaxing each part of his body until finally he drifted away from the unanswerable questions and into a deep sleep he was a man who had made up his mind and had a car arriving early to take him to the airport the car a black mercedes with tinted windows turned up at am with pablo sitting in the back in a dark suit with an openneck shirt how did your talk with yacoub go last night asked pablo as the car pulled away given that a bomb went off in seville yesterday he knows im not coming over on a social visit what did he say he was pleased that we were going to see each other but he knows theres an ulterior motive hes going to be a natural at this business im not sure hell take that as a compliment because of your investigation this is timecritical so weve arranged a private jet to take us down there the flight to casablanca will be less than an hour and a half as long as we get good airtraffic clearance youve got diplomatic status so well get through any formalities quickly and youll be on the road to rabat within two hours of takeoff said pablo i presume youre meeting yacoub in his home im a friend not a business associate said falcon although that might change after this meeting im sure mark flowers gave you some good tips how long have you known about markand me asked falcon smiling since you first outwitted him back in july and he made you one of his sources said pablo were not worried about mark hes a friend after the americans said they were going to put someone in andalucia and we asked for mark juan has known him since they were in tunis together keeping an eye on gaddafi did mark give you any ideas on how to approach yacoub diouri im pretty sure he tried to recruit him and was rebuffed said falcon he said that yacoub didnt like americans that should make your task easier if hes used to being approached i dont think yacoub diouri is someone you approach hes the sort of guy who would see you coming a long way off if you did well just talk as we always do about everything it will come out in the way it does im not going to use any strategies on him like a lot of arabs he has a powerful belief in honour which h e learnt from the man who became his father he is someone to whom you show respect and not just as a gesture said falcon perhaps you should tell me the sort of thing you want him to do how you want him to operate what contacts youre expecting him to make are you hoping to get information about the mila from him mila has mark been talking to you about the mila youre all the same you intelligence people said falcon you cant take a question you have to answer it with another do you exchange any information the mila has nothing to do with what we want from yacoub the tve news said they were responsible for the bomb said falcon a text was posted from seville to the madrid office of the abc about andalucia being brought back into the muslim fold the mila are only interested in money said pablo theyve dressed their intentions up in jihadist rhetoric but the reason they want to liberate ceuta and melilla is that they want the enclaves for themselves tell me what were trying to achieve said falcon for the purposes of this mission what is crucial is not who destroyed that apartment building in seville and why but rather what the explosion has revealed to us said pablo forget the mila theyre not important this is not about your investigation into yesterdays bomb this is not about the past but the future ok tell me said falcon thinking that flowers may have been right about the cni planting the mila story last year the british held their parliamentary elections they didnt need the example of the madrid bombings to know that these elections were going to be the target of a number of attempts by terrorists to change the way a population thinks and nothing happened said falcon tony blair the little satan got in with a reduced majority exactly and nobody knew that there were three separate cells with active plans who were prevented from carrying out their attacks by mi said pablo all those cells were sleepers dormant until they received their instructions in january every member of the cell was either a secondor thirdgeneration immigrant originally from pakistan afghanistan or morocco but now british they spoke perfect english with regional accents they all had clean police records they all had jobs and came from decent backgrounds in other words they were impossible to find in a country with millions of people of the same ethnicity but they were found and their attacks were prevented because mi had a codebook to help them when they were searching some suspects properties after a series of arrests made in and early they came across identical editions of a text called the book of proof by a ninthcentury arab writer called aljahiz both editions had notesall in english because the accused didnt have a word of arabic between them some of the notes in each copy were remarkably similar mi photocopied the books replaced the originals released the accused and set their codebreakers to work and when did they share that information with the cni october so what happened with the london bombings of th and st july the british think they stopped using the book of proof after the may elections and now you think youve discovered a new codebook said falcon what about the new copy of the koran found on the front seat of the peugeot partner we think they were going to prepare another codebook to give to someone the imam abdelkrim benaboura we havent finished searching his apartment said pablo shrugging thats taken some time the imam lived in a twobedroomed flat in el cerezo and almost every room is full floor to ceiling of books i dont feel any closer to knowing why you want to recruit yacoub diouri the jihadis are in need of another big coup something on the scale of but not as small scale as a few hundred people killed on trains in madrid and the underground in london said falcon not quite able to stomach this level of objectivity im not diminishing those atrocities im just saying that they were on a different scale youll learn about intelligence work as you do it javier youre not in the trenches seeing your friends getting killed it has an effect on your vision said pablo madrid was timetargeted with a specific goal it wasnt a big bold statement it was just saying this is what we can do theres no comparison to the operation that brought down the twin towers no flight or hijack training they just had to board trains and leave rucksacks the most difficult aspect of the operation was to buy and deliver the explosives and in that we now know they had considerable help from local petty criminals so what is the big coup asked falcon uneasy at this breezy talk of death and destruction the world cup in germany no for the same reason that the olympics in greece was untouched its just too difficult the terrorists are competing with specialists who have been planning security at these events for years even the buildings are constructed with security in mind the chances of discovery are increased enormously why waste resources silence as the mercedes tyres ripped over the tarmac towards the airport which was smudged out by the earlymorning haze you dont know what it is do you said falcon you just know its coming or maybe you feel its coming we have no idea said pablo nodding but we dont just sense their desperation we know it too the design of the twin towers attack was to generate a fervour in muslims all over the world to get them to rise up against the decadent west which they feel has humiliated them so much over the years and to turn on their own dictatorial leaders and corrupt governments it hasnt happened the disgust level is rising in the muslim world at what the fanatics are prepared to dothe kidnapping and beheading of people like the aid worker margaret hassan the daily slaughter of iraqis who just want to have a normal lifethese things are not going down well but the demographics of the muslim world lean heavily on the side of youth and a disenfranchised youth likes nothing better than a demonstration of rebel power and that is what these radicals are in need of now another symbol of their power even if its the last bang before they die out with a whimper so what has this bomb in seville indicated to you the fact that hexogen was found is a cause for concern and judging by the level of destruction it was not a small quantity just the use of this material which the jihadis have never used before makes us think that the design was not to frighten the population of seville but something bigger said pablo the british have also revealed that local sources have heard talk about something big about to happen but their intelligence network has picked up no changes in any of their communities we have to remember that since the july th london underground bombings those communities are more aware too this makes mi and mi think that it will be an attack launched from the outside and spain has proven to be a popular country for terrorists to gather and plan their campaigns so how are you expecting yacoub diouri to help you asked falcon he doesnt do much business in england he goes to london for shopping and the two fashion weeks he has friends but theyre all in the fashion industry im assuming by the way that you want yacoub to act for you because hes not involved in international terrorism but that he might have contacts with people whose involvement in these activities he is unaware of were not going to ask him to do anything unusual or out of character he attends the right mosque and he already knows the people we want him to make contact with he just has to take it a step further i didnt know he attended a radical mosque a mosque with radical elements where it is possible with a name like diouri to become involved as you know yacoubs father abdullah was active in the independence movement istiqlal in the fifties he was one of the prime movers against european decadence in tangier his name carries huge weight with the traditional islamists the radicals would love to have a diouri on their side so you know who these radical elements are i go to church im a moderate catholic said pablo i dont have much time to get involved in churchrelated business or socialize with other members of the congregation but even i know all the people who hold strong views because they cant keep them in and they cant disguise their history but you can have powerful convictions and have enthusiasm for radical ideas without being a terrorist exactly which is why the only way to find out is to be involved and get to the next level said pablo what were trying to find is a chain of command where do the orders come from to activate the dormant cells where do the ideas for terrorist attacks originate is there a planning division are there independent recce and logistical teams who move around giving expert help to activated cells our picture of these terrorist networks is so incomplete that were not even sure whether a network exists or not where are the british in all this asked falcon theyre expecting another major assault from the outside they must know about yacoub from his trips to london why havent they tried to recruit him themselves they have it didnt work said pablo the british are very sensitive to anything that happens in southern spain and north africa because theyre in the middle with their naval base in gibraltar they are aware of the potential for attacks like the explosive dinghy launched at the uss cole in yemen in october they have sources in the expat criminal communities operating between the costa del sol and that stretch of moroccan coast between melilla and ceuta the nature of the drugsmuggling business is that it is cash heavy and requires access to efficient moneylaundering operations other criminal communities are inevitably involved information comes from all angles when we told the british that hexogen had been used in the seville bomb yesterday it resonated with something they already knew or rather something theyd heard did they tell you what that was it needs to be corroborated said pablo the most important thing at this stage is to find out whether yacoub is prepared to act for us if hes already turned down the americans and the british it could be that hes not interested in that sort of life because believe me it is very demanding so lets see if hes a player and take it from there the car had arrived at a private entrance to the airport beyond the terminal buildings the driver talked to the policeman at the gate and showed a pass pablo dropped the window and the policeman looked in with his clipboard he nodded the gate opened the car drove into an xray bay and out again they drove beyond the air cargo area until they arrived at a hangar where six small planes were parked the car pulled up alongside a lear jet pablo picked up a large plastic bag of that mornings newspapers from the floor of the mercedes they boarded the jet and took their seats pablo flicked through the newspapers which were full of the bombings how about that for a headline he said and handed falcon a british tabloid the second coming count the number of the beast june casablancawednesday th june hrs the plane touched down just after am spanish time two hours ahead of moroccan time they were met by a mercedes which contained a member of the spanish embassy from rabat who took their passports they were driven to a quiet end of the terminal building and after a few minutes they were through to the other side the mercedes drove to where the rental cars were parked the man from the spanish embassy handed over a set of keys and falcon transferred to a peugeot we cant have an embassy vehicle turning up at his residence said pablo the diplomat handed over some dirhams for the tolls falcon left the airport and joined the motorway from casablanca to rabat the sun was well up and the heat haze was draining the colour from the dull flat landscape falcon sat back with the window open and the moist sea air baffling over the glass he overtook vastly overloaded trucks farting out black smoke with boys sitting on top of sheetwrapped bales their legs hooked around the securing ropes in the fields a man in a burnous sat on a bony white donkey which he tapped and poked with a stick occasionally a bmw flashed past leaving a flicker of arabic lettering on the retina the smell was of the sea woodsmoke manured earth and pollution the outskirts of rabat loomed he took the ring road and came into the city from the east he remembered the turning after the societe marocaine de banques the tarmac gave out immediately and he eased up the troughed and pitted track to the main gate of yacoub diouris walled property the gateman recognized him he swung up the driveway lined with washingtonian palms and stopped outside the front door two servants came out in blue livery with red piping each wearing a fez the hire car was driven away falcon was taken inside to the living room which overlooked the pool where yacoub swam his morning lengths he sat down on one of the cream leather sofas in front of a low wooden table inlaid with motherofpearl the servant left birds fluttered in the garden a boy dragged a hose out and began spraying the hibiscus yacoub diouri arrived wearing a blue jellabah and white barbouches a servant set down a brass tray with a pot of mint tea and two small glasses on the table and left yacoubs hair which hed allowed to grow long was wet and he now had a closecropped beard they embraced with an enthusiastic arabic greeting and held on to each other by the shoulders looking into each others eyes and smiling falcon saw warmth and wariness in yacoubs he had no idea what was readable in his own would you prefer coffee javier asked yacoub releasing him tea is fine said falcon sitting on the other side of the table falcons question was humped up in his mind he felt an unaccustomed nervousness between them he knew for certain now that spanish directness was not going to work a more spiralling philosophical dynamic was called for the world has gone crazy once again said diouri wearily pouring the mint tea from a great height not that it was ever sane said falcon weve got no patience for the dullness of sanity but strangely theres an unending appetite for the dullness of decadence said diouri handing him a glass of tea only because clever people in the fashion industry have persuaded us that the next handbag decision is crucial said falcon touche said diouri smiling and taking a seat on the sofa opposite youre sharp this morning javier theres nothing like a bit of fear for honing the mind said falcon smiling you dont look frightened said diouri but i am being in seville is different to watching it on television at least fear provokes creativity said diouri veering away from falcons intended line whereas terror either crushes it or makes us run around like headless chickens do you think the fear people experienced under the regime of saddam hussein made them creative what about the fear that comes with freedom all those choices and responsibilities or the fear from lack of security said diouri sipping his tea enjoying himself now that he knew falcon was not going to be too european did we ever have that conversation about iraq weve talked a lot about iraq said falcon moroccans love to talk to me about iraq while everybody north of tangier hates to talk about it but we you and i have never had the original conversation about iraq said diouri that question why did the americans invade falcon sat back on the sofa with his tea this was how it always was with yacoub when he was in morocco it was how it was with falcons moroccan family in tangier with all moroccans in fact tea and endless discussion falcon never talked like this in europe any attempt would be greeted with derision but this time it was going to provide the way in they had to circle each other before the proposal could finally be made almost every moroccan ive ever spoken to thinks that it was about oil you learn quickly said diouri acknowledging that falcon had acquiesced to the moroccan way there must be more moroccan in you than you think my moroccan side is slowly filling up said falcon sipping the tea diouri laughed motioned to javier for his glass and poured two more measures of highaltitude tea if the americans wanted to get their hands on iraqi oil why spend billion on an invasion when they could raise sanctions at the stroke of a pen said diouri no thats the facile thinking of what the british like to call the arab street the teahouse huffers and puffers think that people only do things for immediate gain they forget the urgency of it all the invention of the weapons of mass destruction pretext haranguing the un for more resolutions rushing the troops to the borders the hastiness of the planned invasion which made no provision for the aftermath what was all that about where was iraqi oil going to go down the plug hole wasnt it more about the control of oil in general said falcon we know a bit more about the emerging economies of china and india now but the chinese werent making a move said diouri their economy wont be larger than americas until no that doesnt make sense either but at least you didnt say that word that i have to listen to now when i go to dinners in rabat and casablanca and find myself sitting next to american diplomats and businessmen they tell me that they went into iraq to give them democracy well they did have elections there is an iraqi assembly and a constitution as a result of ordinary iraqi people taking considerable risks to vote the terrorists made a political mistake there said diouri they forgot to offer the people a choice that didnt include violence instead they said vote and we will kill you but they had already been killing them anyway when they were walking down the street to get some bread with their children thats why you have to swallow the word democracy at your dinners said falcon it was a victory for the occupation when i hear them use that word i ask themvery quietly i should addwhen are you going to invade morocco and get rid of our despotic king and his corrupt government and install democracy freedom and equality in morocco i bet you didnt you see youre right i didnt why not because of the state security system of informers left over from the king hassan ii days said falcon what did you say to them i did what most arabs do and said those things behind their backs nobody likes to be called a hypocrite especially the leaders of the modern world what i said to their faces were the words of palmerston a nineteenthcentury british prime minister said diouri in talking about the british empire he said we have no eternal allies and no perpetual enemies what we have are eternal and perpetual interests how did the americans react to that they thought it was henry kissinger whod said it said diouri didnt julius caesar say it before all of them we arabs are often derided as impossible to deal with probably because we have a powerful concept of honour we cannot compromise when honour is at stake said diouri westerners only have interests and its a lot easier to trade in those maybe you need to develop some interests of your own of course some arab countries have the most vital interest in the global economyoil and gas said diouri miraculously this does not translate into power for the arab world its not only outsiders who find us impossible to deal withwe cant seem to deal with each other which means youre always operating from a position of weakness correct javier said diouri we behave no differently to anyone else in the world we hold conflicting ideas in our heads agreeing with all of them we say one thing think another and do something else and in playing these games which everybody else plays we always forget the main point to protect our interests so a world power can condescend to us about democracy when their own foreign policy has been responsible for the murder of the democratically elected patrice lumumba and the installation of the dictator mobutu in zaire and the assassination of the democratically elected salvador allende to make way for the brutality of augusto pinochet in chile because they have no honour and only interests they always operate from a position of strength now do you see where we are not exactly that is another one of our problems we are very emotional people look at the reaction to those cartoons which appeared in the danish newspaper earlier this year we get upset and angry and it takes us down interesting paths but further and further away from the point said diouri but i must behave and get back to why the americans invaded iraq the half of my moroccan family that doesnt think it was about oil said falcon thinks that it was done to protect the israelis ah yes another notion that seethes in the minds of the tea drinkers said diouri the jews are running everything most of my work force thinks that was a mossad operation to turn world opinion against the arabs and that george bush knew about it all along and let it happen even some of my senior executives believe that the israelis demanded the invasion of iraq that mossad supplied the false intelligence about weapons of mass destruction and that ariel sharon was the commanderinchief of the us forces on the ground where the jews are concerned we are the worlds greatest conspiracy theorists the problem is that it is their rage at the israeli occupation of palestine that blinds them to everything else that fundamental injustice that slap in the face for the arabs sense of honour brings up such powerful emotions in the arab breast that they cannot think they cannot see they focus on the jews and forget about their own corrupt leadership their lack of lobbying power in washington the pusillanimity of almost all dictatorial authoritarian arab regimesach im boring myself now you see javier we are incapable of change the arab mind is like his house and the medina where he lives everything looks inward there are no views or vistasno visions of the future we sit in these places and look for solutions in tradition history and religion while the world beyond our walls and shores grinds relentlessly forward crushing our beliefs with their interests people will look back on the twentieth century and gasp how was it they will say that a race that held the worlds most powerful resource oil the resource that made the whole system run allowed most of its people to live in abject poverty while its political cultural and economic influence was negligible you know the last people in the world who should be sent to talk to the arabs are the americans we are polar opposites in becoming an american part of the pact is to walk away from your past your history and totally embrace the future progress and the american way whereas to an arab what happened in the seventh century or is still as vivid today as it was when it first occurred they want us to embrace a new future but we cannot forsake our history why is it that when you talk about the arabs sometimes you say we and sometimes they as you know i have one foot in europe and the other in north africa and my mind runs down the middle said diouri i perceive the injustice of the palestinian situation but i cant emotionally engage with their solutions the intifada and suicide bombings its just a terrifying extension of throwing stones at tanksan expression of weakness an inability to draw together the necessary forces to bring about change since arafat has gone things have been able to move forward stagger forwardlurch from side to side said yacoub sharons stroke signified the end of the old guard the vote for hamas was a vote against the corruption of fatah well see if the rest of the world wants them to succeed but despite all these misgivings you still have no desire to live in spain thats my peculiar problem ive been brought up in a religious household and ive benefited from the daily discipline of religious observance i love ramadan i always make sure i am here for ramadan because for one month of the year the workings of the world drift into the background and the spiritual and religious life becomes more important we are all joined together by it in communal fasting and feasting it gives spiritual strength to the individual and the community in christian europe you have lent but it has become something personal almost selfish you think ill give up chocolate or i wont drink beer for a month it doesnt bind society like ramadan does is that the only reason you dont live in spain you are one of the few europeans i can talk to about these things without having you laugh in my face said diouri but that is what i have learnt from my two fathers the one who forsook me and the one who taught me the right way to be that is the difficulty for me in both europe and america you know theres been a big change here recently it was always the dream to get to america young moroccans thought their culture was cool their society much freer than racistbound old europe the attitude of immigration and the universities more open now the kids have changed their minds they were attracted to europe but now after the riots in france last year and the disrespect shown in denmark their dreams are of coming home for myself when im alone in hotel rooms in the west and i try to relax by watching television i gradually feel my whole being dissipating and i have to get down and pray and whats that about its about the decadence of a society consumed by materialism said diouri to which you yourself make a considerable contribution and from which you derive great benefit said falcon all i can say is if i lived anywhere other than morocco i would be drained of will within a few weeks but then you rage against the lack of progress and the inability to change in the arab world i rage against poverty the lack of work for a young and growing population the humiliation of a people by but if you give a young guy work hell make money and go out and buy a mobile phone an ipod and a car said falcon he will once he has made sure that his family is taken care of said diouri and that is fine as long as the materialism doesnt become his new god a lot of americans are profoundly religious whilst being driven by materialism they believe it goes hand in hand they are wealthy because they are the chosen people well thats confused everything said falcon only the extremist polarizes through simplification said diouri laughing extremists understand one thing about human nature nobody wants to know about the complexity of the situation the invasion of iraq was about oil no it wasnt it was all about democracy the two extremes are a long way from the truth but theres enough in both statements to make people believe it is all about oil but not iraqi oil and it is about democracy but not the strange beast that will have to be cloned in order to hold iraq together i think weve come full circle said falcon we must be close by now oil democracy and the jews theres truth in all of them it was part of the brilliance of the plan said diouri to create such a colossal diversionary arena that the world would look nowhere else the problem with most conspiracy theories is that they always award phenomenal intelligence and foresight to people whove rarely exhibited those qualities said falcon this action didnt require huge intelligence or foresight because it simplified all complexities down to a single perpetual interest theres also a terrifying logic to it which conspiracy theories always lack said diouri i told you that it was all about oil democracy and protection but none of it was to do with iraq for the americans to maintain their world domination they need oil in a continuous supply at a competitive price democracy is a very fine thing as long as the right person wins and that means the person who will look after american interests most ably democracy in the arab world is dangerous because politics is always bound up with religion it is only promoted in iraq because the installation of another more pliable despot than saddam hussein would not be acceptable to the outside world at least it introduces the concept of democracy there have been attempts at democracy in the arab world before now it breaks down when it becomes clear that the winners in the elections would be the islamic candidates democracy puts power in the hands of the most numerous and for them islam will always come first that doesnt offer much security to american interests which is why the democratically elected iraqi assembly and their constitution have had to bewrestled into position do you think thats the case it doesnt matter whether it is or not its the common perception in the arab world so who are the americans seeking to protect with all this activity in the region if it isnt the israelis the israelis can take care of themselves as long as they have american supportwhich they are guaranteed because theyre so powerfully represented in washington no the americans have to protect the weak and the flabby the decadent and the corrupt who are the guardians of their greatest and most sacred interest oil i believeand im not a mad lone conspiracy theoristthat they invaded iraq to offer protection to the saudi royal family its not as if saddam hussein had shown himself to be the most accommodating neighbour exactly so a perfect pretext was invented on the basis of past performance said diouri anybody could see that after the first gulf war in saddam was a spent force which was why bush senior left him there rather than create the unknown quantity of a power vacuum fortunately saddam still strutted about on his little stage with all the arrogance of a great arab icon he was cruel and genocidal gassing the kurds and massacring shias it was easy to create the image of an evil genius who was destabilizing the middle east i mean they even managed to frame him for but he was cruel violent and despotic said falcon so when are the coalition forces going to turn their attention to say robert mugabe in zimbabwe said diouri but thats how the americans play the game they confuse the picture with elements of truth if saddam was a spent force why did the saudis believe they needed protecting they were scared of the militancy that they themselves had created said diouri to maintain credibility as the guardians of the sacred sites of islam they bankrolled the medressas the religious schools which in turn became hotbeds of extremism like all decadent regimes they are paranoid they sensed the antipathy of the arab world and its extremist factions they couldnt invite the americans in as they had done in but they could ask them to install themselves next door the double reward for the americans was that they not only secured their perpetual interest the oil but also drew the forces of terror away from the homeland by offering a target in the heart of islam bush has repaid his corporate debts to the oil companies the american population feels safer and it can all be dressed up as the forces of good crushing those of evil silence while diouri lit his first cigarette of the morning and sipped some more tea falcon sucked on the sweet viscous liquid in his own glass his question crammed tight in his chest tea cigarettes foodtheyre all negotiating tools said diouri mysteriously falcon studied yacoub over the rim of his tea glass spies were necessarily complicated people even those with a clear motive the worrying and yet crucial aspect of their personality was their need and therefore ability to deceive but why spy why did he himself provide information for mark flowers it was because he had begun to find the illusion of life tiresome the supposed reality of tussling politicians beaming businessmen and fatuous pundits was exhausting to watch on tv when its veneer had been worn so thin he spied not because he wanted to exchange one facile illusion for a slightly more knowing one but because he needed to remind himself that acceptance was passive and hed already discovered the dangers of denial and inaction in his own mind but what he was asking his friend yacoub to do was real spying not just giving mark flowers some detail to fill in his little pictures he was asking yacoub to pass on information that could result in the capture and perhaps death of people that he might know youre thinking javier said diouri normally at this stage europeans are writhing in their seats with ennui at having to talk about iraq the palestinian question and all the rest of the insoluble horror they have no appetite for polemic any more in my world of fashion all they want to talk about is coldplays new album or costume design in the latest baz luhrman movie even business people would rather talk about football golf and tennis than world politics it seems that we arabs have created an interest that nobody wants weve cornered the market in the most boring conversations in the world its riveting to the arabs because you havent got what you want the comfortable never want to talk about stuff that will make them feel uncomfortable im comfortable said diouri are you said falcon youre wealthy but do you have what you want do you know what you want i associate comfort with boredom said diouri it might be to do with my past but i cannot bear contentment i want change i want a state of perpetual revolution its the only way i can be sure that im still alive most moroccans ive spoken to would like to be comfortable with a job a house a family and a stable society to live in if they want all that theyll have to be prepared for change none of them wanted terrorism said falcon and none of them wanted a talibantype regime how many did you get to condemn acts of terrorism none of them approved i mean outright condemnation said diouri firmly only the ones who had persuaded themselves that the terrorist acts had been committed by the israelis you see its a complicated state the arab mind said diouri tapping his temple at least they didnt find terrorism honourable you know when terrorism is honourable said diouri pointing at falcon with the chalk stick of his french cigarette terrorism was considered honourable when the jews fought the british for the right to establish their zionist state it was considered dishonourable when the palestinians employed extreme tactics against the jews in order to reclaim the land and property that had been stolen from them terrorists are acceptable once theyve become strong enough to be perceived as freedom fighters when they are weak and disenfranchised they are just common bloody murderers but thats not what were talking about here said falcon fighting back his frustration at how the conversation had spiralled off again it will always be part of it said diouri that hard pip of injustice scores at the insides of every arab they know that what these mad fanatics are doing is wrong but humiliation has a strange effect on the human mind humiliation breeds extremism look at germany before the second world war the power of humiliation is that it is deeply personal we all remember it from the first time it happened to us as a child what extremists like bin laden and zarqawi realize is that humiliation becomes truly dangerous when it is collective has risen to the surface and theres a clear purpose in venting it that is what the terrorists want that is the ultimate aim of all their attacks they are saying look if we all do this together we can be powerful and then what said falcon youll be taken back to the glory days of the middle ages forward to the past said diouri crushing out his cigarette in the silver shell of the ashtray im not sure thats a price worth paying to have our humiliation assuaged have you heard of an organization called vomit asked falcon thats the antimuslim website that people here get so enraged about said diouri i havent seen it myself apparently the site enumerates the victims of muslim attacks on civilians not just in the western world but also muslimonmuslim attacks such as the suicide bombings of iraqi police recruits women murdered in honour killings and the gangraping of women to inflict shame whats your angle javier asked diouri through narrowed eyes are you saying this organization has a point as far as i know they are making no point other than keeping count what about the name of the website well vomit expresses disgust you know muslim life is regarded rather cheaply in the west think how valuable each of the lives was in the twin towers how much was invested in the commuters in madrid or the odd people who died in the london bombings and then look at the value of the iraqi civilians who lost their lives in the preinvasion assault nothing im not sure they even registered said diouri was there a website that enumerated the victims of serb slaughter in bosnia what about hindu attacks on muslims in india i dont know thats why vomit is antimuslim it has singled out the acts of a fanatic few and made it the responsibility of an entire religion said diouri if you told me they were responsible for blowing up the mosque in seville yesterday it wouldnt surprise me theyve established a presence said falcon our intelligence agency the cni are aware of them who else are the cni aware of said diouri uneasy its a very complicated situation said falcon and were looking for intelligent knowledgeable and wellconnected people who are willing to help us falcon sipped his tea grateful for the prop hed finally got it out into the open he almost couldnt believe hed said it nor could yacoub diouri who was sitting on the other side of the ornately decorated table blinking have i understood you correctly javier said diouri his face suddenly solid as a plastic mask and his voice stripped of any warmth you have presumed to come into my house to ask me to spy for your government you knew from the moment i called you last night that i wasnt coming here on a purely social visit said falcon holding firm spies are the most despised of all combatants said diouri not the dogs of war but the rats i would never have thought of asking you if for one moment i took you to be a man who was satisfied with what we are being asked to believe in this world said falcon that was the point of your discourse on iraq wasnt it not just to show me the arab point of view but also your appreciation of a greater truth but what has led you to believe that you could ask me such a question i ask it because like me you are promuslim and proarab and antiterrorism you also want there to be change and to make progress rather than a great regression you are a man of integrity and honour i wouldnt normally associate those virtues with the amorality of spying said diouri except that knowing you your purpose would not be financial reward or vanity but rather a belief in bringing about change without pointless violence you and i are very similar people said diouri except that our roles have been reversed we have both been wronged by monstrous fathers you have suddenly discovered that you are half moroccan while i should have been brought up spanish but have become moroccan perhaps we are the embodiment of two entwined cultures with messy histories said falcon nodding sevillewednesday th june hrs the radio promised the sevillanos a day of towering heat in excess of c with a light saharan breeze to sting the eyeballs dry the sweat and render the site of the destroyed building a serious health hazard consuelo was still groggy from the pill shed taken at three in the morning when shed realized that watching darios fluttering eyelids was not going to help her sleep as always she had a busy day ahead which would now be enclosed by the parentheses of sessions with alicia aguado she did not think about them she was removed from what was happening she was more aware of the bone structure of her face and the snug mask of her skin behind which she hoped to keep operating the mood of the radio presenter was sombre his words of reflection did not penetrate nor did his announcement of a minutes silence for the victims of the bombing which had been called for midday her eyelids closed and opened as if she was expecting a new scene with every blink rather than the same scene minutely changed the sleeping pill dulled the adrenaline leak into her system had she been any sharper the terrifying sense of coming apart that shed experienced yesterday would have been too powerful a memory and she would have glided past aguados consulting room and driven straight to work as it was she parked the car and let her legs carry her up the stairs her hand engaged with alicia aguados white palm as her hips fitted between the arms of the lovers chair she bared her wrist words came to her from some way off and she didnt catch them im sorry she said im still a little tired can you repeat that last night did you think about what i told you to im not sure that i remember what i toldwhat you told me to think about something that made you happy oh yes i did that have you been taking drugs consuelo youre very slow this morning i took a sleeping pill at three this morning why couldnt you sleep i was too happy aguado went to the kitchen and made a powerful cafe solo and gave it to consuelo who knocked it back you have to be sharp for our meetings or theres no point said aguado you have to be in touch with yourself aguado stood in front of consuelo tilted her face up as if she were positioning a small child for a kiss and pressed her thumbs into her forehead consuelos vision brightened aguado sat back down why couldnt you sleep i was thinking too much about all those things that made you too happy happiness is not my normal condition i needed a respite what is your normal condition i dont know i cover it too well are you listening to yourself i cant help it i have no resistance so you didnt do what i told you to do last night i told you happiness is not my normal condition im not drawn to it what did you do i watched my children sleeping what does that tell you about the condition that you are drawn to its uncomfortable do you drive yourself hard in your work of course its the only way to be successful why is success important to you its an easier measure than what panic rose in consuelos constricting throat its easier to measure ones success in business than it is to measure or rather to seeperceiveyou know what im trying to say i want you to say it consuelo shifted in her half of the seat took a deep breath i balance my failures as a person by showing the world my brilliance in business so what is your success to you its my cover people will admire me for that whereas if they knew who i really was what i had done they would despise me do your three children sleep in separate bedrooms now they do yes the two older boys need their own space when you watch them sleeping who do you spend most time with the youngest dario why he is still very close to me is there an age gap hes four years younger than matias do you love him more than the other two i know i shouldnt but i do does he look more like you or your late husband like me have you always looked at your children sleeping yes she said thinking about it but its only becomeobsessive in the last five years since my husband was murdered did you look at them any differently compared to now before i would look at them and think these are my beautiful creations only after rauls death did i begin to sit amongst themi put them all in the same room for a whileand yes it was then that the pain started but its not a bad pain what does that mean i dont know not all pain is bad in the same way that not all sadness is terrible and not all happiness that great talk me through that said aguado when is sadness not so terrible melancholy can be a desirable state ive had affairs with men which have satisfied me while they lasted and when they finished i was sad but with the knowledge that it was for the best when can happiness not be so great i dont know said consuelo twirling her free hand maybe when a woman comes out of a courtroom saying that shes happy her sons killer was sentenced to life imprisonment i wouldnt call that id like you to personalize that for me my sister thinks im happy she sees me as a healthy wealthy and successful woman with three children when i told her about our sessions she was stunned she said if youre nuts what hope is there for the rest of us but when do you see your happiness as not being so great thats what i mean said consuelo i should be happy now but im not i have everything anybody could wish for what about love my children give me all the love i need do they asked aguado dont you think that children take a lot of loving you are their guiding light in the nurturing process you teach them and give them confidence to face the world they reward you with unconditional love because they are conditioned to do that but they dont know what love is dont you think that children are essentially selfish you dont have children alicia were not here to talk about me and not every point of view that comes from me is my own said aguado do you think life can be complete without adult love a lot of women have come to the conclusion that it can be said consuelo ask all those battered wives we have in spain theyll tell you that love can be the death of you you dont look like the battered type not physically have you suffered mental torment from a man a tremor shuddered through consuelo and aguados fingers jumped off her wrist consuelo thought that shed kept the content of this session at a remove what shed been saying was in her head of course but it was confined there fenced in but now somehow it had broken out it was as if the mad cows had realized the flimsiness of the barriers and crashed through to stampede around her body she felt the wild terror of yesterday the sense of coming apartor was it the fear of something that had been contained getting loose keep calm consuelo said aguado i dont know where this fear comes from im not even sure whether its associated with what ive been saying or if its from some other source thats suddenly leaked into the mainstream try to put it into words thats all you can do ive become suspicious of myself im beginning to think that a large chunk of my existence has been kept satisfied or perhaps tied down by some illusion that ive devised to keep myself going most people prefer the illusory state its less complicated to live a life feeding off tv and magazines said aguado but its not for you consuelo how do you know maybe its too late to start breaking things down and rebuilding them im afraid its too late for you to stop said aguado thats why youve ended up here youre like someone whos walked down an alleyway and seen a naked foot sticking out of a rubbish bin you want to forget about it you dont want to get involved but unfortunately youve seen the foot too clearly and youll get no peace until the matter is resolved the reason i came here was because of the man in the plaza del pumarejomy bizarreattraction to him and its danger to me now weve talked about other things unrelated to that and i have the feeling that ive got nowhere to go nowhere in my head is safe only my work takes my mind elsewhere and thats only temporary even my children have become potentially dangerous none of it is unrelated said aguado im teasing out the threads from the tangled knot eventually well find the source and once youve seen it and understood it youll be able to move on to a happier life this terror has its rewards ines woke up in a convulsion of fear she blinked taking in the room a piece at a time esteban wasnt there his pillow was undented she creaked up on an elbow and threw off the sheet the pain made her whimper she panted like a runner summoning energy for the next lap the next level of pain there didnt seem to be a painfree position she had to think her way around her body trying to find new pathways to limbs and organs that didnt hurt she got up on to all fours and gasped hanging her head staring down the tunnel of her falling hair tears blurred her vision there was a circle of diluted red on her pillow she got a foot down on to the floor and slid off the bed she shuffled to the mirror and pushed her hair back she could not believe it was her head on top of that body the contusions were gross an abstract of purple blue black and yellow had spread out over her entire chest area and now joined the bruise on her torso which reached down as far as her pubic hair it was true she did bruise easily it wasnt as bad as it looked the pain was more from stiffness than actual damage a warm shower would help in the bathroom she caught sight of her back and buttocks the welts looked angrier and uglier she would have to disinfect the punctures left by the buckle how easily this new regime came to her she ran the water held her handstill puffy from where her finger had been bent backunderneath the flow she stepped in and held on to the mixer tap gasping at the pain of the water falling on her she wouldnt be able to wear a bra this morning tears came she sank to the floor of the shower the water seethed through her hair what had happened to her she couldnt even think of herself in the first person singular any more she was so distant from the woman she used to be she slapped the shower off and crawled out like a beaten dog she found reserves she didnt know she had she took painkillers she was going to work it was impossible to stay in the hell of this apartment she dried herself off got dressed and made up nothing showed she went out and caught a cab the driver talked about the bomb he was angry he hit his steering wheel he called them bastards without knowing who they were he said that the time had come to stop fucking about and teach these people a lesson ines didnt engage she sat in the back gnawing at the inside of her cheek thinking how much she needed somebody to talk to she went through all her friends they were hopeless not one could she describe as intimate her colleagues all good people but not right for this family she couldnt bear to reveal her failure and it came to her out of the blue a thought shed never allowed herself before her mother was a stupid person and her father a pompous ass who thought he was an intellectual the office was empty she was relieved her schedule told her she had two meetings and then nothing shed made sure there was nothing because she had to prepare for a court appearance the next day she headed for the door and one of her male colleagues blundered in with an armful of files the pain of their collision detonated in her head fainting seemed like the only option to wipe clean the pain circuit she dropped and held on to her foot as a distraction her colleague was all over her saying he was sorry she left without a word meetings passed only at the end of the second one did the judge ask her if she was all right she went to the lavatory and tried to ignore the trickle of blood she saw slowly dissipating in the water her period she hadnt had one it wasnt due she didnt care she took more painkillers she went across the avenue to the murillo gardens she knew what she was after she wanted to see the whore again she wasnt sure why one part of her wanted to show the whore what hed done to her the other partwhat did the other part want the whore wasnt there it was hot the street signs told her it was c at she walked through the barrio santa cruz amongst the ambling tourists how was she going to find the whore the painkillers were good her mind floated free of her body reality eased off a few notches it hadnt occurred to her that painkillers killed all manner of pain her lips tingled and did not feel like her own street sounds came to her muffled her vision was soft focus she was being drawn along by a great multitude of people who were crowding into the avenida de la constitucion and heading for the plaza nueva they carried banners which she couldnt read because they were turned away from her in the square there were hundreds of placards held up in the air which said simply paz peace yes she would like some of that the clock struck midday and the crowd fell totally silent she walked amongst them wondering what had happened looking into their faces for signs they returned her gaze stonefaced the traffic noise had stopped too there was only the sound of birds it was quite beautiful she thought that people should be gathering together to ask for peace she wandered out of the square just as people returned to a state of animation and the murmur of humanity rose up behind her she went down calle zaragoza thinking she would go to el cairo for something to eat they liked her in el cairo she thought they liked her in el cairo but everybody liked everybody else in bars in seville it was then that she saw the whore not the whore herself but a photograph she stepped back into the street confused could whores do that now advertise themselves in shop windows they pipe porn into your living room after midnight now but do they let whores tout for business like this she was surprised to find it was an art gallery a car gave her a light toot she stepped back up to the window she read the card next to the photograph marisa just thatmarisa how old was she the card didnt say thats what everybody wants to know these days how old are you they want to see your beauty they need to know your age and if youre talented thats a bonus but the first two are crucial for the marketing beyond the window display was a young woman at a desk ines went in she heard her heels on the marble floor shed forgotten to look at the whores work but she was committed now i love that marisa she heard herself say i just love her the young woman was pleased ines was well dressed and seemed harebrained enough to pay the ridiculous prices they veered off together to admire marisas worktwo woodcarvings ines encouraged the woman to talk and in a matter of minutes had found out where marisa had her workshop ines had no idea what she should do with this information she went to el cairo and ordered a stuffed piquillo pepper and a glass of water she toyed with the bright red pepper which looked obscene like a pointed inquisitive tongue looking for a moist aperture she hacked it up and forked it into her cottonwool mouth she went home turned on the air conditioning and lay on the bed she slept and woke up in the chill of the apartment having dreamt and been left with an overwhelming sense of loneliness she had never been as lonely as in that dream it occurred to her that she would only be as lonely as that in death the painkillers had worn off and she was stiff with cold she realized that she was talking to herself and was fascinated to know what shed been saying it was in the afternoon she should go to the office and work on the case but there didnt seem much point now for some reason tomorrow had begun to seem unlikely she heard herself say dont be ridiculous she went to the kitchen and drank water and swallowed more painkillers she came out of the apartment and into the street which was thick with heat after the thin chilled air inside she caught a cab and heard her voice ask the cab driver to take her to calle bustos tavera why had she asked to be taken there there was nothing to be gained there was something jutting out of the gathered neck of her handbag which she held on her lap she didnt recognize what it was she pulled open the bag and saw a steel button set flush in a black handle and a straight steel blade next to her hairbrush she looked up at the driver their eyes connected via the rearview mirror have you seen that said the driver what said ines in shock at the sight of the knife but he was pointing out of the window people hanging hams outside their front doors he said if they cant afford them theyre hanging pictures of hams a ham manufacturer in andalucia is distributing them this guy on the radio was saying its a passive form of protest it goes back to the fifteenth century when the moors were driven out of andalucia and the catholic kings promoted the cooking and eating of pork to signify the end of islamic domination theyre calling today el dia de los jamones what do you think of that i thinki dont know what i think said ines fingering the knife handle the driver switched the radio to another station flamenco music filled the cab i cant listen to too much talk about the bomb he said it makes me wonder who ive got in the back of my cab sevillewednesday th june hrs yesterdays emotionally charged workload followed by the three evening meetings an uneven nights sleep the flight and the tension caused by the uncertainty of his mission had left falcon completely drained hed briefly told pablo that yacoub had agreed to act for them but not without conditions then hed hit his seat in the lear jet and passed out instantly they landed at seville airport just before pm and split up agreeing to meet later that night back at home falcon showered and changed his housekeeper had left him a fish stew which he ate with a glass of cold red wine he called ramirez who told him there was to be another big meeting at pm and gave him a very thin update of which the best news was that lourdes the girl theyd pulled out of the wreckage yesterday had regained consciousness for a few minutes just after midday she was going to be all right there was no news on the electricians or the council inspectors except that elvira had arranged a press release and thered been announcements on tv and radio nothing extraordinary had come out of the interviews with the informaticalidad sales reps the one remarkable element in ramirezs report was his praise for juez calderon who had been handling a very aggressive media you know i dont like him said ramirez but hes been doing a very good job since our big news yesterday the investigation has been completely stalled but calderon is making us look competent realistically whats the earliest we can expect to get to the epicentre of the bomb asked falcon not before am tomorrow said ramirez once they get down to the rubble directly over the mosque theyre going to be working by hand under bomb squad and forensic supervision thats going to take time and the conditions are going to be horrible in fact they already are the stink down there gets into you like a virus its been confirmed with per cent certainty that one of the dead in the mosque is a cgi source said comisario elvira opening the pm meeting we wont have complete confirmation until the dna samples are matched to those taken from his apartment and what was he doing in there asked calderon inspector jefe barros has the report said elvira his name is miguel botin hes spanish thirtytwo years old and a resident of seville said barros esperanzathe woman who gave comisario elvira the list of men believed to be in the mosqueshe had a partner who was in the destroyed building said falcon was that miguel botin yes said barros he converted to islam eleven years ago his family came from madrid and his brother lost a foot in the march th bombings miguel botin was recruited by one of my agents in november and became active just over fourteen months ago in april the only noise in the preschool classroom was from the mobile airconditioning units even the steady grinding of the machinery outside had receded as barros began his report for the first eight months botin had very little to tell us the members of the congregation most of whom were of nonspanish origin were all good muslims and none of them were in the slightest bit radical they were all sympathetic to the story of his brother and they were all outraged by the london bombings which occurred not long after botin became active it was in january this year that botin first started to detect a change there was an increase in outside visitors to the mosque this had no noticeable effect on the congregation but by march it seemed to be having a discernible effect on imam abdelkrim benaboura he was preoccupied and appeared under pressure on th april my agent made a request to plant a microphone in the imams office i had a discussion with the juez decano de sevilla who was issued with my agents report the evidence was deemed to be largely circumstantial and a bugging order was refused due to a lack of hard evidence on my agents request botin stepped up his activities and started following imam abdelkrim benaboura outside the mosque between nd may and the date of this report which was wednesday st may botin saw the imam meet with three pairs of men on ten separate occasions at ten different locations around seville he has no idea what was said at any of these meetings but he did manage to take some photographs only two of which show clearly visible people on the basis of this report with the photographic evidence another bugging request was made last thursday st june we did not receive a reply prior to the explosion yesterday morning how many men are visible in these two shots asked falcon four said barros and since the cgi in madrid have sent down a set of shots from the apartment they raided yesterday weve been able to identify two of them as djamal hammad and smail saoudi we have no idea yet who the other two men are but the shots are currently in the hands of the cni mi and interpol obviously i would like to have made this information available sooner but what about these ten different locations said calderon cutting in on the selfpity is there anything exceptional about them are they near public buildings addresses of prominent people do they appear to be part of a plan of attack theres a significant building within a hundred metres of each meeting place but thats the nature of a big city said barros one of the meetings was in the irish pub near the cathedral who knows if that was the perfect cover for three muslims who didnt drink alcohol or whether their meeting outside the only remaining structure of the twelfthcentury almohad mosque was significant when was the first request to bug the imams office turned down by the juez decano asked falcon on the same day it was applied for th april and why wasnt the second bugging request authorized and acted on the juez decano was away in madrid at the time he didnt see the application until monday afternoonth june what was miguel botins description of the imams state of mind during this month when he observed him more closely asked falcon increasingly preoccupied not as engaged with his congregation as he had been the previous year botin became aware of him taking medication but wasnt able to find out what it was we found tenormin on his bedside table which is a prescription for hypertension said gregorio from the cni we also found an extensively stocked medicine cabinet his doctor says that he has been treated for hypertension for the past eight years hed recently been complaining of heart rhythm problems and was on medication for a stomach ulcer when will we get access to the imams apartment and your findings asked falcon dont worry inspector jefe said juan weve been working with a forensics team since the moment we opened the apartment door wed still like to get in there said falcon were nearly finished said gregorio does the cni have an opinion about botins findings and the imams doctor asked calderon and has someone gained access to his mysterious history asked falcon were still awaiting clearance on his history said gregorio the imam was under a lot of pressure said falcon before calderon could mount another attack on juan hammad and saoudi were known operators in the logistics of attacks they met with the imam were they asking the imam to act in some way perhaps they were calling in a favour or a promise made some time ago in his inaccessible history under those circumstances what do you think would put a man like the imam under severe stress that they were asking him to do something that would have very grave consequences said calderon but if he believed in the cause surely he would be happy said falcon it should be an honour for a radical fanatic to be asked to participate in a mission you think the pressure came from being a reluctant accomplice said gregorio or the nature of what he was being asked to do said falcon theres a different pressure in storing an unknown product for a week or two say and being asked to actively participate in an attack we need more information on the imams activities said elvira it hasnt been confirmed yet but we think it likely that hammad and saoudi were in the mosque when the building was destroyed said falcon confirmation will come with dna testing the other two men photographed by miguel botin have to be identified and found if we want to know how the imam was implicated that is in hand said gregorio id like to talk to the agent who ran miguel botin said falcon inspector jefe barros nodded comisario elvira asked for a resume of the situation with the electricians and the council inspectors ramirez gave the same very thin update hed just given to falcon we know the cgi antiterrorist squad did not have the mosque under surveillance said falcon we have two men posing as council inspectors who were clearly intent on gaining access to the mosque the electricians were responding to a blown fuse box we have to look at the possibility of a link between the fake council inspectors and the electricians i cannot believe that a legitimate electrician would not have come forward by now the obvious advantage of being an electrician is that you can bring large quantities of equipment into a place and witnesses have confirmed that this was the case you think that they planted the bomb asked barros it has to be considered said falcon we cant ignore it just because it doesnt fit with the discoveries weve made so far it also does not exclude the possibility that there was already a cache of explosives in the mosque we must talk to your agent what state of mind is he in not good hes a young guy only a little older than miguel botin weve been recruiting in that age group because they can connect more easily with each other his relationship with botin was close the two of them had a religious connection were they both converts no my agent was a catholic but they both took their religion seriously they respected and liked each other wed like to speak to him now said falcon barros left the room to call him the forensics need to make contact with the wives and families of the men who were in the mosque said elvira they have to start extracting dna as soon as possible the woman who represents them esperanza says she will only talk to you elvira gave him the mobile number the meeting ended the men dispersed elvira hung on to falcon theyre sending me some more people down from madrid he said no reflection on you or your squad but we both know the demands that are being made you need more foot soldiers and these are all experienced inspector jefes and inspectors anything thats going to relieve pressure im happy with said falcon as long as they dont complicate things theyre under my jurisdiction you dont have to deal with them theyll be assigned where theyre needed most have the guardia civil been able to get more information on the route of hammad and saoudi from madrid to seville its taking time barros pulled falcon aside as he left the room my agents not back from lunch yet he said theyll call me as soon as he gets in its just gone pm said falcon giving him his mobile number hes running a bit late isnt he barros shook his head shrugged things were not going well for him whats your agents name ricardo gamero said barros falcon called esperanza and they arranged to meet in some nearby gardens he asked to bring a female police officer with him cristina ferrera was waiting for him outside the preschool he briefed her on the way esperanza recognized falcon as he got out of the car introductions were made they piled back in esperanza sat next to falcon ferrera was behind staring at esperanza as if she recognized her how are the women holding up asked falcon i imagine the circumstances are very difficult for them they oscillate between despair and fear she said theyre devastated by the loss of their loved ones and then they see the newsthe assaults and damage to property they feel a little more secure since your comisario came on television and announced that violence against muslims and vandalizing of their property would be dealt with severely youre their representative said ferrera they trust me im not one of them but they trust me youre not one of them im not a muslim said esperanza my partner is a convert to islam i know them through him your partner is miguel botin said falcon yes she said he wants me to convert to islam so that we can get married im a practising catholic and i have some difficulties as a european with the treatment of women in islam miguel introduced me to all the women in the mosque to help me understand to help me get rid of some of my prejudices but its a big leap from catholicism to islam how did you meet miguel asked ferrera through an old school friend of mine said esperanza i ran into the two of them just over a year ago and after that miguel and i started seeing each other whats your friends name asked falcon ricardo gamero she said he does something in the police forcei dont know what he says its administrative seville was a village thought falcon he told esperanza what they needed from the women and said that ferrera would accompany her to collect and mark up the dna samples well need a sample from miguel botin as well said falcon im sorry esperanza nodded staring into space she had a clear unadorned face her only jewellery was a gold cross at her neck and two gold studs in her ear lobes which were visible as her slightly crinkly black hair was scraped back she had very straight eyebrows and it was these that first gave away her own emotional turmoil and then the moisture flooding her dark brown eyes she shook hands and got out of the car falcon quickly told ferrera how ricardo gamero fitted in and asked her to find out if esperanza knew what her partner had been doing dont worry inspector jefe said the exnun esperanza and i recognize each other weve been on the same path the two women moved off falcon sat in the airconditioned cool of the car and breathed the stress back down into its hole he made himself believe that he had time on his side the terrorist angle of the attack was not at the moment in his hands nor was the imams history but progress had been made he had to concentrate his powers on finding a link to the fake council inspectors and the electricians there had to be another witness someone more reliable than majid merizak whod seen the inspectors and the electricians falcon called ferrera and asked her to find out from the women if there was anybody else who might have been in the mosque on the mornings of friday nd june and monday th june he went back to his notebook too much occurring to him for his brain to have any chance of remembering detail the first bugging request the cgi made to the juez decano was submitted and refused on april th when did informaticalidad buy the apartment three months ago no date he called the estate agency the sale went through on the nd of february what was he expecting what was he looking for he wanted to apply pressure on informaticalidad he was still suspicious of them despite the performance by the sales reps in the police interviews but he didnt want to apply pressure directly it had to come from another source other than the homicide squad he wanted to see if they would react maybe if he could find someone whod been recently fired or had moved on from informaticalidad they would still know people at the company perhaps even some of the guys whod used the apartment on calle los romeros he found the lists given to him by diego torres the human resources director names addresses home telephone numbers and the dates they left the company how was he going to find these people at this time of day he started with the employees whod left the company most recently reasoning that they might still be out of work until after the summer he hit answer machine after answer machine number no longer in use and then finally a ringing tone that went on for some time a female voice answered sleepily falcon asked for david curado she shouted and threw down the phone which took a soft landing curado picked it up he sounded just about alive falcon explained his predicament sure said curado waking up instantly ill talk to anybody about those wankers curado lived in a modern apartment block in tabladilla falcon knew it hed been there years ago to observe a hostage situation across the street curado came to the door stripped to the waist wearing a pair of white short trousers as seen on the tennis player rafael nadal like nadal he looked as if he went to the gym beads of sweat stood out on his forehead the apartment was hot the girl whod answered the phone was lying splayed across the bed in a pair of knickers and a tiny vest curado offered a drink falcon took some water the girl groaned and rolled over her arms slapped against the mattress she gets annoyed said curado when im not earning i dont turn on the air conditioning during the day daviiid said the girl in a long whine now that youre here he said rolling his eyes he got up and flipped the switch on the fuse box a light mist appeared at the vents the girl let out an orgasmic cry how long did you work for informaticalidad asked falcon just over a year fifteen months something like that how did you get the job i was headhunted but i did the research to make sure that i was headhunted what was the research i went to church said curado the sales guys at informaticalidad were the best paid in the business and it wasnt all commissionbased money they paid a good basic salary of close to a month and you could triple that if you worked hard at the time i was working like a slave for a month all commission so i started asking around and it was weird nobody knew anything about how this company recruited i called all the agencies looked through the press and trade magazines the internet i even called informaticalidad themselves and they wouldnt tell me how they recruited i tried to get friendly with the informaticalidad sales crew but they brushed me off i started looking at who they sold to and it didnt matter what prices i offered i could never make a sale once a company started buying from informaticalidad they bought exclusively thats why they can offer the high basic salary they dont have to compete so i began looking at the individuals in the companies they sold to and tried to get friendly with them nothing i couldnt get anywhere until a buyer from one of these companies got fired it was she who told me how it worked youve got to go to church and you mustnt be a woman so i qualified on one score but i hadnt been to church for fifteen years there were three churches they used iglesia de la magdalena de santa maria la blanca and san marcos i bought myself a black suit and went to church within a couple of months id been approached so you got the job the money the nice apartment said falcon what went wrong almost immediately they started to cut in on my free time we were sent on coursessales training and product information normal stuff except that it was almost every weekend and there was a lot of repetitive company ethos shit and religion and it wasnt always easy to differentiate between the two they also did this other thing theyd partner you off with a senior guy whod been with the company for two or three years and he would be your mentor if you were unlucky and got one of the serious ones theyd fill your head with even more shit i saw people recruited at the same time as me who just disappeared disappeared lost their personality they became an informaticalidad man with a glassy look in their eye and their brain tuned to one frequency it gave me the creeps that said curado leaning forward conspiratorially and the total lack of women in the whole sales force i mean not one how did you get along with your mentor marco he was a good guy i still talk to him occasionally even though its forbidden for informaticalidad men to talk to exemployees why did you leave apart from the lack of women and all the brainwashing shit said curado they wouldnt let me into where the big money was being made like i said they sold to companies without having to compete so you got the good basic salary but if you wanted to make the big commissions that was all in converting new prospects to the informaticalidad way once theyd been converted you got commission on everything that was sold to that company ever and how did that work i never found out i never got beyond the lowest tier of salesmen i did not have the right mentality he said tapping his forehead in the end they forced me out through boredom i was nothing more than a formfiller and a post boy taking orders passing them on to supply it was the way they got rid of you at informaticalidad falcon took a call from inspector jefe barros im on my way to an apartment on calle butron said barros youd better come along as well im in the middle of an interview said falcon annoyed ricardo gamero was late coming back from lunch so i sent another of my agents round to his apartment there was no answer the woman in the apartment below let him in she said shed seen gamero going up but hadnt seen him leave the agent called back and i told him to get in there any way he could which was when the woman started screaming theres a central patio in the block shed opened the window to shout up the well he was hanging out of his bedroom window sevillewednesday th june hrs marisa left her apartment it was hot easily over forty degrees and the perfect time for her to work in her studio her tight mulatto skin yearned to sweat freely out in the street she walked in the sun and breathed in the desert air the streets were empty she stumbled on the cobbles of calle bustos tavera until her eyes got used to the sudden shade she turned up the alleyway to the courtyard the light at the end was blinding the sun had sucked out even the edges of the buildings beyond the arch she shivered a little at the sensation she always had walking down this tunnel at the end where the huge cobbles turned pewtery on the threshold she stopped the courtyard should have been empty at this hour instinct told her that someone was there she saw ines halfway down the steps leading to the entrance of her studio rage shuddered through her and bunched up behind her flat chest this fatuous middleclass bitch now wanted to infect the sanctity of her work place with the received opinions of her bourgeois upbringing with the soulless rant of her consumer needs with her selfrighteous smugness of being thin marisa stepped back into the full darkness of the tunnel in turning back to go up the stairs to the studio ines revealed the lowest welts on the backs of her thighs these people deserve each other thought marisa they wander through life with total belief in their brilliant control of the reality around them without ever seeing the iridescence of the illusory bubble in which they float they might as well be dead marisa suppressed the temptation to run up the steps beat the wretched woman senseless throw her down the stairs break her skull open and discover the smallness within my god she hated these people grown from tradition sporting their fancy namesines conde de fucking tejadasurname and title rolled into one ines reached the top of the steps put her handbag down tugged open the neck and drew out a blackhandled knife now this was interesting had the bitch come to kill her maybe the skinnylegged cow had some cojones after all ines scored something on the front door of the studio stepped back and jutted her chin at her work she put the knife back in the bag and walked down the steps marisa backed away snarling and retreated to her apartment for an hour by the time she returned the courtyard was empty the heat more intense she ran up the stairs to see iness message scored into the door was the predictable word puta whore it was time this was over she thought she couldnt have the bitch turning up at her place of work the news of gameros suicide had so disconcerted falcon hed left curado with barely another word now as he drove across town ideas occurred to him and he called curado on his mobile have you heard of someone called ricardo gamero should i he asked was he at informaticalidad maybe that had been too lurid an idea i want you to do something for me david said falcon i want you to call your old friend at informaticalidadmarco marco barreda i want you to tell marco barreda that you had a visit from the inspector jefe del grupo de homicidios javier falcon the same cop whos investigating the seville bombing i want you to tell him what we discussed in a thought youd like to know sort of way nothing sensational just matter of fact and tell him what my last question to you was about ricardo gamero exactly the medico forense was already up the ladder carrying out his preliminary examination of ricardo gameros body as falcon arrived on the crime scene there was no doubt that he was dead the cgi agent whod found him paco molero had checked for a pulse even if gamero had survived jumping off his window ledge with a rope tied around his neck he would not have lived for long on the floor were twelve empty trays of paracetamol even if theyd got him to hospital and pumped his stomach he would probably have remained in a coma and died of liver failure within fortyeight hours this was not attention seeking this was an experienced policeman making sure his apartment had been locked and chained his bedroom door was also locked with a chair tilted under the handle falcon shook inspector jefe barross hand im sorry ramon im very sorry said falcon whod never lost anybody from his squad but knew that it would be terrible two paramedics manoeuvred the body on to the ladder and pulled it up through the bedroom window they laid him out on his livingroom floor while the forensics went through the bedroom falcon asked the instructing judge for permission to search the body gamero was wearing suit trousers and a shirt he had a wallet in one pocket loose change in another as falcon turned the body to check the back pockets the head lolled with sickening flexibility there was a ticket to the archaeological museum in the righthand back pocket falcon showed it to inspector jefe barros who couldnt get rid of the dismay in his face the ticket had todays date on it hes a citizen of seville said falcon he doesnt need to buy a ticket to get into this museum maybe he didnt want to show his id said barros stay anonymous was that where he met his informers theyre taught not to follow a routine id like to talk to the agent who found himpaco molero of course said barros nodding they were good friends paco was sitting at the kitchen table with his face in his hands falcon touched him on the shoulder introduced himself pacos eyes were red were you worried about ricardo theres been no time for that said paco obviously he was upset because he believed hed lost one of his best sources in the mosque did you know his source ive seen him but i didnt know him said molero ricardo asked me to come with him a few times to check his backjust a routine precaution to make sure he wasnt being watched or followed did he leave the office at all today apart from going to lunch no he went out at one thirty he was due back two hours later when he hadnt showed by four thirty and his mobile was turned off inspector jefe barros sent me over here to find out what had happened what time did you find him i was here by ten to five so maybe just gone five oclock tell me what happened yesterdayafter the bombing we were all at work when it happened we called our sources to arrange meetings ricardo couldnt get through to botin then we were told not to leave the office so we drafted uptodate reports from what our sources had told us the last time wed seen them lunch was brought in we werent released to go home until after pm were you aware of any pressure on ricardo apart from the usual work stress apart from the unusual work stress you mean why unusual we were being investigated inspector jefe said molero we wouldnt be much of an antiterrorist outfit if we didnt know when our own department was being investigated how long have you known about this we reckon it probably started around the end of january what happened nothingjust a change in attitude or atmosphere did you suspect each other no we had total trust in each other and a belief in what we were doing said molero and i would say that out of the four of us handling islamic terrorist threats ricardo was the most committed because he was religious youve had time to do some homework said molero i just met his sources partner who happened to be an old school friend of ricardos esperanza said molero nodding they were at school and university together she was going to become a nun before she met ricardo did they ever get together no ricardo was never interested in her did he have a girlfriend not that i know of esperanza told me that the relationship ricardo had with his source was based on a mutual respect for each others religion religion had something to do with it said molero but they were both against fanaticism too ricardo had a special understanding of fanatics why because hed been one himself said molero and falcon nodded him on he believed that it came from a profound desire to be good which interacted with a deep concern and constant worry about evil that was where the hatred came from hatred the fanatic in his deep desire for goodness is in constant fear of evil he begins to see evil all around him in what we think of as harmless decadence the fanatic sees the insidious encroachment of evil he begins to worry about everybody who is not pursuing good with the same zeal as himself after a while he tires of the pathetic weakness of others and his perception shifts he no longer sees them as misguided fools but rather as ministers of the devil which is when he starts to hate them from that moment he becomes a dangerous person because then he is someone receptive to extreme ideas ricardo had long conversations with botin who described a fundamental difference between catholicism and islam which was the book the koran is a direct transcription of the word of god by the prophet mohammed the word koran means recitation it is not like our bible a series of narratives laid down by remarkable men it is the actual word of god as taken down by the prophet ricardo used to ask us to imagine what that would be like to a fanatic the book was not the inspired writing of gifted human beings but the word of god in his desperation for goodness and his fear of evil the fanatic penetrates deeper and deeper into the word he seeks better more exactingly good interpretations of the word he works his way out by degrees to the extremes that was ricardos strength hed been a fanatic himself so he could give us an insight into the minds that we were up against but he wasnt a fanatic any more said falcon he said hed once reached the point where hed begun to look down on his fellow human beings and not just found them lacking but thought them subhuman in some way it was a form of intense religious arrogance he realized that once youve reached the point where you dont regard all humans as equals then killing them becomes less of a problem and had he reached that point hed been pulled back from it by a priest do you know who this priest was he died of cancer last september that must have been a blow i suppose it must have been he didnt talk to me about it i think that was too personal for office consumption said molero he worked harder he became a man with a mission and what was that mission to stop a terrorist attack before it happened rather than helping to catch the perpetrators after a lot of people have been killed said molero in fact last july was a bad time for ricardo the london bombings affected him very badly and then at the end of the month his priest was diagnosed with cancer six weeks later he was dead why did the london bombings affect him like that he was disturbed by the bombers profile young middleclass british citizens some with small children and all with family ties they werent loners that was when he became focused on the nature of fanaticism he developed his theories bouncing ideas off one friend the dying priest and the other the convert to islam so he would have taken this explosion as a personal failure that and the fact that it also took the life of miguel botin with whom hed developed a very close relationship hed just applied a second time for a bugging order we thought the refusal of the first was strange since the london bombings weve been told to look for the slightest change ofinflexion in a community and there was plenty going on in that mosque to justify a bug being placed thereaccording to ricardos source anyway do you think it had something to do with the department being under investigation ricardo did we didnt see the logic of it we just thought he was angry at being turned down you know how it is your brain plays tricks and you see conspiracies wherever you look he had a ticket in his back pocket for the archaeological museum which he must have visited in his lunch break today said falcon any thoughts about that apart from the fact that he didnt have to buy a ticket no would that be significant asked falcon was he the sort of person who would leave something like that as a sign i think youre reading too much into it he met somebody in his lunch break and then killed himself said falcon his mind wasnt made up before the meeting why would you bother to go if you were planning to kill yourself so something happened during this meeting to tip him over the edge to make him believe perhaps with his mind in an emotional turmoil that he was in some way responsible i cant think who that person could be or what they could possibly have said to him said molero what church did his friend the priest belong to its close thats why he took this apartment said molero san marcos did he still attend that church even after the priests death i dont know said molero we didnt see much of each other outside the office i only know about san marcos because i offered to go with him to his priests funeral mass to understand why gamero had committed suicide they needed to talk to the person hed met in the archaeological museum falcon asked barros to find out from the rest of the antiterrorism squad if theyd seen gamero with anybody they didnt recognize he also wanted all names and telephone numbers from gameros office line and in the meantime theyd check his mobile and the fixed line in his apartment barros gave him the mobile numbers of the other two officers in the antiterrorism squad and left with paco molero the instructing judge signed off the levantamiento del cadaver and gameros body was removed falcon and the two forensics felipe and jorge began a detailed search of the apartment we know he committed suicide said felipe all the doors were locked from the inside and the prints on the water glass next to the paracetamol trays match the bodys so what are we looking for anything that might give us a lead to the person he met in his lunch break said falcon a business card a scribbled number or an address a note of a meeting falcon sat at the table in the kitchen with gameros wallet and the museum ticket the tendons of his hands rippled under the cloudy membrane of the latex gloves he felt sure that there were connections to be made out there which he was just missing every lead they were pursuing failed to unfold into the greater narrative of what was going on there were movements like seismic aftershocks that brought about casualties such as ricardo gamero a man dedicated to his work and admired by his colleagues whod seenwhat his responsibility or was it just the recognition of his failure he teased out the contents of gameros wallet money credit cards id receipts restaurant cards atm extractsthe usual falcon called serrano and asked him to get the name and number of the priest of the san marcos church he went back to the wallet turning over the cards and receipts thinking that gamero was a man who was used to a high level of secrecy in his life vital phone numbers would not be written down or stored in his mobile but either memorized or encoded in some way he wouldnt have or couldnt have made contact with the person he saw in the museum on the day of the bomb his department was being watched and they were all being kept in the office he could have called at night after they were released from work he would probably have used a public phone the only chance was that he might not have remembered an infrequently used mobile number he turned over the last atm extract in the wallet nothing he thumped the table have you got anything out there asked falcon nothing said jorge the guys in the cgi hes not going to leave anything hanging around unless he wants us to find it a call came through from cristina ferrera she gave him the name and number of another spanish convert who would normally have been in the mosque at that time in the morning but had gone to granada on the monday evening he was now back in seville his name was jose duran a few minutes later serrano called with the name and number of the priest of the san marcos church falcon told him to stop what he was doing and come to calle butron pick up gameros id and take it to the archaeological museum where he should ask the ticket sellers and security guards if they remembered seeing gamero and anybody he might have met the priest couldnt see him until after evening mass at about pm it was already falcon couldnt believe the time the day almost gone and no significant breakthrough he called jose duran who was in the city centre they agreed to meet in the cafe alicantina vilar a big crowded pasteleria in the centre serrano still hadnt showed up falcon left the id with felipe and decided it was quicker to walk to the pasteleria than get stuck in evening traffic as he walked he put a call through to ramirez and gave him a quick report on ricardo gamero and told him hed stolen serrano for a few hours were not getting anywhere with these fucking electricians said ramirez all this manpower to find something that doesnt exist they do exist jose luis said falcon they just dont exist in the form we expect them to the whole world knows were looking for them and they havent come forward to me that means theyre sinister not everybody is a perfect citizen they might be frightened they probably dont want to get involved they couldnt care less they might be implicated said falcon so we have to find them because they are the link from the mosque to the outside world we have to find out how they fit into this scenario there were three of them for gods sake somebody somewhere knows something we need a breakthrough said ramirez everybodys making breakthroughs except us you found the biggest breakthrough of all jose luisthe peugeot partner and its contents we have to keep up the pressure and then things will start to give way said falcon and what are all these other breakthroughs elviras called a meeting for am tomorrow he cant talk until then but its international the webs spreading wider by the hour thats the way these things go now said falcon remember london they were rounding up suspects in pakistan inside a week but i tell you jose luis theres something homegrown about this too the intelligence services are equipped to deal with all that worldwide web of international terrorism what we do is find out what happened on our patch have you read the file on the unidentified body found at the dump on monday morning fuck no perez wrote a report on it and theres an autopsy in there too read it tonight well talk about it tomorrow the waiter brought him a coffee and some sort of sticky pastry envelope with puscoloured goo inside he needed sugar he had to wait half an hour for jose duran in which time he took calls from pablo of the cni mark flowers from the us consulate manuela comisario elvira and cristina ferrera he turned his mobile off too many of them wanted to see him tonight and he had no more time to give jose duran was pale and emaciated with hair plastered close to his head round glasses and a fluffy beard deodorant was a stranger to his body and it was still c outside falcon ordered him a camomile tea duran listened to falcons introduction and twizzled his beard into a point on his chin he breathed on his glasses and wiped them clean with his shirt tail he sipped his tea and gave falcon his own introduction hed been to the mosque every day of last week hed seen hammad and saoudi talking to the imam in his office on tuesday th may he hadnt heard their conversation hed seen the council inspectors on friday nd june they must have been from health and safety because they looked at everything water drains electricity they even looked at the quality of the doorssomething to do with fire said duran they told the imam he was going to have to get a new fuse box but he didnt have to do anything until they issued their report and then he had fifteen days to put it right and the fuse box blew on saturday night said falcon thats what the imam told us on sunday morning do you know when he called the electricians on the sunday morning after prayers how do you know that i was in his office how did he find their number miguel botin gave it to him miguel botin gave the imam the number of the electricians no he reminded the imam of the card hed given him earlier the imam started to search the papers on his desk and miguel gave him another card and told him that there was a mobile number he could call any time and that was when the imam called the electricians isnt this sort of detail just a bit ludicrous in the light of youve no idea how crucial this detail is jose just tell me the imam called them on his mobile they said theyd come round on monday morning and take a look and tell him how much it was going to cost i mean thats what i assume from the questions the imam was asking and you were there on monday morning the guy turned up at eight thirty took a look at the fuse box the guy was spanish yes description there was nothing to describe said duran searching amongst the empty tables and chairs he was an average guy about metres tall not heavy but not thin either dark hair with a side parting no facial hair there was nothing particular about him im sorry you dont have to try to tell me everything now but think about it call me if anything occurs to you said falcon giving him his card did the guy say hello to miguel botin duran blinked he had to think about that im not sure that miguel was there at that point and later when he turned up with the other guys thats right he needed help the imam wanted a socket in the storeroom and he had to cut a channel from the nearest junction box which was in the imams office said duran miguel was with him in the office i presume they said hello what about the other guys the labourerswere they spanish too no they spoke spanish but they werent spaniards they were from those eastern bloc countries you know romania or moldavia one of those places descriptions dont ask me that said duran running his hands down his face in frustration think about them jose said falcon call me its important and have you got the imams mobile phone number sevillewednesday th june hrs falcon called inspector jefe barros to see if anybody had searched miguel botins apartment nobody from the cgi had been there he called ramirez gave him botins address told him to get round there and look for the electricians card he called baena gave him the imams mobile number and told him to get the phone records he called esperanza miguels partner shed never heard of any friends of his who were electricians by the time hed made these calls he was at the doors of the iglesia de san marcos it wasnt quite pm he flicked through his messages to see if serrano had called he had at the museum theyd remembered ricardo gamero at the ticket desk two security guards had seen him speeding through rooms taking no notice of the exhibits a third security guard had seen gamero talking to a man in his sixties for some twenty minutes the guard was now at the jefatura with a police artist working up a sketch of the older man father roman was in his early forties he was out of the robes of office and in an ordinary dark suit with the jacket folded over his arm he was standing in the nave of the brick interior of the church talking to two women dressed in black on seeing falcon he excused himself from the conversation went over to shake hands and led him up to his office you look exhausted inspector jefe he said sitting at his desk the first days after something like this are always the longest said falcon my congregations have doubled since tuesday morning said father roman a surprising number of young people theyre confused they dont know when this will end or how it can possibly end not just young people said falcon but im sorry father i must press on of course you must said father roman you may know that one of your congregation committed suicide todayricardo gamero did you know him father roman blinked at the swift devastation of this news it left him dumb with shock im sorry i wasnt able to break it to you more gently said falcon he took his life this afternoon obviously you knew him i understand he was a very i met him when my predecessor was taken ill said father roman they were very close my predecessor had helped him resolve a number of issues to do with his faith how well did you know ricardo he didnt appear to be seeking the same sort of relationship with me as hed had with my predecessor did you know what these issues to do with his faith were that was between them ricardo hasnt spoken to me about them when was the last time you saw ricardo he was here on sunday for mass as always and you havent seen him since silence from father roman who looked as if he was coping with a distressing nausea sorry he said snapping out of it im just trying to think of the last time we spokeand if there was any indication that he was still troubled to the same extent as he had been in my predecessors time you didnt happen to see him today did you father no no not today he said distracted have you heard of a company called informaticalidad asked falcon should i have done asked father roman frowning they actively recruit personnel from amongst your congregation said falcon is that without your knowledge forgive me inspector jefe but i find it rather confusing the way this conversation has developed im feeling the pressure of your suspicion but im not sure about what its better just to answer the questions rather than trying to understand what theyre about this has become a very complicated situation said falcon have you ever met a man called diego torres its not such an unusual name he happens to be the human resources director at informaticalidad i dont always know the profession of the members of my congregation but you have someone of that name who attends this church yes said father roman squeezing it out like a splinter falcon went through the list of board members of informaticalidad four out of the ten were members of father romans congregation would you mind telling me what exactly is going on here said falcon nothing is going on here said father roman if as you say this company is using my church as an informal recruiting agency what can i do it is the nature of people that they will meet at a church and that there will be a social exchange quite possibly invitations are made and its conceivable that jobs might be offered just because the church seems to have less influence in society doesnt mean that some churches dont perform in the way that they used to falcon nodded hed overreached himself in his excitement at finally realizing a connection only to find it a little too loose did you know ricardo gameros profession i knew from my predecessor that he was a member of the police force but i have no idea what he does or rather did was he a member of your squad he was an agent with the cgi specifically the antiterrorism group said falcon islamic terrorism i doubt that was something he talked to many people about said father roman did you happen to notice if he mixed with any of the people i mentioned who worked for informaticalidad im sure he would have done when people leave church they go to the two cafes around the corner they socialize did you notice regular meetings father roman shook his head falcon sat back he needed more ammunition for this conversation he was tired too the flight to casablanca and back seemed to have been from a month ago the fullness of every minute with not only his own findings but the ramifications of concurrent investigations under the colossal concentration of manpower rolling out all over spain europe and the world made hours feel like days were you aware that informaticalidad not only used your church but two others inside the old city for the same purpose said falcon look inspector jefe its quite possible that this company has an unspoken employment policy of only taking on practising catholics i dont know these days i believe youre not allowed to ask a recruitment agency to discriminate on your behalf what would you do they do have an unspoken employment policy said falcon they dont take on any women i suppose thats not dissimilar to the catholic church on the walk back to his car falcon called ramirez who was still searching miguel botins apartment were not getting anywhere here said ramirez i dont know what it is about this place but were sure somebodys been around here before us its a bit tidy weve turned the place upside down and were going through his library now i have a witness who saw him give a card to the imam maybe theyre still with him in his bag under the rubble what state was the bombsite in when you last saw it the heavy work is over the crane has gone theyre working by hand now with just a couple of tippers standing by theyve put scaffolding up and sheeted off the remaining rubble about six teams of forensics are ready to go in they reckon theyll get into the mosque itself by midmorning tomorrow when youve finished at botins apartment let everybody go home and get some sleep said falcon its going to be another big day tomorrow have you seen juez calderon only on television said ramirez hes been giving a press conference with comisario lobo and comisario elvira anything we should know theres a job waiting for juez calderon as a chatshow host if he gets bored of being a judge so hes not telling them anything but it looks as if he is exactly said ramirez and given that weve come up with fuckall today hes making us sound like heroes the drive back home was eerily quiet at nearly pm the streets should have been alive and the bars full of people a lot of places were closed there was so little traffic falcon went through the centre of town only a few young people had gathered in the plaza del museo under the trees the mood was sombre and the narrow streets tense with anxiety an investigation of his fridge revealed some cooked prawns and a fresh swordfish steak he ate the prawns with mayonnaise while drinking a beer direct from the bottle he fried up the fish squeezed some lemon over it poured himself a glass of white rioja and ate his mind picking over the detail of the day he went over the dialogue with father roman had the priest been trying to avoid the sin of lying by omission evasion and ducking the question it felt like it he poured himself another glass of white wine pushed back his plate and folded his arms and had just started to contemplate the big event of the daythe suicide of ricardo gamero when his first visitor arrived pablo had come on business he refused a beer and they went into the study you mentioned yacoub had some conditions before you fell asleep on the plane this morning said pablo the first condition is that he will only talk or deal with me said falcon he wont meet any other agents or take phone calls from anyone but me thats quite normal except of course youll be in different countries ill talk you through the communication procedure later but it wont exactly be direct contact said pablo it puts you under a lot of pressure he also says hes not making a lifelong commitment said falcon thats understandable said pablo but you know spying can have an addictive effect on certain personalities like juan said falcon he looks like a man with a few secrets as if hes running two families that dont know about each other he does he has his wife and two kids and the cni and they dont know anything about each other keep going with the conditions yacoub will not give us any information that could jeopardize the life of any of his family members said falcon that was to be expected said pablo but does he suspect any of his family members he says not but theyre all devout muslims and they lead very different lives to him said falcon it could be that he finds out that they are closely involved or at some remove but he will not be an instrument in their downfall if they are these people have totally accepted him as one of their own and he wont give them up anything else asked pablo my problem yacoub doesnt have any training for this work most spies dont they just happen to be in a position where information comes their way you make it sound easy its only dangerous if youre careless falcon had to raise his concentration levels to take in pablos briefing about the method of communication with yacoub he got him to boil it down to the basics which were they would communicate via email using a secure website run by the cni both falcon and diouri would have to load their computers with different encryption software the emails would go to the cni website to be decrypted and passed on the cni would obviously see all emails and make their recommendations for action all falcon had to do this evening was to call yacoub and tell him to go to the shop in rabat and pick up a couple of books these books would give yacoub all the information he needed falcon made the call and kept it short saying he was tired weve got to get him working as soon as possible said pablo this whole thing is moving fast what whole thing the game the plan the operation said pablo were not sure which all we know is that since the bomb went off yesterday the level of encrypted emails on the web has gone up fivefold and how many of those encrypted emails can you read not many so you havent cracked the code from the koran found in the peugeot partner not yet weve got the worlds best mathematicians working on it though what do the cni make of ricardo gameros suicide asked falcon inevitably were thinking that he was the mole said pablo but thats just a theory were trying to work up the logic around it if he was the mole from what i know about him id find it hard to believe he was passing information to an islamic terrorist movement right but what about miguel botin what do you know about him that his brother was maimed in the madrid train bombings giving him good reason to be operating against islamic terrorism said falcon that his girlfriend was a school friend of gamero who remains a devout catholic having so far been reluctant to convert to islam and it was botin who followed the imam and took shots of hammad and saoudi and these other two mystery men which he handed over to the cgi he was also prompting gamero to get the imams office bugged thats about it he doesnt sound like a promising candidate as a terrorist does he have you searched botins apartment asked falcon pablo cradled his knee nodded what did you find there i cant say but you found something that makes you think botin was acting for the terrorists while working for gamero this is what its like javier said pablo shrugging the hall of mirrors we constantly have to revise what were actually seeing you found another heavily annotated copy of the koran didnt you said falcon sitting back dazed what the hell does that mean it means you cannot say a word about this conversation to anybody said pablo it means we have to get our counterintelligence up and running as soon as possible but it also means that the terrorists whoever they are were letting miguel botin serve up information to the cgi that compromised the imam hammad and saoudi along with whatever operation was being planned in the mosque were still conducting our enquiries said pablo they were sacrificing them asked falcon nauseated by his inability to think his way around this new development first of all we live in an age of suicide bombingtheres sacrifice for you said pablo and secondly intelligence services all over the world have always had to sacrifice agents for the greater good of the mission its nothing new so this electrician whose card miguel botin handed over to the imam was the agent of their destruction the electrician was sent by botins islamic terrorist masters to bomb the building thats just fantastic we dont know that said pablo but as you know not all suicide bombers realize that they are suicide bombers some have just been told to deliver a car or leave a rucksack on a train botin had just been told to give an electricians card to the imam what we need to find out is who told him to do that are we wasting our time here asked falcon is this whole investigation just a show for whichever terrorist group decided to abort their mission and blow up any possible leads back to their network were still very interested to find out whats in the mosque said pablo and were very keen to get yacoub up and running and how do you know that yacoub is approaching the right group even asked falcon exhausted and close to rage from frustration we have confidence in that because it has come from a reliable detainee and has also been verified by british agents on the ground in rabat said pablo what group are we talking about the gicm groupe islamique de combattants marocains otherwise known as the moroccan islamic combatant group they had links to the bombings in casablanca madrid and london said pablo what were doing here is not something that was thought up yesterday as an idea worth trying javier this represents months of intelligence work pablo left soon after falcon was almost depressed by their exchange all the manhours put in by his squad were beginning to look like a waste of energy and yet there were unnerving gaps in what pablo had told him it was as if each group involved in the investigation put most trust in the information that they themselves uncovered so the cni believed in the annotated koran as the codebook because of the example of the book of proof uncovered by british intelligence and that coloured everything they looked at the fact that the witness in the mosque jose duran had described the electrician and his labourers as a spaniard and two eastern bloc natives who did not sound anything like islamic terrorist operatives held little water for pablo but then again it had been local spanish petty criminals whod supplied the madrid bombers with explosives and what does it take to leave a bomb a little care and a psychotic mind after the press conference on tve with comisarios lobo and elvira juez calderon had taken a taxi round to canal sur where he was miked up and eased on to the set of a roundtable discussion about islamic terrorism he was the man of the hour and within moments the female chair of the programme had drawn him into the discussion he controlled the rest of the programme with a combination of incisive and informed comment humour and a savage wit he reserved for socalled security specialists and terrorism pundits afterwards he was taken out to dinner by some executives from canal surs current affairs department and the female chair of the programme they fed and flattered him for an hour and a half until he found himself alone with the female chair who let it be known that this could continue in more comfortable surroundings for once calderon demurred he was tired there was another long day ahead of him andthe main reasonhe was sure that marisa was a better lay calderon sat in the middle seat in the back of the canal sur limousine he felt like a hero his mind was racing with endorphins after his tv performances he had a sense of the world at his feet seville as it flashed past in the night began to feel small to him he imagined what it must be like to be as high on success as this in a city like new york where they really knew how to make a man feel important the limousine dropped him off outside the san marcos church at am and for once rather than take his usual little deviation around the back he strode past the bars on the other side hoping that friends of ines would be drinking there who would stop him and congratulate him he really had been exceptionally brilliant the bars however were already closed calderon in his heightened state had failed to notice how quiet the city was as he went up in the lift he knew that the only way he was going to sleep was after a strenuous crazy fuck with marisa out on the balcony in the hall going down in the lift out in the street he felt so on top of the world he wanted everybody to see him performing marisa had watched the tv programmes in a state of insensate boredom she could tell that the press conference revolved around esteban as all the questions from journalists were for him she could also see that he was controlling the roundtable discussion and even that the female chair was dying to get into his trousers but the drivel that was being talked had reduced her to a vegetative state why do westerners have to get so exercised about things and talk them to death as if its going to be any help then it struck her that was what irked her about westerners they always took things at face value because that was what could be controlled and what could be measured they just served up their lies all round and then congratulated each other on their command of the situation that was why white people bored her they had no interest beyond the surface what are you doing sitting there all day marisa had been the most frequently asked question shed faced in america and yet in africa theyd never asked her that questionor any question for that matter questioning existence didnt help you live it she looked down on calderons arrival from her balcony she saw his jaunty steps his little preparations when he said his usual its me into her entry phone she replied my hero he burst into her apartment like a showman arms raised waiting for the applause he drew her to him and kissed her pushing his tongue between the barrier of her teeth which she did not like their kissing had only ever been lip deep it wasnt difficult to tell that he was still on the crest of the media wave she let him drive her out on to the balcony where they had sex he looked up at the stars holding on to her hips imagining even greater glory she participated by hanging on to the railings and making a suitable amount of noise as soon as he was finished he was rendered mentally and physically drained like someone coming off a coke high she managed to steer him to the bed and get his shoes off before he fell into a deep sleep at am she stood over him smoking a cigarette wondering if shed be able to wake him in a couple of hours time she washed herself in the bidet closing her right eye to the smoke rising from the cigarette she lay on the sofa and let time do what it was good at at am she started trying to rouse him but he was completely inert she held a lighter to his foot he writhed and kicked out it took time to get him to come round he had no idea where he was she explained that he had to go home he had an early start he had to get changed at she called a taxi she put his shoes on got him standing put his arms into his jacket and called the lift up to her floor she stood outside with him his head dropping and jerking off his chest and her shoulder the taxi arrived just after she put him in the back and instructed the driver to take him to calle san vicente she said he was exhausted that he was the leading judge in the seville bombing and that gave the driver a sense of mission he waved away her note for this man it was going to be free the cab pulled away calderon had his head thrown back on the rear shelf in the yellowish street lighting he looked as he would when dead the whites of his eyes were just visible below the lids at that time of the morning with seville as silent as a ghost city there was no traffic and the cab arrived at calle san vicente in just under ten minutes after much cajoling the cab driver had to reach in and physically haul calderon out into the street he walked him to the front door of the building and asked him for his keys the driver got the door open and realized he was going to have to go all the way they crammed themselves into the hall is there a light asked the driver calderon slapped at the wall light burst into the hall and the ticking sound of a timer started up the driver supported him up the stairs this one here said calderon as they reached the first floor the driver opened the apartment door which was double locked and returned the keys to calderon are you all right now he asked looking into the judges bleary eyes yeah im fine now ill be ok thanks he said youre doing a great job said the driver i saw you on the telly before i started my shift calderon clapped him on the shoulder the driver went down the stairs and the light in the hall went out with a loud snap the cab started up and pulled away calderon rolled over the doorjamb into the apartment the light was on in the kitchen he shut the door leaned back on it even in his exhausted state with his eyelids as heavy as lead his teeth clenched with irritation sevillethursday th june hrs calderon came to with a start that thumped his head into the wall his face was pressed against the wooden floor the smell of polish was strong in his nose his eyelids snapped open he was instantly wide awake as if danger was present and near he was still dressed as he had been all day he couldnt understand why he was lying in the corridor of his apartment had he been so exhausted that hed slept where he fell he checked his watch just gone four oclock hed only been out for ten minutes or so he was mystified he remembered coming into the apartment and the light being on in the kitchen it was still on but he was beyond it now further into the flat which appeared to be completely dark and cold from the air conditioning he struggled to his feet checked himself he wasnt hurt hadnt even banged his head he must have slid down the wall ines he said out loud puzzled by the kitchen light calderon stretched his shoulders back he was stiff he stepped into the rhomboid of light on the corridor floor he saw the blood first a huge burgeoning crimson pool on the white marble the colour of it under the bright white light was truly alarming he stepped back as if expecting an intruder still to be there he lowered himself and saw her through the chair and table he knew immediately that she was dead her eyes were wide open with not a scintilla of light in them the blood had spread to the right side of the table and underneath it it was viscous and seemed to be sucking at the chair and table legs it was so horribly bright that it throbbed in his vision as if there was still life in it calderon crawled on all fours round to the left of the table to where iness feet lay slack and pointed outwards in front of the sink her nightie was rucked up his eyes travelled from her white legs over her white cotton panties beyond the waistbandand that was where the bruising started he hadnt seen it before hed had no idea his fists had accomplished such horrifically visible damage and it was then that he thought he might have seen this before after all because his whole body was suddenly consumed with a remembered panic that seemed to constrict his throat and cut off the blood supply to his brain he reared back on his knees and held his head he crawled back out of the kitchen and got to his feet in the corridor he went swiftly out of the apartment which required him to unlock the door he hit the stair light looked around and went back in the light was still on in the kitchen ines was still lying there the blood was now one floor tiles width from the wooden floor of the corridor he pressed the balls of his palms into his eye sockets and ripped them away but it made no difference to the horror of what lay before him he dropped to all fours again you fucking bitch you stupid fucking bitch he said look what the fuck youve gone and done now the noisily bright blood resounded in the hard kitchen it was also moving consuming the white marble reaching towards him he went back around the table the ghastly purple of the contusions seemed to have deepened in colour in the interim or his constant toing and froing in and out of the light was playing tricks between her splayed thighs he now saw the welts from his belt lashing he sank to his knees again pressed his fists into his eyes and started sobbing this was it this was the end he was finished finished finished even the most incompetent state judge couldnt fail to make a watertight case against him a wifebeater whod gone a step too far a wifebeater whod just come back from fucking his mistress had another confrontation and this timeoh yes it might have been an accident was it an accident it probably was but this time hed overdone it and shed smashed her stupid head open he pounded the table it cleared as suddenly as it had arrived calderon sank back on his heels and realized that the terrible panic had gone his mind was back on track at least he felt it was back on track what he hadnt realized was the nature of the damage done by the panic the way it had opened up electronic pathways to the flaws in his character as far as calderon was concerned his mind was back to the steeltrap clarity of the leading judge in seville and it came to him that with no chest freezer the only solution was to get her out of the apartment and he had to do it now there was just over an hour before dawn weight was not the problem ines was currently kilos her height at m was more of a difficulty he stormed around the table and into the spare room where the luggage was kept he pulled out the biggest suitcase he could find a huge grey samsonite with four wheels he grabbed two white towels from the cupboard one of the towels he laid across the kitchen doorway to stop the blood from seeping into the corridor the other he wrapped around iness head it nearly made him sick the back of her head was a flat mush and the blood soaked gratefully into the towel consuming the whiteness with its incarnadine stain he found a bin liner and pulled it over her head securing it with cooking string he washed his hands he put the case on the table picked ines up and laid her in it she was far too big even foetally she didnt fit he couldnt cram her feet in and even if he could her shoulders were too broad for the case to shut he looked down on her with his considerable intellect surging forward but fatally in the wrong direction ill have to cut her up he said to himself take her feet off and break her collar bones no that was not going to work hed seen films and read novels where they cut up bodies and it never seemed to work even in fiction where everything can be made to bloody work he was squeamish too couldnt even watch extreme makeover on tv without writhing on the sofa think again he walked around the apartment looking at everyday objects in a completely new light he stopped in the living room and stared at the carpet as if willing it not to be the cliche of all cliches you cant wrap her up in the carpet itll come straight back to you same with the luggage think again the river was only three hundred metres from calle san vicente all he had to do was get her in the car drive fifty metres turn right on calle alfonso xii go straight up to the traffic lights cross calle nuevo torneo and there was a road he remembered as quite dark which ran down to the river and veered left behind the huge bus station of plaza de armas from there it was a matter of metres to the waters edge but it was a stretch used by earlymorning runners so he would have to act quickly and decisively the decorators the memory of his irritation at them leaving their sheet up the stairs a few days ago juddered into his brain he ran out of the apartment again slashed on the stairwell light and stopped himself he put the apartment door on the latch that would be too much to bear locked out of his apartment with his dead wife on the kitchen floor he leapt down the stairs three at a time and there it all was under the stairs there were even full cans of paint to weigh down the body he pulled out a length of paintspattered hessian sheeting he sprinted back up the stairs and laid it out on the clean half of the kitchen floor he lifted her out of the suitcase where shed been lying like a prop in an illusionists trick and laid her on the sheet he folded the edges over he gasped at the momentary peak of horror at what he was doing iness beautiful face reduced to a scarecrows stuffed bin liner the blood had reached the towel across the doorway and he had to leap over it he crashed with the deranged heaviness of a toppled wardrobe into the corridor cracking his head and shoulder a glancing blow on the wall he shrugged off the pain he went into his study tore open the drawers found the roll of packing tape he kissed it on the way back he steadied himself and hopped more carefully over the bloodsoaked towel he wrapped the tape around her ankles knees waist chest neck and head he pocketed the cooking string and tape he didnt bother to admire his mummified wife but ran out of the apartment grabbing his keys and the garage remote as he left he took the door off the latch slapped the fucking light on againtick tick tick tick tickand rumbled down the stairs he sprinted down calle san vicente to the garage which was just around the corner he hit the button of the remote as he rounded the bend and the garage door opened but so slowly he was jumping up and down in towering frustration swearing and punching at the air he rolled underneath the quarteropen door and hurtled down the ramp pressing another button on the remote for the light he found his car he hadnt driven the damn thing for weeks who needs a car in seville thank fuck ive got a car no mistakes he reversed out calmly as if suddenly on betablockers he eased up the ramp the garage door was only just fully open the car hopped out on to the street which was deadly quiet the red digits on the dashboard told him it was he pulled up outside the apartment clicked the button to open the boot he sprinted upstairs in the dark this time fell and cracked his shin such a blow on the top stair that the pain ricocheted up his skeleton to the inside of his skull he didnt even stop he unlocked the door slowed down at the kitchen and stepped over the bloody towel ines no not ines any more he picked her up she was absurdly heavy for someone who was less than fifty kilos and had lost at least three kilos of blood he got her into the corridor but she was too heavy to cradlecarry her he hoisted her over his shoulder and closed the apartment door he stepped carefully down the stairs in the dark again that fucking tick tick tick of the light just too unbearably stressful at this stage he stuck his head out into the street empty two steps in the boot shut the boot close the apartment building door wait slow down think the tins of paint to weigh down the body open the boot back under the stairs pick up the two cans of paint as heavy as ines heave them into the boot close the boot in the car rearview mirror no headlights calm nice and slow youre nearly there this is going to work calderons car was alone at the traffic lights by the plaza de armas which were showing red the lights from the dash glowed in his face he checked the rearview again saw his eyes they were pitiful the lights changed to green he eased across the six empty lanes and took the ramp down to the river it was first light it wasnt quite as dark as he would have liked down by the river he would have preferred something subterranean as black as antimatter as utterly lightless as a collapsed star there was still plenty to do he had to get the body out attach the cans of paint and push it into the river he had a good long look around until he couldnt believe that everything wasnt moving he shook the paranoia out of his mind opened the boot he lifted the body out and laid it down on the pavement close to the car for cover he heaved out the cans of paint with superhuman strength sweat cascaded his shirt was stuck to him his mind closed off this was the home stretch get it done he didnt see the man at the back of the bus station was not aware of him making his fatal call to the police he worked with savage haste while the man muttered what he was seeing into his mobile phone along with calderons registration number with no traffic it took less than a minute for a patrol car to arrive it had been cruising down by the river less than a kilometre away when the two officers were notified by the communications centre in the jefatura the car rolled down the ramp towards the river with its headlights and engine switched off only calderons car was visible he was kneeling behind it taping the second can of paint to iness neck his sweat was dripping on to the hessian sheet he was finished all he had to do now was hump close to kilos about a metre across the pavement and then up over a low wall and into the water he summoned his last reserves of strength with the two paint cans attached the body had become incredibly unwieldy he jammed his hands underneath not caring about the skin he tore from his fingers and knuckles he drove forward with his thighs and with his chest and pelvis close to the floor he looked like an enormous lizard with some unmanageable prey iness body shifted and thumped into the low wall he was panting and sobbing tears streamed down his face the pain from his stubbed fingers and torn nails didnt register but when the headlights of the patrol car finally came on and he found himself encased in light like an exhibit in the reptile house he stiffened as if hed just been shot the policemen got out of the patrol car with their weapons drawn calderon had yanked his arms out from under the body rolled over and was now lying on his back his stomach convulsed with each racking sob a lot of the emotion he was coughing up was relief it was all over hed been caught all that hideous desperation had flowed out of him and now he could relax into infamy and shame while one patrolman stood over the sobbing calderon the other ran a torch over the tapedup hessian sheet he put on some latex gloves and squeezed iness shoulder just to confirm what he already knew that this was a body he went back to the patrol car and radioed the jefatura this is alpha were down by the river now just off the torneo at the back of the bus station in plaza de armas i can confirm that we have a male in his early forties attempting to dispose of an unidentified body youd better get the inspector jefe de homicidios down here give me the car registration number se ht fuck me what thats the same number given to me by the guy who reported the incident i dont fucking believe this whos the owner of the vehicle dont you recognize him the patrolman called out to his colleague who passed a torch over calderons face he was barely recognizable as human let alone a specific person his face bore the contortions of a particularly agonized flamenco singer the patrolman shrugged no idea the patrolman said into the radio how about juez esteban calderon said the operator fuck said the patrolman and dropped the mouthpiece he shone his own torch in the mans face grabbed him by the chin to hold him still calderons agony slackened off with surprise the patrolman let a sly grin spread across his face before he went back to the car falcon had to claw his way out of sleep like an abandoned potholer desperately trying to reach a star of light in a firmament of blackness he came to with a jerk and grunt of disgust as if hed been spewed up by his own bed the bedside light hurt him the green digits on his clock told him it was he grappled with the phone and sank back into his pillow with it clasped to his ear the voice was of the duty officer in the communications centre of the jefatura he was babbling he was speaking so fast and with such a heavy andaluz accent that falcon only picked up the first syllable of every other word he stopped him got him to start again from the top we have a situation down by the bus station at the plaza de armas behind the bus station down by the river near the puente de chapina a man has been apprehended attempting to dispose of a body we have a positive identification of the owner of the vehicle used to bring the body to that point and we have a positive id of the man who was attempting to dispose of the body and the mans name inspector jefe isesteban calderon falcons leg spasmed as if some high voltage had shot up it in one movement he was out of bed and pacing the floor esteban calderon the judge are you positive we are now the patrolman at the scene has checked the id and read the number back to me that and the cars registration confirm the man as esteban calderon have you spoken to anyone about this not yet inspector jefe have you called the juez de guardia no youre the first person i should have how was the incident reported an anonymous phone call from a guy who said he was walking his dog down by the river what time it was timed at am is that when people walk their dogs old people who cant sleep do especially in this heat how did he report it he called in on his mobile told me what he was seeing gave me the registration number and hung up name and address didnt have time to ask him dont talk to anyone about this said falcon call the patrolmen and tell them there is to be radio silence on this matter until ive spoken to comisario elvira the bedroom seemed to fill up with the catastrophe of scandal falcon went out on to the gallery overlooking the patio the morning was warm he felt sick he called elvira gave him some seconds to wake up and then told him the news in the most measured tone he could muster falcon broke the ensuing silence himself by telling elvira how many people at this point knew what had taken place we have to get him the body and the car off the street as soon as possible whatever happens said elvira and we need a judge and a medico forense to do that juez romero is reliable and neither a friend nor enemy of esteban calderon this mustnt look like a coverup said elvira almost to himself this isnt something that can be covered up said falcon we have to do things absolutely by the book the investigation might have to be taken off your hands given esteban calderons status i think it better for me to initiate the proceedings said falcon lets go for normal procedure but nobody absolutely nobody is to talk about this we must have no leaks until we can get a press statement together ill speak to comisario lobo tell the communications officer to make the usual calls but not under any circumstances to inform the press if it gets out before were ready therell be hell to pay the only person we cant control is the anonymous caller who reported the incident said falcon well he shouldnt know who it was he was reporting should he said elvira this was too big a scandal to contain elvira was asking too much this was going to come sweating out of the jefatura walls falcon called the communications centre gave the instructions and asked the officer to call felipe and jorge to the crime scene he showered standing under the drilling water trying to think of any plausible innocent explanation for calderon being discovered down by the river with a dead body it was and the dawn was well advanced by the time he walked across the plaza de armas to the incident the traffic on the torneo was still very light a patrol car had parked at the top of the ramp and some cones had been put out to stop any traffic from turning down the road the duty judge was already at the scene as was a police photographer who was taking some shots jorge and felipe arrived and were allowed down the ramp there was no sign of calderon two patrolmen were making sure no earlymorning joggers came past the scene along the riverbank the duty judge told falcon that calderon was sitting in the back of the patrol car with one of the policemen whod first come across the incident were just waiting for a medico forense to arrive and inspect the body a set of tyres squeaked at the top of the ramp and a car rolled down and parked up the medico forense got out with his bag he was already dressed in a white hooded boiler suit and had a mask hanging from his neck he shook hands put on gloves and they proceeded to the body an ambulance arrived with no siren or flashing lights the medico forense used a scalpel to cut the tape wrapped around the body he worked from the feet up to the head he laid open the hessian sheet the head wrapped in the black bin liner looked sinister as if the body had been the subject of some sexual deviancy falcon started to feel dizzy the medico forense murmured into his dictaphone about the heavy bruising on the torso he put his scalpel through the cooking string at the neck of the body and eased away the bin liner a darkening at the edges of his vision made falcon clutch at the duty judges sleeve are you all right inspector jefe he asked under the bin liner the head was wrapped in a towel the front was white with blood smears over it the medico forense lifted up one corner of the towel and folded it back the outline of the face was visible as under a shroud he pulled away the other corner of the towel and falcon dropped unconscious to the floor with the features of his exwife imprinted on his retina falcon came to on the ground the duty judge had managed to catch him and break his fall the paramedics from the ambulance were over him he heard the duty judge above their heads hes in shock this is his exwife he shouldnt really be here the paramedics helped him up the medico forense continued to murmur into his dictaphone he checked the thermometer made a calculation and muttered the time of death tears welled up as falcon looked down once more on iness inert body this was a scene from her life that hed never imaginedher death over the years hed done a lot of thinking and talking about ines hed relived their life together ten times over until hed nearly driven alicia aguado insane hed only been able to get rid of her permanent occupation of his mind by finally seeing her for what she was and realizing how badly shed behaved and treated him but this was not how it should have ended no amount of selfishness deserved this the paramedics moved him away from the body and got him sitting on the low wall by the river away from where the medico forense was working falcon breathed deeply the duty judge came over you cant handle this case he said ill call comisario elvira said falcon nodding hell appoint somebody from the outside my entire squad is an interested party elvira was speechless until he finally managed to come up with his condolences the catastrophe was so much worse than hed imagined and as he spoke first to falcon and then the duty judge the hideousness of the morning press conference began to spread like a malignancy through his innards the duty judge finished the call and handed the mobile back to falcon they shook hands falcon took one last look at the body her face was perfect and undamaged he shook his head in disbelief and had an image from years ago when hed come across ines in the street shed been laughing laughing so hard that she was doubled up with her hair flung forward staggering backwards on her high heels he turned away and left the scene he walked past the patrol car where calderon was being held the door was open the radio squawked calderons wrists were cuffed his torn and bleeding hands lay in his lap he stared straight ahead and his vision did not deviate even when falcon leaned in esteban said falcon calderon turned to him and said the sentence that falcon had heard more times from the mouths of murderers than any other i didnt do it sevillethursday th june hrs the classroom in the preschool had been reglazed and new blinds put up the air conditioners were already working full blast which was the only way to keep the sulphurous stink of the corrupted bodies still in the destroyed apartment building at a bearable level it was already past eight oclock and still comisario elvira had not arrived everybody was tired but there was a buzz of expectation in the room somethings happened said ramirez and ive got the feeling its something big what do you think javier falcon couldnt speak wheres juez calderon said ramirez thats what makes me think its big hes the man for the press conference falcon nodded appalled to silence by what hed seen down by the river the door opened and elvira came in and made his way to the blackboard at the far end of the room followed by three men already present at the meeting were pablo and gregorio from the cni inspector jefe ramon barros and one of his senior officers from the antiterrorist squad of the cgi and falcon and ramirez from the homicide squad elvira turned his face was grim theres no easy way to put this he said so im just going to give you the facts at around six oclock this morning juez esteban calderon was placed under arrest on suspicion of murdering his wife two patrolmen found him earlier this morning attempting to dispose of his wifes body in the guadalquivir given these circumstances he will no longer be acting as the juez de instruccion in our investigation it will also be impossible for our own homicide squad to conduct the murder enquiry which will be carried out by these three officers from madrid led by inspector jefe luis zorrita thank you the three homicide officers from madrid nodded and filed out of the room stopping briefly to introduce themselves and shake hands with falcon and ramirez the door closed elvira resumed the meeting ramirez stared at falcon in a state of shock we have decided to appoint a juez de instruccion from outside seville said elvira and juez sergio del rey is on his way down from madrid now on his arrival an announcement will be made to the press at a conference to be held in the andalucian parliament building and until that time i would ask you to keep this information to yourselves following the suicide yesterday of ricardo gamero of the cgi there have been some major developments and the cni will now explain these to us something had been sucked out of elviras face overnight the staggering import of his announcements had left him haggard he sat back in the teachers chair inanimate with his chin resting on his fist as if his head needed that sort of support to keep it in place pablo made his way to the front just prior to the suicide of the cgi agent ricardo gamero we had received information from british intelligence that they had successfully identified the other two men photographed by gameros source miguel botin these two men are of afghan nationality living in rome they were known to mi because they were arrested in london two weeks after the failed st july bombings and held for questioning under the terrorism act they were released without being charged the british were not able to establish what these men were doing in london at the time other than that they were visiting family the known addresses of these two men in rome were raided by the italian police last night and found to be empty their current whereabouts is unknown what concerns us about these suspects is that they are believed to have connections to the high command of alqaeda in afghanistan and are believed by the british to have forged links with the gicm in morocco in the last year they are known to have visited the uk belgium france italy spain and morocco all these countries are believed to have gicm sleeper cells there is considerable intelligence work still to be done to ascertain miguel botins role imam abdelkrim benabouras relationship to these two men and their involvement with what has happened here in seville after ricardo gameros suicide we conducted a search of miguel botins apartment and discovered a heavily annotated copy of the koran which matches the edition found in the peugeot partner driven by hammad and saoudi large chunks of the notes are exact transcripts and we believe that this is a codebook it is now thought that as each sleeper cell is activated they are issued with a new codebook which they use until their mission is complete the significance of finding this copy of the koran in miguel botins apartment is that it could mean that ricardo gameros source was a double working with the cgi and operating for a terrorist cell this throws considerable confusion into the current investigation because it would mean that the only intelligence botin was communicating to gamero was what his commanders wanted us to know this would mean that hammad and saoudi the two afghans and the imam were all expendable there is one final confusing detail about botins actions in this scenario as you know a great deal of manpower has been spent trying to find the fake council inspectors and the electricians inspector jefe falcon has found a witness who was in the mosque on the sunday morning after the fuse box blew on the saturday night this witness saw botin give the electricians card to the imam and he watched as the imam called the number and made the appointment inspector jefe barros has informed us that this was not something sanctioned by him or anyone in his department the cgi was still waiting for authorization to bug the mosque we now have to examine the possibility that the council inspectors and the electricians were members of or in the pay of a terrorist cell it could beand we might only have a chance of verifying this when the forensics have reached the mosquethat the council inspectors laid a device to blow the fuse box and that the electricians were brought in to set a bomb that would wipe out the imam hammad and saoudi and botin himself there seems to be a break in the logic chain of that scenario said barros it might just be believable that botin was the unwitting agent of their destruction but i dont see any terrorist commander allowing that quantity of hexogen brought into this country at what one imagines was considerable risk and expense to be destroyed the electricians and council inspectors would constitute a type of terrorist cell weve never come across before too said falcon the witness said they were a spaniard and two eastern europeans and how does ricardo gameros suicide fit into this scenario asked barros a profound sense of failure at his inability to prevent this atrocity said pablo we understand that he took his work very seriously silence while everybody wrestled with the cnis possible scenario falcon snapped out of his shocked state and burned with his theory that too much weight was being attached to the copy of the koran as a codebook but it was impossible to understand how two identical copies could have ended up in the peugeot partner and botins apartment why do you think this cell selfdestructed asked barros we can only think that it was a spectacular diversionary tactic to occupy our domestic investigating teams and all european intelligence services while they plan and carry out an attack elsewhere said pablo if botin was a double agent his terrorist masters would have known that the mosque was under suspicion they fed that suspicion further by bringing in the hexogen and hammad and saoudi two known logistics men they then blew it up they dont mind theyre all going to paradise whether as successful bombers or magnificent decoys what about the afghans asked barros theyve been identified but not exactly sacrificed perhaps botin intended the shot of the two afghans to be interpreted by us as an indication of an attack planned for italy botin supplied those photographs when he was a trusted cgi source so another diversionary tactic the italians danish and belgians are all on red alert as they were after the london bombings so this letter sent to the abc with the abdullah azzam text and all the media references to milawas that all part of this grand diversion asked barros nearly enjoying himself at being able to finally needle the cni who had so humiliated him and his department what were working on now is the real target said pablo the abdullah azzam text and the idea of mila are powerful tools of terror they inspire fear in a population we see this as part of the escalation of this particular brand of terrorism we are fighting the equivalent of a mutating virus no sooner do we find one cure than it adapts to it with renewed lethal strength there is no model only after we have sustained attacks do we become aware of a modus operandi the intelligence gathered from the hundreds of people interviewed after the madrid and london bombings is no help to us now we are not talking about an integrated organization with a defined structure but more of a satellite organization with a fluid structure and total flexibility are you sure youre not reading too much into the diversionary tactic said elvira after the madrid bombings were pretty sure that eta provided the diversion which led to the devastating success of the madrid bombings we dont think it was a coincidence that kilometres southeast of madrid the guardia civil stopped a van driven by two eta incompetents and loaded with kilos of titadine for delivery to madrid and on the same day kilometres away in aviles three moroccan terrorists were taking delivery of the kilos of goma eco used on the madrid trains said pablo british security forces and intelligence were focused on an attack on the g summit in edinburgh when suicide bombers blew themselves up on the london underground all right so there is a history of diversion said elvira and a diversion that is prepared to sacrifice kilos of titadine said pablo looking pointedly at barros the reality said elvira is that we have no idea who we are dealing with most of the time we call them alqaeda because it helps us to sleep at night but we seem to have come up against a very pure form of terrorism whose goal is to attack our way of life and decadent values at whatever cost there even seems to be competition between these disparate groups to think up and carry out the most devastating attack possible this is what were concerned about here said pablo enthused by elvira seeing his point of view are we experiencing a series of diversionary jabs prior to the main attacksomething on the scale of the world trade center in new york what we need to know said ramirez tiring of all the conjecture is where our investigation here in seville should be heading there is no juez de instruccion until sergio del rey arrives from madrid said elvira the madrid cgi have been pulling in all contacts of hammad and saoudi for interviews but so far they appear to have been operating alone the guardia civil have successfully plotted the route taken by the peugeot partner from madrid to the safe house near valmojado where it is believed they were keeping the hexogen they are having difficulties plotting the route taken by the vehicle from valmojado down to seville there are concerns that it diverted on its route where was the last sighting of the peugeot partner asked falcon heading south on the nive it stopped at a service station near valdepenas the concern is that ninety kilometres later the road forks the niv continues to cordoba and seville while the ne goes to jaen and granada they are looking at both routes but its not easy to track a particular white van amongst the thousands on the roads their only chance is if the vehicle stopped and the two men got out so that someone could identify them as happened at the service station near valdepenas which means theres a distinct possibility that theres more hexogen elsewhere said pablo our job at the moment is to find out what connections botin made and well be speaking to his partner esperanza this morning thats great said ramirez but what are we supposed to do keep searching for the nonexistent electricians and council inspectors were looking like incompetents at the moment juez calderon was doing a good job of protecting us from too much media attention now hes in a police cell a cgi antiterrorist agent has committed suicide and his source could be a double agent were at crisis point here our squad cant just carry on as we were until we receive forensic information from inside the mosque theres not a lot else we can do said falcon we can go back to the congregation of the mosque and interview them about miguel botin see what that throws up but i believe we should keep hammering away at the electricians and council inspectorswho do exist they have been seen and if i understand the cni correctly the council inspectors created a pretext so that the electricians could plant a bomb they are the perpetrators of this atrocity we have to find them and the people who sent them that as the grupo de homicidios is our goal but possibly one that you can only achieve through quality intelligence said elvira are they part of an islamic terrorist cell or not perhaps the answer lies somewhere in the history of miguel botin who gave their card to the imam and what about the imam said ramirez not wanting to be thwarted where is he in all this has the cni search of his apartment been completed can we have their findings has access to his history finally been granted to someone whos allowed to tell us we cant access it because we do not hold it said pablo who does hold it the americans did you find a heavily annotated copy of that edition of the koran in the imams apartment asked falcon no so you dont think he was in the loop said ramirez we dont know enough to be able to answer that question the meeting broke up soon after that exchange the cni and cgi men left the preschool together elvira asked falcon to attend the press conference in the andalucian parliament building when the new judge arrived to show a united front ramirez was waiting outside the classroom im sorry for your loss javier he said holding him by the shoulder and shaking his hand i know you and ines had grown apart butits a terrible thing i hope you didnt go to the crime scene i did said falcon i dont know what i was thinking they told me over the phone that hed been identified as juez calderon and that hed been trying to dispose of a body i dont know whyi just didnt think it would be ines did he do it i went to talk to him in the patrol car all he said was i didnt do it ramirez shook his head denial was a very common psychological state for husbands when they murdered their wives theres going to be a feeding frenzy said ramirez a lot of people have been waiting for this moment you know jose luis the worst thing said falcon struggling was that she was very badly bruised over her torso down her left sideand it was old bruising hed been beating her her face was completely clear youd better take the riot squad with you into that press conference said ramirez theyre going to go mad if they hear about that ines came round to my house the other night said falcon she was behaving very strangely i thought for a moment she wanted to get back with me but now i think she was trying to tell me what was happening to her did she seem in pain at all asked ramirez preferring to stick to the facts she was swearing like id never heard her swear before and yes she did hold on to her side at one point said falcon she was furious with him for all his yes we know said ramirez who hadnt banked on this level of intimacy falcons eyes filled his mind taking its grief in gulps ramirez squeezed his shoulder with his huge mahogany hand wed better start thinking about today said falcon did you manage to read that file about the unidentified body found at the dump on monday not yet we dont get that many dead bodies in seville said falcon and in my career i have never come across such a disfigured corpse and poisoned with cyanide too and all this happens days before a bomb goes off in the city there doesnt have to be a connection said ramirez wary of letting himself in for more fruitless work but before we get a ton of forensic information from the mosque id like to see if there is one said falcon at least id like to identify the victim it might open up another pathway into this situation any pointers before i start reading the medico forense thought he was mid forties longhaired desk bound but tanned and didnt wear shoes very much he had traces of hashish in his blood there was also tattoo ink in the lymph nodes which is the reason his hands were severed they had tattoos on them small ones but presumably distinctive sounds like a university type to me said ramirez who was suspicious of anybody with too much education postgraduate or maybe a professor trying to recapture his youth spanish oliveskinned said falcon hed had a hernia op the medico forense removed the mesh see if you can get a match for it find the company that supplied it and to which hospital of course he might have had it done abroad do you want me to do this on my own take ferrera with you shes done some work on this already said falcon perez serrano and baena can tour the construction sites of seville especially any with immigrant labour tell them they have to find the electricians didnt i hear someone say that you were having a model made of this guys headthe one from the dump the sculptors a friend of the medico forense said falcon ill follow that up you missed your session last night said alicia aguado something cropped up said consuelo something very upsetting thats why were here you told me to make sure i had a family member to look after me when i came home after my session on tuesday evening said consuelo i asked my sister she was there but couldnt stay for long we talked about the session she could see that i was calm and so she left then yesterday afternoon she called me to check that i was still ok and we chatted and she remembered something shed meant to ask me about the night before my new pool man pool man he looks after the pool he checks the ph levels hoovers the bottom skims the surface cleans the said consuelo getting carried away on the detail ok consuelo im not going into the poolcleaning business said aguado the point is i dont have a new pool man said consuelo the same guy has been coming round every thursday afternoon since i bought the house i inherited him from the previous owners and what consuelo tried to swallow but couldnt my sister described him and it was the same disgusting chulo from the plaza del pumarejo very upsetting said aguado it unnerved you im sure so you called the police and stayed with your children i can understand that silence consuelo was slumped to one side of the chair as if shed lost some stuffing all right said aguado tell me what you did or did not do i didnt call the police why not i was too embarrassed she said id have to explain everything you could have just told them that an undesirable person was snooping around your home you probably dont know very much about the police said consuelo i was a murder suspect for a couple of weeks five years ago what they put you through is not so different to what youre doing to me here you start talking and they smell things they know when people are hiding the shit in their lives they see it every day theyd ask a question like do you think it possible that you know this person and what would happen especially in my fragile mental state i know you might find this difficult to believe but to me this is a positive development said aguado it makes me feel like a failure said consuelo i dont know whether this person could be a danger to my children and just because of my own shame im prepared to put them at risk but at least now i know that hes real said aguado silence from consuelo who hadnt considered this alarming possibility our minds have ways of correcting imbalances said aguado so for instance a powerful chief executive who controls thousands of peoples lives may redress the balance by dreaming of being at school and the teacher telling him what to do this is a very benign form of balancing things out more aggressive forms exist its not unusual to find successful businessmen who visit a dominatrix in order to be tied up rendered powerless and punished a new york psychologist told me he had clients who went to nurseries where they could wear nappies and sit in oversized playpens the danger comes with the uncertainty between the fantastic the real and the illusory the mind becomes confused and cannot differentiate and then a breakdown can ensue with possible lasting damage what you mean is ive had the fantasy and i may take the next step and seek out the reality but at least you werent describing an illusion to me said aguado before your sister confirmed his existence i wasnt sure how advanced you were i told you not to allow yourself to be distracted on your way here because if he was real then the reality you were seeking was very dangerous for youpersonally this man has no idea of the nature of your problems he has sensed some vulnerability and is probably just a predator he knows my name and that my husband is dead said consuelo those two details came out when he accosted me on monday night then you really should talk to the police about it said aguado if they think youre strange refer them to me then theyll know im a lunatic and take no notice said consuelo theres been a bomb in seville and a rich bitch is worried about a chulo in her garden try talking to them said aguado this man might assault or rape you silence what are you doing now consuelo im looking at you and youre thinking that i trust you more than ive trusted anyone in my life anyone even your parents i loved my parents but they knew nothing about me said consuelo so who have you trusted in your life i trusted an art dealer in madrid for a bit until he moved down here said consuelo who else asked aguado what about raul no he didnt love me said consuelo and he lived in a closedoff world trapped by his own misery he didnt talk to me about his problems and i didnt reveal my own was there anything between you and the art dealer no our attraction was nothing remotely sexual or romantic what was it then we recognized that we were complicated people with secrets we couldnt talk about but he did once tell me that hed killed a man thats not an easy thing to do said aguado sensing that they might be closer to the heart of the tangled knot than consuelo suspected we were drinking brandy in a bar on the gran via i was depressed id just told him everything about my abortions he traded this secret of his but he said it was an accident when in fact it was much more shameful than that more shameful than appearing in a pornographic movie to pay for an abortion of course it was hed killed somebody for consuelo stopped as if shed been knifed in the throat the next word wouldnt come out she could only cough up a croak as if there was a blade across her windpipe a powerful shudder of emotion rippled through her aguado released her wrist grabbed her by the arm to steady her a strange sound came from consuelo as she slid to the floor it was something like an orgasmic cry and in fact it was a release but not one of pleasure it was a cry of acute pain aguado had not expected to reach this point so quickly in the treatment but then the mind was an unpredictable organ it threw things up all the time vomited horrors into the consciousness and this was the strange thing sometimes the conscious mind could hurdle these terrible revelations sidestep them leap across the sudden chasm other times it was scythed to the ground consuelo had just experienced the equivalent of being hit by a halfton bull from behind she ended up in the foetal position on the afghan rug squeaking as if something enormous was trying to get out sevillethursday th june hrs the pressroom in the andalucian parliament building was filled to capacity and there were more people outside in the corridors the double doors had been left open it was inconceivable to falcon that something hadnt leaked the heaving level of interest in a routine press conference could not be so vast the gravity of the revelations had brought comisario lobo to the conference and his glowering presence was a comfort lobo commanded respect he induced fear nobody took his huge frame and coarse cumin complexion lightly he was the most senior policeman in seville and yet he seemed to be a man just managing to keep the lid on an extremely violent temperament on the raised platform were six chairs set behind two tables on which had been placed six microphones the six stars of the press conferencecomisarios lobo and elvira juez del rey the magistrado juez decano de sevilla spinola inspectors jefe barros and falconwere standing in the wings occupying themselves with the folded lengths of card on which their names were printed del rey had arrived only five minutes earlier having taken a cab straight from the estacion santa justa he looked remarkably calm for a man whod been woken up at in the morning and told to catch the next ave train to seville and take control of the largest criminal investigation andalucia had ever seen at exactly lobo led them out like a cadre of gladiators being presented to the public there was a clatter of shutters and flickering of flashes from the photojournalists lobo sat in the middle held up a large finger and surveyed his audience who instantly battened down to total silence the prime objective of this press conference is to introduce the new team who will be conducting the investigation into the seville bombing now referred to as th june he presented each member of the team explaining their role there was a human tremor at the introduction of sergio del rey as the new judge directing the investigation which meant that falcons role was lost in the aftershock wheres juez calderon shouted a voice from the back of the room lobos huge finger was raised once again this time with a slightly admonishing edge to it silence fell the magistrado juez decano de sevilla will now explain the reason behind the change in our juez de instruccion spinola stood up and gave a similar terse and factual description of the events of the early morning down by the guadalquivir river as elvira had done an hour earlier when hed finished there was a missed beat and then a roar as of a crowd in an enclosed basketball arena whod just witnessed a heinous foul their hands came out waving pens notebooks and dictaphones when their shouting failed to penetrate they started screaming like maddened traders in the bear pit of a crashing bourse it was impossible to hear any questions lobo stood the colossus of the jefatura made no impact the scandal was just too vast and the herd too demented to care about his immense authority the journalists rushed the platform falcon was grateful for the barrier of the table lobo was decisive the six men left the stage just managing not to break into a run for the door at the back barros was the last man out and he had to wrest his arm from the clutches of a womans bloodred nails the door was shut and locked by security the journalists hammered from the other side the double doors seemed to swell as if they might be about to burst open theres no talking to them said lobo and anyway theres nothing to be said beyond that statement well hold another press conference later and ask them to present their questions beforehand they left the building and all except lobo elvira and spinola were driven back to the preschool juez del rey still hadnt completed his reading of the case file which was already huge he said hed need until midday to complete it and then he would like a meeting with the investigating team falcon called dr pintado the medico forense whod handled the unidentified corpse from the dump and asked for miguel covos number saying he had to see anything that the sculptor had been able to accomplish as soon as possible pintado said that covo would call if he had anything to show a call came through on his personal mobile it was angel he should have turned the damn thing off i was there said angel ive never seen anything like that in my life i thought we were going to have to fire tear gas at you lot said falcon trying to keep it light this is a disaster for your investigation juez del rey is a very capable man youre talking to me javierangel zarrias public relations expert what youve got on your hands is we know but what can we do we cant turn the clock back and bring ines back to life im sorry he said her name reminding him to be solicitous im really sorry javier i just got carried away with the madness in there it must have been hard for you not even your experience could have prepared you for that the saliva thickened in falcons mouth as the bitterness of his grief hit him again in another unexpected wave he was surprised hed thought hed rid himself of all emotional entanglements with ines and yet here were these odd residues hed loved her or at least he thought hed loved her and he was amazed at how that seemed to have stood the test of her cruelty and selfishness what can i do for you angel he said businesslike look javier im not a fool i know you cant talk about anything even if you did know what had happened he said i just want you to know that the abc is on your side ive spoken to the editor if comisario elvira needs help were prepared to give our full support ill tell him angel said falcon ive got to go now ive got another call falcon closed down that mobile and opened the other it was the sculptor miguel covo he had something to show him he gave falcon directions to his workshop falcon said he could be there in ten minutes he called elvira on the way and mentioned the conversation with angel zarrias nothing comes for free in this world said elvira but we are going to need all the help we can get ive just read the autopsy report andim sorry javier i shouldnt have mentioned that i saw her said falcon his stomach lurching but he didnt want to hear it hed read autopsies before of battered wives and girlfriends and been stunned at the bodys capacity to absorb punishment and still keep going he tuned himself out from elviras voice he really didnt want to know what ines had suffered a civilized man a respected and brilliant legal mind a cultured person we used to bump into each other at the opera theres no telling javier its a terrifying thought that even these certainties cannot be trusted perhaps i shouldnt have told you about angel zarriass offer i dont follow you thats angel zarriass talent he has a genius for the manipulation of image the suspicion is going to be that we knew about calderons behaviour and condoned it with our silence because of his exceptional ability said elvira who seemed more panicked by the power of the media now that hed lost calderon his brilliant front man things are going to come out once inspector jefe zorrita starts digging and then therell be all the women he wasyou know fucking that wasnt the word i was after but yes i understand it wasnt just one or two said elvira less scrupulous newspapers than the abc might get hold of them and therell be more stories stretching back over the yearswell all look complete idiots or worse for not having spotted the flaws in his character beforehand none of us did know about it said falcon so we shouldnt feel guilty about presenting our case and its the way of the world that these things have to be conducted through the media but at least some good will come out of it hows that it will change peoples perceptions theyll now know that anyone can be an abuser of women its not the preserve of uneducated brutes with no selfcontrol but possibly civilized cultured intelligent men who can be moved to tears by tosca they hung up covos workshop was near the plaza de pelicano an ugly modern square of s apartment blocks whose central sitting area had become a place where dog owners brought their pets to shit falcon parked outside covos studio in an adjacent compound of small workshops and took a digital camera out of the glove compartment i used to keep it all in the house said covo as he led falcon through a steelcaged door into a room that was completely bare of any decoration and had only a table and two chairs but my wife started to complain when i worked my way into other rooms covo made some strong coffee and broke the filter off a ducado and lit it his head was shaved to a fine white bristle all over he wore halfmoon glasses with gold rims so that he looked like an accountant from the neck up he was slim with a nutbrown body and his arms and legs were all sinew and wiry muscle this was all visible because he wore a black string vest a pair of running shorts and sandals the only problem with this place is that it gets very hot in the summer he said they drank coffee covo didnt volunteer any more information he studied falcons face eyes flicking up and down side to side he nodded smoked drank his coffee falcon did not feel uneasy he was glad to have a respite from the madness of the world outside in the company of this strange individual were all unique said covo after some minutes and yet remarkably the same there are types said falcon ive noticed that the only problem is that we live in a part of europe where there has been a lot of genetic exchange so that for instance you will find the berber genetic marker eb both in north africa and on the iberian peninsula said covo much as wed like to were not going to be able to tell you where exactly your corpse comes from other than that he is either spanish or north african thats already something said falcon how did you find the genetic marker dr pintado has been calling in some favours from the labs said covo your corpse has good teeth you already know that hes had corrective work to make them straight expensive and unusual for someone of his generation the work was not done in spain youve been very thorough i presumed that this mans death has something to do with the bomb so i have been working hard and fast said covo the important thing is to work out how this affects the shape of the face and the overall effect of good teeth is impressive hair is also important head and facial you think he was bearded the job they did with the acid was not as thorough as it could have been im certain he was bearded but that presents other problems how did he keep it all i can say is that it wasnt long and shaggy the teeth perhaps indicate a man who cared about his appearance and he kept his hair long yes and he had high cheekbones said covo a prominent nosepart of the septum was still intact i think were talking about a rather striking individual which was why they probably went to such lengths to destroy his features im surprised they didnt smash up his teeth they would have had to extract each one to make sure it was probably too timeconsuming said covo let me show you what ive done covo stubbed out his ducado after a last long drag and they went into the studio lights came on in certain areas in the centre of the room was a block of stone from which a number of faces were emerging they all gave the impression of struggle as if they were inside the rock and nosing out into the world desperate to be free from the stultifying substance around the walls in the gloom were the spectators hundreds of heads some in clay others frighteningly real in wax i dont let many people in here said covo they get spooked by the silence i imagine said falcon one would expect so many faces to be expressing themselves it reminds people too much of death said covo my talent is not artistic i am a craftsman i can recreate a face but i cannot give it life they are inanimate without the motivation of soul i embalm people in wax and clay the faces coming out of the rock seem animated to me said falcon i think ive started to feel the restraint of my own mortality said covo let me show you our friend to the right of the block of stone was a table with what looked like four heads under a sheet i made up four copies of his faceless head said covo then i made a series of sketches of how i thought he looked finally i started to build he lifted the sheet off the first head it had no nose mouth or ears here im trying to get the feeling for how much skin and fat would cover the bones said covo ive looked at the whole body and estimated the extent of his covering he lifted the sheet off the next two heads here ive been working with the features trying to fit the nose mouth ears and eyes together on the face said covo the third one as youve probably noticed is more decisive once ive reached this stage i do more sketches working with hair and colour this fourth figure i made last night i painted him and attached the hair just this morning its my best guess the sheet slipped off to reveal a head with brown eyes long lashes aquiline nose sharp cheekbones but with the cheeks themselves slightly sunken the beard was clipped close to the skin the hair long dark and flowing and the teeth white and perfect im only worried that i may have got carried away said covo and made him too dashing falcon took photographs while covo made a selection from the sketches of other possible looks by am falcon was heading back across the river to the jefatura he had the sketches scanned and the image of the victim transferred to the computer he called pintado and asked him to email the dental xrays he put together a page with the corpses approximate age height and weight the information about the hernia op tattoos and skull fracture he called pablo who gave him the email address of the right man in the cni in madrid who would distribute it to all other intelligence agencies the fbi and interpol ramirez called just as he was leaving ive spoken to the vascular surgeon at the hospital he said hes identified the hernia mesh taken from the body as one known by the trade name surumesh made by suru international ltd of mumbai in india does he use them for inguinal hernias he uses a german make called timesh youre learning stuff jose luis im completely fascinated said ramirez drily he tells me suru international would probably supply hospitals through medical supplies wholesalers ill speak to pablo the cni can get a list from suru international then theyve got to contact the hospitals supplied by those wholesalers its quite possible that a hospital takes meshes made by a number of different manufacturers then there are the specialist hernia clinics this is going to take time were moving on a lot of fronts said falcon i have a face to work with now we have dental xrays im thinking more about america he had orthodontic work done most inguinal hernias occur over the age of forty said ramirez dr pintado estimates the guys hernia op as three years old so were only looking at say the last four maximum five years of hernia operations maybe two and a half million ops worldwide keep thinking positively jose luis ill see you next year falcon told him about the meeting with juez del rey at midday and hung up he sent another email about suru international to his contact in the cni he got up to leave again his personal mobile vibrated no name came up on the screen he took the call anyway diga he said its me consuelo he sat down slowly thinking my god his stomach leapt his blood came alive his heart beat loudly in his head its been a long time he said i saw the news about ines she said i wanted to tell you how sorry i am and to let you know that im thinking of you i know you must be very busyso i wont keep you thank you consuelo he said willing something else to come to mind its good to hear your voice again when i saw you in the street im sorry for that too she said it couldnt be helped he didnt know what that meant he needed something to keep her on the phone nothing seemed relevant his mind was too full of the corpse hernia meshes and two and a half million ops worldwide i should let you go she said you must be under a lot of pressure it was good of you to call it was the least i could do she said id like to hear from you again you know im thinking of you javier she said and it was all over he sat back looking at the phone as if her voice was still inside it shed kept his number for four years she was thinking of him do these things have meaning was that just social convention it didnt feel like it he saved her number the car park at the back of the jefatura was brutally hot the car windscreens blinded by the sun in the clear sky falcon sat in the car with the air conditioning blasting into his face those few sentences the sound of her voice had opened up a whole chapter of memory which hed closed off for years he shook his head and pulled out of the jefatura car park he headed for el cerezo the back way via the expo ground crossing the river at the puente del alamillo he arrived at the bombsite at the same time as ramirez any news about the electricians asked falcon perez called theyve been through seventeen building sites nothing whats ferrera doing shes chasing down witnesses who might have seen our friend with the hernia being dumped in the bin on calle boteros they went into the preschool juez del rey was alone waiting for them in the classroom they sat down on the edges of the school desks del rey folded his arms and stared into the floor he gave them a perfect recap of the major findings of the investigation so far he didnt use notes he got all the names of the moroccan witnesses correct he had the whole timetable of what had happened in and around the mosque in his head hed decided to make an impression on the two detectives and it worked falcon felt ramirez relax calderons replacement was no fool the two most significant recent developments in the investigation concern me the most said del rey ricardo gameros suicide and the belief that his source was working as a double agent we had a sighting of gamero by a security guard in the archaeological museum in the parque maria luisa said falcon weve got a police artist working on some sketches of the older man he was seen talking to ill call serrano said ramirez see how thats going im not convinced that a sense of failure at preventing this bomb attack from taking place was enough to drive a man like gamero to suicide said del rey theres something more failure is too general feeling personally responsible is what drives people to kill themselves the police artist didnt have much luck with the security guard last night said ramirez coming back from his call hes been with him again this morning they should have something by lunchtime im not convinced by miguel botin as a double either said del rey his brother was maimed by an islamic terrorist bomb for gods sake can you see someone like that being turned he was a convert said falcon he took his religion very seriously its difficult to know what sort of impression a charismatic radical preacher could make on someone like that we have the example of mohammed sidique khan one of the london bombers who was transformed from a special needs teacher into a radical militant we dont know what the relationship between miguel botin and his injured brother was like either said ramirez im also uncomfortable about the electricians and the fake council inspectors i dont buy the cni line that they were a terrorist cell the cni seem to me to be trying to cram square information into a round hole there was a knock at the door a policeman put his head round the forensics have been working their way through the rubble above the storeroom in the mosque he said theyve found a fireproof shockproof metal box its been taken to the forensic tent and they thought you might like to be there when they open it sevillethursday th june hrs outside the preschool everybody was wearing masks against the stench and falcon ramirez and del rey walked with their hands clasped over their mouths and noses there was an anteroom to the main body of the forensics tent where they all dressed in white hooded boiler suits and put on masks the interior of the tent was air conditioned down to c five forensic teams were currently working at the site all of them had stopped for the opening of the box something within the human psyche making it impossible even for forensics to resist the mystery of a closed secure container a dictaphone was tested and set in the middle of the table the leader of the forensic team nodded to the judge and detectives as they gathered around his hands in latex gloves were spread on either side of a red metal box next to him was a shallow cardboard evidence box dated and with the address of the imams apartment on the lid inside were three small plastic bags containing keys a whitesuited figure nudged into falcon it was gregorio this could be interesting if those keys open that box he said two sets came from the desk and one from the kitchen of the imams apartment are we ready asked the forensics team leader here we are on thursday th june at hours we have a sealed metal box which has sustained some blast damage to the lid although the lock still appears to be sound we are going to attempt to open this box using keys taken from the imams apartment during a search of those premises on wednesday th june he rejected the first sachet of keys but selected the next one and poured the two keys into his hand he fitted one of the identical keys into the lock turned it and the lid sprang open the box has been successfully opened by a key found in the kitchen drawer of the imams apartment he opened the lid and lifted out three coloured plastic folders thick with folded paper this emptied the box which was removed to another table he opened up the first green folder here we have one sheet of writing in arabic script which has been paperclipped to what appears to be a set of architects drawings he opened out the drawings which proved to be a detailed plan of a secondary school in san bernardo the other two folders followed the same pattern the second set of drawings featured the plan of a primary school in triana and the third the biology faculty on avenida de la reina mercedes silence while the men and women of the forensic teams contemplated their find falcon could feel the minds in the room working their way towards more and more uneasy conclusions each islamic terrorist atrocity had released new viral strains of horror into the body of the west no sooner had the west become reconciled to men as bombs than they had to accept women as bombs and even children as bombs it seemed sickeningly obvious now that car bombs would transmute to boats as bombs and then planes as bombs finally the atrocities would no longer remain at a distance in the middle east far east or america but come to madrid and london then there was the unimaginable the stuff that would make a horror novelist tremble at night executions beamed around the world of men and women being beheaded with kitchen knives and finally beslan children held hostage given no food or water explosives hung over their heads how is an ordinary mind supposed to work under these conditions of easy contagion were they going to blow these places up asked a voice take hostages said a woman look theyre after kids from five years old up to twentyfive years old bastards is there nothing these people wont do are there no fucking boundaries i think said juez del rey quick to put a lid on the mounting hysteria that we should wait until we have translations of the arabic script in our hands before we jump to conclusions it was not the voice of reason that people wanted to hear not just yet anyway theyd been waiting a long time to get their hands on solid evidence and now theyd found something spectacular they wanted to vent some of their anger del rey sensed this he moved things along once more as a precaution these three buildings should be searched if there was a plan to seize them its possible that weaponry has been stored there everybody nodded glad to see that even the man from madrid suffered the same paranoia the same corrupted brain circuit as themselves lets get these drawings and the arabic texts through the forensic process as soon as possible we need those translations fast he said theres something else said the forensics team leader the bomb disposal people have come across something interesting on the explosives front an army officer in white overalls with a green armband pushed his way through to the table so far weve only had full access to the area above the storeroom because theres no evidence of bodies or human tissue we still believe that the main destructive explosion was caused by a large quantity of hexogen being detonated but we have also found trace evidence of goma eco which is the mining explosive that was used in the madrid bombings did one set off the other its certainly possible but we have no way of proving it is there any reason why two types of explosive would be used goma eco is industrial quality whereas hexogen is military if you have a large quantity of hexogen which has greater brisance than goma eco i dont see why youd use a lower grade explosive unless your intention was to cause other distracting explosions or to hold people in a state of fear you estimated the hexogen stored in the building to be in the region of kilos said del rey conservative estimate what sort of damage would kilos do to these schools and the university faculty on these drawings a real expert who understood the architecture of the buildings could probably raze them to the ground said the army officer but it would be a demolition job they would have to drill into the reinforced skeleton of the building and wire the charges together for a simultaneous explosion and what about people if everyone was herded into one or two rooms of each building with kilos of hexogen there would be no or only very few survivors is it possible for you to tell how much goma eco exploded in the storeroom of the mosque personally i would say kilos or less but i wouldnt be able to stand up in court and say that because the hexogen trace is too dominant is hexogen manufactured in spain no the uk italy germany usa and russia he said they probably make it in china too but theyre not telling us if they are why go to the trouble of importing it its availability said the army officer wherever theres conflict in the world theres ordnance and hexogen can easily be extracted from it you end up with lowvolume high explosive which is untraceable easy to transport hide and disguise domestic gunpowder magazines are more tightly controlled since th march although there have been theftsfor instance in portugal last year i would also say that the chances of hexogen being spotted in an open european transport system are slim whereas mounting a robbery of a gunpowder magazine in this country would get you lower grade explosive and draw the immediate attention of the authorities what about the homemade variety used in the london bombings asked del rey wouldnt it be easier to mix up easily available ingredients than go to the trouble and risk of bringing in hexogen or stealing goma eco youre right triaceton triperoxide can be made quite easily but i wouldnt like to be around someone dealing with it unless he had a chemistry postgraduate degree and we were operating in temperaturecontrolled laboratory conditions its volatile he said also it depends on what sort of atrocity you want to commit tatp is fine if youre intent on killing people but if you want a spectacular explosion with serious destruction and loss of life then hexogen is much more capable of doing that hexogen is also stable and not temperature sensitive something thats important at this time of year in a place like seville where daytime temperatures can vary by as much as twenty degrees the work rate was increasing material was coming in at a constant rate from the bombsite bits of credit card scraps of id driving licences strips of clothing shoes the more macabre findings such as body parts were taken to the tented morgue next door while del rey watched the forensic work falcon briefed elvira whod just arrived from a meeting in the town hall with the mayor comisario lobo and magistrado juez decano spinola elvira ordered searches of the three buildings immediately evacuation would be carried out by the local police and searches conducted by the bomb squad in case of booby traps elvira was concerned that other terrorist cells might have become active preparing to take over the buildings the cgi had to be alerted gregorio of the cni was already in touch with pablo who was asking for the translations to be sent to him by secure email as soon as they were ready falcon ramirez and del rey stripped off their boiler suits in the forensic tents anteroom and went back to the preschool to resume their meeting what do you make of that development inspector jefe asked del rey we were asked to keep an open mind in this investigation especially by the senior cni man said falcon and yet since we found the peugeot partner and its contents almost all subsequent findings have directed us towards the belief that an islamic terrorist campaign was being planned in this mosque almost all subsequent findings we cannot satisfactorily explain the fake council inspectors and the electricians and yet we are very suspicious of their involvement said falcon they seem to be an intrinsic part of the actual explosion now that weve spoken to the bomb squad officer it seems clear that a smaller device was planted which set off the stored hexogen we have a link between miguel botin and the electricians he was seen handing over the card to the imam but who was he working for you dont buy the cni line either i would if there was any proof for it but theres none what about those keys from the imams apartment opening the box said ramirez where does that place the imam now as part of the plot said del rey except that the keys were found in a kitchen drawer said falcon i find that strange when all the other keys were kept in his desk and the two keys were identical would you keep them together if we are to believe that botin was a double agent and that he was serving up the imam to the cgi on behalf of another terrorist commander as the cni seem to think then what are we to make of the drawings in the metal box asked del rey the imams keys opened the box therefore whatever is in that box is an expendable operation said falcon the cni would be forced to admit it was another part of the diversion and what do you think inspector jefe i dont have enough information to think anything said falcon you said you were keeping an open mind inspector jefe what does that mean exactly that youve been conducting other enquiries falcon told him about informaticalidad giving the background on horizonte and iit he gave their reasons for buying the property and how the sales reps used it he also told him about informaticalidads recruiting procedure well all that sounds strange but i cant see anything in particular thats pointing to their involvement in this scenario ive never heard anything like it said ramirez so far the only illegal thing i can find is that they used black money to buy the apartment said falcon ive been trying to find something that links them to what was going on in the mosque and you havent found it the only connection is that one of the churches used in recruiting employees for informaticalidad was the same one used by the cgi antiterrorist agent ricardo gamerosan marcos but you have no proof that gamero met anyone from informaticalidad none i spoke to the priest from san marcos and i would describe some of his responses as extremely guarded but thats all are you hoping that the police artists drawing of the man gamero met in the museum is going to provide that link to informaticalidad thats a tricky process to extract a likeness from a museum security guards view of a person he wasnt particularly interested in said falcon theyre looking for troublemakers not two adults having a conversation which is why after five hours we still have nothing said ramirez were also pushing forward with an enquiry we started the day before the bomb said falcon and described the circumstances of the mutilated corpse and because of the timing you think that there might be a link to the bombing asked del rey not just that after this particularly brutal treatment to hide the victims identity the body had been sewn into a shroud that struck me as respectful and religiously motivated the corpse also had what is known as a berber genetic marker which means that he was either from the iberian peninsula or north african you said he was poisoned he ingested it said falcon which could imply that he didnt know he was being executed then they removed his identity but treated him with respect and how will this help us to identify the fake council inspectors and the electricians i wont know that until i identify the murdered man said falcon im hoping that can be done now that an image of the victims face and a full set of dental xrays have been sent out to intelligence services worldwide including interpol and the fbi del rey nodded scribbled notes were not getting anywhere looking for these electricians through conventional channels said ramirez while the bomb squad officer was talking it occurred to me that an explosives expert would have to know about electronics and therefore probably electrics in general said falcon goma eco is a mining explosive so perhaps we should sit our witnesses down in front of photo ids for all licensed explosive handlers in spain have your witnesses been able to describe the electricians the most reliable one is a spanish convert called jose duran but he couldnt describe them very well there didnt seem to be anything particular about them witnesses plural you said theres an old moroccan guy but he didnt even spot that the two labourers werent spanish maybe we should send an artist along to see jose duran while he looks at the licensed explosive handlers said ramirez ill get on to it falcon gave him his mobile to extract durans number ramirez left the room im concerned that the cni are either not seeing things straight or theyre not telling us everything we should know said del rey i dont know why they havent let you into the imams apartment yet theyre not concerned about what happened here any more said falcon this explosion was either a mistake or a decoy and either way theres no point in expending energy to find out very little when theres possibly another more devastating attack being planned elsewhere but you dont agree with the cnis point of view i think there are two forces at play here said falcon one force is an islamic terrorist group who appeared to be planning an attack using hexogen brought here in the peugeot partner and stored in the mosque an attack on those schools and the biology faculty lets see what forensic information we get if any from the drawings and the texts said falcon and also the content of the translations and the other force i dont know but how does this force manifest itself by a breakdown of logic in the scenario said falcon we cant fit the council inspectors and the electricians into our scenario nor can we explain the goma eco but who do you think this force is what are these islamic terrorist groups fighting for or who do you think theyre fighting against asked falcon its difficult to say there doesnt seem to be any coherent agenda or strategy they just seem to be meting out a series of punishments london and madrid were supposedly because of iraq nairobi the uss cole and the twin towers because they believe that america is an evil empire bali because of australian action in east timor against the islamic nation of indonesia casablanca was supposedly against spanish and jewish targets karachii dont know it was the sheraton wasnt it and thats our problem here said falcon we have no idea who their enemy is perhaps this other force is just a group of people whove had enough and decided they dont want to be passively terrorized any more they want to fight back they want to preserve their way of lifewhether its considered decadent or not they could be the people behind the vomit website they could be an unknown local andalucian group whove heard about the mila and perceived it as a threat to them and their families maybe its a religious group who want to maintain the sanctity of the catholic faith in spain and drive islam back into north africa or perhaps we are even more decadent than we know and this is pure power play somebody has seen the political or economic potential in terrifying the population when those planes hit the twin towers everything changed people see things differently nowboth good and bad people once a new chapter in the human history of horror has been opened all sorts of people start applying their creative powers to the writing of its next paragraphs sevillethursday th june hrs did you manage to talk to your exmentor marco barreda at informaticalidad asked falcon i did better than that said david curado i went to see him how did that go well i called him and started to tell him what you and i talked about and he stopped me said it was a pity we hadnt seen each other since id left the company and why didnt we meet for a beer and a tapa has that happened before no way weve only ever talked on the phone said curado i was surprised youre not even supposed to talk to exemployees let alone meet them for a beer was it just the two of you yes and it was odd said curado hed been all enthusiastic on the phone but when we met it was almost as if hed changed his mind about the whole thing he seemed distracted but i could tell it was an act how i told him about our conversation and he barely took any notice said curado but then i asked the question about ricardo gamero and he was stunned i asked him who this ricardo gamero was and he said he was a member of his church whod committed suicide that afternoon as you know i used to go to san marcos myself and id never come across ricardo gamero so i asked him if hed killed himself because the cops were after him and marco said that the guy was a cop how do you think hed taken the news of ricardo gameros suicide he was sick about it i could tell very upset he was were they friends i assume so but he didnt say falcon knew he had to speak to marco barreda directly curado gave him his number they hung up falcon sat back in his car tapping the steering wheel with his mobile had gameros suicide made marco barreda vulnerable and if that was a weakness and falcon could get some leverage would it reveal enough would it in fact reveal anything he had no idea what he was getting into he had spoken to juez del rey about these two forcesislamic terrorism and another as yet unknownboth of whom had demonstrated a ruthlessness in their operations but he knew nothing about their structures nor their aims other than a preparedness to kill had the one movement learnt from the other declare no coherent agenda operate a loose command structure create selfcontained unconnected cells who having been remotely activated carry out their destructive mission talking this through to himself produced a moment of clarity that was one cultural difference between islam and the west whenever an islamic attack occurred the west always looked for the mastermind there had to be an evil genius at the core because that was the order that the western mind demanded a hierarchy a plan with an achievable goal what was the chain he worked back from the electrician whod planted the bomb hed been brought in by a call from the imam who in turn had been given the electricians card by miguel botin the card was the connection between the mission and the hierarchy whod ordered it neither the electricians nor the council inspectors for that matter had been in the building at the time of the explosion and both sets of people were as much a part of the plan as the card this would not be how an islamic terrorist cell would operate that would mean logically that the only other person who could have activated miguel botin was ricardo gamero why had gamero committed suicide because in activating miguel botin with the electricians card gamero did not realize that he was making him the agent of destruction of the building and all the people inside that would be reason enough to take your own life on the day of the bombing the cgi antiterrorist squad couldnt move because of the possibility of a mole in their ranks only on day two could ricardo gamero have got out and demanded to see someone seniorthe older man in the archaeological museumfrom whom he demanded an explanation that explanation had not been good enough to prevent his suicide falcon called ramirez has that police artist come up with a sketch of the man gamero met in the museum yet weve just scanned it and sent it to the cni and cgi send a copy to the computer in the preschool said falcon the witness jose duran is due here any moment well show him the shots of the licensed explosive handlers but im not holding out much hope said ramirez the bomb could have been made up by somebody else and left in the mosque or he could have been an assistant to an explosives expert and learnt everything necessary keep at it jose luis said falcon if you want a really impossible task try looking for the fake council inspectors ill add that to the list of two and a half million hernia ops ive still got to go through said ramirez another thought said falcon contact all the hermandades associated with the three churches san marcos santa maria la blanca and la magdalena hows that going to help whatevers happening here has some religious motivation informaticalidad recruits from church congregations ricardo gamero was a devout catholic attending san marcos the abdullah azzam text was sent to the abc the main catholic newspaper and it included a direct threat to the catholic faith in andalucia and what do you think the brotherhoods in these churches could have to do with it maybe nothing youd be too exposed as a known brotherhood but you never know they may have heard of a secret one or seen strange things going on in the churches that might give us some leverage with the priests we have to try everything this could get ugly said ramirez even uglier than it is already the media are all over us again ive just heard that comisario lobo and the magistrado juez decano de sevilla are going to give another press conference to explain the situation following juez calderons dismissal said ramirez i heard the one at the parliament building earlier today was a disaster and now the television and the radio are full of arseholes telling us that since calderons arrest on suspicion of murder and wife abuse our investigation has completely lost credibility how has all this got out the journalists have been all over the palacio de justicia talking to iness friends and colleagues now theyre not just talking about the evident physical violence but also a prolonged campaign of mental torture and public humiliation this is just what elvira was frightened of a lot of people have been waiting a long time to get esteban calderon down on the ground and now theyve got him there theyre going to kick him to death even if it means our investigation is effectively destroyed and what do lobo and spinola hope to achieve in this press conference asked falcon they cant talk about a murder investigation thats in progress damage control said ramirez and theyre going to talk up del rey hes due to come on afterwards with comisario elvira to give a recap of the case so far no wonder he was so word perfect with us said falcon maybe it wouldnt be such a good idea for him to talk about what were working on now youre right about that said ramirez youd better call him del rey had switched his mobile off maybe he was already in the studio falcon called elvira and asked him to give a rather cryptic message to del rey there was no time to explain the detail falcon picked up the sketch from the computer operator in the preschool at least it looked like a drawing of a real person a man in his sixties possibly early seventies in a suit and tie some hair on top with a side parting no beard or moustache the artist had included the mans height and weight as given by the security guard he was on the small side at m and kilos but did it look like the man they wanted to find back in the car he took a look at the lists given to him by diego torres the human resources director at informaticalidad marco barreda was not one of the employees whod spent time in the apartment on calle los romeros maybe he was too senior for that he called the mobile number david curado had given him and introduced himself with his full title i think we should talk face to face said falcon im busy itll take fifteen minutes of your time im still busy im investigating an act of terrorism multiple murder and a suicide said falcon you have to make time for me im not sure how i can help im neither a terrorist nor a murderer and i dont know anybody who is but you did know the suicide ricardo gamero said falcon where are you now im in the office im just on my way out name a place deep breath from barreda he knew he couldnt brush him off forever he named a bar in triana falcon called ramirez again have you got the printout of all calls made on ricardo gameros mobiles ramirez crashed around the office for a minute and came back falcon gave him barredas number interesting said ramirez that was the last call he made on his personal mobile while i think about it said falcon we need the list of calls the imam made on his mobile especially the one he made in front of jose duran on sunday morning because that is the electricians mobile number the bar was half full of people everybody was looking at the television ignoring their drinks the news had just finished and now it was lobo and spinola but ramirez had been wrong it wasnt a press conference they were being interviewed falcon walked through the bar looking for a lone young man nobody nodded to him he sat down at a table for two the interviewer a woman was attacking spinola she could not believe that he hadnt known about the campaign of terror conducted by calderon against his wife the magistrado juez decano de sevilla an oldschool pachyderm with saurian eyes and an easy but quite alarming smile was not uncomfortable with his moment in the hot seat falcon tuned out of the pointless argument spinola was not going to be drawn the female interviewer had lost herself in the emotional aspect of the case she should have been hitting spinola on calderons ability to perform and his integrity as a judge in the investigation instead she was looking for some riveting personal revelation and she had gone to precisely the wrong man for it a young guy in a suit caught falcons eye they introduced themselves and sat down falcon ordered a couple of coffees and some water you people are having a hard time said barreda tilting his head at the tv were used to it said falcon so how many times has it happened that a juez de instruccion has been found trying to dispose of his wifes dead body during a major international terrorism investigation about as many times as a valued member of an antiterrorist squad has committed suicide during a major international terrorism investigation said falcon how long have you known ricardo gamero a couple of years said barreda subdued by falcons swift response was he a friend yes so you didnt just see him at mass on sundays we met occasionally during the week we both like classical music we used to go to concerts together informaticalidad had season tickets when did you last see him on sunday i understand that informaticalidad use san marcos and other churches to recruit employees did anybody else from the company know ricardo gamero of course wed go for coffee after mass and id introduce him around thats normal isnt it just because hes a cop doesnt mean he cant talk to people so you knew he was in the antiterrorist squad of the cgi barreda stiffened slightly as he realized hed been caught out ive known him two years it came out eventually do you remember when after about six months i was trying to recruit him to informaticalidad making him better and better offers until finally he told me he said it was like a vocation and he wasnt going to change his career a vocation that was the word he used said barreda he was very serious about his work and his religion said falcon did he feel the two were bound up together barreda stared at falcon trying to see inside you were a friend he met at church after all said falcon i would have thought you were bound to talk about the islamic threat and then once it came outthe nature of his work i mean it would seem a natural progression to at least discuss the connection barreda sat back with an intake of breath and looked around the room as if for inspiration did you ever meet paco molero asked falcon two blinks he had well paco continued falcon said that ricardo by his own admission had been a fanatic that hed only just managed to transform himself from being an extremist to being merely devout and that hed managed to achieve this through a fruitful relationship with a priest who died recently of cancer where would you describe yourself as being on that integral scale between say lapsed and fanatical ive always been very devout said barreda theres been a priest in every generation of my family including your own except mine is that something you feeldisappointed by yes it is was that one of the attractions of the culture at informaticalidad said falcon it sounds a bit like a seminary but with a capitalist aim theyve always been very good to me there do you think theres a danger that people with like minds and with the same intensity of faith might become in the absence of a balancing outside influence drawn towards an extreme position ive heard of that happening in cults said barreda how would you describe a cult an organization with a charismatic leader that uses questionable psychological techniques to control its followers falcon left that hanging sipped his coffee and took the top off his water he glanced up at the television to see that lobo and spinola had now been replaced by elvira and del rey the apartment which informaticalidad bought on calle los romeros near the mosquedid you ever go there before it was bought they asked me to look at it to see if it was suitable suitable for what asked falcon diego torres told me youre right there wasnt much to look at it was entirely suitable how upset were you by ricardos death asked falcon thats a terrible thing for a devout catholic to do to kill himself no last rites no final absolution do you know why people commit suicide a frown had started up on marcos forehead a trembling frown he was staring into his coffee biting the inside of his cheek trying to control emotion some people kill themselves because they feel responsible for a catastrophe other people suddenly lose the impetus for carrying on we all have something that glues us into placea lover friends family work home but there are other extraordinary people who are glued into place by much bigger ideals ricardo was one of those people a remarkable man with great religious faith and a vocation is that what he suddenly lost when that bomb exploded on th june barreda sipped his coffee licked the bitter foam from his lips and replaced the cup with a rattle in its saucer i was very upset by his death said barreda just to stop the barrage of words from falcon i have no idea why he committed suicide but you recognize what it means for a man of his faith to do that barreda nodded you know who ricardos other great friend was asked falcon miguel botin did you know him no reaction from barreda he knew him falcon piled on the pressure miguel was ricardos source in the mosque a spanish convert to islam they were very close they had great respect for each others faith i have a feeling that it was as much miguel botin as ricardos old priest that pulled him back from the brink of fanaticism to something more reasonable what do you think barreda had his elbows up on the table his fingertips pressed into his forehead and his thumbs pushing into his cheekbones hard enough for the skin to turn white falcon had barreda right there on the brink but he couldnt get him to move that last centimetre his mind seemed locked in a state of great uncertainty and doubt falcon still had his ace up his sleeve but what about the drawing if he showed it to him and the man was unrecognizable he would lose his present advantage but if it was a close likeness it could blow the whole thing open he decided to play the ace the last time you saw ricardo was on sunday said falcon but it wasnt the last time you spoke to him was it do you know who was the last person on earth that ricardo spoke to before he hanged himself out of his bedroom window the last number on the list of mobile calls he made silence apart from the television burble at the far end of the cafe what did he say to you marco asked falcon were you able to give him absolution for his sins the whole bar suddenly erupted all the men were on their feet hurling insults at the television a couple of empty plastic bottles were thrown which glanced off the tv whose screen was full of del reys face what did he say falcon asked the man nearest to him who was shouting cabron cabron in time with the rest of the men in the bar hes trying to tell us that it might not have been islamic terrorists after all said the man his tremendous belly quivering with rage hes trying to tell us that it could have been our own people whove done this our own people who want to blow up an apartment block and schools and kill innocent men women and children go back to madrid you fucking wanker falcon turned back to marco barreda who looked stunned by the reaction around him fuck off back to madrid cabron the bar owner stepped in and changed the channel before someone put a glass bottle through the screen the men settled back into their chairs the fat guy nudged falcon the other judge he beat his wife but at least he knew what he was talking about the television showed another current affairs programme the interviewer introduced her two guests the first was fernando alanis whose introduction was lost in applause from the bar they knew him he was the one whod lost his wife and son and whose daughter had miraculously survived and was now fighting for her life in hospital falcon realized that this was the man they were all going to believe it didnt matter what he said his tragedy had conferred on him a legitimacy that juez del reys vast experience and command of the facts totally lacked in the other chair was jesus alarcon the new leader of fuerza andalucia the bar was silent listening intently these were the people who were going to tell them the truth barreda excused himself to go to the toilet falcon sat back from the table in a state of shock hed lost all the leverage hed just created why hadnt elvira given del rey the message that he shouldnt mention the other angle of the investigation now that the mistake had been made it was clear that even as an enquiry let alone a possible truth it was totally unacceptable to the local populace the topic of the tv discussion was immigration the interviewers first question was irrelevant as fernando had come to the cameras well primed there wasnt a sound in the bar as he started to talk im not a politician im sorry to say this in front of sr alarcon who is a man ive grown to respect over the days since the explosion but i dont like politicians and i dont believe a word they say and i know im not alone i am here today to tell you how it is im not an opinionmaker i am a labourer who works on a building site and i used to have a family said fernando who had to stop momentarily as his adams apple jumped in his throat i lived in the apartment block in el cerezo which was blown up on tuesday i know from the media people ive met over the last few days that they would like to believe and they would like the world to believe that we live in a harmonious and tolerant modern society here in spain in talking to these people i realized why this is the case they are all intelligent people far more intelligent than a mere labourer but the truth of the matter is that they do not live the life that i do they are well off they live in nice houses in good areas they take regular holidays their children go to good schools and it is from this point of view that they look at their country they want it to continue in the way that it appears to them i livei mean i lived in a horrible apartment in a nasty block surrounded by lots of other ugly blocks not many of us have cars not many of us take holidays not many of us have enough money to last the month and we are the people living with the moroccans and the other north africans i am a tolerant person i have to be i work on building sites where there is a lot of cheap immigrant labour i have a respect for peoples rights to believe in whichever god they want to and to attend whichever church or mosque they want to but since th march i have become suspicious since that day when people died in those trains i have wondered where the next attack is coming from i am not a racist and i know that the terrorists are very few out of a large population but the problem is thati dont know who they are they live with me they live in my society they enjoy its prosperity until one day they decided to put a bomb under my apartment block and kill my wife and son and there are many of us who have lived in suspicion and fear since th march until last tuesday th june and now it is we who are angry barreda came back from the toilet he had to go falcon followed him out into the heat and fierce light of the street all his advantage and initiative had gone they stood under the awning of the bar and shook hands barreda was back to normal hed recomposed himself in the toilet and perhaps been strengthened by listening to fernando alaniss speech on his way back you didnt tell me what ricardo said to you in that final phone call said falcon im embarrassed to have to talk about it afterwhat weve said about him embarrassed i didnt realize how he felt about me said barreda but thenim not gay sevillethursday th june hrs so why werent all these other lines of enquiry written up in a report asked comisario elvira looking from del rey back to falcon as you know ive been helping the cni with one of their missions said falcon ive had to maintain the enquiry into this murder which happened prior to the bombing and ive since acquired a suicide to investigate however all these enquiries i believe are linked and should be moved forward together at no point have i deviated from my initial intention which was to find out what happened in the destroyed building you have to agree that there has been a breakdown of logic in the scenario and its my job to create different lines of enquiry to find the necessary logic to resolve it i didnt hear what happened on television but it has now been explained to me that it was the interviewer who interrupted juez del rey and said so you believe it was one of our own people that committed this atrocity it was that question which caused this public relations problem problem public relations catastrophe said elvira another one on top of this mornings debacle did you talk to angel zarrias of the abc asked falcon were a bit shy of the media right now said elvira comisario lobo and i are having a strategy meeting after this to see how we can repair the damage juez del rey has done a great job bringing himself up to speed on a very complicated and sensitive investigation said falcon we cant allow the thrust of our enquiry to be dictated by the media who have seen an opportunity to manipulate a nervous population by playing games with us on television what were playing with here is the truth said elvira the presentable truth and the acceptable truth and its all a question what about the actual truth said falcon and its all a question said elvira nodding at his little slip of timing which truth is released when have the translations of the arabic script attached to the drawings been completed asked falcon so you didnt see the news before we went on said elvira and nor did we which was why the wretched interviewer seized on what juez del rey was saying only afterwards did we find out that the evacuations of the two schools and biology faculty had been filmed and a translation of one of the arabic texts was aired with it each text gave full instructions on how to close off each building where to hold the hostages and where to place the explosives in order to ensure maximum loss of life should special forces storm the building said del rey there was a final instruction in each text which was that one hostagestarting with the youngest child in the case of the schoolswas to be released every hour and as they made their way to freedom they were to be shot in full view of the media this process was to continue until the spanish government recognized andalucia as an islamic state under sharia law well that explains why there was nearly a riot in the bar i was in said falcon how did the media get hold of the text it was delivered by motorbike to canal surs reception in a brown padded envelope addressed to the producer of current affairs said del rey an enquiry is underway said elvira what were you doing in this bar i was interviewing the last man to speak to ricardo gamero before he killed himself said falcon hes a sales manager at informaticalidad this isnt the old guy who was seen talking to gamero in the archaeological museum said del rey no this was the last call gamero made on his personal mobile said falcon i presume that all members of the cgis antiterrorist squad would be vetted comisario including their sexuality of course said elvira anybody with access to classified information is vetted to make sure theyre not vulnerable so it would be known if gamero was homosexual absolutelyunless he was you know not practisingso to speak the guy i was talking to marco barreda was at cracking point when the bar went crazy he knows something i think he feels that whatever it is that he or they have got involved in it has spiralled out of control hes sick about gameros death for a start that was not part of the script and what script is that asked elvira who was desperate for one i dont know said falcon but its something that explains what happened in that mosque on tuesday if we had the manpower id have the whole of informaticalidad down at the jefatura and interview them until they broke down so what did marco barreda say were gameros last words asked elvira that gamero was in love with him said falcon hed been reluctant to say anything because he was embarrassed about it i thought it was significant that hed been to the toilet im sure he called someone and was given advice about what to say he was at cracking point and then suddenly he seemed to be back on the rails so what have we got on informaticalidad nothing apart from the fact that the apartment was bought with black money and what do you think this apartment was used for surveillance of the mosque with what purpose with the purpose of attacking it or enabling others to attack it for any particular reason other than that they are an organization recruited from the catholic church and therefore representative of the religious right and opposed to the influence of islam in spain im not entirely sure there might be a political or financial angle that i dont as yet know about you havent got enough said elvira youve interviewed all the sales reps and youve tried to capitalize on marco barredas vulnerability without success all you have is an unsubstantiated theory to go on how could you apply any more pressure if you brought them down here theyd come with lawyers attached then thered be the media to contend with youre going to need something much more solid than your instinct to break open informaticalidad im also concerned that that was all they did said falcon nodding provide surveillance information and nothing more in which case we could interview them for days and get no further than that i need another link i want the old guy seen talking to gamero in the museum did you show the drawing to marco barreda asked del rey no i was concerned that it might not be a close enough likeness and i wanted to apply pressure to his vulnerable point which was ricardo gamero whats your next move im going to take a look at all the board directors of informaticalidad and the other companies in their group including the holding company horizonte and see if i can find a likeness to the sketch said falcon what are the cni and cgi doing theyre concerned with the future now said elvira juan has gone back to madrid the others are using the names from this investigation to try to get leads to other cells or networks so were on our own with this investigation here theyll only come back to us if we find from the dna sampling that the imam or hammad and saoudi werent in the mosque at the time of the explosion said elvira as far as theyre concerned theres nothing more for them to extract from this situation and theyre more worried about future attacks back in his office falcon ran an internet search for informaticalidad and horizonte and extracted photographs of the directors of all the individual companies their groups and the holding company as he scrolled through the search engines results for horizonte he came across a web page dedicated to the celebration of their fortieth anniversary in as hed hoped the page showed a banquet with more than twentyfive shots of the great and the good at their tables the memory is a strange organ it seems to be random and yet it can be jogged into patterns by other senses falcon knew if he hadnt just seen him on television he would never have picked him out from all the other faces at the horizonte candlelit floral dinner he stopped scrolled back it was unmistakably jesus alarcon with his beautiful wife sitting three places to his right he looked at the caption which said nothing other than this was a table belonging to horizontes bankersbanco omni well that figured alarcon had been a banker in madrid before he came to seville he printed out the page with all its photographs and left the jefatura serrano having given him the name of the security guard at the archaeological museum the security guard was called to the ticket desk and falcon showed him the photographs which he flipped through quickly shaking his head he ran his finger over the fortieth anniversary banquet shots nothing jumped out at him it was too hot even for a quick snack under the purple flowers of the jacarandas in the park and falcon drove back into town with too much on his mind pablo from the cni called and they agreed to meet in a bar on calle leon xii near the destroyed apartment building falcon was there first it was a downtrodden place the staff hadnt bothered to clear away the ankledeep fag butts sugar sachets and paper napkins after the coffeebreak rush he ordered a gazpacho which was a little fizzy and a piece of tuna which had less flavour than the plate it was served on and the chips were soggy with oil things were going well pablo arrived and ordered a coffee first thing he said sitting down yacoub has made contact and weve given him his instructions on your behalf he knows what to do now and what is that yacoub belongs to two mosques the first is in rabat the grand mosque ahlfes which is attended by the powerful and wealthy its not known for any radical islamic stance but he also belongs to a mosque in sale near his work which is a different kind of place altogether and yacoub knows it all he has to do is step over to the other side and start getting involved he knows the people how does he know the people javier said pablo with an admonishing look dont ask you dont have to know how dangerous is this going to be for him asked falcon i mean radical islam isnt known for its forgiving nature and i imagine theyre especially unforgiving when it comes to betrayal as long as he maintains his role theres no danger he communicates with us at a distance theres no face to face which is where things normally come unstuck if he needs to see anybody then he can organize a business trip to madrid what happens if they take him over and start feeding us emails of disinformation theres a phrase he has to use in his correspondence with us if that phrase isnt employed then we know it isnt him writing and we react accordingly how quickly will they come to trust him said falcon youve always been of the opinion that this bomb was a mistake or a diversion maybe youre expecting an information return too quickly if you think that he can help you with attacks which have already been planned theyll recognize his value immediately has he been approached by the gicm before asked falcon these things only just occurring to him hes in a unique position because of his business said pablo pointedly ignoring falcons question he can travel freely and is widely known respected and trusted by his business partners he will arouse no suspicion from the moroccan authorities looking for radicals or european authorities looking for terrorists or their planners hes the perfect person for a terrorist organization to make use of but theyll test him first surely said falcon i dont know how it works but they might give him some valuable information and see what he does with it see for instance if it appears elsewhere just like the cni did with the cgi here in seville come to think of it thats our job javier we know what we can use from him and what we cant if we have information that could only possibly have come from him then we know to be careful said pablo if he tells us that theres a gicm cell operating from an address in barcelona we dont just storm the building whats the other thing we want you to communicate with yacoub tonight theres nothing to be said but we want him to know youre here and in touch with him is that it not quite the cia have come back to us with the identity of your mystery man with no hands or face that was quick theyve developed quite a system over there for tracing people of arabic origin even when theyve become american citizens said pablo your model man did a good job with the face and his identity was corroborated by the hernia op tattoos and dental xrays what were the tattoos on the webbing between thumb and forefinger he had four dots configured in a square on his right hand and five dots on his left hand any reason it helped him count said pablo up to nine apparently women never failed to comment on them that is on his file said falcon amazed youll see why when i tell you he was a professor in arabic studies at columbia university until march last year when he was fired after being found in bed with one of his students said pablo and you know how they found out he was shopped by one of his other students who he was bedding at the same time you dont do that sort of thing at an american university and get caught the police were brought in the girls parents threatened to sue the university and then him personally it was the end of his careerand it cost him too he managed to settle out of court on advice from his lawyers who knew he would lose and that they wouldnt get paid he had to sell his midtown apartment which had been left to him by his parents the only job he could get after the case blew over was teaching maths privately in columbus ohio he lasted three months of a mid west winter and then flew to madrid in april last year after that our information gets a little sparse weve a record of him taking a trip to morocco for three weeks at the end of april he took the ferry from algeciras to tangier on th april and he came back on th may thats it does he have a name his real name is tateb hassani said pablo when he became an american citizen in which was also the year both his parents died one in a car crash and the other of cancerhe changed his name to jack hansen its not so unusual for immigrants to anglicize their names he was born in fes in and his parents left morocco in his father was a businessman who went back and forth frequently tateb only went back to morocco twice in thirty years he didnt like it his parents forced him to maintain an arabic education and his mother spoke to him only in french he wrote and spoke arabic fluently he graduated in mathematics but couldnt get a place as a postgraduate so he switched to arabic studies and wrote a thesis on arab mathematicians he came out of princeton with a doctorate in he spent time in the universities of madison minnesota and san francisco before ending up in new york he had a good life a university salary with the rent from his parents apartment coming in then when he landed the professorship at columbia he took over the apartment and had the perfect existence until he started sleeping with his students what about his religion hes down as a muslim but as you might have gathered from his history hed let that lapse was he known for any opinions about radical islam you can read the file sent over by the cia said pablo taking it out of his briefcase laying it on the table it looked to be about ten pages long are there any samples of his handwriting in here asked falcon not that ive seen can the cia send some across to us asked falcon flicking through the pages in both arabic script and english ill get them on to it any other languages apart from french english and arabic he spoke and wrote spanish too said pablo he used to give a maths course every summer over here at granada university comisario elvira told me that youre not much interested in our investigation any more and that juan has gone back to madrid said falcon does that mean youve cracked the code in the annotated versions of the koran juans been called back to madrid because there have been reports of other cells not connected with hammad and saoudi which are now on the move said pablo were still interested in your investigation but not in the way you are and no we havent cracked the code hows the diversion theory going madrid have hit dead ends with the hammad and saoudi connections said pablo arrests have been made but its the usual thing they only knew what they were doing they received encrypted emails and did what they were told to do so far weve only picked up a few associates of hammad and saoudi which hardly constitutes unravelling the whole networkif there was one to unravel were hoping yacoub can help us there what about the mila a story invented by the media based on some truththat this group does in fact existbut they werent involved in any way said pablo it was a neat followon from the abdullah azzam text sent to the abc something to capture the publics imagination but in the end bogus if you ask me its irresponsible journalism and vomit asked falcon did you break them down too thats not a priority for us said pablo riding over falcons irony were more concerned about future attacks on european countries which emanate from spain rather than an enumeration of the past so nothing has changed said falcon you still believe that miguel botin was a double and he was instructed to give the electricians card to the imam by someone in his radical islamic network i know you dont have any faith in it said pablo but we have more information than you do and youre not going to give it to me ask your old friend mark flowers said pablo ive got to go now you know it was a set of keys from the imams kitchen drawer that opened the fireproof box recovered from the storeroom of the mosque said falcon gregorio was with me when they opened it and he was very interested by that although as usual he didnt say why the cni was so fascinated this is just the way we have to be javier said pablo its nothing personal its just the nature of our work and the work of others in our business make sure you call me when the handwriting comes through from the cia said falcon what do you want us to do with it youve got a handwriting expert back in madrid havent you sure falcon bowed his head and started flicking through tateb hassanis file he knew it was childish but he wanted to show that two could play at the withholding information game gregorio and i will come by your house tonight he nodded waited for pablo to leave he closed the file sat back and let his mind wander the television was on and the four oclock news showed the evacuations of the schools and the biology faculty while the bomb squad went in with their dogs gradually a palimpsest of the arabic script found with the architects drawings appeared over the action images with a voiceover of their translations cut to a journalist outside the school trying to make something out of the fact that nothing as yet had been found on the premises the chair recently vacated by pablo slid into falcons vision he went back to the photographs of horizontes fortieth anniversary and the shot of banco omnis table thats what hed noticed an empty chair next to jesus alarcons wife monica a closer look showed that the chair had just been vacated by a man in a dark suit who was walking away against the dark background only a cuff of shirt a hand and his collar with some grey hair above it was visible the preschool was empty apart from a policewoman at the door and another on the computer in one of the classrooms the stink from the bombsite did not make it a popular location to hang out falcon logged on to the internet and entered horizonte fortieth anniversary he clicked on the first article which was from the business pages of the abc the byline jumped out at him because it was a zarrias he read through the article just looking for a mention of banco omni it was there but no names the photograph was of the horizonte board at the dinner he went for another article which had been published in a business magazine again the byline was for a zarrias falcon clicked on five other articles of which three had been placed by angel he must have been doing the pr for horizontes fortieth anniversary interesting he entered banco omni and horizonte into the search engine there were thousands of hits he scrolled down through the pages of hits until he got to articles written in he clicked on the articles not reading them but checking who placed them angel zarrias had written per cent of them so when angel had quit politics hed gone into journalism but hed also picked up a lucrative sideline in pr with banco omni who presumably put him in touch with horizonte he entered banco omni board of directors into the search engine he went back through the years pulling up articles on to the screen there were names but never any photographs in fact the only photograph he could find of any employees of banco omni was from the table shot taken at horizontes fortieth anniversary banquet sevillethursday th june hrs its taken me hours to get to speak to this person said ferrera but i think its been worth it ive got areliable witness to the dumping of the body which was later found on the rubbish dump outside seville we now have a name for that body hes called tateb hassani said falcon you didnt sound very sure of that word reliable he drinks which is never a good thing for a court to hear and im not sure we could ever get him to court anyway tell me what the guy saw and well worry about his credentials if it gets us anywhere he lives in an apartment at the end of a culdesac just off calle boteros his daughter owns the third and fourth floors of this building she lives on the third and her father lives above both apartments have the perfect view of those bins on the corner of calle boteros im sure thats why the daughter bought them said falcon and whats this guy doing awake at three in the morning looking out of his window hes an insomniac or rather he cant sleep at night only during the day she said he sleeps from eight until four the daughter wouldnt let me disturb him until shed given him lunch she knows that if she breaks his routine itll be hell for her for a week he goes straight into lunch said falcon she doesnt give him breakfast he likes to drink wine so she gives him something substantial to eat with it so whats his problem exactly quite unusual for a sevillano hes agoraphobic he cant go outside and he cant bear more than two people in a room i see the problem with the court appearance now said falcon anyway he was awake at three in the morning but not so drunk that he couldnt see what was going on by the bins he was drunk but he says it doesnt affect his vision said ferrera just after three oclock on sunday morning he saw a large dark estate car pull into the culdesac and reverse back towards the bins the driver and passenger got out of the front both male and a third man got out of the back the driver stood in the middle of calle boteros and looked up and down the other men opened the boot they checked the bins which were empty at that time of night tipped one of them on its side and leaned it against the rear of the car they reached into the back and dragged something into the bin they manoeuvred the bin which now appeared heavy back up to the pavement and returned to the rear of the car they removed two black bin liners which the witness described as bulky but light and swung them into the bin on top of whatever theyd just put in there they closed the bin the driver slammed the boot shut they got back into the car reversed into calle boteros and headed off in the direction of the alfalfa could he give you anything on the three men he thought from the way they moved that the two guys who did the work were youngby that he meant around thirty the driver was older thicker around the waist they were all dressed in dark clothes but seemed to be wearing what looked like white gloves i assume he means latex gloves the driver and one of the younger men had dark hair and the third was either bald or had had his head shaved not bad for an old drunk in an attic said falcon theres some street lighting on that corner said ferrera but stillnot bad for someone who his daughter says will drink until he falls over just dont include that in his witness statement said falcon what about these two bulky but light bin liners they threw on top of the body he thought they probably contained something like gardening detritushedge clippings that sort of thing why hes seen that sort of stuff thrown in there before but at the end of the afternoon not at three in the morning have you found any large houses in that area which might have that quantity of gardening detritus asked falcon its mostly apartments around the alfalfa they could have picked up a couple of bin liners of stuff from anywhere said ferrera if theyd done that those bin liners would have come out first whereas according to your friend they dealt with something heavy first ill see what i can find come to think of it felipe and jorge said they had a bin liner of clippings that theyd picked up near the body on the rubbish dump said falcon ill see if theyve had time to have a look at it yet ramirez called as falcon was on his way out to the forensics tent the imams mobile phone records said ramirez the cni have got them and they wont release them to me or rather pablo said he would look into it but now he doesnt take or return my calls ill see what i can do said falcon the forensic tent was filled with more than twenty masked and boilersuited individuals who were impossible to differentiate falcon called felipe and told him to come outside felipe remembered the gardening detritus which hed also had a chance to look at it was all from the same type of hedge he said the kind they use in ornamental gardens box hedge small shiny dark green leaves how fresh was it it had been cut that weekend friday afternoon or saturday any idea how much hedge wed be looking at remember that might have been just part of the clippings said felipe and i live in an apartment hedges are not my speciality calderon was lying on the folddown bed in his police cell his head was resting on his hands while his eyes stared at four squares of white sunlight high on the wall above the door when he closed his eyes the four squares burned red on the inside of his eyelids if he looked into the darkness of the cell they smouldered greenly he was calm enough for this he had been calm since the moment hed been caught trying to get rid of ines get rid of ines how had that phrase broken its way into his lexicon theyd brought him down to the jefatura in the earlymorning summer light he was shirtless because the forensics had bagged that horrifically bloodstained garment the cops had the air conditioning on even at that hour and his nipples were hard and he was shivering as they crossed the river two rowing eights out for early training slipped under the bridge and he had the sensation of an enormous weight coming off his shoulders the relaxing of the muscles in his neck and between his scapulae was almost erotic it was a powerful postfear drug that his body chemistry had concocted and it had the awkward result of arousing him he had gone through the process of incarceration dumbly like an animal for slaughter moving from transport to pen to holding cell with no idea of the implications a dna swab had been taken from the inside of his cheek hed been photographed and given an orange shortsleeve shirt the relief of finally being left alone with no possessions his belt removed and just a pack of cigarettes was immense his tiredness drew him to the bed he kicked off his loafers and sank back on the hard bunk and fell into a dreamless sleep until he was woken at three in the afternoon for lunch hed eaten and applied his ferocious intellect to what he was going to say in his interview with the detective before falling into this dazed state of looking at the squares of light on the wall it was unexpectedly pleasant to be released from the oppression of time at five oclock the guard came to tell him that inspector jefe luis zorrita was ready to interview him you are of course allowed to have your lawyer present said zorrita coming into the interview room i am a lawyer said calderon still with all his precrime arrogance lets get on with it zorrita made the introductions to the tape and asked calderon to confirm that hed been given the opportunity to have a lawyer present and had declined i didnt want to talk to you until id had the full autopsy report from the medico forense said zorrita now ive got that and had the opportunity to conduct my preliminary enquiries what sort of preliminary enquiries asked calderon just to show that he wasnt going to be passive ive more or less established what you and your wife had been doing over the last twentyfour hours before her murder more or less there are still some details to fill in on what your wife was doing yesterday afternoon thats all said zorrita so what id like you to do sr calderon is to tell me in your own words what happened last night from what time well lets start from the moment you left the canal sur studios and arrived at your lovers apartment said zorrita the time before that is well accounted for my lover that was the word marisa moreno used to describe your relationship said zorrita looking through his notes she was firm about not wanting to be called your mistress that admission from marisa made him feel quite sentimental how ridiculous it was that a police enquiry had drawn that from her having not thought about her very much since being arrested he suddenly missed her is that a fair description asked zorrita from your point of view yes i would say that we were lovers wed known each other for nine months or so it would explain why she was doing her best to protect you protect me she was trying to make out that youd left her apartment later than you had which would have made it more difficult for you to have murdered your wife i did not kill my wife said calderon summoning the full severity of his professional voice but she forgot that shed called a taxi for you and that we can access all the phone records as well as the cab company logs and talk to the driver himself of course so her attempts to help you were im afraid quite futile the interview was not following the pattern that calderon had outlined to himself in his lawyers mind while lying on his bunk hed witnessed only a few police interrogations in his time as a judge and so had little idea of the way in which they moved it was for this reason that barely a minute into his interview with zorrita he was in a quandary warmed by the thought that marisa had called him her lover but chilled by the idea that she believed he needed her help which had ugly implications the effect of these two extremes of temperature alive in his body was to undermine his equilibrium his thoughts would not line up in their usual orderly fashion but seemed to mill around like shoals of children careering around the school playground so sr calderon please tell me when you arrived at your lovers apartment it must have been about and what did you do we went out on to the balcony and made love made love said zorrita deadpan you didnt indulge in anal sex by any chance certainly not you seem very firm about that said zorrita and i only ask you such a personal question because the autopsy revealed that your wife seemed to be accustomed to being penetrated in this fashion panic rose in calderons chest he had lost control of the interview in a matter of a few exchanges his arrogance had cost him dear his assumption that he could trounce zorrita in any mind or word game had proved to be wide of the mark this was a man who was used to the wiliness of criminals and had come to the interview with a clear strategy which made calderons analytical brain seem worthless we made love said calderon unable to add anything more without making it sound like some biological transaction would you say that these two relationships generally worked in this fashion asked zorrita you treated your lover with respect and admiration while abusing your wife as if she was some cheap whore outrage was the first emotion that leapt into calderons throat but he was learning he saw zorritas two interrogating weapons emotional stabs followed by logical bludgeon i did not treat my wife like a cheap whore youre right of course because not even a cheap whore allows herself to be beaten up and sodomized for no money at all silence calderon gripped the edge of the table so hard his nails whitened with the pressure zorrita was unconcerned at least you dont have the temerity to deny that you treated your wife in such shameful fashion said zorrita i presume your lover didnt know these two sides to your personality who the fuck do you think you are to presume to know anything about my relationship with my wife or my lover said calderon through lips gone bloodless with rage some fucking inspector jefe come down from madrid now i can see why your wife would be terrified of you sr calderon said zorrita underneath that brilliant legal mind youre a very angry man i am not fucking angry said calderon pounding the table hard enough to jog a hank of his hair loose you are goading me inspector jefe if im goading you im not doing it by shouting at you or insulting you im only doing it by asking you questions based on proven fact the autopsy has revealed that you sodomized your wife and that you beat her up so badly that some of her vital organs were damaged theres also a history of humiliation which even extended to pursuing an affair with another woman on the same day that you announced your engagement to your wife whove you been talking to asked calderon still unable to control his fury as you know ive only had today to work on this case but ive managed to talk to your lover which was a very interesting conversation and a number of your colleagues and your wifes colleagues ive also spoken to some of the secretaries in the edificio de los juzgados and the palacio de justicia and the security guards of course who see everything of the twentyodd interviews ive conducted so far not one person has been prepared to defend your behaviour the least emotional description of your activities was an incorrigible womanizer what was so interesting about your conversation with marisa asked calderon unable to resist the bait of that remark she was telling me about a conversation you had about marriage do you remember that asked zorrita calderon blinked against the rush of memory too much had happened in too short a time the reason you married inesmaddy krugman how ines represented stability after thatcatastrophic affair what are you trying to do here inspector jefe jog your memory sr calderon you were there i wasnt ive only spoken to marisa you talked about the bourgeois institution of marriage and how she marisa wasnt interested in it you agreed with her didnt you what do you mean asked calderon you werent happy in your marriage but you didnt want to get divorced why was that asked zorrita calderon couldnt believe it he was in the elephant pit again he pulled himself together this time i believe that once youve made a commitment before god in church you should adhere to it he said but that wasnt what you said to your lover was it what did i say to her you said its not so easy what did you mean by that sr calderon its not as if were living in fear of excommunication any more breaking your vows wasnt your concern so what were you worried about even calderons giant brain couldnt compute the numerous possible answers to this question in less than half a minute zorrita sat back and watched the judge agonize over everything except the truth of the matter its not that difficult a question said zorrita after a full minutes silence everybody knows what the repercussions of divorce are if you want to extricate yourself from a legal commitment youre going to lose out what were you afraid of losing sr calderon put like that it didnt seem so bad yes it was a common fear for men facing divorce and he was no different the usual things he said finally i was worried about my financial situation and my apartment it was never a serious possibility ines was the only woman id ever were you concerned as well that it might affect your social status and perhaps your job asked zorrita i understand your wife had been very supportive of you after the maddy krugman debacle your colleagues said she helped you to get your career back on track his colleagues had said that there was never any serious threat to my career said calderon there was no question that i would be appointed as the juez de instruccion for something as important as the seville bombing for instance your lover offered you a solution to the problem though didnt she said zorrita what problem said calderon confused i just said there was no problem with my career and marisa the awkward problem of the divorce silence calderons memory baffled around his head like a moth seeking the light the bourgeois solution to the bourgeois problem said zorrita oh you mean that i could kill her said calderon snorting with derisive laughter that was just a silly joke yes on her part said zorrita but how did it affect your mind thats the question it was ridiculous an absurdity we both laughed at it thats what marisa said but how did it affect your mind silence it never for one moment entered my mind to kill my wife said calderon and i didnt kill her when did you first beat your wife sr calderon this interview was like a steeplechase with the fences getting higher as he progressed around the course zorrita watched the internal struggle that hed seen so many times before the unacceptable truth followed by the necessary delusion and the attempt to construct a lie from those two unreliable sources had you beaten her before the beginning of this week asked zorrita no he said firmly but instantly realized that it implied some admission of guilt thats cleared something up said zorrita making a note it was difficult for the medico forense to establish the occurrence of the first beating you gave her because well as i understand it old bruising isnt as easy to measure as saybody temperature dating old bruising is a difficult businessas is organ rupture and internal bleeding look said calderon inwardly gasping at these shocking revelations i know what youre trying to do id really like to establish a specific time when you first beat ines was it sunday night or monday morning they werent beatings they were accidents said calderon aghast that hed used the plural now and whatever the case it does not mean that i murdered my wifei didnt but did the first beating occur on sunday or monday asked zorrita or was it tuesday of course you used the plural so it was probably sunday monday tuesday and then finally and tragically wednesday and well never be able to attribute what bruise to which day what time did you get back on tuesday morning having spent the night with marisa it was around am well that squares with what marisa said and was ines asleep i thought she was but she wasnt said zorrita she woke up didnt she and what did she do all right she found my digital camera and started downloading the images i had on it they included two shots of marisa you must have been very angry when you found out when you came across her in the act caught her redhanded said zorrita not quite able to ease back on his relish she was very fragile your wife wasnt she the medico forense estimates her weight before the catastrophic blood loss as kilos look we were in the kitchen i just brushed her aside said calderon i didnt realize my own strength or her fragility she fell awkwardly against the kitchen counter its made out of granite but that doesnt explain the fist mark on her abdomen or the toe mark over her left kidney or the amount of her hair weve found distributed around your apartment calderon sat back his hands fell from the edge of the table he was not a career criminal and he was finding resistance very hard work the only time he could remember having to trump up such a quantity of lies was when hed been a small boy as i swept her aside i must have tapped her diaphragm she hit the counter and came down on my foot the autopsy found a ruptured spleen and a bleeding kidney said zorrita i think it was less of a tap and more of a punch wasnt it sr calderon the medico forense thinks from the shape of the bruise around her loin area and the darker red imprint of a toenail that it was more of a kick with a bare foot than someone falling on to a foot which would of course be flat on the floor silence and all that took place on tuesday morning yes said calderon how long was that after your lovers little joke about solving the problem of your divorce her joke had nothing to do with that all right when was the next time you beat your wife asked zorrita was it after you found out that your wife and lover had accidentally met in the murillo gardens how the fuck do you know that asked calderon i asked marisa if shed ever met your wife said zorrita and she started off by lying to me why did she do that do you think i dont know she said she hadnt but you know ive been interviewing liars more than half my working life and after a while its like dealing with children you become so practised at reading the signs that their attempts become laughable so why do you think she lied on your behalf on my behalf asked calderon she didnt do anything on my behalf why didnt she want me to know that she had had thisvocal confrontation with your late wife ive no idea because she was still angry about it sr calderon thats why said zorrita and if she was angry about being insulted by your wife about being called a whore in public by your wifeim wondering how she made you feel about itwell she told me she told you oh she tried to protect you again sr calderon she tried to make it sound like nothing she kept repeating estebans not a violent man that you were just annoyed but i think she also realized just how very very angry you were what did you do on the night that marisa told you ines had called her a whore more silence from calderon hed never found it so difficult to articulate he was too stoked up with emotion to find the right reply was that the night you came home and pummelled your wifes breasts and whipped her with your belt so that the buckle cut into her buttocks and thighs hed come into this interview with a sense of resistance as dense and powerful as a reinforced concrete dam and within half an hour of questioning all that was left were some cracked and frayed bean canes and then they caved in he saw himself in front of a state prosecutor facing these same questions and he realized the hopelessness of his situation yes he said on automatic unable to find even the schoolboy creativity to invent the ridiculous lie to obscure his brutality there was nothing ambiguous about the welt of a belt and the gouge of its buckle why dont you talk me through what happened on the last night of your wifes life said zorrita earlier wed reached the moment when youd just made love to marisa on the balcony calderons eyes found a point midway between himself and zorrita which he examined with the unnerving intensity of a man spiralling down to the darker regions of himself hed never had these things said to him before hed never had these things revealed to him under such emotional circumstances he was stunned by his brutality and he couldnt understand where in all his urbanity it came from he even tried to imagine himself dealing out these beatings to ines but they wouldnt come to him he did not see himself like that he did not see esteban calderons fists raining down on his fineboned wife it had been him there was no doubt about that he saw himself before and after the act he remembered the anger building up to the beatings and it subsiding afterwards it struck him that he had been in the grip of a blind savagery a violence so intense that it had no place in his civilized frame a terrifying doubt began to crowd his chest and affect the motor reflex of his breathing so that he had to concentrate in out in out and it was there in the lowest and darkest circle of his spiralling thoughts the completely lightless zone of his soul that he realized that he could have murdered her javier falcon had told him once that there was no greater denial than that of a man who had murdered his wife the thought terrified him into a state of profound concentration hed never looked with such microscopic detail into his mind before he began to talk but as if he was describing a film scene by horrible scene he was exhausted he had been completely drained by the experiences of the day he stumbled into the bedroom collapsed on to the bed and passed out immediately he was aware only of pain he lashed out wildly with his foot he woke up with no idea where he was she told him he had to get up it was past three oclock he had to go home he couldnt wear the same clothes as he had yesterday and appear on television she called a taxi she took him down in the lift he wanted to sleep on her shoulder in the street the cab arrived and she spoke to the driver he fell into the back seat and his head rolled back he was only vaguely aware of movement and of light flashing behind his eyelids the door opened hands pulled at him he gave the driver his house keys the driver opened the door to the building he slapped on the light they walked up the stairs together the driver opened the apartment door two turns of the lock the driver went back down the stairs the hall light went out he went into the apartment and saw light coming from the kitchen he was annoyed he didnt want to see her he didnt want to have to explainagain he moved towards the light calderon paused because he was suddenly unsure of what he was going to see his foot crossed the edge of the shadow and stepped into the light he turned into the frame calderon was blinking at the tears in his eyes he was so relieved to see her standing there at the sink in her nightdress she turned when she heard his footfall he was going to skirt the table and pull her to him and squeeze his love into her but he couldnt move because when she turned she didnt open her arms to him she didnt smile her dark eyes did not glisten with joythey opened wide with abject terror and what happened asked zorrita what asked calderon as if coming to you turned into the kitchen doorway and what did you do asked zorrita i dont know said calderon surprised to find his cheeks wet he wiped them with the flat of his palms and brushed them down his trousers its not unusual for people to have blank moments about terrible things that they have done said zorrita tell me what you saw when you turned into the doorway of the kitchen she was standing at the kitchen sink he said i was so happy to see her happy said zorrita i thought you were annoyed no he said holding his head in his hands no it wasi was lying on the floor you were lying on the floor yes i woke up on the floor in the corridor and i went back to the kitchen light and it was then that i saw ines lying on the floor he said there was a terrible quantity of blood and it was very very red but how did she end up lying on the floor asked zorrita one moment she was standing and the next shes lying on the floor in a pool of blood what did you do to her i dont know that she was standing said calderon searching his mind for that image to see if it really existed let me tell you a few facts about your wifes murder sr calderon as you said the cab driver opened the door of the apartment for you with two turns of the key in the lock that means the door had been double locked from the inside your wife was the only person in the apartment yeees said calderon concentrating on zorritas every syllable hoping they would give him the vital clue that would unlock his memory when the medico forense took your wifes body temperature down by the river it was c she was still warm the ambient temperature last night was c that means your wife had just been killed the autopsy revealed that your wifes skull had been smashed at the back that there had been a devastating cerebral haemorrhage and two neck vertebrae had been shattered examination of the crime scene has revealed blood and hair on the black granite work surface and a further large quantity of blood on the floor next to your wifes head which also contained bone fragments and cerebral matter the dna samples taken from your apartment belong only to you and to your wife the shirt that was taken from you down by the river was covered in your wifes blood your wifes body showed indications of your dna on her face neck and lower limbs the scene in the kitchen of your apartment was consistent with someone who had picked ines up by the shoulders or neck and thrown her down on the granite work surface is that what you did sr calderon i only wanted to embrace her said calderon whose face had broken up into the ugliness of his inner turmoil i just wanted to hold her close sevillethursday th june hrs the taberna coloniales was at the end of the plaza cristo de burgos there was something colonial about its green windows long wooden bar and stone floor it was well known for the excellence of its tapas and it was popular for its traditional interior and the seating outside on the pavement of the plaza this was angel and manuelas local falcon didnt want angels journalistic nose anywhere near the police work around the destroyed apartment block nor did he want to have to discuss anything sensitive in the glass cylinder of the abc offices on the isla de la cartuja most important of all he needed to be close to angels home so that there would be the least trouble possible for him to give falcon what he wanted this was why he was sitting outside the taberna coloniales under a calico umbrella sipping a beer and biting into the chilled flesh of a fat green olive waiting for angel to appear he took a call from pablo the americans have sent over the handwriting samples you asked forthe arabic and english script belonging to jack hansen he looks more like a tateb hassani to me than a jack hansen said falcon what do you want us to do with the samples ask your handwriting experts to make a comparison between tateb hassanis arabic script and the notes attached to the drawings found in the fireproof box in the mosque and compare the english script to the handwritten notes in the copies of the koran found in the peugeot partner and miguel botins apartment you think he was one of them asked pablo i dont get it lets make the comparison first and the deductions afterwards said falcon and by the way the imams mobile phone recordswe need to have a look at them one of those numbers he called on sunday morning belongs to the electrician ive spoken to juan about that said pablo gregorios checked out all the numbers the imam called on sunday morning the only one he couldnt account for was made to a phone registered in the name of a seventyfouryearold woman living in seville este who has never been an electrician id like access to those records said falcon thats something else for you to talk to your old friend flowers about said pablo and hung up falcon sipped his beer and tried to persuade himself that he was calm and that the present strategy was the right one hed taken serrano and baena away from their task of touring the building sites looking for the electricians and had directed them to help ferrera locate the hedge whose clippings had been dumped with the body ramirez and perez had photographs of tateb hassani and were walking the streets around the alfalfa trying to find anybody who recognized him this meant that no one from the homicide squad was now working on anything directly linked to the seville bombing he wasnt worried about elvira for the moment the comisario had his hands too full of public relations problems to be worried about the gamble falcon was taking for a man whos supposed to be running the largest criminal investigation in sevilles history youre looking remarkably relaxed javier said angel taking a seat ordering a beer we have to present a calm exterior to a nervous population who need to believe that somebody has everything under control said falcon does that mean that it isnt under control asked angel comisario elvira is doing a good job he might be from the policemans point of view said angel but he doesnt imbue the general public with confidence in his ability hes a public relations disaster javier what was he thinking of asking that poor bastardthe judge sergio del rey yeshim putting him on national television when the guy could barely have had time to read the files let alone comprehend the emotional aspect of the case said angel the comisario must know by now that television is not about the truth is he the kind of guy who watches reality tv and thinks that it is reality dont be too hard on him angel hes got a lot of excellent qualities that just dont happen to suit the televisual age well unfortunately thats the age were in now said angel now calderon he was the man he gave the tv what it craves drama humour emotion and brilliant surface he was a huge loss to your effort you said it brilliant surface it wasnt so pretty underneath and how do you think you look now asked angel remember the london bombings what was the story that kept rolling out in the days after those attacks the story that maintained the emotional pitch and focused the emotions not the victims not the terrorists not the bombs and the disruption that was all part of it but the big story was the mistaken shooting by plainclothes special policemen of that brazilian guy jean charles de menezes and whats our big story thats your problem its the arrest under suspicion of his wifes murder of the juez de instruccion of the whole investigation have you seen the stuff coming out of the television about calderon just listen the tables around them had filled up and a crowd had gathered outside the open doors of the bar they were all talking about esteban calderon did he do it didnt he do it not your investigation not the terrorist cells that might be active in seville at the moment not even the little girl who survived the collapse of the building said angel its all about esteban calderon tell comisario elvira that i have to say angel that for a man who loves seville more than almost anyone i know you seembuoyant its terrible isnt it i am i havent felt as energized in years manuelas infuriated i think she preferred me when i was dying of boredom how is she depressed she thinks shes got to sell the house in el puerto de santa maria in fact she is selling it said angel shes lost her nerve this whole idea of the islamic liberation of andalucia has taken hold in her mind so now shes selling the gold mine to save the tin and copper mines theres no talking to her when shes like that said falcon so why are you so buoyant angel if youre not watching the news very much you probably dont know that my little hobby is doing rather well you mean fuerza andalucia said falcon i saw jesus alarcon with fernando alanis on television a few hours ago did you see the whole thing it was sensational after that programme fuerza andalucia picked up per cent in the polls wildly inaccurate i know its all emotional reaction but thats per cent more than weve ever polled before and the left are floundering when did you first meet jesus alarcon asked falcon genuinely curious years ago said angel and i didnt much care for him he was a bit of a boring banker type and i was dismayed when he said he wanted to go into politics i didnt think anybody would vote for him he was a stiff in a suit and as you know these days its not about your policies or your grasp of regional politics its all about how you come across but ive got to know him better since he came down here and i tell you this relationship hes developed with fernando alanisits gold dust as a pr man you just dream of something like that was that the first time you met himwhen you were doing pr work when i left politics i did a pr commission for banco omni that must have been nice work to walk into said falcon we catholics stick together said angel winking actually the chief executive officer and i are old friends we went to school university did our national service together when i finished with those wankers in the partido popular he knew that i wouldnt be able to just retire so he commissioned me and it led to other things they were the bankers for a group in barcelona and i did their fortieth anniversary pr for them then there was an insurance group in madrid and a property company on the costa del sol there was a business for me if i could have been bothered with it but you know javier corporate pr its sosmall youre not going to change the world doing that shit you didnt change it in politics to tell you the truth the pp was no different it was like working for a huge corporation play safe toe the party line everything happening by millimetres no striding out to new horizons and changing the way people think and live who wants change said falcon most people hate change so much that we have to have wars and revolutions to bring it about but look at us now javier talking like this in a bar said angel why because were in crisis our way of life is being threatened you said it yourself angel most people cant cope with it so what do they talk about youre right its esteban calderon on everybodys lips said angel but at least its not the usual trivia its tragedy its hubris bringing down the great man so what would you tell comisario elvira to do now asked falcon aha is this what its all about javier said angel smirking youve brought me down here to get some free advice for your boss i want the pr mans take on the world you have to focus and you have to focus on certainty because of the nature of the attack its been difficult for you but now youve finally got into the mosque its time for you to reveal more and be specific the evacuations of the schools and university buildings whats that all about people need a bone to chew on uncertainty creates rumour which does nothing to quell panic juez del reys mistake was that he hadnt taken the pulse of the city so when he started spreading uncertainty again it was the interviewers question that spread uncertainty said falcon that wasnt the way the viewers saw it del rey only found out afterwards that someone had leaked the arabic script del rey should never have presented the truth of the situation that there is still considerable confusion about what went on in that mosque he should have pressed home the certainties if in the end the truth happens to be something else you just change your story your investigation lost a lot of its credibility when your spokesman was arrested for murder the only chance of regaining that credibility lies in confirming the publics suspicions the interviewer knew that the public would be in no mood to be told that there might be a homegrown element to this terrorist plot elvira has trouble deciding when to use what kind of truth so that his investigation can get on with the business of finding out what actually happened said falcon politics is great preparation for that said angel so you think jesus alarcon has got what it takes hes made a good start but its too early to say its whats going to happen six or seven months from now thats important said angel hes riding a big wave of public emotion now but even the biggest waves end up as ripples on the beach he could always go back to the banco omni if it didnt work out they wouldnt have him said angel you dont leave the banco omni once theyve given you a job they take you into their confidence if you leave them and become an outsider thats where you remain so jesus is taking some risks not really he had a good introduction from my friend who thinks very highly of him hell find him something else to do if it all comes to nothing have i met this mysterious friend of yours lucrecio arenas i dont know manuelas met him hes not so mysterious now that hes retired you mean he was mysterious before banco omni is a private bank it runs a hefty percentage of the catholic churchs finances its a secretive organization you wont even see any photographs of banco omni executives i did a specific pr job for them but i only got that job because of lucrecio i found out nothing about the organization other than what i needed to know in order to perform my task said angel why are we talking about banco omni because jesus alarcon is the man of the moment said falcon after esteban calderon ah yes you still havent told me what you want to see me about said angel im sounding you out angel said falcon shrugging i told elvira about our conversation earlier today when you offered to help us but hes wary i want to be able to go back to him and make him feel better about employing your talents he just needs to be pushed thats all im prepared to help in a crisis said angel but im not looking for permanent work elviras problem is that he sees you as a journalist and therefore the enemy said falcon if i can talk to him about your pr activity and the sort of clients youve represented that will give him a different perspective ill give advice but i wont be employed said angel some might think there was a conflict of interest just give me some other company names that youve worked for said falcon who was it you represented for their fortieth anniversary horizonte the property company was called mejorvista and the insurance group was vigilancia said angel dont promote me too much javier ive got my work cut out steering fuerza andalucia through the media maze the only thing is that pr is a difficult concept to sell other peoples press cuttings are meaningless if i could show elvira the quality of the people youve worked for that might help have you got shots of the people at horizonte or banco omni or something from the horizonte fortieth anniversary celebrations you know pictures of angel zarrias with senior executives elvira likes tangible things of course javier anything for you just dont oversell me were in crisis said falcon both our instructing judges have been discredited we have to rebuild our image before its too late elvira is a good policeman and i dont want to see him fail just because he doesnt know how to play the media game they went up to the apartment manuela wasnt there it was a huge fourbedroomed place with two of the bedrooms used as offices angel walked to the wall of his study and pointed at a shot in the middle thats the one you want he said tapping a framed photograph in the centre of the wall thats a rare shot of all the executives of horizonte and banco omni in the same place it was taken for the fortieth anniversary event ive got a copy of it somewhere angel sat at his desk opened a drawer and went through a stack of photographs falcon searched the shot for a likeness of the police artists drawing of the man seen with ricardo gamero which one is lucrecio arenas asked falcon i dont see anybody i recognize here if id met him where would that have been he has a house in seville although he doesnt live in it for half the year his wife cant stand the heat so they go and live in some palatial villa built for them by mejorvista down in marbella said angel you remember that big dinner i had in the restaurante la juderia last october he was there i was away teaching a course at the police academy angel gave him the shot and pointed out lucrecio arenas who was in the centre while angel was on the very edge of the two rows of men arenas had similarities to the police artists drawing in that he was the right age but there was no revelatory moment thanks for this said falcon dont lose it said angel who put it in an envelope for him what about this shot of you and king juan carlos said falcon have you got a copy of that they both laughed the king doesnt need me to do his pr for him said angel hes a natural are you getting anywhere jose luis asked falcon i cant believe it but weve drawn a total blank said ramirez if tateb hassani was staying with someone in this area he didnt go for a coffee he didnt eat a tapa drink a beer buy bread go to the supermarket get a newspapernothing nobody has seen this guy before and hes got a face you dont forget any news from cristina and emilio theyve seen most of the big houses in the area and there are no box hedges theyve all got internal patios rather than gardens theres the convento de san leandro and the casa pilatos but that doesnt help us much i want you to find and check out another house i dont have the address but it belongs to someone called lucrecio arenas said falcon and i spoke to the cni about the imams phone records theyve checked out the electricians number already it was a dead end can we have a look at those records ourselves theyve become classified documents said falcon and hung up he was on his way to see the security guard whod finished his shift at the archaeological museum and gone home it was a long drive out to his apartment in the northeast of the city he took a call from pablo youre going to be pleased about this the cni man said our handwriting expert has matched the arabic script to the notes attached to the architects drawings of the schools and the biology faculty hes also matched tateb hassanis english script to the annotations in both copies of the koran what does this mean javier im not absolutely sure of its greater significance but im confident you can tell your code breakers to stop looking for a key to crack the nonexistent cipher in those copies of the koran said falcon i think they were planted in the peugeot partner and miguel botins apartment specifically to confuse us and thats all you can say for the moment ill be seeing you later at my house said falcon im hoping it will all be clearer by then the lift to the security guards apartment on the sixth floor was not working falcon was sweating as he rang the doorbell the wife and kids were despatched to bedrooms and falcon laid the photograph down on the diningroom table his heart was beating tight and fast willing the guard to find lucrecio arenas do you see the older man in this photograph there were two rows of men about thirty in all the security guard had done this before he took two pieces of paper and isolated each face from the rest of the shot and took a good look at it he started on the left and worked his way across he studied them carefully falcon couldnt bear the tension and looked out of the window it took the guard some time he knew it must be important for an inspector jefe to come all the way out to his apartment to show him this shot thats him said the guard im absolutely sure of it falcons heart was thundering as he looked down but the guard wasnt pointing at lucrecio arenas in the centre of the shot he was tapping the face at the extreme right of the second rowand that face belonged to angel zarrias sevillethursday th june hrs the sun was setting on the third day since the explosion as falcon drove back into the city his mind reached a static but profound level of concentration focused entirely on angel zarrias back in the security guards apartment hed become quite angry hed torn the police sketch out of his pocket smoothed it out on the diningroom table and asked the poor guy to show him the similarities falcon had been forced to admit a few things that all old people looked the same or invisible to younger people that angel was m and only a little heavier than kilos that angel had no facial hair and he did have a side parting and even if he was a bit thin on top he used all available hair to make it look as if he was still hanging on to it only when the security guard had talked him through the jaw line and nose did falcon see angel in the sketch as an adult finally sees the outline of a face in a cloud as pointed out by a frustrated child ramirez met him in the car park outside the preschool we found lucrecio arenass house said ramirez it was in the plaza mercenarias i sent cristina over there to take a look and it was all closed up the neighbours say they dont spend much time there in the summer and theres no garden only an internal patio they didnt recognize tateb hassani either they went into the classroom at the back where juez del rey and comisario elvira were waiting eight hours sleep in three days was ruining elvira they sat down they were all exhausted even del rey who should have been fresh looked rumpled as if hed been jostled by a disgruntled crowd good news or bad asked elvira both said falcon the good news is that ive identified the man seen speaking to ricardo gamero in the archaeological museum in the hours before he killed himself name angel zarrias silence as if theyd all seen someone sustain an ugly blow hes your sisters partner isnt he said ramirez how did you identify him asked elvira falcon briefed them on his conversation outside the taberna coloniales and how hed extracted the horizontebanco omni executive photograph from angel but thats only part of the bad news said falcon the other part is that im not sure whether this gets us any further down the chain meaning what have we found out that will help us apply pressure on zarrias to reveal more said ramirez exactly said falcon he was the last person to speak to ricardo gamero but so what he knew gamero from church and thats the end of it why did he go to zarrias and not his priest his priest is dead what did they talk about gamero was very upset what about maybe zarrias will give the same answer that marco barreda gave me perhaps zarrias told barreda to tell me that gamero had been a closet gay we dont know enough to be able to crack him open i cant believe that ricardo gamero would go to angel zarrias at that particular moment to discuss emotional problems said del rey you could show zarrias the shot of tateb hassani and see what reaction you get said elvira neither elvira nor del rey had heard from pablo so falcon told them about tateb hassani and how his handwriting matched that of the documents found in the fireproof box from the mosque and the notes found in the two copies of the koran and why did you ask for that comparison to be made in the first place asked elvira it went back to a question i asked my officers when we first discovered the dead body on the rubbish dump why kill a man and take such drastic steps to destroy his identity you would only do that because knowledge of the victims identity would lead investigators to people known to the victim or because knowledge of his expertise might jeopardize a future operation tateb hassanis identity revealed a number of things his expertise as a professor of arabic studies meant that he could write arabic and would have a sound knowledge of the koran he had also given maths classes in granada during the summer months and therefore spoke and wrote spanish his profile was not that of an islamic militanthe was an apostate a sexual predator and a drinker of alcohol once he lost his job at columbia university which had cost him his new york apartment he became so desperate for money that hed taught maths privately in columbus ohio which was the home of iit who own horizonte who in turn own informaticalidad finally i was not comfortable with the fact that the keys found in the imams apartment which successfully opened the fireproof box from the mosque had been discovered in the kitchen drawer and not in the imams desk with his other keys this struck me as a plant by someone who had access to the imams apartment but not his study when he wasnt there who would have planted the keys botin under instructions from gamero said ramirez at the beginning of this investigation juan was telling us to keep an open mind and not to look at this attack historically because there is no pattern in the way islamic terrorists work thats true thats their style each attack comes out of the blue and theres always some new twist that teases greater terror into the mind of the west just think about the virtuosity of the attacks experienced so far when i was driving back from the security guards apartment something that struck me about the seville bombing was its lack of originality of course that wasnt my first thought my first thought was these terrorists are prepared to attack residential property but now im beginning to see that the seville bomb refers back to some element in those previous attacks the collapse of the apartment building reminded us of the moscow apartment blocks coming down in the discovery of the islamic sash the hood and the koran in the peugeot partner reminded us of the koran tapes and detonators found in the renault kangoo outside the station at alcala de henares the use of goma eco in the device planted in the mosque reminded us of the explosive used on th march the threat to the two schools and the biology faculty was reminiscent of beslan it was as if the person who planned this operation was drawing inspiration from something in those previous attacks vomit said ramirez if theres anybody who knows everything there is to know about islamic terrorist attacks its the author of that website and now that the security guard has pointed the finger at angel zarrias theres a logic to it hes a journalist but hes also a pr man he knows how things work in the human mind said falcon im now asking myself who leaked the arabic script found in the fireproof box to canal sur or rather who didnt have to leak it because it was already in their possession and who planted the stories about the mila who sent the abdullah azzam text to the abc in madrid from seville how far do you think this goes said elvira if they planted the korans the hood and the sash was it because they knew about the hexogen i dont think so said falcon i think the idea was conceived as just an attack against the mosque and the people in it they were getting information from miguel botin via ricardo gamero that something was happening the cgi had been frustrated in their first attempt to get a bugging order gamero found another way or rather another way was revealed to him by zarrias which was that the mosque could be put under surveillance by informaticalidads sales reps once it appeared that hammad and saoudi were making sinister preparations they decided to kill them and anybody else unfortunate enough to be in the mosque at the time before they could carry out the attack they were planning the decision was made the surveillance terminated the apartment on calle los romeros rented out again meanwhile the fake council inspectors went into the mosque laid a small device that would blow the fuse box which would give the electricians access miguel botin was given the electricians card and told to make it available to the imam its quite possible that botin wasnt part of the conspiracy and that he was told by gamero that they had now been granted a bugging order and these electricians were going to position the microphone so that the cgi could carry out their surveillance botin was there to ensure that the imam made the call to the right electricians the goma eco bomb was planted along with the fireproof box the design of the attack was to make it look like a bomb had gone off in the preparatory stage everybody would be killed and the ultimate atrocious aim of the plot that was supposedly being planned would be found in the fireproof box they knew that hammad and saoudi were up to no good but what i dont believe they realized was just how powerful the explosive was that they were storing in the mosque the detonation of kilos of hexogen and the complete destruction of the apartment building and the damage to the preschool were not part of the plan and that was why ricardo gamero killed himself not just because his friend and source had been killed but also because he felt responsible for all the deaths well that returns the logic to the scenario said elvira but first of all i cant see angel zarrias as the sole perpetrator and mastermind of this conspiracy and secondly i dont know how the hell you set about proving any of it so that it can stand up in a court of law the problem is that if this scenario is the correct one i cannot go to angel zarrias and reveal my hand because the only cards ive got are the fact that i know he was the last person to speak to gamero face to face and the shock value of having identified tateb hassani you have to find the next link in the chain after angel zarrias said del rey hes a journalist and a pr man what are his pr connections thats how i got to him in the first place said falcon i was sure that the people from informaticalidad couldnt be operating on their own i assumed they would be getting orders from their parent company i looked at horizonte and thats where i came across their bankers banco omni and and jesus alarcon used to work for banco omni said falcon more things occurring to him he was put forward as a political candidate by angel zarriass old friend the chief executive of banco omni lucrecio arenas political candidate for what asked del rey hes the new leader of fuerza andalucia but fuerza andalucia are nowhere in regional politics said elvira they poll per cent of the vote if theyre lucky after jesus alarcon appeared with fernando alanis on television today they polled per cent said falcon zarrias was very excited about it he calls the pr work he does for fuerza andalucia his hobby but i think its bigger than that hes looking for a share of power with the partido popular because for once in his political life he wants to have the strength to change things i think hes trying to manoeuvre jesus alarcon into a position where he can challenge for the leadership of the partido popular i dont think im exaggerating when i say that he is to jesus alarcon what karl rove was to george bush so who is the next link in the chain asked del rey tateb hassani was staying somewhere while he was being put to work and it was there that he was probably killed said falcon i had assumed it would be in a house near where he was dumped the bins were in a culdesac on a quiet street and that implied knowledge that knowledge i realize came from zarrias who lives nearby on the plaza cristo de burgos im now thinking that the house where tateb hassani was probably staying was the headquarters of fuerza andalucia which belongs to eduardo rivero on calle castelar does it have a garden asked ramirez with a hedge there is some sort of formal garden between the front of the house where rivero has the office and the back part which is the family home i went there once with angel and manuela for a party but it was in the dark and i wasnt looking at hedges what we need now is a sighting of tateb hassani going into that house which will give us our next link in the chain what about angel zarrias asked ramirez do you think its worth putting him under twentyfourhour surveillance i think it would be especially as it might not be for long said falcon but there is something else which bothers me about all this and that is the killing tateb hassani was poisoned with cyanide said ramirez its not like stabbing shooting or strangling first of all how did they get hold of cyanide asked falcon and then there was the disfigurement the clean amputation of the hands im thinking there must be a doctor or surgeon involved in all this and what about the bomb said ramirez it takes real criminal ruthlessness to do something like that falcon called angel zarrias to arrange a meeting with comisario elvira to talk about reviving the image of the investigative team theyd agreed to profess an interest in zarriass pr talents it would also bring zarrias to them so that serrano and baena could start the first shift of the surveillance it was too risky for falcon to be seen in calle castelar near eduardo riveros house where he might be recognized the work of placing tateb hassani in riveros household fell to ferrera perez and ramirez elvira del rey and falcon waited in the preschool for angel to turn up youre not happy javier said elvira are you concerned about how this will affect your relationship with your sister no that does concern me but its not that said falcon what im thinking about now is that if my scenario proves to be the correct one it still doesnt explain why hammad and saoudi brought kilos of hexogen to seville thats the cnis job not yours said elvira what scares me is that if you did want to bring andalucia back into the islamic fold without an army or navy then your best chance of achieving that would be with a beslantype siege said falcon i thought at the time that the russian special forces probably started that firefight because putin could see how impossible the situation was becoming he had to act before the global media circus made it an intense emotional focal point once that happened he could only see himself making concessions putins reputation is built on strength and toughness he couldnt allow a bunch of terrorists to make him look weak so he met their ruthlessness with his own and more than three hundred people died if a similar situation happened here with children taken hostage just at the moment when they should be going on holiday can you imagine the reaction in spain europe and the world putinstyle ruthlessness would not be acceptable steps have been taken said elvira we cant go through all the schools in andalucia in the same way that weve gone through the three buildings here in seville but weve told them to search their premises and weve got the local police involved too youve also told us that you believe the idea of mila involvement to be a media invention of zarrias said del rey so we have no real idea what the islamic terrorists original intention was but why bring powerful explosive to seville the capital of andalucia said falcon theres an unnerving brilliance to the idea of the mila launching a ruthless attempt to bring andalucia back into the islamic fold its as if the fiction and the truth could easily meet have we had any results from the dna sampling are we certain that hammad and saoudi died in the mosque do we know yet whether they deviated from their route between the safe house in valmojado and seville the forensics have been told to contact me as soon as theyve had confirmation but i doubt that will be today said elvira we havent heard anything more from the guardia civil about the route of the peugeot partner dont try to overthink this situation javier just concentrate on your task angel zarrias arrived at pm falcon made the introductions and left them to it he went over to the forensics tent they were working under lights on the bombsite which was almost flat the crane had gone as had the diggers only one tipper was waiting to remove any further rubble falcon changed into a boiler suit and went into the tent which was bright with halogen light he found the chief of the forensics hovering over a vast array of rags bits of shoe plastic strips of leather he introduced himself again im looking for anything that could be construed as an instruction for making and placing bombs said falcon something more than what weve already found in the fireproof box detail about the bomb making is what im after said falcon it might have been sewn into a jacket lining or in a wallet weve still got plenty of work to do to get into the mosque we got to the fireproof box early because it happened to have been blown upwards in the blast he said were working our way downwards now but its piecebypiece work with everything having to be documented as we go tomorrow morning will be the earliest that well get into the main body of the mosque i just wanted you to know that were still looking for another piece in the jigsaw said falcon it could be in code numbers or arabic script there were ten people working outside under the lights it was similar to an archaeological dig with a plan of the mosque under a reference grid on a table where each find was logged the forensics were barely thirty centimetres below ground level the stink of putrefaction was still heavy in the warm air they worked in silence and low murmurs it was hard gruesome work falcon put a call through to mark flowers and asked for a meeting sure where are you im at the bombsite now but i was thinking a good place to meet would be the apartment of imam abdelkrim benaboura said falcon you know where that is dont you mark flowers didnt respond to the sarcasm falcon walked to the imams apartment which was in a block nearby similar to the one that had been destroyed there was a permanent police guard on the door falcon showed his id and the guard said that he did not have the authority to allow him to enter you know who i am said falcon yes inspector jefe but youre not on my list can i see your list sorry sir thats classified the guards mobile rang and he took the call listening intently hes already here he said and hung up he unlocked the door and let falcon in the cni men had not been exaggerating about the quantity of books in the apartment the living and dining rooms were lined with books and the bedroom floors were stacked with them they covered all areas of human knowledge and were mostly in french and english although there was a whole room given over to arabic texts the back room should have been the master bedroom but was the imams study with just a single bed at one end and his desk at the other the walls were covered in books falcon sat at the desk in a wooden swivel chair he looked through the drawers which were empty he swivelled in the chair and reached for a book on the nearest shelf it was called riemanns zeta function he put it back without troubling to open it hed read them all said flowers standing at the door pretty amazing to think of all this knowledge in one guys head we had a few people in langley with this kind of reading behind them but not many how long had you known him said falcon assuming that hes dead im sure hes dead said flowers we met in afghanistan in he was a kid then but he was one of the few mujahedeen who spoke english because although he was born in algeria he went to school in egypt we were supplying them with weapons and tactics to fight the russians he appreciated what we did for them helping to keep those atheistic communists out of the land of allah as you know not many of the others did isnt there a saying about helping people being the quickest road to resentment and you kept in touch all this time there have been breaks as youd expect i lost track of him in the s and then we resumed contact in i dug him out on one of my foraging trips to tunis he never bought into the taliban and all that wahhabi stuff as you probably gathered he was a bright guy and he couldnt find an interpretation of any line of the koran that approved of suicide bombing he was one of them but he saw things very clearly and you didnt think to tell one of your new spies who was investigating hey look javier you had the information from day one juan told you he didnt have clearance for his history and that the americans had vouched for him on his visa application what more do you want his cv dont expect to be spoonfed in this game said flowers i cant have it released into the public domain that i was running an imam as a spy in a local mosque in seville and thats why we didnt get in here said falcon and why we didnt get access to his phone records i had to make sure the place was clear of anything that might implicate him in cia work that meant going through all these books said flowers and im not irresponsible i made sure the cni checked out the electricians number all right i accept that i should have been a bit moreaware said falcon did benaboura tell you about hammad and saoudi no he didnt that must have hurt you dont understand the pressure on these people said flowers he gave me plenty of useful information names movements all sorts of stuff but he didnt tell me about hammad and saoudi because he couldnt you mean he couldnt risk telling you about them and you then acting on the information with the result that all fingers would be pointing at abdelkrim benaboura youre learning javier did he know about miguel botin benaboura was an experienced guy i see said falcon thinking that through so he decided that miguel botin was an acceptable route for the information about hammad and saoudi to come out which was why he used the electricians botin put forward he read that situation very clearly he understood why the fake council inspectors came in he appreciated the fuse box blowing and the right electrician being put in his hand said flowers what he didnt expect was for the electricians to plant a bomb as well as a microphone there was a microphone of course he had to find out where it was so that he could have his conversations there said flowers they put it in the plug socket in his office i wonder if that was in use and who was listening to it said falcon what did the cni have to say about it it was supposed to be the cgi who planted it said flowers botin was working for gamero who was with the cgi and i never spoke to them about it because i was told that there was a security problem in their ranks what about the extra socket benaboura had installed in the storeroom that was probably a request from hammad and saoudi said flowers he never spoke to me about it so you didnt know about the hexogen either it would have all come out when benaboura was ready for it to come out did he pick up on the surveillance in the apartment across the street said flowers he was so amazed at how unprofessional it was hed begun to think it wasnt surveillance did you talk to somebody about that on his behalf i asked juan and he said it wasnt anything to do with them and he nosed around the cgi for me and said they werent involved either i had a look in the apartment myself one evening and it was empty no equipment i didnt bother with it any more after that youre uncharacteristically allowing me to ask a lot of questions its all old news you dont seem bothered by the fact that botins electricians put a bomb in the mosque oh im bothered javier im very bothered by that ive lost one of my best agents do you buy the cnis story that botin was a double said flowers that the islamic terrorists he was working for knew about benaboura and wanted to get rid of him and hammad and saoudi thats bullshit said flowers bitterly but im not thinking about that now its your job to rummage in the past now youre thinking what were hammad and saoudi going to do with kilos of hexogen in seville the gicm are not interested in returning andalucia to the islamic fold said flowers their priority is to make morocco an islamic state under sharia law but they do hold the same feelings about the west as those people we call alqaeda is it certain that hammad and saoudi were gicm theyve worked for them before so what was the hexogen going to be used for and was there more of it elsewhere asked flowers those are the big unanswerable questions it was probably still in its raw form when it exploded we can only hope for more clues when we get into the mosque what would have had to be done to it to make it usable normally theyd have mixed it with some plastique so that it could be moulded the best clue would be to find what they were going to pack it into the hardware but if you wanted to destroy a building you could just stick it all in a suitcase put it in the boot of a car and drive it through the entrance thats correct do you know what the cni are working on asked falcon realizing now that his conversation with flowers was no longer evolving youd have to ask them said flowers but my advice to you is to do what youre paid to do javier stick to the past falcons mobile vibrated it was ramirez he took the call in the kitchen well away from flowers we can confirm a sighting of tateb hassani in riveros house said ramirez we werent having any luck on the outside but cristina spotted a woman coming out of the house who happened to be the maid looking after hassanis room she first saw him on th may and last saw him on nd june she didnt work weekends none of the maids in the main house do shes not absolutely certain but she doesnt think he left the house the entire time he was there he worked in the fuerza andalucia offices at the front of the building and took most of his meals over there what news about angel zarrias thats why im calling hes just arrived at riveros house about five minutes after jesus alarcon turned up theyre all here it must be a fuerza andalucia strategy meeting tell cristina she has to find someone who was working at riveros house on saturday evening there must have been some kind of dinner for tateb hassani which means cooks serving staff those kinds of people sevillethursday th june hrs i think we should get eduardo rivero on his own said falcon without any sense of support from jesus alarcon and angel zarrias tateb hassani was in his house as his guest and he was murdered there in his offices if we can break him first im sure hell give us the rest what about the transport said elvira can we get our hands on the car that took the body from riveros house to dump it in those bins on calle boteros the only sighting weve had of that car has been by an elderly alcoholic who was looking down from a height of about ten metres at night all weve got from him is that it was a dark estate said falcon ramirez is round there now with perez trying to find a more reliable witness were also checking all the cars in riveros name and his wifes to see if any match the basic description and whos watching riveros house serrano and baena are keeping angel zarrias under twentyfourhour surveillance they wont leave until he does said falcon what about a search warrant for riveros house im worried about that javier said elvira rivero might not be the leader of an important party but he is a huge figure in seville society he knows everybody he has important friends in all walks of life including the judiciary the trump card you hold at the moment is surprise he doesnt realize that youve identified tateb hassani and located him at his house in the days before his murder if i apply for a search warrant i have to make the case and reveal everything to the judge the vital advantage you have has more opportunities to leak youd rather i tried to break him first there are risks either way theyre having a meeting now and theyll probably have dinner afterwards said falcon lets see what the next hours bring us and well confer before we make the final move falcon went back to his house to have something to eat and to think about the best way to get eduardo rivero to talk inspector jefe luis zorrita called wanting to talk to him about iness murder falcon told him that now was the only moment he could spare encarnacion had left him some fresh pork fillet he made a salad and sliced up some potatoes and the meat he smashed up some cloves of garlic threw them into the frying pan with the pork fillet and chips he dashed some cheap whisky on top and let it catch fire from the gas flame he ate without thinking about the food and drank a glass of red rioja to loosen up his mind instead of thinking about rivero he found his mind full of ines again and it was playing tricks on him he couldnt quite believe that she was dead despite having seen her lying by the river shed been here onlylast night or was it the night before it was stuffy in the kitchen and he took his glass of wine and sat on the rim of the fountain in the patio under the heat which was still sinking down the walls like a giant invisible press theyd made love in this fountain he and ines those were wild exhilarating days just the two of them in this colossal house running naked around the gallery down the steps in and out of the cloisters she had been so beautiful then in that time when youth was still running riot he on the other hand was already carrying his ball and chain he just didnt know it couldnt see it it occurred to him that hed probably driven her into the arms of esteban calderon the man who would eventually kill her the doorbell rang he let zorrita in and sat him down in the patio with a beer falcon had just finished describing his marriage to ines her affair with calderon their separation and divorce when his mobile vibrated he took it in his study closed the patio door weve had some luck with the car said ramirez theres a bar on calle boteros called garlochi strange place all decked out with pictures and effigies of the virgin the bar has a canopy over it like a float from semana santa its lit with candles they burn incense and the house cocktail comes in a glass chalice and its called sangre de cristo suitably decadent its always been shut when weve checked the area before the owner tells me he was closing up on saturday night or rather early sunday morning when he saw the car turn into the culdesac and reverse up to the bins he described it just as cristinas witness had except that he got a good view of it when the car reversed out of the culdesac he recognized it as a mercedes e because he wanted to buy one himself but couldnt afford it he also looked for the registration because he thought the three guys were behaving suspiciously but that was nearly a week ago all he could remember was that it was a new type of number which began with and he thought that the last letter was an m does that help you baena just called me to say that three other cars have now turned up at riveros house said ramirez weve checked the plates and theyre owned by lucrecio arenas cesar benito and agustin cardenas were running a search on those people lucrecio arenas introduced jesus alarcon to fuerza andalucia through angel zarrias said falcon i dont know anything about the other two listen agustin cardenass car is a black mercedes estate e and the registration is bhm thats our man said falcon ill get back to you when i know more falcon went back to zorrita apologized zorrita waved it away falcon told him about the last time hed seen ines how shed unexpectedly turned up at his house on tuesday night swearing about her husband and his endless affairs did you like esteban calderon asked zorrita i used to people were surprised i only found out much later that he and ines had been having an affair for the last part of our short married life said falcon i thought he was an intelligent wellinformed cultured person and he probably still is but hes also arrogant ambitious narcissistic and a lot of other adjectives that i cant retrieve from my brain at the moment interesting said zorrita because he asked me if youd go and see him what for asked falcon he knows i cant talk about his case he said he wants to explain something to you im not sure thats a good idea its up to you said zorrita it wont bother me off the record said falcon did he break down and confess nearly said zorrita there was a breakdown but not in the usual way rather than his conscience forcing out the truth it was more as if he suddenly doubted himself to start with he was all arrogance and determined resistance he refused a lawyer which meant i could be quite brutal with him about the way hed abused his wife i think he was unaware of the intensity of his rage the savagery it unleashed and the damage hed done to her he was shocked by the autopsy details and thats when his certainty really wavered and he began to believe that he could have done it he described arriving at his apartment as if he was telling me about a movie and there was some confusion about how the script played out at first he said that hed seen ines standing by the sink but then he changed his mind in the end i think there were two calderons the judge and this other person who was locked up most of the time but would come out and take over ines said he needed psychological help said falcon but i dont think she had something as serious as schizophrenia in mind not clinical schizophrenia said zorrita theres a beast inside most of us it just never gets to see the light of day for whatever reason calderons beast got out of the cage youre convinced he did it im certain there was nobody else involved so the only question is whether it was premeditated or accidental said zorrita i dont think his lover stood to gain anything out of iness death she didnt want to marry him shes not the marrying kind she admitted that theyd had a joke about the bourgeois solution to a bourgeois institution being murder but i dont think it was her intention that he should go off and kill his wife hell try to make out it was accidental although no court is going to like the sound of how he abused her beforehand zorrita finished his beer falcon walked him to the door ramirez called again zorrita walked off into the night with a wave ok cesar benito is the chief executive of a construction company called construcciones plm sa he is on the board of directors of horizonte in charge of their property services division which includes companies like mejorvista and playadoro the other guy agustin cardenas is a bit more interesting hes a qualified surgeon who runs his own cosmetic surgery clinics in madrid barcelona and seville he is also on the board of horizonte in charge of their medical services division which runs quirurgicalidad ecograficalidad and optivision it looks like a gathering of the conspiracy to plan their next move now that the first phase has been successfully completed said falcon but im not convinced that weve got the full picture said ramirez i can see rivero zarrias alarcon and cardenas poisoning hassani and probably cardenas did the work on the corpse but none of these guys fits the descriptions of any of the men in the mercedes e who dumped the body and who planted the bomb or gave orders for it to be planted theres a missing element said ramirez i can see the money and the power and a certain amount of ruthlessness to deal with tateb hassani but how could you get somebody to do the work in the mosque and rely on them to keep their mouths shut the only way to find that out is to put them under pressure in the jefatura said falcon hearing the doorbell give elvira an update ive got a meeting with the cni here and tell cristina she has to get a sighting of tateb hassani as late on saturday evening as possible its important that we have that before we talk to rivero pablo and gregorio went straight to the computer gregorio set to work booting up the computer and getting access to the cnis encrypted site through which they would chat to yacoub diouri weve arranged for you to talk to yacoub at hours every night unless you agree not to beforehand thats spanish time which is moroccan time said pablo obviously you have to be on your own to do this nobody even in the house with you the way in which you recognize each other is that each time you make contact you will start with a paragraph of incidental chat in which you will include a phrase from this book pablo handed him a copy of tomorrow in the battle think on me by javier marias on the first day he will choose a phrase from the opening paragraph of page one and you will respond with a phrase from the closing paragraph of page one said pablo once youve recognized each other you can talk freely what if he doesnt use the phrase the most important thing is that you do not remind him and you dont respond with any classified information you include your introductory phrase in your opening paragraph and if he still doesnt rectify the situation you log off you must then not communicate with him until weve checked out his status said pablo the other thing is no printouts we will have a record on our website which you will not be able to access unless we are here with you i still dont understand how you know that yacoub will be accepted so easily into the gicm said falcon we didnt say that said pablo we said that he would be accepted into the radical element of the mosque in sale you have to remember yacoubs history what his real father raul jimenez did and how his surrogate father abdullah diouri retaliated that did not happen in a bubble the whole family knew about it that is the source of a certain amount of sympathy with some of the more radical elements of islam dont ask any morelets just see whether yacoub has made contact with the radical element in the mosque and if he has how quickly hell be put in touch with the high command of the gicm so what is the purpose of my conversation with him at this stage to let him know that youre here said pablo ultimately we want to find out what was supposed to happen here in seville and whether they still have the capability to make it happen but we might have to be satisfied with confirmation of the history at this stage the communication started at they made their introductions and falcon asked his first question hows your first day been back at school its more like the first day as a new member of a club everybodys sizing me up some are friendly others suspicious and a few are unfriendly its like in any organization ive come in at a certain level and been welcomed by my equals but im despised as a usurper by those who thought they were becoming important theres a hierarchy here there has to be its an organization with a military wing the striking difference is that the commanderinchief is not a man but allah no action by this group or any of the others that they read about is referred to without mention of the ultimate source of the commands were constantly reminded that were involved in a holy war it is powerful and inspirational and ive come back feeling dazed home seems strange or rather extremely banal after a day spent with people so certain of their place and destiny in the will of allah i can see how powerfully this would work on a young mind theyre also clever at depersonalizing the enemy who are rarely specific peopleunless you count tony blair and george bushbut rather the decadence and godlessness that has engulfed the west i suppose its easier to bomb decadence and godlessness than it is men women and children any talk about what happened in seville on th june they talk about nothing else the spanish satellite news is avidly watched for more information but its not so easy to work out the extent of their involvement any talk about djamel hammad and smail saoudi and what they were doing bringing kilos of hexogen to seville im not sure how much is speculation and how much is hard fact you must understand that these people are not the gicm themselves they support the actions of the gicm and some members have been involved in their activities but mainly on the home front dont think that ive walked off the street into a tent full of mujahedeen with aks at this stage i can only tell you what has happened rather than what will happen as that is only known by the gicm commanders who as far as i know are not here my friends tell me that hammad and saoudi have worked for a number of groups not just the gicm they fund themselves through cashmachine fraud they were only involved in recce logistics and documents they were not bomb makers the hexogen came from iraq it was extracted from an american ammunitions cache captured at the beginning of it went via syria into turkey where it was repackaged as cheap washing powder and sent to germany in containers for sale to the immigrant turkish community there nobody knows how it got to spain the total quantity sent to germany in the washing powder consignment is believed to be around kilos any speculation about how they intended to use it asked falcon no all they say is that everything in the spanish press and news is total fabrication abdullah azzams text the mila the intention to attack schools and the biology faculty and the idea of bringing andalucia back into the islamic fold they want to bring andalucia back into islam but not yet making morocco an islamic state with sharia law is the priority and we talked about that which is of no interest to you the current strategy as far as foreign operations are concerned is not specific although they are still very angry with the danish and think they should be punished they want to weaken the european union economically by forcing huge expenditure on antiterrorist measures they plan to attack financial centres in northern europe namely london frankfurt paris and milan while conducting smaller campaigns in the tourist areas of the mediterranean ambitious theres a lot of big talk as to their capabilitywho knows the hexogen in seville doesnt seem to fit with their general strategy they say the hexogen exploding was nothing to do with them and how do they know that because the hardware for making the bombs had not arrived wrote yacoub given that hammad and saoudi were recce and logistics i assume there were others who were due to arrive with the hardwarethe containers plastique detonators and timersfrom some other source how much of this do you believe asked falcon there is definitely something going on theres a tension and uncertainty in the air i cant be more specific than that this is information that has come to me i am not enquiring as yet i havent asked about operational cells in spain for instance i can only gather from the way people talk that there are operators in the field doing something falcons mobile vibrated on the desktop he took the call from ramirez while pablo and gregorio talked over his head cristina has found a domestic who saw tateb hassani on saturday evening before dinner his name is mario gomez he says that the dinner wasnt served but laid out as a buffet but he saw tateb hassani eduardo rivero and angel zarrias going up to the fuerza andalucia offices just before he left which was around he didnt see anybody else he said no cars had arrived by the time he left i think thats going to be good enough said falcon and hung up ask him if hes heard any names anything that will give us a clue as to a network operating over here said pablo falcon typed out the question they dont use names their knowledge of foreign operations is vague they are more informative about the present state of morocco than anything abroad any foreigners asked pablo afghans pakistanis saudis falcon tapped it out one mention of some afghans who came over earlier this year nothing else context i couldnt say where does the group meet its in a private house in the medina in rabat but i was brought here and im not sure i could find it again look for clues in your surroundings documents books anything that might indicate research theres a library which ive been shown but i havent spent any time there get access and tell us what books they have i have been toldwarned that there will be an initiation rite which is designed to show my allegiance to the group everybody has to go through this whatever your connections to the senior members may be they have assured me that it will not require violence do they know about your friendship with me asked falcon of course they do and that worries me i know how their minds work they will make me show allegiance to them by forcing me to betray the confidence of someone close to me the chat was over falcon sat back from the computer a little shattered by the last exchange the cni men looked at him to see how hed taken this new level of involvement in case youre wondering said falcon i didnt like the sound of that we cant expect just to receive information in this game said gregorio im a senior policeman said falcon i cant compromise my position by giving out confidential information we dont know what hes going to be asked to do yet said pablo i didnt like the look of that word betray said falcon that doesnt sound like theyre going to be satisfied with my favourite colour does it pablo shook his head at gregorio anything else said pablo if they know about me whats to say they dont know about the next step weve taken said falcon that i came over to make yacoub one of our spies he employs ten or fifteen people around his house how do you know that hes safe that hes not going to be turned and that they still think that im just a friend we have our own people on the inside said pablo working for yacoub we didnt just think this operation up last week said gregorio we have people working in his home at his factory and weve watched him on business trips so have the british hes been vetted down to his toenails the only thing we didnt have which nobody had was access and thats where you came in dont think about it too much javier said pablo its new territory and well take it one step at a time if you feel theres something you cant dothen you cant do it nobodys going to force you im less worried about force than i am by coercion sevillethursday th june hrs thats what flowers had said you dont understand the pressure on these people alone now falcon gripped the arms of his chair in front of the dead computer screen hed only had a glimpse of it but now he understood what flowers had meant he sat in his comfortable house in the heart of one of the least violent cities in europe and yes he had a demanding job but not one where he had to pretend every day or cope with an initiation rite that might demand betrayal he didnt have to cohabit with the minds of clearsighted fanatics who saw gods purpose in the murder of innocents who in fact didnt see them as innocents but as culpable by democracy or the product of decadence and godlessness and therefore fair game he might have to face a moral choice but not a lifeordeath situation which could result in harm done to yacoub his wife and children yacoub knew how their minds worked that they would demand betrayal because that would sever the relationship they werent interested in the lowquality information of a sevillano detective they wanted to cut yacoub off from a relationship that connected him to the outside world yacoub had been with the group for twentyfour hours and already they were setting about the imprisonment of his mind the mobile vibrating on the desktop made him start just to let you know said ramirez arenas benito and cardenas have just left rivero zarrias and alarcon are still there do we know what were doing yet i have to call elvira before we make a move said falcon what i want is for the two of us to go in there as soon as rivero is alone and break him down so that he reveals everybody in the whole conspiracy not just the bit players do you know eduardo rivero asked ramirez i met him once at a party said falcon hes fantastically vain angel zarrias has been trying to lever him out of the leadership of fuerza andalucia for years but rivero loved the status it conferred on him so how did zarrias get him out no idea said falcon but rivero is not a man to hand in his ego lightly it happened on the day of the bomb didnt it thats when they announced it but it must have been coming for a while said ramirez zarrias never mentioned anything to you about it are you speaking with some inside knowledge jose luis some press guys i know were telling me there was talk of a sex scandal around rivero said ramirez underage girls theyve lost interest since the bomb but they were very suspicious of the handover to jesus alarcon so whats your proposed strategy jose luis said falcon you sound as if you want to make yourself unpopular again i think i do ive done a bit of work on eduardo rivero and i think that might be the way to make him feel uneasy said ramirez lull him into a false sense of relief when we move away from the hint of scandal and then give him both barrels in the face with tateb hassani that is your style jose luis hes the type wholl look down his nose at me said ramirez but because he knows you and knows your sister is zarriass partner hell expect you to bring some dignity to the proceedings hell turn to you for help i think hell be devastated when you show him the shot of tateb hassani we hope vain men are weak falcon called comisario elvira and gave him the update he could almost smell the mans sweat trickling down the phone are you confident javier he asked as if begging falcon to give him some resolve hes the weakest of the three the most vulnerable said falcon if we cant break him well struggle to break the others we can make the evidence against him sound overwhelming comisario lobo thinks its the best way falcon pocketed his mobile and a photograph of tateb hassani he used his reflection in the glass doors to the patio to knot his tie he shrugged into his jacket he was conscious of his shoes on the marble flagstones of the patio as he made his way to his car he drove through the night the silent lamplit streets under the dark trees were almost empty ramirez called to tell him that alarcon had left falcon told him to send everybody home except serrano and baena who would follow zarrias once hed left it was a short drive to riveros house and there was parking in the square he joined ramirez on the street corner serrano and baena were in an unmarked car opposite riveros house a taxi came up the street and turned round by riveros oak doors the driver got out and rang the doorbell within a minute angel zarrias came out and got into the back of the cab which pulled away serrano and baena waited until it was nearly out of sight and then took off in pursuit cristina ferrera had taken a cab back to her apartment she was so exhausted she forgot to ask the driver for a receipt she got her keys out and headed for the entrance to her block a man sitting on the steps up to the door made her wary he held up his hands to show her he meant no harm its me fernando he said i lost your number but remembered the address i came to take you up on your offer of a bed for the night my daughter lourdes came out of intensive care this evening shes in a room now with my parentsinlaw looking after her i needed to get out have you been waiting long since the bomb i dont look at the time he said so i dont know they went up to her apartment on the fourth floor youre tired he said im sorry i shouldnt have come but ive got nowhere else to go i mean nowhere that id feel comfortable its all right she said its just another long day in a series of long days im used to it have you caught them yet were close she said she put her bag on the table in the living room took off her jacket and hung it on the back of the chair she had a holster with a gun clipped to a belt around her waist are your kids asleep he asked in a whisper they sleep with my neighbour when i have to work late she said i just wanted to see them sleeping you know he said and fluttered his hand as if that explained his need for normality theyre not quite old enough to be left on their own all night she said and went into the bedroom unhooked the holster from her belt and put it in the top drawer of the chest she pulled her blouse out of her waistband have you eaten she asked dont worry about me im putting a pizza in the microwave cristina opened some beers and laid the table she remade the bed with clean sheets in one of the kids rooms do your neighbours gossip well youre famous now so theyre bound to talk about you said ferrera they know i used to be a nun so theyre not too concerned about my virtue you used to be a nun i told you she said so whats it like what to be famous i dont understand it said fernando one moment im a labourer on a building site and the next im the voice of the people and its nothing to do with me but because lourdes survived does that make any sense to you youve become a focus for what happened she said taking the pizza out of the microwave people dont want to listen to politicians they want to listen to someone whos suffered tragedy gives you credibility theres no logic to it he said i say the same things that ive always said in the bar where i go for coffee in the morning and nobody listened to me then now ive got the whole of spain hanging on my every word well that might change tomorrow said ferrera what might change sorry its nothing i cant talk about it i shouldnt have said anything forget i even mentioned it im too tired for this fernandos eyes narrowed over the slice of pizza halfway to his mouth youre close said fernando thats what you said does that mean you know who they are or youve actually caught them it means were close she said shrugging i shouldnt have said it its police business it slipped out because i was tired i wasnt thinking properly just tell me the name of the group said fernando they all have these crazy initials like miedomartires islamicos enfrentados a la dominacion del occidente islamic martyrs facing up to western domination you didnt listen he frowned and replayed the dialogue you mean they werent terrorists they were terrorists but not islamic ones fernando shook his head in disbelief i dont know how you can say that ferrera shrugged ive read all the reports said fernando you found explosives in the back of their van with the koran and the islamic sash and the black hood they took the explosive into the mosque the mosque exploded and thats all true then i dont know what youre talking about thats why youve got to forget about it until it comes out in the news tomorrow then why cant you tell me now he said im not going anywhere because suspects still have to be interrogated what suspects the people who are suspected of planning the bombing of the mosque youre just trying to confuse me now ill tell you this if you promise me that that will be the end of it said ferrera i know its important to you but this is a police investigation and its totally confidential information tell me promise me first i promise he said waving it away with his hand that sounds like a politicians promise thats what happens when you spend time with them you learn too much too quickly said fernando i promise you cristina there was another bomb that was planted in the mosque which when it exploded set off the very large quantity of hexogen which the islamic terrorists were storing there thats what destroyed your apartment building and you know who planted the bomb you promised me that that would be the end of it i know but i just need toi have to know thats what were working on tonight you have to tell me who they are i cant theres no discussion its not possible if it came out id lose my job they killed my wife and son and if they are responsible they will face trial fernando opened up a pack of cigarettes youll have to go out on the balcony if you want to smoke come and sit with me no more questions i promise youre right i cant do this to you falcon and ramirez were ringing the bell as zarriass taxi turned out of calle castelar eduardo rivero opened the door expecting it to be angel coming back for the notebook hed forgotten he was surprised to find two stonefaced policemen in the frame presenting their id cards his face momentarily lost all definition as if the muscles had been deprived of their neural drive geniality revived them what can i do for you gentlemen he asked his white moustache doubling the size and warmth of his smile wed like to talk to you said falcon its very late said rivero looking at his watch it cant wait said ramirez rivero looked away from him with faint disgust have we met he asked falcon you seem familiar i came to a party here once some years ago said falcon my sister is angel zarriass partner ah yes yes yes yes yesjavier falcon of course said rivero can i ask what youd like to talk to me about at this time of the morning were homicide detectives said ramirez we only ever talk to people at this hour of the morning about murder and you are said rivero his distaste even more undisguised inspector ramirez he said weve never met before sr rivero youd have remembered it i cant think how i can help you we just want to ask some questions said falcon it shouldnt take too long that eased the tension in the doorway rivero could see himself in bed within the hour he let the door fall back and the two policemen stepped in well go up to my office said rivero trying to reel in ramirez whod gone straight through the arch to the internal courtyard and was brushing his large intrusive fingers over the rough head of the low hedge whats this called he asked box hedge said rivero from the family buxaceae they use it in england to make mazes shall we go upstairs it looks as if its just been clipped said ramirez when did that happen probably last weekend inspector ramirez said rivero holding out his arm to herd him back into the fold lets go upstairs now shall we ramirez snapped off a twig and twiddled it between thumb and forefinger they went up to riveros office where he showed them chairs before sinking into his own on the far side of the desk he was irritated to find ramirez examining the photographs on the wall shots of rivero in politics and at play with the hierarchy of the partido popular various members of the aristocracy some bull breeders and a few local toreros are you looking for something inspector asked rivero you used to be the leader of fuerza andalucia until a few days ago said ramirez in fact didnt you hand over the leadership on the morning of the explosion well it wasnt a sudden decision it was something id been thinking about for a long time but when something like that happens it opens up a new chapter in seville politics and it seemed to me that a new chapter needed new strength jesus alarcon is the man to take the party forward i think my decision has proved to be a very good one were polling more now than in the partys history i understood that you were very attached to the leadership said ramirez and that moves had been made before now to persuade you to hand over but youd refused so what happened to make you think again i thought id just explained that two senior members of your party left at the beginning of this year they had their reasons the newspapers reported that it was because they were fed up with your leadership silence it always amazed falcon how much ramirez enjoyed making himself unpopular with important people i seem to remember that one of them even said that it would take a bomb to get you to give up the leadership and i quote that would have the satisfying side effect of removing don eduardo from politics as well that doesnt sound as if you were actively thinking about giving up your position sr rivero the person who said that was expecting the leadership to be conferred on him i didnt think he was a suitable candidate as he was only seven years younger than me it was unfortunate that we fell out over the matter thats not what was written in the newspapers said ramirez they were reporting that these two senior members of your party were not pushing themselves forward but were in fact pushing for jesus alarcon to take over what i was wondering was what happened between then and now to bring about this sudden change of heart im quite flattered to find you so knowledgeable about my party said rivero who regained some strength by reminding himself that these men were homicide detectives and not from the sex crimes squad but didnt you tell me you were here to talk about something else its late perhaps we should press on yes of course said ramirez it was probably just malicious rumour anyway ramirez sat down very pleased with himself rivero looked at him steadily over the rims of the gold specs hed just put on it was difficult to know what was burning inside him did he want to know what this rumour was or would he prefer ramirez just to shut the fuck up were looking for a missing person don eduardo said falcon riveros head whipped away from ramirez to focus on falcon a missing person he said and some relief crept into the corner of his face i cant think of anybody i know whos gone missing inspector jefe were here because this man was last seen in your household by one of your maids said falcon who had spoken each word clearly and slowly so that he could watch the accumulation ease into eduardo rivero with the intrusiveness of a medical probe rivero was a practised politician but even he could not relax and animate himself through the progression of this sentence perhaps because it was a line that hed dreaded hearing and had forced to the bleakest region of his mind im not sure who you could be talking about said rivero clutching at the rope of hope only to find frayed cotton threads his name is tateb hassani although in america he was known as jack hansen he was a professor of arabic studies at columbia university in new york said falcon who removed a photograph from his inside pocket and snapped it down in front of rivero im sure youd recognize one of your own house guests don eduardo rivero leaned forward and planted his elbows on the desk he glanced down stroked his chin and massaged his jowls with his thumb over and over whilst ransacking the furniture of his brain for the inspiration that would take him to the next moment youre right said rivero tateb hassani was a guest in this house until last saturday when he left and i havent seen or heard of him since what time did he leave here on saturday and how did he depart from these premises asked falcon im not sure when he left was it daylight i wasnt here when he left said rivero when was the last time you saw him it was after lunch probably four thirty i said i was going to take a siesta he said he would be leaving when did you wake from your siesta about six thirty and tateb hassani had already gone that is correct im sure your staff will be able to confirm that silence when did you last see the cosmetic surgeon agustin cardenas he was here this eveningfor dinner and before that silence while monstrous abstractions boiled up loomed subsided and loomed again in riveros nauseated mind he was here on saturday evening again for dinner how did he arrive for dinner in his car can you describe that car its a black mercedes estate e hed just bought it last year where did he park his car inside the front doors below the arch did agustin cardenas stay the night here yes what time did he leave on sunday at about eleven in the morning were you aware of that car leaving your house at any time between agustin cardenass arrival and his departure on sunday morning no said rivero the sweat careening down his spine who else was present at that dinner on saturday night rivero cleared his throat the water was getting deeper winking at his chin im not sure what this could possibly have to do with the disappearance of tateb hassani because that was the night that tateb hassani was poisoned with cyanide had his hands surgically removed his face burnt off with acid and his scalp cut away from his skull said falcon rivero had to clench his buttocks against the sudden looseness of his bowels but ive already told you that tateb hassani left here before dinner said rivero maybe four hours before dinner and im sure that can be corroborated by the domestic servants on duty here at the time said falcon were not accusing you of lying don eduardo said ramirez but we must have a clear idea of what happened here in this house in the hope that it will explain what happened later what happened later lets take it step by step said falcon who attended the dinner apart from yourself and agustin cardenas that will shed no light on the disappearance of tateb hassani because he had already left this house roared rivero hammering out the last six words with his fist on the desk theres no need to upset yourself don eduardo said ramirez leaning forward full of false concern surely you can understand given that a man was murdered and brutally dealt with that the inspector jefe has to ask questions that may appear mystifying but which we can assure you will have a bearing on the case lets go back a step said falcon to make it sound less unrelenting tell me who prepared saturdays dinner and who served it it was prepared by the cook and it wasnt served it was brought up to the room next door and laid out as a buffet can we have those employees names please said falcon they left straight afterwards and went home wed still like their names and phone numbers said falcon and ramirez handed over his notebook which rivero refused to accept this is an infringement tell us what happened after the dinner said falcon what time did it finish who left and who stayed and what did those who stayed do for the remainder of the night no this is too much ive told you everything thats relevant to the disappearance of tateb hassani ive cooperated fully all these other questions i consider to be outrageous intrusions into my private life and i see no reason why i should answer them why was tateb hassani a house guest of yours for five days i told you im not answering any more questions in that case we must inform you that tateb hassani was suspected of terrorist offences directly linked to the seville bombing his handwriting was on documents found in the destroyed mosque you were therefore harbouring a terrorist don eduardo i think you know what that means regarding our investigation so we would like you to accompany us down to the jefatura and we will continue this interview under the terms of the antiterrorism now inspector jefe lets not be too hasty said rivero blood draining from his face you came here enquiring about the disappearance of tateb hassani i have cooperated as best i can now you are changing the nature of your enquiry without giving me the opportunity to address the matter in this new light we didnt want to have to force your hand don eduardo said falcon lets go back to why you entertained tateb hassani as your house guest for five days rivero swallowed and braced himself against the desk for this next lap of the course he was helping us to formulate our immigration policy he like us did not believe that africa and europe were compatible or that islam and christianity could cohabit in harmony his particular insights into the arabic mind were extremely helpful to us and of course his name and stature added weight to our cause despite the fact that he rarely visited his homeland had spent his entire adult life in the usa and that he had to leave columbia university under the cloud of a sexual harassment case which cost him his apartment and all his savings said falcon despite that said rivero his insights were invaluable how much did fuerza andalucia pay him for this work rivero stared into the desk terrified by this burgeoning demand for more and more improvisation how was he ever going to remember any of it fatigue got a foothold in his viscera he viciously shrugged it off he had to hang on like a fatally wounded man he had to keep talking to overwhelm any desire he might have to give up the flaws were developing inside him his shell had been weakening from the moment that dvd had come anonymously into his possession and hed had to view the hideousness of his indiscretions the cracks had spread further when angel had come to see him he had listened his white mane of hair gone wild and his face battered by excessive alcohol as angel had told him how hed saved him the rumour had been rife like a wildfire consuming the tinderdry undergrowth gathering strength to leap up into an enormous conflagration angel had saved him but it had come at a price the time had come to step down or be destroyed that conversation with angel had weakened him more than he knew over the days the flaws spread through him until every part of him was ruined every step now was a step down into the dark murder had come into his house and a desecration of the sanctity of the body he could not think after it had taken place how such a thing could have happened to him in a matter of weeks one moment brilliant and whole the next corrupt fractured fissured beyond repair he had to get a grip on himself the centre must hold you must remember what you had to pay for such invaluable advice said falcon who had been watching this immense struggle from the other side of the desk it was said rivero was that with a cheque no cash you paid him with black money even policemen know how this country works said rivero acidly i must say don eduardo that i do admire your poise under these very stressful circumstances said falcon had i been in your shoes and found out that the man id paid for his advice on immigration had also been involved in a terrorist plot to take over two schools and a university faculty i would be in a state of shock that this man should also have been responsible for writing out those appalling instructions to kill schoolchildren one by one until their demands had been met would devastate me if i were you but then again you are a politician said ramirez smiling sweat was raking down his flanks his stomach was embarking on a ferocious protest his blood pressure was screaming in his ears his heartbeat was so fast and tight that his breathing had shallowed and his brain gasped for oxygen and yet he sat there tapping the side of his nose bracing himself against the desk i have to say rivero said that i cannot begin to think what this means so you had this dinner on saturday night said falcon it wasnt served but was laid out as a buffet how many people attended that dinner so far we have yourself and agustin cardenas but youd hardly go to the trouble of a buffet for just two people would you angel zarrias was there as well said rivero smoothly thinking yes they could have angel he should go down with them the little fucker i quite often have buffets on saturday nights so that the servants can go home and enjoy dinner with their families what time did angel arrive he was here around i think and agustin cardenas about pm did he arrive with anybody else no he was alone in the car yes youre saying there were only three people for dinner rivero didnt care about the lying any more it was all lies he stared into his desk and let them fall from his tongue like gold coins worn to a slippery smoothness yes i quite often have a buffet and whoever turns upturns up falcon glanced at ramirez who shrugged at him nodded him in for the kill do you know one of your staff called mario gomez of course it was he who laid out the buffet in the next room on that saturday night that would be his job said rivero he told us that hed served tateb hassani with at least one meal a day since hed arrived in your house up here in these rooms possibly he knew who tateb hassani was and he saw you accompanying him upstairs to dinner with angel zarrias at on saturday night some hours later tateb hassani was poisoned with cyanide horribly disfigured and driven from here in agustin cardenass car to be dumped in a bin on calle boteros rivero clasped his hands drove them between his slim thighs and sobbed with his head dropped on to his chest released at last sevillefriday th june hrs great news said elvira sitting at his desk in his office in the jefatura nearly great news said falcon we didnt manage to force rivero into revealing the entire conspiracy he only gave us two names its quite possible that we can charge the three of them but only with the murder of tateb hassani and not the planning of the bombing of the mosque but now we can get a search warrant for eduardo riveros house and the fuerza andalucia offices said elvira we must be able to squeeze something out of those two places but nothing in writing you dont draw this sort of stuff up in the minutes of a fuerza andalucia meeting said falcon we have a tenuous link between angel zarrias and ricardo gamero but no proof of what they discussed in the archaeological museum we have no idea of the connection of any of these men to the people who actually planted the bomb both jose luis and i think that there is a missing element to the conspiracy a criminal element added ramirez were sure that lucrecio arenas and cesar benito are in some way involved but we couldnt persuade rivero to even give us their names said falcon they could be the other half of the conspiracy arenas put up jesus alarcon as a candidate for the leadership so we assume that he is involved but did arenas and benito make contact with the criminal element who planted the bomb were not sure well ever find out who or what that missing element was but you can put rivero zarrias and cardenas under enormous pressure except that they know with the clarity of selfpreservation that all they have to do is keep their mouths shut and well only be able to pin murder on one of them and conspiring to murder on all three but nothing more said falcon and as for lucrecio arenas jesus alarcon and cesar benito we have no chance ferrera worked hard just to get that final sighting of tateb hassani once those few remaining employees left the house was empty which means well have a job to place arenas benito and alarcon therethat is assuming that they turned up for the killing and if i was them id have kept well away from that said ramirez the link to the bomb conspiracy is tateb hassani said elvira work on the suspects until they reveal why hassani had to be killed once theyve admitted if it was my life that depended on it said ramirez id just hold out i cant speak for rivero and cardenas but i know angel zarrias is very religious with a deep faith however misguided it might be im sure hell even find it in himself to be absolved of all his sins said falcon angel is urbane he knows whats tolerable in modern spanish society as far as expressing religious views is concerned but i dont think were talking about a mentality thats any less fanatical than an islamic jihadists rivero zarrias and cardenas are going to spend the night in the cells said elvira and well see what tomorrow brings you both have to get some sleep well have search warrants ready in the morning for all of their properties im going to have to give my sister at least half an hour of my time said falcon her partner has just been dragged out of bed and arrested in the middle of the night theres probably a hundred messages on my mobile already cristina ferrera slammed back into consciousness with deadbolt certainty and sat upright in her bed faintly swaying as if moored by guy ropes in a wind she only came awake like this if her maternal instinct had received a highvoltage neural alarm call despite the depth of the sleep shed just abandoned her lucidity was instantaneous she knew that her children were neither in the apartment nor in danger but that something was very wrong the street lighting showed that there was nobody in her room she swung her legs out of bed and scanned the living room her handbag was no longer in the centre of the diningroom table it had been moved to the corner she toed the door open to the bedroom shed made up for fernando the bed was empty the pillow was dented but the sheets had not been drawn back she checked her watch it was coming up to am why would he have come here just to sleep for a few hours she turned the light on over the diningroom table and wrenched open the neck of her large handbag her notebook was on top of her purse she slapped it on the table nothing was missing not even the in cash she sat down as their conversation came back to her fernando badgering her for news her eyes drifted from her handbag to her notebook her notes were personal she always kept two columns one for the facts the other for her thoughts and observations the latter was not always tethered to the former and sometimes verged on the creative she turned the notebook over one of her observations jumped out at her from the page it was alongside the names of the people whod been seen by mario gomez going up with tateb hassani to the last supper in her observation column shed scribbled the only possible conclusion to all the enquiries shed made fuerza andalucia planted the bomb no question mark a bold statement based on the facts shed gathered it was suddenly cold in the room as if the air conditioning had found another gear she swallowed against the rise of adrenaline she headed for the bedroom with the backs of her thighs trembling below the oversized tshirt she wore in bed she slapped the light on and opened the drawer of her dresser where she kept a vast tangle of knickers and bras her hand roved the drawer again and again she ripped it out and turned it over she ripped out the other drawer and did the same she thought she was going to faint with the quantity of chemicals her body was injecting into her system her gun was no longer there this was too big for her to manage on her own she was going to have to call her inspector jefe she hit the speeddial button listened to the endless ringing tone and reminded herself to breathe falcon answered on the eighth ring hed been asleep for one and a half hours she told him everything in three seconds flat it went down the line like a massive file under compression software youre going to have to tell me all that again cristina he said and a little slower breathe close your eyes speak this time it came out in a thirtysecond stream theres only one person from fuerza andalucia who fernando knows who isnt currently in police custody and thats jesus alarcon said falcon ill pick you up in ten minutes but hes going to kill him inspector jefe said ferrera hes going to kill him with my gun shouldnt we if we send a patrol car round there he might get spooked and do just that said falcon my guess is that fernando is going to want to tell him something first punish him before he tries to kill him with a gun he doesnt have to try very hard the concept is easy the reality takes a bit more said falcon lets hope he woke you up as he left your apartment if hes on foot he cant be too far ahead of us fernando squatted on his haunches next to some bins on the edge of the parque maria luisa only his hands were in the light from the street lamps he looked from the dark at the blue metal of the small revolver he turned it over surprised at its weight hed only ever held toy guns made from aluminium the real thing had the heft of a much bigger tool condensed into pure efficiency and portability he emptied the bullets from the chambers of the revolvers cylinder and put them in his pocket he clicked the cylinder back into place he was good with his hands he played around with the weapon getting used to its weight and the simple lethal mechanisms when he was confident with it he counted the bullets back into the chambers he was ready he stood and did what hed seen people do in the movies he tucked it into the waistband in the small of his back and pulled the fuerza andalucia polo shirt given to him by jesus alarcon over the top the wide avenida that separated the park from the smart residential area of el porvenir was empty he knew where jesus alarcon lived because thered been the offer of a room for as long as he wanted it he hadnt accepted it because he didnt feel comfortable with their class differences he stood in front of the huge sliding metal gate of the house a silver mercedes was parked in front of the garage if fernando had known that it was worth twice as much as his destroyed apartment it would have stoked his fury even more as it was the malignancy growing inside him was too big to contain his rib cage creaked against his endlessly extending outrage at what jesus alarcon had done not just the bombing but the purpose with which hed set out to make fernando whose family he had personally been responsible for destroying his close friend it was treachery and betrayal on a scale to which only a politician could have been impervious jesus alarcon with all his authentic concern and genuine sympathy had been playing him like a fish there was no traffic the street in el porvenir was empty none of the people in these houses was ever up before dawn fernando called alarcon on his mobile it rang for some time and switched into the message service he called alarcons house phone and looked up at the window he imagined would be the master bedroom jesus and monica in some gargantuan bed beneath highquality linen dressed in silk pyjamas a faint glow appeared behind the curtains alarcon answered groggily jesus its me fernando im sorry to call you so early im here outside ive been out all night they threw me out of the hospital i had nowhere to go i need to talk to you can you come down imim desperate it was true he was desperate desperate for revenge hed only ever heard tales of the monstrousness of this horrific emotion he had not been prepared for the way it found every crevice of the body his organs screamed for it his bones howled with it his joints ground with it his blood seethed with it it was so intolerable that he had to get it out of himself he wanted stilts so that he could step over the gate smash through the glass reach into alarcons bed and pluck out his beautiful wife and throw her to the ground break her bones dash out her brains tread his sharpened stilt into her heart and then see what jesus alarcon made of that yes he wanted to be enormous to drive his arm into alarcons home as if it was a dolls house he saw his hand ferreting around the bedrooms reaching for alarcons small children who would run squealing from his snatching hand he wanted alarcon to see them crushed and laid out under little sheets in front of the house im coming said alarcon no problem fernando had he known the hidden hunger behind the eyes staring through the bars of the gate jesus alarcon would have stayed in his bed called the police and begged for special forces a light came on outside the front of the house the door opened alarcon in a silk dressing gown pointed the remote at the gate fernando flinched as if being shot at the gate rumbled back on its rails fernando slipped through the gap and walked quickly up to the house alarcon had already turned back to the front door holding out an arm which he expected to fit around fernandos shoulders and welcome him into his home moths swirled around the porch light maddened by the prospect of a greater darkness which never materialized alarcon was still too groggy to recognize the level of intent moving up on him he was astonished to feel a fistful of his dressinggown collar grabbed from behind and the front door reeling away from him as fernando with the hardened strength of a manual worker swung him round alarcon lost his footing and fell to his knees fernando yanked him backwards and trapped his head between his thighs he had the gun out of his waistband alarcon reached back grabbing at fernandos trousers and polo shirt fernando showed him the gun poked the barrel into the socket of his eye so that alarcon gasped with pain you see that said fernando you see it you little fucker alarcon was paralysed with fear his voice with his neck pulled taut produced only a grunt fernando pushed the gun between alarcons lips felt the barrel rattle across his teeth and sensed the steel mushing into the softness of his tongue feel it taste it you know what it is now he wrenched the gun out of his mouth taking a chip of tooth with it he jammed the barrel into the back of alarcons neck are you ready say your prayers jesus because youre going to meet your namesake fernando pulled the trigger the gun pressed hard against alarcons shaking neck there was a dry click a gasp from alarcon and a stink rose up from behind him as he loosed his bowels into his pyjamas that was for gloria said fernando now you know her fear fernando moved the gun round to alarcons temple screwed it into the top of his sideburn so that alarcon winced away from it another dry click and a sob from alarcon that was for my little pedro said fernando coughing against the emotion rising in his throat he didnt know fear he was too young to know it too innocent now look at the gun jesus you see the cylinder two empty chambers and four full ones were going upstairs now and youre going to watch me shoot your wife and two children just so you know how it feels what are you doing fernando said alarcon finding his voice and his presence of mind now that the rush of the initial onslaught was past what the fuck are you doing you and your friends youre all the same theres no difference between you and any other politician youre all liars cheats and egomaniacs i dont know how i fell for your stupid fucking line jesus alarcon the man who will talk to you without cameras without the photo opportunity without his beautiful profile in mind what are you talking about fernando what have i done how have i lied and cheated said alarcon pleading you killed my wife and child said fernando and then because you needed me you made me your friend how did i kill them i read it in the police notes you were all in it rivero zarrias cardenas you planted the bomb in the mosque you killed my wife and son you killed all those people and for what fernando he looked up a different voice from beyond the gate female not in his head the blood was simmering in his brain bubbling and popping in such arterial rage that hed become confused gloria he said its me cristina she said im here with inspector jefe falcon we want you to put the gun down fernando this is not how you resolve things youve misunderstood no no that is not true i have finally understood only too well you listen you listen to my friend jesus alarcon fernando knelt down by the side of alarcon and whispered harshly in his ear i am not going to shoot you or your family on one condition he said the condition is that you must tell them the truth theyre the cops they know what the truth is youre going to tell them the truth for the first time with your gilded politicians lips tell them how you planted the bomb and you will live to see the rest of this day if you dont i will shoot you and when you are dead i will go inside and find monica and shoot her too go on tell them fernando stood up and prodded alarcon in the neck with the gun alarcon cleared his throat the truth said fernando or im sending you into the dark tell them alarcon crossed himself he has asked me to tell you the truth about the bomb said alarcon his head hung on to his chest his arms limp by his sides if i fail to tell you the truth he says he will shoot me and then my wife i can only tell you what i know which may not be the whole truth but only a part of it fernando stood back arm straight he rested the gun barrel on the crown of alarcons head i had nothing to do with the planting of any bomb in that mosque so help me god said alarcon sevillefriday th june hrs there was no gunshot a force travelled from alarcons head up the gun barrel through fernandos hand arm and shoulder and into his mind it made his upper body shudder so that the gun barrel drifted from its aim and had to be retrained on to alarcons crown not once or twice but three times his finger caressed the trigger with each retraining of the revolver he blinked took in huge gulps of air and looked down on the man who a few moments ago had been the object of his deepest hatred he couldnt do it alarcons words had somehow drained all his resolve it was the miracle cure for the malignancy of his revenge he knew with absolute certainty that he had heard the truth at first light with the sky turning from midnight blue to anil fernando dropped his arm and let it hang with the weight of the gun ferrera stepped forward and removed it from his slack grasp and holstered it she moved him away from behind alarcon who fell forwards on to all fours take fernando to the car said falcon cuff him alarcon was dry retching and sobbing at the sudden release of tension falcon got him to his feet and took him to where his wife was standing wideeyed features rigid by the front door falcon asked for the bathroom the request brought monica alarcon back to reality she led falcon and her husband upstairs to where the children were standing one holding a fluffy tiger the other a small blue blanket uncomprehending of the adult drama monica got the kids back into their bedroom she joined falcon in the bathroom where her husband was struggling to undo the buttons on his pyjamas falcon told her to strip her husbands clothes off and get him into the shower he would wait downstairs in the kitchen exhaustion leaned on falcon like a big stupid dog he shut the front door and sat at the kitchen table staring into the garden with only one thought shuttling backwards and forwards through his mind jesus alarcon was not part of the conspiracy it looked as if he was their compliant and ignorant front man monica came back down to the kitchen and offered him a coffee she was shaken her hands trembled over the crockery she had to ask him to work the espresso machine did he have a gun she asked did fernando have a gun your husband handled himself very well said falcon nodding but fernando and jesus were getting on so well fernando read something he shouldnt have done and misunderstood an observation as a fact said falcon your husbands courage meant that it didnt end in tragedy we both admired fernando so much for the way in which he was managing his terrible loss she said i had no idea he was so unstable he thought your husband had betrayed him that hed made him his friend to further his political career and fernando is unstable nobody can be called stable after losing their wife and son like that jesus appeared in the doorway hed lost the ashen look he was shaved and dressed in a white shirt and black trousers falcon made him a coffee monica went back upstairs to check on the children they sat at the kitchen table a lot has happened overnight said falcon can you answer a few questions before we discuss that alarcon nodded stirred sugar into his coffee can you tell me where you were on saturday rd june asked falcon we were north of madrid for the weekend said alarcon one of monicas friends got married the wedding party was at a finca on the way up to el escorial we stayed there on sunday and came back on the ave train early on monday morning did you go to the fuerza andalucia offices in eduardo riveros house during the week before that no i didnt said alarcon on the advice of angel zarrias i was staying clear of eduardo angel was still working on him to relinquish the leadership and he reckoned that for eduardo to see the new young blade of the party around him might be construed as humiliation so i didnt see any of them except angel who came here a couple of times to tell me how things were going when you say you didnt see any of them who do you include in that eduardo rivero and the three main sponsors of the party who are all my supporters lucrecio arenas cesar benito and agustin cardenas when did you last see eduardo rivero on the tuesday morning when he formally handed over the leadership and before that i think we had lunch around the th of may id have to check my diary have you ever seen this man before asked falcon looking at alarcon as he pushed a photo of tateb hassani across the table it was clear he didnt recognize the man no he said have you ever heard mention of the name tateb hassani or jack hansen no falcon took the photograph back and turned it over and over in his hands has that man got anything to do with what fernando was talking about asked alarcon he looks north african that first name you mentioned hes originally a moroccan who became a us citizen said falcon hes dead now murdered rivero zarrias and cardenas are under arrest on suspicion of his killing im confused inspector jefe don eduardo told me a few hours ago that he paid tateb hassani a consultancy fee last week for his advice on the formulation of fuerza andalucias immigration policy thats ridiculous our immigration policy has been in place for months we started work on that last october when the eu opened the door to turkey and all those african immigrants tried to jump the wire into melilla fuerza andalucia does not believe that a muslim country even with a secular government can be compatible with christian countries europeans have shown themselves to be consistently intolerant of other religions throughout history we have no idea of the social consequences of introducing turkey whose membership will result in one fifth of the european union population being muslim youre not on the campaign trail now sr alarcon said falcon holding up his hands against the avalanche of opinion im sorry its automatic he said shaking his head but why are rivero zarrias and cardenas accused of murdering a man who theyd just paid to help formulate policy why does fernando think that fuerza andalucia is in some way responsible for planting a bomb in the mosque im going to give you an irrefutable fact and i want you to tell me what you construe from it said falcon you heard on the news that a fireproof box was found in the destroyed mosque which included architects drawings of two schools and the university biology faculty with notes attached in arabic script the ones giving the horrific instructions those were written by tateb hassani so he was a terrorist falcon waited tapping the edges of the photograph one after the other on the table top while the espresso machine fumed quietly in the corner alarcon frowned at the back of his hands as his brain worked through the permutations falcon gave him the other facts that were not in the public domain as yet tateb hassanis handwriting also matched that found in the two korans found in the peugeot partner and in miguel botins apartment he also told him about ricardo gameros final meeting with angel zarrias and the cgi agents subsequent suicide alarcon turned his hands over and looked at his palms as if his political future was trickling away through his fingers i dont know what to say falcon gave him a short life history of tateb hassani and asked him if that sounded like the profile of a dangerous islamic radical why did they pay hassani to make up documents that would indicate a planned terrorist attack when as has been made clear by the discovery of traces of hexogen in the peugeot partner islamic terrorists were positioning material to carry out a bombing campaign asked alarcon it doesnt make sense the executive committee of fuerza andalucia did not know about the hexogen said falcon which opened up the story about the surveillance by informaticalidad the fake council inspectors the electricians and the planting of the secondary goma eco device and the fireproof box alarcon was stunned he knew all the directors of informaticalidad whom he described as part of the setup only then did he finally understand how hed been used and i was positioned as the fresh face of fuerza andalucia who in the aftermath of the atrocity would attract the antiimmigration vote which would give us the necessary percentage to make ourselves the natural coalition partner of the partido popular for next years parliamentary campaign said alarcon the revelations drained what little energy remained in alarcon and he sat back with his arms limp at his sides and contemplated the catastrophe in which hed been unwittingly involved i realize that this must be hard for you said falcon there are enormous implications of course said alarcon with an odd mixture of dismay and relief spreading across his features but i wasnt thinking of that i was thinking that fernandos madness has had the inadvertent side effect of allowing me to exonerate myself in front of the investigating inspector jefe our range of interrogation techniques no longer includes mock executions said falcon but it has saved me a lot of time it wasnt what i had in mind for the extension of police powers in the handling of terrorists either said alarcon you might have to work a little harder than that to get my vote said falcon how would you describe your relationship to lucrecio arenas im not exaggerating when i tell you that hes been like a father to me said alarcon how long have you known him eleven years said alarcon in fact i met him before that when i was working for mckinseys in south america but we became close when i moved to lehman brothers and started working with spanish industrialists and banks then he headhunted me in and since then hes been a surrogate fatherhes shaped my whole career hes the one who has given me belief in myself hes second in my life only to god it was the response falcon had expected if you think he is involved in whatever this is then think again you dont know the man like i do said alarcon this is some local intrigue cooked up by zarrias and rivero rivero is finished he was finished before this happened he was walking with the flybuzz of scandal about him said falcon i know angel zarrias hes not a leader he makes people into leaders but he doesnt make things happen himself what can you tell me about agustin cardenas and cesar benito i need another coffee said alarcon heres an interesting link for you to think about said falcon informaticalidad to horizonte to banco omni toiit the coffee machine gurgled trickled hissed and steamed while alarcon hovered around it blinking in this new point of view matching it to his own bank of knowledge doubt threaded its way across his eyebrows falcon knew this wasnt going to be enough but he didnt have anything more if rivero zarrias and cardenas didnt break down then alarcon might be his only door into the conspiracy but it was going to be a heavy door to open he didnt know enough about lucrecio arenas to induce a sense of outrage in alarcon at the way in which hed been shamelessly exploited by his socalled father i know what you want from me said alarcon but i cant do it i realize its not fashionable to be loyal especially in politics and business but i cant help myself even suspecting these people would be like turning on my own family i mean they are my family my fatherinlaw is one of these people that was why you were chosen said falcon you are an extraordinary combination i dont agree with your politics but i can see that for a start you are very courageous and that your intentions towards fernando were completely honourable youre an intelligent and gifted man but your vulnerability is in your professed loyalty powerful people like that in a person because you have all the qualities that they dont and you can be manipulated towards achieving their goals its a marvellous world in which loyalty is perceived as a vulnerability said alarcon you must be a man made cynical by your work inspector jefe im not cynical sr alarcon ive just come to realize that its the nature of virtue to be predictable he said its always evil that leaves one gasping at its bold and inconceivable virtuosity ill remember that dont make me any more coffee said falcon i have to sleep perhaps we should talk again when youve had time to think about what ive told you and ive started working on rivero zarrias and cardenas alarcon walked him to the front door as far as i am concerned i have no wish to see fernando punished for what he did to me he said my sense of loyalty also enables me to understand the profound effects of disloyalty and betrayal you might have charges you wish to press against him but i dont if this gets out to the press ill have no option but to prosecute him said falcon he stole a police firearm and theres a good case for attempted murder i wont talk to the press you have my word on it youve just saved the career of one of my best junior officers said falcon stepping off the porch he walked to the gate and turned back to alarcon i presume after last nights meeting that lucrecio arenas and cesar benito are still in seville he said i would suggest a facetoface meeting with one or both of them while the information ive just given you is still out of the public domain cesar wont be there hell be at the holiday inn in madrid for a conference said alarcon is seventytwo hours from inception to demise of a political future some kind of spanish record the advantage you have at the moment is that you personally are clean if you can retain that you will always have a future its only once you join hands with corruption that youre finished said falcon your old friend eduardo rivero could tell you that from the bottom of the well of his experience cristina ferrera and fernando were sitting in the back of falcons car shed cuffed his hands behind his back and he leaned forward with his head resting against the back of the front seat falcon thought that theyd been talking but were now exhausted he turned to face them from the drivers seat sr alarcon is not going to press charges and he wont talk to the newspapers about this incident he said if i were to prosecute you i would lose one of my best officers your daughter would lose her father and only parent and would have to be taken into care or go to live with her grandparents you would go to jail for at least ten years and lourdes would never know you do you think thats a satisfactory outcome for a burst of uncontrollable rage fernando cristina ferrera looked out of the window blinking with relief fernando raised his head from the back of the passenger seat and had your rage got the better of you had your hatred been so dire that no reason could have appealed to it and youd actually killed jesus alarcon then all the above would still be true although your prison sentence would be longer and youd have had the death of an innocent man on your conscience said falcon how does that feel in the dawn light of a new day fernando looked straight ahead through the windscreen down the street growing lighter by the moment he said nothing there was nothing to say sevillefriday th june hrs you didnt make it to our appointment last night said alicia aguado i was in no condition said consuelo i left you went to the pharmacy with the prescription youd given me bought the drugs and didnt take them i went back to my sisters house i spent most of the day in her spare room some of the time i was crying so hard i couldnt breathe when was the last time you cried i dont think i ever havenot properly not with grief said consuelo i dont even remember crying as a child apart from when i hurt myself my mother said i was a silent baby i dont think i was the crying type and how do you feel now cant you tell said consuelo twitching her wrist under aguados fingers tell me its not an easy state to describe said consuelo i dont want to sound like some mushy fool mushy fool is a good start i feel better now than i have done for a long time said consuelo i cant say that i feel good but that terrifying sense of impending hideousness has gone and the strange sexual urges have gone so you dont think youre going mad any more said aguado im not sure about that said consuelo ive lost all sense of equilibrium i cant seem to have just one feeling im both extremes at once i feel empty and full courageous and afraid angry and placid happy and yet griefstricken i cant find any middle ground you cant expect your mind to recover in twentyfour hours of crying said aguado do you think you could describe what happened yesterday morning you came to some sort of realization which completely felled you id like you to talk about that im not sure i can remember how it came about said consuelo its like the bomb going off in seville so much has happened that it already feels like ten years ago ill tell you how it came about afterwards said aguado concentrate on what happened describe it as best you can it started off like a pressure as if there was a membrane stretched across my mind like an opaque latex sheet against which someone or something was pressing its happened to me before it makes me feel queasy as if im at that crossover point between being merry and drunk when its happened in the past id make it go away by doing something like rummaging in my handbag the physical action would help to reassert reality but id be left with the sensation of the imminence of something that had not come to pass the interesting thing was that i stopped getting these moments a few years ago were they replaced by something else i didnt think so at the time i was just glad to be rid of the sensation but now im thinking that it was then that the sexual urges started said consuelo in the same way that the pressure started during a lull of brain activity so the urges would come sometimes in a meeting or playing with the kids or trying on a pair of shoes it was disturbing to have no control over when they appeared because they would be accompanied by graphic images which left me feeling disgusted with myself so what happened yesterday asked aguado the membrane came back said consuelo palms suddenly moist on the arms of the chair there was the pressure but it was much greater and it seemed to be expanding at an incredible rate so that i thought my head would burst in fact there was a sensation of bursting or rather splitting which was accompanied by that feeling you get in dreams of endlessly falling i thought this is it im finished the monsters come up from the deep and im going to go mad but that didnt happen did it no there was no monster was there anything there was just me a lonely young woman in a rainfilled street full of grief guilt and despair i didnt know what to do with myself when this happened we were talking about someone you knew said aguado the madrid art dealer ah yes him did i tell you that hed killed a man yes but you told me about it in a certain way i remember now said consuelo i told you about it as if his crime was greater than my own what does that mean that i believed that i had committed a crime said consuelo questioning except that i knew what id done i had always faced up to the fact that id had the abortions even the appalling way id raised the money for the first one which had resulted in some confusion in your mind said aguado the graphic sexual images i dont understand this pain you mentioned when you watched your children sleeping especially the youngest childwhat do you think that was consuelo gulped as the saliva thickened in her mouth and tears flooded her eyes and rolled down her face you told me before that it was the love that was hurting said aguado do you still think it was love no said consuelo after some long minutes it was guilt at what i had done and grief at what could have been go back to that time when you were standing in the rainfilled street i think you told me earlier that you were looking at some smart people coming out of an art gallery do you remember what you were thinking before you decided that you wanted to be like them that you wanted to reinvent yourself there was a long silence aguado didnt move she stared straight ahead with her unseeing eyes and felt the pulse beneath her fingers like string untangling itself regret said consuelo i wished i hadnt done it and when i saw those people coming out into the street i thought that they were not the sort of people to get themselves into this state it was then that i decided i wanted to leave this pathetic lonely pitiful person on this wet street and go and be someone else so although youve always faced up to what youd done there was also something missing what was that the person whod done it said consuelo me the search warrants for eduardo riveros house the premises of fuerza andalucia angel zarriass apartment and agustin cardenass residence were issued at am by the forensics had moved in the computer hard disks had been copied and evidence was being gathered and gradually shipped back to the jefatura comisario elvira all six members of the homicide squad and three members of the cgi antiterrorism squad convened for a strategy meeting in the jefatura at the idea was that the nineman interrogation team would interview the three suspects with a few breaks for a total of thirteen and a half hours to prevent the suspects developing relationships or getting used to a certain style every member of the team would interview each suspect for an hour and a half while the first three interviewers worked the next wave would watch and the third wave would rest or discuss developments lunch would be taken at pm and there would be another tactical discussion the next session would run from pm to pm and if none of the suspects had cracked there would be a break for dinner and a final ninetyminute session at midnight the point of the interviews was not to persuade the suspects to admit to the killing of tateb hassani but to force them to reveal who had put fuerza andalucia in touch with him why he was being employed where the documents hed prepared had been delivered and who else had been at the dinner at which tateb hassani had been poisoned exhaustion was the communal state the meeting broke up with sighs hands run through hair jackets removed and shirt sleeves rolled up it was agreed that falcon would take angel zarrias first ramirez would handle eduardo rivero and barros would start on agustin cardenas once they were told that the suspects were in the interview rooms they went downstairs ferrera was due to follow falcon interviewing angel zarrias they stood in front of the glass viewing panel looking at him he was sitting at the table wearing a longsleeved white shirt hands clasped eyes fixed on the door he seemed calm falcon began to feel too tired for this confrontation youre going to find out that angel zarrias is a very charming man said falcon he especially likes women i dont know him very well because hes the sort of man who keeps you at a distance with his charm but there has to be a real person underneath that there has to be the fanatic that wanted to make this conspiracy work thats the man we want to get to and once weve got to him we want to keep him there exposed for as long as possible and how are you going to do that said ferrera hes practically your brotherinlaw ive learnt a few things from jose luis said falcon nodding at riveros interview room which ramirez had just entered then ill keep an eye on both of you said ferrera angel zarriass eyes flicked up as falcon opened the door to the interview room he smiled and stood up im glad its you javier he said im so glad its you have you spoken to manuela i spoke to manuela said falcon who sat down without turning on any of the recording equipment or following any of the normal introductory procedure shes very angry well people react in different ways to having their partners arrested in the middle of the night on suspicion of murder said zarrias i can imagine some people might get angry i dont know how id feel myself she wasnt angry about your arrest said falcon she was pretty fierce with your officers said angel it was after id spoken to her that she becameincandescent with rage said falcon i think that would be a fair description when did you speak to her he asked unnerved puzzled at about two oclock this morning said falcon shed already left about fifty messages on my mobile by then of courseshe would as you know she can be quite a daunting prospect when shes emotionally charged said falcon it wasnt possible for me to just say that youd been arrested on suspicion of murder and leave it at that she had to know who where and why and what did you tell her i had to tell her by degrees because of course there are legal implications but i can assure you i only told her the truth what was this truth that you told her that is what you are supposed to tell me angel you are the perpetrator and i am the interrogator and between us there is a truth the idea is that we negotiate our way to the heart of it but its not up to me to tell you what i think youve done thats your job silence zarrias looked at the dead recording equipment falcon was pleased to see him confused he leaned over turned on the recorder and made the introductions why did you kill tateb hassani asked falcon sitting back and what if i tell you that i didnt kill him if you like for the purposes of this interview we wont draw a distinction between murder and conspiring to murder said falcon does that make it easier for you what if i tell you i had nothing to do with the murder of tateb hassani youve already been implicated along with agustin cardenas by the host of hassanis final and fatal dinner eduardo rivero youve also been identified as being present at the scene of the crime by an employee in his household said falcon so for you to say that you had nothing to do with hassanis death would be a very difficult position to defend angel zarrias looked deeply into falcons face falcon had been looked at like this before his old technique before his breakdown in was to meet it with the armourplated stare his new technique was to welcome them in bring them to the lip of his deep well and dare them to look down this was what he did to angel zarrias but angel wouldnt come he looked hard but he never came to the edge he backed off and glanced around the room lets not get bogged down in all the detail said falcon im not interested in who put the cyanide in what or who was present when agustin cardenas did his gruesome work although i am interested to know whose idea it was to sew tateb hassani into a shroud did you come up with any suitable islamic orisons for him did you wash him before you sewed him up it was a bit tricky for us to tell once wed discovered him bloated and stinking with the shroud torn off on the rubbish dump outside seville but i thought that was a nice touch of respect from one religion to another was that your idea angel zarrias had pushed his chair back and in his agitation had started to pace the room youre not talking to me already angel and weve only just started what the hell do you expect me to say all right i know its difficult youve always been a good catholic a man of great religious faith you even managed to get manuela to go to mass and she must have loved you to do that said falcon guilt is a debilitating state for a good man such as yourself living in mortal sin must be petrifying but equally its a daunting task to bring yourself to the confessional for the greatest of human crimes im going to make this easier for you lets forget about tateb hassani for the time being and move on to something youre more comfortable with that you should be able to talk about that should loosen your vocal cords so that you will eventually be able to come back to the more demanding revelations angel zarrias stopped in his tracks and faced falcon his shoulders slumped his chest looked like a cathedral roof on the brink of collapse go on then ask your question where were you on wednesday th june between pm and pm i cant recall i was probably having lunch sit down and think about it said falcon this is the day after the explosion you would have received a phone call from someone who was desperate im sure youd remember that a fellow human being in distress who needed to speak to you you know who it is so you tell me said angel whod started his agitated walking again sit down angel roared falcon zarrias had never heard falcon shout before he was shocked at the anger simmering beneath the placid surface he swerved towards the chair sat down and stared into the table with his hands clasped tight you were seen and identified by a security guard said falcon i went to the archaeological museum and met a man called ricardo gamero are you aware of what happened to ricardo gamero about half an hour after you spoke to him he committed suicide you were the last person to speak to him face to face what did you talk about he told me he had developed feelings for another man he was very ashamed and distressed about it youre lying to me angel why should a committed cgi agent leave his office during the most important antiterrorist investigation ever to happen in this city to go and discuss his sexual angst with you you asked me a question and i replied said zarrias without taking his eyes off the table falcon pummelled zarrias with questions about ricardo gamero for threequarters of an hour but could not get him to budge from his story he accused zarrias of telling marco barreda from informaticalidad to offer up the same lie zarrias didnt even give falcon the satisfaction of a flicker of recognition at this new name falcon made a show of ordering barreda to be brought down to the jefatura for questioning zarrias hung on grimly knowing that this was the difference between life and a living death it was well past am when falcon returned to the murder of tateb hassani zarrias looked pale and sick from maintaining his wall of deceit one eye was bloodshot and his lower lids were hanging down from his eyeballs to reveal raw veined and shiny flesh lets talk about tateb hassani again said falcon an employee mario gomez saw you rivero and hassani going upstairs to the fuerza andalucia offices in riveros house to dine on a buffet that hed just laid out the time was pm rivero has told us that agustin cardenas arrived a little later and parked his car underneath the arch of the entrance tell me what happened in the time between you going up the stairs and tateb hassanis body being brought down to be loaded into agustin cardenass mercedes e we drank some chilled manzanilla ate some olives agustin turned up a little after ten oclock we served ourselves from the buffet eduardo opened a special bottle of wine one of his vega sicilias we ate we drank we talked what time did lucrecio arenas and cesar benito arrive they didnt they werent there mario gomez told us that there was enough food for eight people eduardo has always been generous with his portions at what point did you administer the cyanide to tateb hassani youre not going to get me to incriminate myself said angel well leave that for the court to decide how was tateb hassani introduced to you we met at the chamber of commerce what did tateb hassani do for you he helped us formulate our immigration policy jesus alarcon says that was already in place months ago tateb hassani was very knowledgeable about north africa hed read a lot of the un reports about the mass assaults by illegal immigrants on the enclaves of ceuta and melilla we were incorporating new ideas into our policy we had no idea how welltimed his help would be in view of what happened on th june falcon announced the end of the interview and flicked off the recorder it was more important now that he prepare zarrias for the next interview there was plenty of evidence of decrepitude in his face but he had retreated into himself concentrated his powers into a nucleus of defence falcon had only achieved some superficial damage now he had to make him vulnerable i had to tell manuela said falcon you know what shes like i told her that youd had to murder tateb hassani because he was the only element outside the conspiracy and therefore the only danger to it if he was left alive it would render fuerza andalucia vulnerable manuela wasnt prepared to deal in those sorts of generalizations so i had to give her the detail how youd employed him and where evidence of his handwriting was found she knows you of course angel she knows you very well she hadnt quite realized how far your obsession had gone she hadnt realized that youd gone from being extreme to fanatical and she admired you so much angel you know that dont you you helped her a lot with your positive energy you helped me too you saved my relationship with her which was important to me i believe that she could have forgiven you this misguided attempt to finally grab a workable power even if she didnt hold with your extreme beliefs she thought at least that you were honourable but there was something that she could not forgive at last zarrias looked up as if hed just come to the surface of himself the tired bruised and sagging eyes were suddenly alive with interest in that moment falcon realized something hed never quite been sure about angel loved manuela falcon knew that his sister was attractive plenty of people had told him that they found her funny and that she had a great zest for life and hed seen her affect men touchingly by playing the little girl as well as the grown woman but falcon knew her too well and it had always seemed unlikely to him that anybody not related to manuela could love her absolutely because she had too many faults and dislikeable traits constantly on display clearly though shed given something to angel that hed missed from his previous marriage because there was no mistaking his need to know why she hated him im listening said zarrias she could not forgive the way you talked to her that morning when youd already planned for that bomb to explode and she hadnt sold her properties rabatfriday th june hrs yacoub was in the library in the groups house in the medina when they came for him with no warning there were suddenly four men around him they put a black hood over his head and tied his hands behind him with plastic cuffs nobody said a word they took him through the house and out into the street where he was thrust into the footwell in the back of a car three men came in after him and rested their feet on his supine body the car took off they drove for hours it was uncomfortable in the footwell but at least they were driving on tarmac yacoub controlled his fear by telling himself that this was part of the initiation rite after several hours they came off the good road and began labouring up some rough track it was hot the car had no air conditioning the windows were open it must have been dusty because he could smell it even inside his hood they spent an hour dipping and diving on the rough track until the car came to a halt there was the sound of a rifle mechanism followed by an intense silence as if each face in the car were being searched they were told to carry on the car continued for another fifteen minutes until it again came to a halt doors opened and yacoub was dragged out losing his barbouches they ran him across some rocky ground so fast that he stumbled they paid no attention to his lost footing and hauled him on a door opened he was taken across a beaten earth floor and down some steps another door he was hurled against a wall he dropped to the floor the door shut footsteps retreated no light came through the dense material of the hood he listened hard and became aware of a sound which did not seem to be in the same room it was a human sound it was coming from a mans throat a gasping and groaning as if he was in great pain he called out to the man but all that happened was that the voice fell silent apart from a faint sobbing the sound of approaching feet kickstarted yacoubs heart his mouth dried as the door opened the room seemed to be full of people all shouting and pushing him around there was the sound of screaming from the next room and a mans voice pleading they picked yacoub up bodily held him face down and took him back up the stairs outside across rough ground they dropped him and stood back whoever had been downstairs in the cells was now out in the open with him crying out in pain a rifle mechanism clattered close to his ear yacoubs head was pulled up and the hood removed he saw a mans feet bloody and pulpy his hair was grabbed from behind and his vision directed towards the man lying in front of him a gunshot loud and close the mans head jolted and matter spurted from the other side his bloody feet twitched the hood was pulled back over yacoubs head the barrel of a gun was put to the back of his neck his heart was thundering in his ears eyes tight shut the trigger clicked behind his head they picked him up again they seemed gentler they walked him away there was no rush now he was taken into a house and given a chair to sit on they removed his plastic cuffs and black hood sweat cascaded down his neck and into the collar of his jellabah a boy put his barbouches down by his feet a glass of mint tea was poured for him he was so disorientated that he could not even take in the faces of those around him before they left the room he put his head down on the table top and gasped and wept after being inside the hood his eyes were already accustomed to the darkness of the room there was a single bed in the corner one wall was covered with books the windows were all shuttered he sipped the tea his heart rate eased back down to below the one hundred mark his throat which had been tight with hysteria slackened he went over to the books and studied the titles of each one most of them were about architecture or engineering detailed tomes on buildings and machines there were even some car manuals thick manufacturers plans for some fourwheeldrive vehicles they were all in french english or german the only arabic texts were eight volumes of poetry he sat back down two men came in and gave him a formal but warm welcome one called himself mohamed the other abu a boy followed them carrying a tray of tea glasses and a plate of flat bread the two men were both heavily bearded and each wore a dark brown burnous and army boots they sat at the table the boy poured the tea and left abu and mohamed studied yacoub very carefully that is not normally part of our initiation procedure said mohamed a member of our council thought that you were a special case said abu because you have so many outside contacts he felt that you needed to be left in no doubt as to the punishment for treachery we did not agree with him said abu we did not think that anyone bearing the name of abdullah diouri would need such a demonstration yacoub acknowledged the honour accorded to his father more tea was poured and sipped the bread was broken and distributed you had a visit from a friend of yours on wednesday said mohamed javier falcon said yacoub what did he want to discuss with you he is the investigator of the seville bombing said yacoub we know everything about him said abu we just want to know what you discussed the spanish intelligence agency had asked him to approach me on their behalf said yacoub he wanted to know if i would be willing to be a source for them and what did you tell him i gave him the same answer that id given the americans and the british when theyd made the same approaches said yacoub which is why i am here today why is that in refusing all these people who dishonoured me by offering money for my services i realized that it was time for me to take a stand if i was certain that i did not want to be with them then it should follow that my loyalties lay elsewhere i had refused them because it would be the ultimate betrayal of everything my father stood for and if that was the case then i should take a stand for what he believed in against the decadence that he so despised so when my friend left i went straight to the mosque in sale and let it be known that i wanted to help in any way that i could do you still consider javier falcon to be a friend yes i do he was not acting for himself i still consider him to be an honourable man we have been following the seville bombing with interest said mohamed as youve probably realized it has caused great disruption to one of our plans which has demanded a lot of reorganization we understand that some arrests were made last night three men are being held they are all members of the political party fuerza andalucia a party holding antiislamic views which it wants to translate into regional policy we have been watching them closely they have recently elected a new leader who we know little about what we do know is that the three men they have arrested are being held on a charge of suspected murder it is believed that they killed an apostate and traitor called tateb hassani that is of no interest to us nor are these three men who we believe to be unimportant we would like to knowand we think that your friend javier falcon will be able to helpwho gave the orders for the mosque to be bombed if he knew that then i am sure they would have been arrested we dont think so said abu we think that they are too powerful for your friend to be able to touch them sevillefriday th june hrs falcon knew that his goading of angel zarrias would not help in any material way but he hoped that it would cause some unseen structural damage which might lead to a breakdown later on angel zarrias had revealed himself of coursehow could he not while hed been squaring up to do battle with the corruptive powers of materialism and the ruthless energy of radical islam his partner the woman he loved was having a tantrum like some spoilt twoyearold consumed by her pathetic needs and concerns it represented to him all that was wrong with this modern existence that hed grown to despise which was how he justified employing equally corruptive powers and fanatical energy to bring the aimless world back to heel falcon became quite concerned that the rage unleashed by his revelation of manuelas comparative peevishness might result in a fatal embolism or lethal infarction angels fortyfive years of political frustration had finally erupted producing spluttering admissions which indicated beyond any doubt his and fuerza andalucias involvement in the conspiracy but did nothing to help the investigation cross the divide into unknown areas by prior arrangement falcon was not going to be interviewing anybody between and midday he was going to attend the funeral of ines conde de tejada he drove out to the san fernando cemetery on the northern outskirts of the city as he drew near he counted three television vans and seven camera crews everybody from the edificio de los juzgados and the palacio de justicia was in attendance at the cemetery close to two hundred people were milling around the gates most of them smoking falcon knew them all and it took him some time to work his way through the crowd to reach iness parents neither of her parents was tall but the death of their daughter had diminished them they were dwarfed by its enormity and overwhelmed by the numbers of people around them falcon paid his respects and iness mother kissed him and held on to him so tightly it was as if he was her lifesaver in this sea of humanity her husbands handshake had nothing in it his face was slack his eyes rheumy hed aged ten years overnight he spoke as if he didnt recognize falcon as he was about to leave iness mother grabbed his arm and in a hoarse whisper said she should have stayed with you javier to which there was no answer falcon joined the crowd walking up the treelined path to the family mausoleum the camera crews were there but they kept their distance as the coffin was taken up the steps there was a great wailing from some of the women in the crowd these occasions especially with untimely deaths were so emotionally lacerating that many of the men had their handkerchiefs out when one elderly woman cried out ines ines as the coffin disappeared into the dark the crowd seemed to convulse with grief the crowd dispersed after the short ceremony falcon walked back to his car head bowed and throat so constricted he couldnt respond to the few people who tried to stop him driving back alone was a relief a great unknotting of strangled emotion he arrived at the jefatura and wept for a minute with his forehead on the steering wheel before pulling himself together for the next round of interviews by lunchtime theyd all discovered their fundamental problem not even rivero who was the weakest of the three would give the interrogators the necessary link between fuerza andalucia and the bomb makers not one of them would even yield up the link to informaticalidad never mind to lucrecio arenas and cesar benito in a conference between elvira del rey and falcon in which they were trying to work out the most serious possible charges with which they could hold the three suspects elvira put forward the possibility that the link wasnt forthcoming because it didnt exist they had to give hassanis work to someone said del rey and i think we all believe now that the reason ricardo gamero killed himself was that the electricians card which would end up in the imams hands via botin made him feel responsible said falcon mark flowers told me that the imam was expecting more intrusive surveillance in fact he wanted the microphone planted in his office so that the cgi antiterrorist squad would find out about hammad and saoudis plan obviously none of them knew a bomb was going to be planted with that microphone the point is that gamero went back to the person who had given him the card looking for an explanation who gave that card to zarrias its possible that zarrias didnt know about the bomb either said elvira perhaps he just thought this was an escalation of the surveillance carried out by informaticalidad the person i would really like to see down here is lucrecio arenas said falcon he positioned his protege jesus alarcon to take over the leadership from rivero he is a longstanding friend of angel zarrias and he has been involved with the horizonte group with whom benito and cardenas are associated and who ultimately own informaticalidad but unless these guys give him up all you can do is talk to him said del rey you have no leverage the only reason weve got this far is a lucky sighting of tateb hassani late on the saturday night in riveros house and riveros subsequent confusion and loss of nerve when you and inspector ramirez first spoke to him falcon was in the observation room for the next interviews which started at four oclock at about five gregorio appeared at his shoulder yacoub needs to talk he said i thought we werent due to chat until tonight in an emergency weve given yacoub the possibility of making contact said gregorio its to do with the initiation rite i havent got the javier marias book with me gregorio produced a spare copy from his briefcase they went up to falcons office and gregorio prepared the computer you might find theres more of a delay between each line of chat this time said gregorio were using different encryption software and its a bit slower gregorio gave up falcons seat and went over to the window falcon sat in front of the computer and exchanged introductions with yacoub who opened by saying he didnt have much time and gave a brief account of what had happened that morning he wrote about the execution hed witnessed but wrote nothing of his own mock execution falcon reeled from the computer screen this is out of control he said and gregorio read yacoubs words over falcons shoulder steady him keep him calm said gregorio theyre just warning him falcon started to type just as another paragraph came through from yacoub important things in no particular order i was taken from the house in the medina at about am the journey was about three and a half hours long and then there was about forty minutes before i met the two men who called themselves mohamed and abu they told me they were following the seville bombing very closely they said that the explosion had caused great disruption to one of their plans which had demanded a lot of reorganization i was left in a room with books on one wall the titles were all about architecture or engineering there were also a number of manufacturers car manuals for fourwheeldrive vehicles they knew about the arrest of three men from a political party called fuerza andalucia who were suspected of murdering an apostate and traitor called tateb hassani they also knew that this was in some way connected to the seville bombing but said that these men were unimportant the information they want from you javier is as follows the identities of the men who were responsible for the planning of the bombing of the mosque in seville they know about the three arrests and they believe that although you know who the real perpetrators are they are too powerful for you to touch them i dont expect you to reply immediately i know you will have to talk to your people first i need your answer as soon as possible if i can give them this information i believe it will increase my standing with the council immeasurably that last bit i dont even have to think about said falcon i cant do it just wait javier said gregorio but falcon was already typing out his reply yacoub its completely impossible for me to give you that information we have our suspicions but absolutely no proof i assume the leaders of this council are looking for revenge for the bombing of the mosque and that is not something i am prepared to have on my conscience falcon had to hold gregorio back as he hit the send button after about fifteen seconds the screen wavered and the cni secure website disappeared to be replaced by the msn home page gregorio played about on the keyboard and tried to get back into the website but there was no access he made a call standing at the window weve lost the connection he said after several minutes of listening and nodding he closed down the mobile trouble with the encryption software they had to terminate the transmission as a precaution did my last paragraph go through they said it did all the way through to yacoub that i dont know yet said gregorio well reconvene at your house at pm ill have had a chance to discuss the meat of what yacoub was saying and its implications with juan and pablo by then sevillefriday th june hrs on the way back down to the interview rooms falcon ran into elvira and del rey in the corridor theyd been looking for him the forensics computer specialists had hacked into the fuerza andalucia hard disks from the articles and photographs found on one of the computers they could tell that the user was compiling the raw material to be transformed into the web pages that would appear on the vomit website from other material on the same hard disk the user was evidently angel zarrias elvira seemed annoyed that this news didnt impress falcon whose mind was still reeling from the exchange with yacoub its more leverage said elvira it places zarrias and fuerza andalucia closer to the heart of the conspiracy falcon had no ready opinion about that im not sure that it does said del rey it could be construed as a separate entity zarrias can defend it as a personal campaign all hes done is use a fuerza andalucia computer to draft the articles which hes downloaded on to a cd and given to some geek to anonymously slap them up on the vomit website i cant see the leverage we can extract from that falcon looked from one man to the other still with no comment elvira took a call on his mobile falcon started to move away that was comisario lobo said elvira the media pressure is at breaking point what has the media been told so far about these men being held asked falcon coming back down the corridor to elvira suspicion of murder and conspiring to murder said elvira has tateb hassani been named not yet naming him would involve revealing too much about the nature of our enquiry at the moment said elvira were still sensitive to the expectations of the people id better get back to work im due to start on eduardo rivero in a few minutes said falcon looking at his watch tell me have the forensics found any blood traces in the fuerza andalucia offices yet especially in the bathroom i havent heard anything on that said elvira moving off with del rey all the interrogators were in the corridor outside the interview rooms a paramedic in fluorescent green was talking to ramirez who caught sight of falcon over his shoulder riveros collapsed he said he started gasping for air getting disorientated and then fell off his chair rivero was lying on the floor between two paramedics who were giving him oxygen whats the problem asked falcon heart arrhythmia and high blood pressure said the paramedic were going to take him to hospital keep him under observation his heart rate is up around and completely irregular if we dont bring it down theres a danger that the blood will pool and clot in the heart and if a clot gets loose he might have a stroke shit said ramirez from the corridor god knows how this is going to play out in the media theyll tell the world were running abu ghraib down here all the interrogators thought that rivero of all the suspects had been the least attached to the central conspiracy he had only been important as the leader of the party and given that the intention was to wrest that from him in order to install jesus alarcon it would stand to reason that he would be kept the least informed his collapse had occurred under persistent questioning from inspector jefe ramon barros about the real reason for his relinquishing of the leadership the pressure of sticking to his story about old age while the truth worked away at the flaws in his mind had proved too much just after pm marco barreda the informaticalidad sales manager was brought in hed been met at the airport having flown in from barcelona his mobile phone records were accessed but none of the numbers called corresponded to any of those owned by angel zarrias falcon made sure that zarrias knew about barredas appearance in the jefatura zarrias was unperturbed barreda was questioned for an hour and a half about his relationship with ricardo gamero he didnt deviate from his original story they released him at pm and went back to zarrias and lied to him about barreda saying hed admitted that gamero had said nothing about being in love with him and wasnt even a homosexual zarrias didnt buy any of it by pm falcon couldnt take any more he went outside to breathe some fresh air but found it hot and suffocating after the chill of the jefatura he drank a coffee in the cafe across the street his mind was confused with too much going on between yacoub and the interrogation of the three suspects he drank some water to wash out the bitterness of the coffee and zorritas words from last night came back to him in the jefatura he went down to the cells where he asked the officer on duty if he could speak to esteban calderon who was in the last cell lying on his back staring at the back of his hands held above him the guard locked falcon in he took a stool and leaned back against the wall calderon sat up on his bunk i didnt think you were going to come he said i didnt think there was much point in coming said falcon i cant help you or discuss your case with you im here out of curiosity only ive been thinking about denial said calderon falcon nodded i know youve come across a lot of it in your work theres no greater guilt than that of a murderer said falcon and denial is the human minds greatest defence talk me through the process said calderon the theorys always different to the reality only in the aftermath of a serious crime such as murder does the motive for taking such disastrous measures suddenly seem ridiculously disproportionate said falcon so to kill someone for say the paltry reason of jealousy seems like madness an affront to the intellect the easiest and quickest way to deal with the aberration is to deny it ever happened once that denial is in place it doesnt take long for the mind to create its own version of events which the brain comes to believe with absolute certainty im trying to be as careful as i can said calderon sometimes care is not enough to defeat a deepseated desire said falcon that scares me javier said calderon i dont understand how the brain can be at the mercy of the mind i dont understand how information facts things weve seen and heard can be so easily transformed reordered and manipulatedby what what is it what is the mind maybe its not such a good idea to lie in a prison cell torturing yourself with unanswerable questions said falcon theres nothing else to do said calderon i cant stop my brain from working it asks me these questions wish fulfilment is a powerful human need on both a personal and a collective level i know which is why im being so careful in examining myself said calderon ive started at the beginning and ive been admitting some difficult things im neither your confessor nor your psychologist esteban but apart from ines you are the person i have most wronged in my life you havent wronged me esteban and if you have i dont need to know but i need you to know i cant absolve you said falcon im not qualified for that i just need you to know the care with which i am conducting my selfexamination falcon had to admit to himself that he was interested he leaned back against the wall and shrugged calderon took some moments to prepare his words i seduced ines he said i set out to seduce her not because of her beauty her intelligence or because of the woman she was i set out to seduce her because of her relationship with you me not because of who you were the son of the famous francisco falcon which was what had made you interesting to ines it was more to do withi dont know how to put this your difference you were not well liked in those days most people thought you cold and unapproachable and therefore arrogant and patronizing i saw something i didnt understand so the first way the most natural way for me to understand you was to seduce your wife what did this beautiful muchadmired woman see in you that i didnt have myself thats why i seduced her and the irony of it was she gave me no insight at all but before i knew it it was no longer just an affair as id intended we became an open secret she was always way ahead of me in public relations she could manipulate people and situations with consummate ease so we became the golden couple and you were the cuckold who people enjoyed laughing about behind your back and i admit it now javier just so that you know what im like i enjoyed that situation because although i didnt understand you which made me feel weak i had inadvertently got one up on you and that made me feel strong are you sure you want to tell me this said falcon the next item isnt so personal to you said calderon batting him down with his hands as if falcon was thinking of leaving its important that you know me for thei was going to say man but im not sure thats appropriate now remember maddy krugman i didnt like her said falcon i thought she was sinister shes probably the most beautiful woman i never went to bed with you didnt sleep with her she wasnt interested in me said calderon beautyi mean great beautyfor a woman is both her good fortune and her greatest curse everybody is attracted to them its difficult for normal people to understand that pressure everybody wants to please a beautiful woman they spark something in everybody not just men and because the pressure is so constant they have no idea who has good intentions who they should choose of course they recognize the poor slackjawed fools who drool on to their lapels but then there are the others the hundreds and thousands with money charm brilliance and charisma maddy liked you because you brushed aside her beauty i dont think that was true i was as much affected by her beauty as everybody else but you didnt let it affect your vision javier and maddy saw that and liked it she was obsessed with you said calderon of course i had to have her she teased me she played with me i amused her that was about it and the worst of it was that we had to talk about you i couldnt bear it i think you knew that it was eating me up inside falcon nodded so when we got into that final and fatal scenario with maddy and her husbandi had to lie about it afterwards said calderon i perjured myself because i couldnt bear your fearlessness i couldnt stand the poise with which you handled that situation i can tell you that i didnt feel fearless then i couldnt stand the way you overcame your fear and i was left sitting on the sofa paralysed said calderon ive been trained for those situations ive been in them before said falcon your reaction was completely natural and understandable but it was not how i saw myself said calderon then your standards are very high said falcon ines was marvellous to me after the maddy krugman affair said calderon you couldnt have wished for a better reaction from a fiancee id humiliated her by announcing our engagement and on the same day i think it was i ran off with maddy krugman and yet she stuck by me she picked up the pieces of my career and selfesteem andi hated her for it i stored up all her kindnesses to me and mixed them with my own bitterness into a rancorous stew of deep resentment i punished her by having affairs i even fucked her best friend during a weekend at iness parents finca and i didnt stop at affairs i refused to look for a house i made her sell her own apartment but i wouldnt let her buy the sort of house she desperately wanted i wouldnt let her change my apartment to suit her when i started hitting herand that was only four days agoit was just the physical expression of what id been doing to her mentally for years what made it worse was that the more i abused her the tighter she clung to me now theres a story of denial for you javier ines was a great prosecutor she could persuade anybody and she persuaded herself totally you should have left her it was too late by then said calderon we were already locked in our fatal embrace we couldnt bear to be together we couldnt wrench ourselves apart the key rattled in the door the guard put his head in comisario elvira wants to see you in his office he said its urgent falcon stood calderon raised himself with effort as if he was stiff or under a great weight one last thing javier i know it will seem incredible after what ive just told you said calderon and im quite prepared to face the punishment handed down to me for her murder because i deserve it but i need you to know that i did not kill her you might have spoken to that inspector jefe from madrid and he might have told you that i gave a very confused account of what happened that night i have been in a fairly wild state so who did kill her i dont know i dont know what their motive could have possibly been i dont know anything other than that i did not kill ines the comisario was not alone in his office his secretary nodded falcon in pablo and gregorio were there along with the chief forensic pathologist they all sat wherever they could except for the pathologist who remained standing by the window elvira introduced him and asked him to give his report the mosque is now empty of all rubble detritus clothes and body parts we have conducted dna testing on all body parts fluids and blood that weve been able to find that means we have tested every square centimetre of the available area in the mosque we have all the results of these tests except for the final two square metres closest to the entrance which was the area containing the least dna material and was the last batch to be sent off we have been able to find matches to all dna samples supplied by the families of all the men believed to have been in the mosque we have also matched a dna sample retrieved from the imams apartment with some in the mosque however we have been unable to match dna samples taken from the madrid apartment belonging to djamal hammad and smail saoudi with any found in the mosque our conclusion is that neither of those two men were in the mosque at the time of the explosion sevillesaturday th june hrs falcon woke up early with renewed determination once the pathologist had left the night before after his stunning revelation they discussed what could possibly have happened to hammad and saoudi pablo updated comisario elvira on the intelligence theyd received from yacoub whose group believed that a total of kilos of hexogen had been sent to spain the bomb disposal officer had thought as a conservative estimate that kilos of hexogen had exploded in el cerezo on th june which would leave between and kilos still at large they all agreed that having secured the remaining hexogen hammad and saoudi would have either gone to ground or left the country elvira put a call through to the guardia civil about the route of the peugeot partner last seen at a service station outside valdepenas at pm on sunday th june thered still been no sightings of the van on any of the main roads in the seville cordoba and granada triangle there was now a huge operation underway looking for sightings on the smaller routes but it was an impossible task given the anonymous quality of the vehicle and the fact that the journey was made nearly a week ago falcon sent perez and ferrera back to el cerezo to check with the residents that the peugeot partner had not been seen until the monday morning of th june the meeting broke up with elvira drafting a press release about hammad and saoudi and announcing the reinstatement of spot checks on vehicles coming into the city this was to be aired on the tve ten oclock news and on canal sur gregorio had come back with falcon to his house on calle bailen where they made another unsuccessful attempt to reach yacoub they drafted a report about hammad and saoudi including photographs which gregorio pasted into the clipboard of the cni website to send to yacoub later in the hope that he could locate them in morocco for one reason or another falcon had not yet interviewed agustin cardenas and it had been decided that he would talk to him first thing in the morning while ramirez tackled zarrias for a second time the rest of the squad would be up early to walk the streets around el cerezo to see if they could get any confirmed sightings of hammad and saoudi either on sunday eveningmonday morning or after the explosion on tuesday by am falcon had called ahead to the jefatura to make sure that agustin cardenas would be waiting ready to be interviewed as soon as he arrived he stopped for a coffee and some toast on the way and was sitting in front of a still groggy agustin cardenas by in his photograph agustin cardenas looked in his mid thirties while his cv told falcon he was fortysix years old by this saturday morning hed found his way up into the mid fifties which was somewhere hed never been before youre not looking good agustin said falcon you could do with a bit of nip and tuck yourself this morning im not a morning person he said how long have you known cesar benito about eight years how did you meet him i did some work on his wife and then he came to see me himself for some work i removed the bags under his eyes and tightened up his neck and jowls and he was happy he was so happy he got a mistress were your clinics part of the horizonte group at this stage no cesar benito thought that horizonte should buy my business which made you a lot of money said falcon did they give you stock options in horizonte cardenas nodded and being a part of the group meant that you had capital said falcon i expanded the business to nine clinics in barcelona madrid seville nerja and another due to open in valencia its a shame that youve built up such a successful business and youre never going to see the fruits of your labour said falcon youre not protecting cesar benito just because hes made you this fortune that youll never enjoy cardenas took a deep breath and stared at the table thinking to himself no said falcon it would have to be more than that wouldnt it theres your hippocratic oath cesar must have had quite a hold on you to be able to persuade you to not only poison hassani at his last supper but also to use your surgical skills to cut off the mans hands burn away his face and scalp him you didnt do all that for cesar just because he made you a rich man more silence from cardenas something was eating away at him here was a man whod done a lot of thinking and not much sleeping overnight what can you offer me said cardenas after some long minutes in terms of a deal said falcon nothing cardenas nodded rocked himself in his chair falcon knew what was working its way from cardenass insides out resentment i can only give you cesar benito said cardenas he was the only person i had contact with well be happy with that said falcon what can you tell me one of the reasons i was not as wealthy as i should have been when i first met cesar was that id been a gambling addict for almost ten years said cardenas did cesar benito know about that when he arranged for horizonte to buy your cosmetic surgery clinics no but he found out soon afterwards said cardenas it was through him that i managed to get it under control and how did it get out of control again i went on a business trip with cesar down to the costa del sol in march he took me gambling he did cardenas nodded looking at falcon very steadily that started me off again but this time it was even worse i was much better off than i had been the last time my funds seemed to be limitless by comparison by the beginning of may i owed over one million euros and i was having to sell things to make the interest payments on some of the loans id taken out and how did cesar find out i told him said cardenas id had a visit from somebody i owed money to they took me into the bathroom of my rented flat in madrid and gave me the wet towel treatment you know you really think youre going to drown they said theyd be back in four days time it scared me enough to go to cesar and ask for help we met in his apartment in barcelona he was shocked by what i told him but he also said that he understood after three days of being completely terrified i was relieved then he told me how he could make this problem go away are you a religious man sr cardenas yes our families go to church together how would you describe your relationship with cesar benito hed become a very close friend thats why i went to see him when benito told you that you would have to commit murder and gross disfigurement surely you must have asked him for every detail of the conspiracy i did but not on that occasion said cardenas once i realized what he was asking i decided on a safety strategy the next time i met him was in my rented apartment in madrid and i secretly recorded our entire conversation and where is that recording its still in the apartment he said writing down the address and telephone number i taped it to the back of one of the kitchen drawers when lucrecio arenas was at his villa in marbella he liked to get up early before the staff arrived which on a saturday was not before am arenas put on a pair of swimming trunks shrugged into his huge white bathrobe and slipped into a pair of sandals on his way out of the house he picked up a large thick white towel and a pair of swimming goggles he hated chlorine in his eyes and always liked to see clearly even underwater he walked down the sloping garden in the warm morning pausing to take in the glorious view of the green hills and the blue of the mediterranean which at this time of day before the heat haze had risen was so intense that even his untouchable heart ached a little the pool had been built at the bottom of the garden surrounded by a dense growth of oleander bougainvillea and jasmine his wife had insisted it be put down there because lucrecio had wanted a metre monster theyd dynamited three hundred tons of rock out of the mountainside so that he could swim his daily kilometre in fifty lengths rather than having the awful bore of turning just as hed got into his stride he reached the poolside and flung his towel on a lounger and let his bathrobe fall on top he stepped out of his sandals and walked to the end of the pool he fitted his goggles over his face and nestled the rubber into his eye sockets he raised his arms and through the rosetinted lenses of the goggles he saw something that looked like a postcard on the end of the diving board he dropped his arms just as he felt two colossal thuds in his back like sledgehammer blows but more penetrating the third blow was to the neck and came down on him with the full weight of a cleaver his legs would not support him and he collapsed messily into the water the dense growth behind him rearranged itself there was the sound of a small scooter starting up the splendid day continued the ice blue water in the swimming pool clouded red around the body a speedboat nosed out into the blue morning pursued by its white frothy wake the holiday inn on plaza carlos triana bertran in madrid was not one of cesar benitos favourite hotels but it had some advantages it was close to the conference centre where hed given a speech to spains leading constructors the night before it was also near the bernabeu stadium and even when real madrid werent playing he enjoyed being close to the beating heart of spanish football the hotel had a third advantage on this saturday which was that it was only twenty minutes to the airport and he had a flight to catch to lisbon at am hed asked for breakfast to be served in his suite as he hated looking at other people who were not his family early in the morning the room service boy had just wheeled in the trolley and benito was flicking through saturdays abc and chewing on a croissant when there was another knock at the door it was so soon after the room service boy had left that he assumed it was him coming back for some reason he didnt look through the spy hole he wouldnt have seen anybody if he had he opened the door on to an empty corridor his head was just coming forward to look out when the edge of a hand swung into him with rapid and lethal force chopping across his adams apple and windpipe and making a loud cracking noise he fell backwards into the room spluttering flakes of croissant over the front of his bathrobe his heels worked furrows into the carpet as he tried to draw air into his lungs the door closed benitos feet slowed after a minute and then stopped working there was a gargling rattle from his collapsed throat and his hands lost all grip he didnt feel the fingers searching for a neck pulse or the light touch of the card placed on his chest the door of the hotel room reopened and closed with a do not disturb sign swinging on the handle the air conditioning breathed easily in the hush of the empty corridor while unclaimed newspapers hung in plastic bags from other indifferent doors at am falcon had taken a break from his interview with agustin cardenas and called ramirez out to give him the news of the recording cardenas had made hoping it could be used to apply pressure on angel zarrias cardenas was taken back down to the cells while falcon went to his office to call elvira to get the madrid police to pick up the recording from cardenass rented flat while simultaneously arresting cesar benito in the holiday inn it was ferrera calling him from a cafe on the avenida de san lazaro who told him to look at the latest news on canal sur falcon ran through the jefatura and burst into the communications room just in time to see a shot of marbella disappear from the television screen to be replaced by the newsreader who repeated the breaking news item lucrecio arenas had been found by his maid floating face down in his swimming pool at that morning he had been shot three times in the back his mobile vibrated and he took the call from elvira ive just seen it he said lucrecio arenas in his pool they got cesar benito in his hotel in madrid as well said elvira thats going to come through in the next few minutes it took another five minutes for the benito item to break a tve camera crew got to the holiday inn before canal sur reached arenass villa in marbella it took a further half an hour before their camera crew pushed a lens into the face of the maid whod only just recovered from the hysteria of finding her boss dead in the pool the newsreaders jumped between the two dramas falcon called ramirez out of the interview room to let him know went back to his office and slumped in his chair all the enthusiasm of the morning gone his first thoughts were that this was the end it didnt matter what they found out now from cardenas and zarrias it was all immaterial he stared at his reflection in the dead grey computer screen and it started him thinking in a slightly less linear way about what had happened he made some uncomfortable connections which made him furious and then another idea came to him which frightened him into calming down he got the communications room to send a patrol car to alarcons house in el porvenir he called jesus alarcon his wife monica answered the phone youve heard the news he said he cant speak to you now said monica hes too upset you know lucrecio was like a father to him first thing none of you are to go outside said falcon lock all the doors and windows and go upstairs dont answer the door im sending a patrol car round there now silence from monica ill tell you what its about when i get there said falcon did jesus speak to lucrecio arenas yesterday yes they met im coming round now lock all the doors dont let anybody in on the way to el porvenir falcon called elvira and asked for armed guards to protect alarcon and his family the request was granted immediately theres more stuff coming out all the time said elvira but i cant talk about it on the phone im coming in im on my way to see alarcon said falcon do we know where alarcon was on the night of tateb hassanis murder he was at a wedding in madrid so you think hes clean i know hes clean said falcon ive got a special insight special insights even your special insights dont always look good in police reports said elvira the street was empty of people and falcon parked behind the patrol car which was already outside the metal sliding gate of alarcons house monica buzzed him in falcon had a good look around before he went through the front door which he closed and triple locked he went to the back of the house and checked all the doors and windows were just being careful said falcon we dont know who were dealing with yet and were not sure whether jesus is on their list so were putting you under armed guard until we know hes in the kitchen she said looking sick with fear she went upstairs to sit with the children alarcon was sitting at the kitchen table with an untouched espresso in front of him he had his arms stretched out on the table fists clenched staring into space he only came out of his trance when falcon broke into the frame of his vision and offered his condolences i know he was important to you said falcon alarcon nodded he didnt look as if hed slept much he made light knocking noises with his fists on the tabletop did you speak to arenas yesterday asked falcon alarcon nodded how did he react to the information i gave you lucrecio had reached the point in his life and business career where he no longer had to bother with detail said alarcon he had people who did the detail i shouldnt think hed seen a bill for the last twentyfive years or read a contract or even been aware of the tonnage of paperwork involved in a modern merger or acquisition his desk is always clean it doesnt even have a phone on it since he discovered that the only people he wants to talk to are on his mobile he never learnt how to use a computer what are you telling me jesus said falcon impatient now that the services of tateb hassani and his consequent murder were details that did not concern lucrecio arenas im telling you that hes the sort of man who will listen to the business news with all its astonishing uptotheminute detail even a channel like bloomberg which is right on top of its subject and laugh said alarcon then hell tell you whats really happening because he is talking to the people who are actually making it happen and you realize that the socalled news is just a bit of detail that a journalist has either picked up or been given so what did you talk about we talked about power that doesnt sound as if its going to help me no but it has been an enormous help to me said alarcon ill be resigning from the leadership of fuerza andalucia and returning to my business career my statement to the media will take place at eleven oclock this morning theres nothing left javier fuerza andalucia is over so what did he tell you about power that all the things that matter to me about politics such as people health education religionall these things are details and none of it can happen without power i think i can grasp that theres a saying in business that what happens in the usa takes about five years to start happening here said alarcon lucrecio told me look at the bush administration and understand that you only achieve power in a democracy with an enormous sense of indebtedness you owe favours to all the people whove made it possible for you to reach high office said falcon you owe them so much that you begin to find that their needs are shaping your policies three armed police arrived as falcon left falcon drove back to the jefatura amazed at his naivety in thinking that jesus alarcon would be able to get anything approaching an admission from an animal like lucrecio arenas elvira was alone in his office standing by the window peering through the blinds as if he was expecting insurgents in the street without turning round he told falcon that he was going to have to prepare for a major televised press conference whose time as yet had not been set the cni will be here in a minute he said did you get anything from alarcon nothing hes resigning later this morning said falcon he had a very unappetizing lesson on the nature of power from his old master who seems to have met his nemesis said elvira a card was found on the diving board of his swimming pool an identical card was found on cesar benitos body in his hotel room arabic script a quote from the koran about the enemies of god elvira finally turned round when he sensed something thunderous developing behind him are you all right javier no he said gritting his teeth im not all right youre angry said elvira surprised its very dismaying but ive been betrayed he said those bastards from the cni have betrayed me and its cost us the possibility of a resolution to this entire investigation a knock on the open door pablo and gregorio came in falcon wouldnt shake their hands got up and went over to the window so whats going on here asked elvira pablo shrugged i recruited a moroccan friend of mine started falcon and gregorio tried to interrupt by saying this was all topsecret cni business and not for public consumption pablo told him to sit down and shut up my moroccan friend has infiltrated the group which positioned hammad and saoudi with the hexogen in seville the group demanded that he show his loyalty by passing an initiation rite this required him to ask me who was behind the fuerza andalucia conspiracy i refused to do this at which point there was a very timely breakdown in communicationa problem with new encryption software since then i have not been able to contact my friend i do not think that the deaths of cesar benito and lucrecio arenas are unconnected with what happened i believe that my refusal to help was intercepted and replaced with the information my friend required the fact that these two men were found dead with quotations from the koran on or near their bodies seems to indicate that revenge has successfully been taken elvira looked at the cni men not true said pablo it proves nothing but we can show you the transcripts its true that your refusal to help did not go through before the system failed but we did not replace it with anything else the encryption software problem has still not been solved and we are now thinking of going back to the original software so that we can at least make contact with your friend on the subject of the deaths of arenas and benito the detectives and forensics on the ground in marbella and madrid have independently told us that they believe this to be the work of professional hitmen they say that whilst they have no record of any individual hits being taken out by islamic jihadists they do have records of professional hitmen using these methods agustin cardenas had just given me cesar benito said falcon slowly we know said pablo we spoke to madrid theyve picked up the recording he mentioned in his interview with you you nailed him said gregorio for the murder of tateb hassani said falcon dont you think the families of the people who died in el cerezo deserve a bit more than that they might get it in court said elvira you said it yourself on tuesday night said pablo terrorist attacks are complicated things you only have a chance at a resolution at least in this one the perpetrators have all suffered apart from the electrician who planted the goma eco said falcon and of course the people who are so contemptuous of law and order that they will assassinate anybody who might make them vulnerable you have to be satisfied with what youve achieved said pablo youve prevented a dangerous group of catholic fanatics from developing a power base in andalucian politics and in the process through the actions of hammad and saoudi we have uncovered an islamic jihadist plot juan doesnt think that that is such a terrible outcome which brings us back to the business in hand said elvira hammad and saoudi their faces have been all over the news and theres been a terrific response unfortunately there have been sightings from all over spain theyve been seen on the same day at the same time in la coruna almeria barcelona and cadiz elvira took a call on his mobile chasing hammad and saoudi is a waste of time said pablo its been four days theyll have done whatever needed to be done and got out the only thing that will help us now is intelligence elvira came back into the conversation that was the guardia civil theyve had a confirmed sighting of hammad and saoudi early on monday morning th june on a stretch of country road near a village called el saucejo about twentyfive kilometres south of osuna and how do we know this is a bona fide sighting asked pablo they were changing the back tyre drivers side on a white peugeot partner said elvira sevillesaturday th june hrs we thought wed lost you back there said pablo i thought youd lost me said falcon are you still with us im tired im shocked that my sisters partner is so deeply involved in this ive been disturbed by whats happened to yacoub and because of these two assassinations ive lost the possibility of a resolution to my investigation said falcon maybe youre used to this in your world but in mine it feels lurid i told juan when we first came up with the idea of using you that we were expecting too much said pablo operating in two worlds the real and the clandestine is the quickest way to paranoia anyway im out the other side now said falcon i think we should go to el saucejo i cant said pablo juans just recalled me to madrid theres a lot of internet chatter and now theres been some movement as well he cant spare me down here to help you so what are you going to do about hammad and saoudi the other quantity of hexogen the hardware that didnt arrive and the disruption to a plan which has required a lot of reorganization said falcon isnt that what youd call intelligence yacoub has been frightened half to death to get this stuff for you i dont know what youre expecting to find in el saucejo said pablo hammad and saoudi sitting on some hexogen helping people pack it into the hardware and carrying on with the plan i dont think so falcon paced the room chewing on his thumbnail this hardwarethat keeps getting referred to it doesnt sound as if its easily available not something you go down to the shops and buy said falcon for some reason it sounds to me as if its been custom made for a certain task it could be keep having ideas keep feeding them to yacoub and see if he can come back with something relevant thats all we can do you said the only thing that would make you sit up and get interested in our investigation was if we found that the imam or hammad and saoudi were not in the mosque when it exploded said falcon and now you dont seem to give a damn things have moved on ive been recalled to madrid im being asked to look at other scenarios but dont you think its significant that the original hexogen was brought to seville that theres additional hexogen out there that hammad and saoudi are alive and well and we know that theres an intention to attack said falcon doesnt all that add up tosomething given the level of security around all major buildings the announcement made last night of the reinstatement of spot checks and the police presence on the streets i think it unlikely that theyll launch anything in seville that sounds like an official communique said falcon it is said pablo the truth is we have no idea on tuesday afternoon they were checking all vehicles going in and out of seville by wednesday evening they were doing spot checks because people were complaining about traffic jams on friday they stopped all checks because people were still complaining now theyve reinstated them and youll see what happens life goes on javier that sounds as if youre saying that we shouldnt worry too much if the population are so unconcerned said falcon but they dont know what we knowthat theres more hexogen that there is an intention to attack and there was a twentyfourhour break in the spot checks on vehicles all that information is in juans hands and hes called me back to madrid because what is going on there is more significant than anything that could happen here said pablo they went to el saucejo gregorio and falcon in the front and a bomb squad officer and his dog in the back with felipe the forensic in osuna they were met by the guardia civil who led them up to el saucejo in their nissan patrol they stopped in the village and picked up two men and continued in the direction of campillos the rolling hills around el saucejo were either given over to endless olive trees or had been ploughed up to reveal duncoloured earth with chalkwhite patches the nissan patrol stopped outside a ruined house on the righthand side of the road which had a view over the shimmering verdigris of the olive trees up to some distant mountains the entrance and a section of the verge on the opposite side of the road about twentyfive metres down towards el saucejo had been taped off as a crime scene the guardia civil introduced the owner of the house and the man whod spotted hammad and saoudi changing the rear tyre early on monday morning felipe started work on the tyre tracks on the side of the road and confirmed that they matched those of the peugeot partner in the police compound he then examined the tyre tracks going into and out of the courtyard to the left of the ruined house after half an hour felipe was able to tell them that the peugeot partner had come from the direction of campillos which was to the east entered the courtyard and then exited it sustaining a puncture which was repaired twentyfive metres down the road inside the courtyard the bomb squad officer released the dog which ran around for a few minutes before sitting down under some secure roofing near the main house the officer then made some tests on the dry beaten earth under the roofing and confirmed that there were traces of hexogen the owner of the house said it hadnt been lived in for over thirty years because it was too isolated for most people and there was a problem with water hed rented it out to a spaniard with a madrileno accent for six months there was no contract and the man had paid him saying he just wanted to use it occasionally for storage the man whod spotted hammad and saoudi changing the tyre said he drove past the house every day and had never seen anybody using it he hadnt even seen the peugeot partner coming out of the courtyard it was already on the side of the road with one of the guys changing the tyre whats important said falcon is did anybody see a car going into or out of this courtyard at any time since tuesday morning they shook their heads falcon drove back to el saucejo they talked to as many people as they could find in the village but nobody had seen any vehicle using the ruined house they left the problem with the guardia civil on the way back to seville gregorio took a call from the cni communications department saying that they had reinstalled the old encryption software and the system was now up and running they had made the hammad and saoudi file available to yacoub but he had not as yet picked it up by pm they were back in the jefatura sitting in front of the computer they saw immediately that yacoub had now picked up the file a prearranged signal email was sent to him and he came online the men you know as hammad and saoudi are already back in north africa wrote yacoub they have been here since thursday morning i only know this because there was much cheering and clapping when the satellite news announced that it was now known that the two men had not been in the mosque when it exploded weve found the place where they stored the remaining hexogen but have no idea when it was picked up or where it has gone it has not been talked about here the two men who were assassinated earlier today lucrecio arenas and cesar benito were the answer to your initiation test their killings were made to look like the work of islamic militants a denial has already been issued to aljazeera have you heard anything more about the hardware that was supposed to be made available for the original consignment of hexogen it has not been discussed since yesterday there has been an increase in internet chatter and also some cell movement here in spain can you comment theres nothing specific theres a sense of excitement here and theres talk of one or more cells being activated but its nothing definite nothing i am told by the group who meet here in the house in the medina can be relied on can you spend some time thinking about what you saw when you were taken out of rabat to be given your initiation test you mentioned the architectural and engineering books and some car manuals ill think about it i have to go now after lunch falcon arranged for zarrias to be brought up to the interview room im not going to record this said falcon nothing we say to each other now will be used in a court of law zarrias said nothing he just looked at the person who could have been his brotherinlaw my inspector has already told you that lucrecio arenas was shot three times in the back said falcon the maid found him face down in the pool do you want the people who did that to lucrecio to get away with it no said zarrias but i cant help you javier because i dont know who he was involved with why was cesar benito important to this said falcon do you think it was something to do with his construction company zarrias looked troubled as if this question had brought something into the frame that he hadnt considered before i dont think this was about money javier said zarrias on your part said falcon in a discussion between lucrecio and jesus yesterday your old friend told him that power in a democracy does not come without a great sense of indebtedness zarriass head snapped back as if hed just been kicked in the face maybe you were working at cross purposes angel said falcon while you and jesus were in it to make this world into what you consider to be a better place lucrecio and cesar just wanted pure power and the money that comes with it silence it happened in the crusades why shouldnt it happen now said falcon while some were out there battling for christendom others just wanted to kill pillage and conquer new territory i cannot believe that of lucrecio maybe i should get jesus to come down here and he can talk you through his disappointment said falcon i didnt see it but he told me he was going to resign at eleven this morning and resume his career in business ive never seen a mans idealism so emphatically extinguished angel zarrias shook his head in denial didnt you stop to think angel about the nature of the forces you were joining asked falcon was there not one moment after youd poisoned tateb hassani and you knew that agustin cardenas was amputating his hands burning off his face and scalping him that you thought are these the extremes to which one must go to achieve goodness in the world and if it didnt happen then what about when you saw the shattered building and the four dead children under their school pinafores surely then you must have thought that you had inadvertently teamed yourself with something very dark if i did said angel quietly it was too late by then the press conference took place at in the andalucian parliament building falcon had prepared a statement on his investigation which had been incorporated into the official press release to be delivered by comisario elvira falcon and juez del rey were attending the conference but only to answer any questions on which elvira didnt have the specific information they were told to keep their replies to an absolute minimum the conference lasted about an hour and was a subdued affair elvira had just reached the point where he was looking to wrap up the event when a journalist at the back stood up a final question for inspector jefe falcon he said are you satisfied with this result a brief silence a cautionary look from elvira a woman leaned forward in the front row to get a good look at him experience tells me i might have to be said falcon it is the nature of all murder investigations that the more time passes the less chance there is that fresh discoveries will be made however i would like to tell the people of seville that i personally am not satisfied with this outcome with each act terrorism reaches new depths of iniquity humanity now has to live in a world where people have been prepared to abuse a populations vulnerability to terrorism in order to gain power i would have liked to have provided the ultimate resolution to this crime which would have been to bring everyone from the planners to the man who planted the device to justice we have only been partially successful but for me the battle does not end with this press conference and i want to assure all sevillanos that i and my squad will do everything in our power to find all the perpetrators wherever they may be even if it takes me the rest of my career from the end of the press conference until pm falcon was in the jefatura catching up on the monumental load of paperwork that had accumulated in the five days of investigation he went home took a shower and changed and was ready for the evening transmission to yacoub when gregorio came round at pm gregorio was nervous and excited its been confirmed from several different sources that three separate cells are on the move a group left valencia last night by car a married couple left from madrid in a transit van early this morning and another group left from barcelona some together some alone at various times between friday lunchtime and early this morning they all seem to be heading for paris lets see what yacoub makes of it said falcon they made contact and exchanged introductions i have no time wrote yacoub i have to leave for paris on the flight and it will take me more than an hour to get to the airport any reason none they told me to book my usual hotel in the marais and that i would receive my instructions once i arrived falcon asked about the three cells activated in spain since friday all heading for paris ive heard nothing i have no idea if my trip is connected what about the hardware still nothing any more questions i have to leave now gregorio shook his head when you were taken to the gicm camp for your initiation you wrote about a wall of booksthe car manuals have you remembered anything about them it seems a curious thing to have they were all fourwheeldrive vehicles i remember a vw insignia and a mercedes the third book was for range rover and the last i had to check my memory of the insignia on the internet it was porsche thats it i will try to make contact from paris gregorio got up to leave as if hed just wasted his time any thoughts on that asked falcon ill talk to juan and pablo see what they think gregorio let himself out falcon sat back in his chair he didnt like this intelligence work suddenly everything was moving around him at an alarming pace with great urgency but in reaction to electronic nods and winks he could see how people could go mad in this world where reality came in the form of information from sources and agents were told to go to hotels and wait for instructions it was all too disembodied for his liking he never thought hed hear himself say it but he preferred his world where there was a corpse pathology forensics evidence and facetoface dialogue it seemed to him that intelligence work demanded the same leap of faith as religious belief and in that respect hed always found himself in a twilight world where his belief in a form of spirituality couldnt quite extend itself to the recognition of an ultimate being the three notebooks hed filled during the course of the investigation sat on his desk next to a pile of paperwork hed brought home with him he took a sheet of paper from the printer and opened up the first notebook the date was th june the day hed been called to view tateb hassanis corpse on the rubbish tip outside seville he saw that hed semiconsciously written el rocio next to the date perhaps thered been something on the radio it was always reported when the virgen del rocio had been successfully brought out of the church and paraded on pentecost monday as he doodled out the shape of one of the painted wagons that was so typical of the pilgrimage he realized how el rocio had become almost as important an event to tourists as semana santa and the feria it had always drawn thousands from all over andalucia and they had now been joined by hundreds of tourists looking for another sevillano experience his brother paco had even started providing horses and accommodation on his bullbreeding farm for an agency specializing in more luxurious forms of the pilgrimage with magnificent tents champagne dinners and flamenco every night there were luxury versions of everything these days there was probably a caviar version of the walk to santiago de compostela decadence had even got into the pilgrimage trade below the drawing of the wagon he wrote el rocio tourists seville more flipping through the random notes and jottings when he did this he couldnt help but think of artists and writers with their notebooks he loved it in the great retrospective of an artist when the museum showed the notebook sketches which eventually became the great and much recognized painting a single line hed written on the reverse side of a sheet of paper caught his eye drain the resources of the west through increased security measures threaten economic stability by attacking tourist resorts in southern europe and financial centres in the north london paris frankfurt milan who had said that was it juan or perhaps it was something yacoub had written there was a map of spain on the wall next to his desk and he crabbed across to it on his chair was seville the obvious place to bring explosives together to launch attacks on the tourist infrastructure of andalucia granada was more central the costa del sol was more accessible from malaga then he remembered the hardware to create panic in a tourist resort needed nothing more than a pipe bomb packed with nuts bolts and nails so why go to the trouble of special hardware and procuring hexogen back to the desk another note hexogenhigh brisance explosive power shattering effect exactly hexogen had been chosen for its power a small quantity did a lot of damage and with that thought his mind slipped back to the important buildings of andalucia the regional parliament in seville the cathedrals in seville and cordoba the alhambra and generalife in granada pablo was right it would be impossible to get a bomb anywhere near those places with the whole region on terrorist alert his computer told him it was midnight he hadnt eaten he wanted to be out and amongst people normally he would have relied on laura to fill his saturday night but that was over now hed allowed himself that morbid thought and it led him back to iness funeral her parents lost as children in the sea of people he snapped out of it and was walking aimlessly from his study to the patio when he remembered consuelos call he hadnt expected her to be so thoughtful shed been the only person to call him about ines not even manuela had done that he dug out his mobile was this a good time he retrieved her number punched the call button let it ring twice and cut it off it was saturday night shed be in the restaurant or with her children two or three images of their sexual encounters shot through his mind theyd been so intense and satisfying he had a rush of physical and chemical desire he punched the call button again and before it even started ringing he could hear himself trying to smother his desire with inept small talk he cut the line again this was all too much for one week hed split up with a girlfriend his exwife had been murdered and now he wanted to rekindle a love affair which had burnt out after a matter of days nearly four years ago consuelo had called him about ines as a friend would it was nothing more than that it was warm outside and there was life in the streets human beings were resilient creatures he walked to el arenal and found the galician bar which did wonderful octopus and served wine in white porcelain dishes as he ate he saw himself appear on the news answering that last question put to him by the journalist at the press conference they showed his answer in its entirety the waiter recognized him and wouldnt take money for the food and instead sloshed more wine into his white porcelain dish out in the street he was suddenly exhausted the hours of adrenalinefilled work had caught up he bought a pringaa spicy meatfilled rolland ate it on the way home he fell into bed and dreamed of francisco falcon back in this house knocking down a wall to reveal a secret chamber it woke him in the intense dark of his bedroom with his heart pounding in his ears he knew that he would not sleep for at least two hours after that downstairs he flicked through the endless satellite channels looking for a movie anything that would quieten down his brain activity he knew why he was awake hed heard himself on the news making that promise to the people of seville he still had hammad and saoudi on his mind the hexogen theyd stored in the ruined house outside el saucejo the great deal of reorganization that the disruption of the bomb had caused to the gicms plan the tv screen was filled with the faceoff between two colossal armies in some recent swordsandsandals epic hed seen it before and it had made no lasting impression on him apart from the designers vision of what the wooden horse would have looked like if the greeks had built it as he supposed they had out of brokenup triremes he had to wait for more than an hour for the horse to be given its rollon part and as he lay on the sofa drifting along with the plot he wondered at the power of myth how an idea even one with faulty wiring in the logic could worm its way into the psyche of the western world why did the trojans drag the damn thing inside their city walls why after all theyd been through werent they in the least bit suspicious just as hed reached the point of wondering whether there would ever be a generation of kids that didnt know about the wooden horse the beast hove into view on the screen the sight of it triggered something in his brain and all the random thoughts notes and jottings of the past five days came together jolting him off the sofa and into his study sevillesunday th june hrs the hotel alfonso xiii was in terms of size probably sevilles grandest place to stay it had been built to impress for the expo and had a mock mudejar interior with geometric tiles and arabic arches around a central patio it was dark in the reception and the strong scent of the lilies in the huge flower arrangement struck a funereal note the manager arrived a few minutes after eight falcon had dragged him out of bed he was shown into the office the manager glanced at the police id as if he saw them every day i thought it was a heart attack he said we get plenty of those no nothing like that said falcon i know you youre investigating the bomb said the manager i saw you on the news what can i do for you we havent got any moroccan clients here people saw the news thought falcon but they only listened to what they wanted to hear i dont know exactly what im looking for it could be a blockbooking for a minimum of four rooms made by some foreign tourists possibly french maybe from paris the booking would have been made for el rocio said falcon it could possibly be for more rooms but the crucial thing is that they would have fourwheeldrive cars driven down from northern europe rather than hired locally the manager spent time at his keyboard shaking his head as he entered variations on falcons data around the time of el rocio ive got large tour groups in coaches he said but theres nothing in the smaller blockbookings of between four and eight rooms there were roadworks where the metro was being built outside the hotel alfonso xiii and falcon decided that this was not the sort of place theyd stay in hed had a look at the porsche cayenne on the internet and he reckoned that the owner of a car like that would be looking for exclusivity somehow the alfonso xiiis grandeur made it passe it was a conservative persons hotel he tried the hotel imperial it was hidden away down a quiet street and overlooked the gardens of the casa pilatos he had no luck there either his epiphany of last night was beginning to take on the luridness of an earlymorning idea that looked absurd in the cold light of day the first indication that his creative instincts hadnt gone completely awry was at a boutique hotel where the receptionist remembered a woman from london calling in march asking for four rooms before and after el rocio with parking for four vehicles the hotel had no parking and only two rooms for the dates shed wanted the woman had asked to hold those rooms for twentyfour hours to see if she could find another two elsewhere the receptionist showed an email from a uk company which had arrived after the call from a woman called mouna chedadi making the booking on behalf of amanda turner falcon was certain that hed found what he was looking for he started working his way through a list of local hotels asking for a booking made by amanda turner thirtyfive minutes later he was sitting in the managers office of the hotel las casas de la juderia she was lucky he said a group had just cancelled ten minutes before she called and she got her four deluxe suites together what about their cars asked falcon giving him mouna chedadis name to make the search through the hotel email database they had four cars said the manager and i see here she was asking if they could leave them in the hotel while they went on the pilgrimage to el rocio did you let them the garage isnt big enough to hold four cars for people who arent current clients of the hotel at that time of year they were told that there were plenty of car parks in seville where they could leave them any idea what they did with their cars the manager called the receptionist and asked her to bring in the hotel registration forms for the four rooms she confirmed that the eight people had arrived in taxis from wherever theyd parked their cars they stayed here on st may said the manager and left the following day to go on the pilgrimage they came back on th june and left again on th june i remember they were going to granada for a night said the receptionist they came back here on th june and lefthave they left yet they paid their bill last night and left at seven thirty this morning when the garage opened so they did leave their cars here when they came back from granada said falcon do you know the models only the registration numbers what do they give as their professions fund managers all four of them did they leave any mobile phone numbers falcon asked for photocopies of the forms he went outside and phoned gregorio gave him the four uk registration numbers and asked him to find which models they belonged to back in the hotel he asked to speak to the bar staff whod been on duty the night before he knew what english people were like the bar staff remembered the group they tipped very well like americans rather than english people the men drank beer and the women drank manzanilla and then gin and tonics none of the bar staff knew enough english to understand anything of their conversation they remembered a man whod had a short exchange with them and then left soon after and there was another couple some other foreigners whod joined them for drinks theyd all gone out for dinner afterwards the other couple were identified as dutch and were called down to reception falcon worked on identifying the lone man whod had a brief chat with the group before leaving the bar staff said he looked spanish and spoke with a castellano rather than andaluz accent the receptionist remembered him and said that hed paid his bill last night as well she dug out his registration form hed given a spanish name and id card hed arrived on th june and had parked a car in the hotel garage as well falcon asked them to scan the id and registration form paste it into an email and send it to gregorio the dutchman appeared looking hungover theyd had a big night out with the english who theyd met on the pilgrimage to el rocio they hadnt got to bed until two in the morning and yet the english said they were leaving early did they say where they were going they just said they were going back to england what about their route they were staying in paradors then going via biarritz and the loire to the channel tunnel they all had to be back at work a week tomorrow falcon paced the patio willing his mobile to start vibrating gregorio called back just before am first of all that spanish id card was stolen last year and we havent got a visual match for his face in any of our files his car was a mercedes and was hired in jerez de la frontera on monday th june in the afternoon and it was returned at this morning ive told them not to touch the car until they hear from us are you going to tell me what this is about what about the car models of uk registrations theyre coming through now said gregorio reading them off a vw touareg a porsche cayenne a mercedes m and a range rover you remember the car manuals yacoub saw lets meet in your office now i can get secure phone lines there fortyfive minutes later falcon was still waiting in his office making notes as the complications to the scenario multiplied in his mind gregorio called from elviras office and told him hed set up a conference call with juan and pablo who were in madrid the first thing i want to hear is the line of logic in all this said juan gregorios talked us through it but i want to hear it from you javier falcon hesitated thinking there were more important things to discuss than the workings of his brain this is urgent said juan but were not in a panic these people are going to take their time travelling back and its going to give us time to find out what were up against ive sent some people from the bomb squad to take a look at the mercedes in the carhire company down in jerez lets get the information first and plan our action afterwards tell me javier falcon talked him through last nights thought processes the transmission with yacoub and the car manuals the notes hed looked over about el rocio the high brisance of hexogen the idea of crippling the eu with attacks on tourist resorts and financial centres juan was irritable and interrupted frequently when falcon happened to mention seeing himself on television juan was sarcastic we saw it here too he said very nice javier we dont allow ourselves to get too sentimental in the cni people need hope juan said pablo they get enough bullshit rammed down their throats by politicians without having to listen to the police version let him talk said gregorio rolling his eyes at falcon i went to bed and woke up a few hours later i watched a movie called troy said falcon and added a little jibe for juan you know the story of troy juan dont you gregorio shook his hand as if this was getting hot the greeks packed a wooden horse full of soldiers left it outside the gates of troy and faked a retreat the trojans pulled the horse inside and in doing so sealed their fate said juan at speed the first thing that occurred to me was how in this highsecurity age could islamic terrorists get a bomb into a significant building in a major citys financial centre ah said pablo youd get the people who work in the city centre to take it in there for you and how would you do that asked juan youd pack someones car full of high explosive while they were unaware said falcon tourists going to el rocio stay in seville before and after the event the main celebration of the pilgrimage finished on th june hammad and saoudi brought the hexogen to seville on th june with the intention of packing it into hardware and fitting it into these peoples cars so that they would drive it back to the uk and into the heart of the city of london the first and possibly the most important thing about this scenario said juan reasserting his control over the call is that the terrorists have intelligence the four guys who own these cars all work for the same company kraus maitland powers they manage one of the citys largest hedge funds specializing in japan china and southeast asia the relevance of that is they are all wealthy men they all live in big houses outside london which means that they drive into work every day and they dont get stuck in traffic because their work day starts at am and finishes at lunchtime their cars are guaranteed to be in the building in the heart of the city at rush hour their office is in a landmark building known as the gherkin where did you get all that information asked falcon mi and mi are already involved said juan they are now looking for various candidates who could have given the terrorists their intelligence what about this woman mouna chedadithe one who made the bookings for amanda turner asked falcon theyre looking at her records now she is not a known terrorist suspect she lives in braintree in essex just outside london shes muslim but not particularly devout and definitely not radical said juan shes only been working for amanda turners advertising agency since the beginning of march she would of course have known everything about their holiday arrangements but possibly not very much about amanda turners boyfriend and his colleagues working in the hedge fund said pablo which means the terrorists probably have two or more sources of intelligence but we dont know who they are so we cannot talk to anybody in any of the companies associated with these eight people said juan weve also consulted with the british and they agree that we cannot talk to the people in the cars either said pablo only a highly trained soldier would be capable of behaving normally whilst driving a car known to be packed with explosives which brings us to the final problem said juan because the hardware has been kept separate at all times from the high explosive and seems to be from different provenance the british are concerned that the core of the hardware might contain something toxic like nuclear waste they are also assuming that the cars will be shepherded back to their destination this means that the option of getting the people away from the cars is not a viable alternative youve got a call on line four juan said pablo in madrid hold on a moment said juan no talking while im gone we all need to know everything thats said gregorio looked for an ashtray but it was a nosmoking office he went into the corridor falcon stared into the carpet one of the advantages of the clandestine world was that nothing ever achieved reality for these people were any of them to actually see amanda turner sitting in the passenger seat of the porsche cayenne as it ripped past the spanish countryside it might be a different matter as it was shed become an element in the video game juan came back to the conference gregorio crushed his cigarette out that was the bomb squad from jerez de la frontera said juan theyve found traces of a hexogen plastique mix in the boot of the rented mercedes theyve also found two air holes drilled through from the boot into the back seat and evidence of food and drink it looks as if he drove into the hotel car park with the bombs and one or two technicians in the boot they were left overnight to install the devices in the british tourists vehicles i dont think we need any more confirmation than that said pablo but now we have to find these tourists said juan without creating a national police alert how long have they been on the move they left seville just after am said falcon its now the dutch couple said the british were heading north to spend a few nights in paradors the slow route would be via merida and salamanca said gregorio the fast route via cordoba valdepenas and madrid we should call the paradors de espana central office and find out where they made their bookings said pablo we can have a bomb squad waiting for them they can disable the devices overnight and the tourists can continue on their way without knowing a thing that should give us their route too said gregorio ok well start with that said juan any news from yacoub not yet said gregorio am i needed for this asked falcon theres a military plane waiting for the two of you at seville airport to bring you to madrid said juan well meet in barrajas in two hours time ive still got a lot to do here said falcon ive spoken to comisario elvira have you put anybody on yacoub in paris asked gregorio weve decided against it said juan and what about the three activated cells heading for paris asked falcon theyre looking more like decoys now said pablo the dgse french intelligence have been alerted and theyre following their progress they closed down the conference call gregorio and falcon drove straight to the airport i dont understand why youre involving me in this said falcon its the way juan works this was your idea you follow it through to the end said gregorio hes annoyed that one of us didnt pick up on the piece of information that unlocked the scenario but he always performs better when he has something to prove but it was pure luck that i picked up on an inconsequential bit of information thats what intelligence is all about said gregorio you put someone like yacoub into a dangerous situation nobody has any idea what hes supposed to be looking for we have a vision of a developing scenario which he cannot see he tells us what he can its up to us to translate it into something meaningful you managed to do that juan is annoyed because he was left looking at the decoy but then again he couldnt afford to ignore it are you worried about yacoub being sent to paris said falcon if he was part of the diversion that would mean the gicm know or at least suspect hes spying for us thats why juan is leaving him alone he wont even tell the dgse about him said gregorio if the gicm are looking at him theyll see someone completely clean thats the beauty of whats happened they put yacoub into the position where he found the information even though he didnt know what those car manuals represented it means he hasnt had to expose himself in any way when their operation breaks down they wont be able to point the finger at him yacoub is in a perfect position for the next time am i being stupid in asking why if you know so much about the gicm you dont just take it out asked falcon because we need to take out the whole network with it said gregorio they landed at barrajas airport in madrid at on a hot afternoon with the air crinkling above the tarmac a car met the plane and took them to an office at one end of the terminal building where juan and pablo were waiting for them weve had some developments here said juan the parador central office has records of bookings in zamora for tonight and santillana del mar for tomorrow night pablo called both hotels and found that the british cancelled their bookings four hours ago mi are trying to work out why theyve changed their plans said pablo it could be a family matter two of the women are sisters or it could be work the only problem is that they dont have anybody vetted on the inside of the hedge fund company there hasnt been any seismic movement in the far east markets theyre talking to city people now to see if theres talk of a buyout or a takeover have you found the cars yet asked falcon if they cancelled four hours ago they were already well on their way so we still have no idea whether theyre heading north via madrid or salamanca what about the ferries asked gregorio weve checked both bilbaoportsmouth and santanderplymouth and theyve made no bookings their channel tunnel booking still stands with no alteration to the date said pablo thats the interior minsters line juan juan took the call making notes he slammed down the phone british intelligence have now been in touch with french intelligence said juan amanda turner has just changed the channel tunnel bookings to monday afternoontomorrowso it looks as if theyre driving to northern france nonstop neither the french ministry of the interior nor the british home office want those cars going through the channel tunnel the french have said that they dont want those cars going through france their route north will take them close to nuclear reactors and through densely populated areas the cars are on spanish soil we have areas of low population density were going to have to deal with it here hes given us direct access to special forces its about kilometres from seville to madrid said gregorio its kilometres from seville to merida if they changed their plans four hours ago they could have still switched to the quicker route north via madrid so if they went to madrid directly they should already be past us but if they changed their route they should be around madrid now pablo called the guardia civil and told them to watch the nie heading north to burgos and the niie heading northeast to zaragoza emphasizing that they only wanted a report on the cars there was to be no pursuit and definitely no general alert juan and gregorio went to the map of spain and studied the two possible routes pablo contacted special forces and asked them to have two cars ready a driver and two armed men in each unmarked vehicle at the guardia civil called back with a sighting of the convoy on the madridzaragoza road just outside guadalajara pablo asked them to put motorbike police in all the service stations along the route and to report if the convoy left the road he went back to special forces gave them the route information and told them to watch out for the convoys shepherd their two cars left madrid at at the guardia civil called to say the convoy had left the road at a service station at kilometre they had also noticed a silver vw golf gti whose registration number had shown it to be a hire car from seville which had come off at the same time as the convoy two men had got out neither of them had gone into the service station they were both leaning on the back of the golf one of them was making a phone call on a mobile while pablo relayed that information to the special forces vehicles gregorio called the carhire company in seville it was closed falcon called ramirez and told him to get it open as soon as possible juan ordered a helicopter to be ready for immediate takeoff he gave the interior minister an update on the situation and told him that at some point they would have to close the mobile phone network down for an hour on the madridzaragoza road between calatayud and zaragoza special forces are going to have to take out the shepherd vehicle over one of the mountain passes he said that way if theyre using mobile phone technology to detonate the devices the network will be down and if theyre using a direct signal theres less chance of a good connection at ramirez called back from the carhire company gregorio gave the registration number of the silver golf gti the carhire company gave them the id card of the driver gregorio checked it on the computer stolen last week in granada the helicopter tilted and rose up into the cloudless sky above barrajas airport falcon hadnt wanted the privileged seat next to the pilot it had been ten years since hed been in a helicopter he felt exposed to the elements and had an unnerving sensation of lightness of being they tracked the niie autopista from madrid to zaragoza and in less than an hour they were up above the mountains around calatayud we dont often get to see this said juan over the headphones the denouement of an intelligence operation i mean even now as they raced towards the culmination of months of work and days of intensity it hardly felt real spain tore past under his feet and men somewhere below made their final preparations as the convoy of fourwheeldrive vehicles full of real live people sped north unknowing and unconcerned at this vast and complicated mechanism moving into action behind them the pilot gave him binoculars and pointed down at the section of road where he watched as a silver golf gti was overtaken by a dark blue bmw the bmw braked so sharply that puffs of smoke came out of the wheel arches the golf gti slammed into the back of it but the soldiers were out their guns ready arms jerking with the recoil the helicopter swooped down on the scene two men were being dragged from the car its windscreen was shattered the front crumpled steam pouring out from under the bonnet the helicopter hopped over to the other side of the mountain pass where the tourists convoy had been pulled over on to the hard shoulder by other armed special forces travelling in a forward car the helicopter turned and hovered as the four couples got out and ran away from their cars to see it all played out with no soundor rather too much sound from the thumping blades thrashing the airadded to the unreality falcon felt faint at the thought that this final operation had all happened as a result of his hunch what if reality yielded no bombs in the vehicles and a golf gti with two injured innocent men he must have been looking bewildered and lost because juans voice came on in his head we quite often think that he said did this really happen the helicopter banked away from the distant city of zaragoza which bristled under the heat and a stagnant smog the pilot muttered his position and direction as the brown hardbaked mountains settled back into the late afternoon coda sevillemonday th july falcon was sitting in the restaurant at the back of the bar in casa ricardo it was almost four years to the day that hed last been in this place and it had been no accident he took a sip of his beer and ate an olive he was just cooling off after the walk in the atrocious heat from his house there had been no time for anything in the last month the paperwork had achieved surreal dimensions from which he broke away to reenter a world hed expected to find changed but the bomb had been like an epileptic fit the city had suffered a terrible convulsion and there had been much concern for its future health but as the days passed and there were no further outbreaks life reverted to normal it left a lesion there were families with an unfillable space at the table and others who regularly summoned their courage to face another day at waist height to people theyd always looked in the eye there were the forgotten hundreds who looked in the mirror every morning to shave around a scar or smooth foundation on to a new blemish but the one force greater than the terrorists power to disrupt was humanitys need to get back into a routine the debrief on the intelligence operation had lasted four days falcon had been relieved when four explosive devices had been found in the british fourwheeldrive vehicles each device was a small marvel of engineering as each bombs aluminium casing had been built to fit in the car as if it was an integral piece of the structure falcon couldnt help but think that the bombs were like terrorism itself fitting so perfectly into society its sinister element indistinguishable his relief had been that they existed they werent a figment of his or the intelligence worlds imagination and there had been no dirty element in the core as the british had feared since returning from madrid falcon had been working with juez del rey to bring the case against rivero cardenas and zarrias to court although since rivero had suffered a stroke and been left unable to speak it was really against the last two the case was being prepared in another surreal dimension del rey had decided to prosecute the two men for the murder of tateb hassani first because he wanted to proceed step by step towards proving their involvement in the greater conspiracy what the public knew about hassani was that he had written the horrific instructions attached to the plans of the schools and biology faculty somehow through a collective blindness these instructions had been separated from the fiction that the conspiracy had attempted to establish the result was that large sections of the public thought of cardenas and zarrias as folk heroes yacoub had made contact on his return from paris the gicm high command had given him no instructions he thought that they suspected him and had therefore made no attempt to contact the cni he had wandered about in public places afraid to stay in his hotel room in case there was a knock he couldnt bear to answer he returned to rabat he attended the groups meetings in the house in the medina there was no mention of the failed mission calderons case was due to be tried in september inspector jefe luis zorrita and the instructing judge juan romero were convinced of his guilt their case was rocksolid falcon had not seen calderon again but had heard that he was resigned to his fate which was to spend fifteen years in prison for the murder of his wife manuela had been a worry to falcon hed thought that the vacancy left by angels removal would leave her lonely and depressed but hed underestimated her once the horror rage and despair at his crime had burnt out she found a renewed vitality all those lessons on positive energy from angel had paid off she did not sell the villa in puerto de santa maria the german buyer came back to her and she found a swede to take the other seville property she also didnt lack for dinner invitations people wanted to know everything about her life with angel zarrias there had been other positive developments in the aftermath to the bomb last sunday while sitting on a park bench in the shade of some trees in the parque maria luisa falcon had found his eye drawn to a family group the man was pushing a wheelchair occupied by a young girl and he was talking to a small blonde woman in a turquoise top and white skirt only when two kids sprinted up to join them did falcon recognize that the children belonged to cristina ferrera who put her arm around her son while her daughter reached over and helped the man push the wheelchair it was only then that he realized that he was looking at fernando alanis falcon had arrived too early in the casa ricardo he finished his beer and asked the passing waiter to bring him a chilled manzanilla the waiter came back with a bottle of la guita and the menu the dry sherry misted the glass as it trickled in he fanned himself with the menu he was on a different table to the one hed been at four years ago this one gave him the perfect view of the door which drew his attention every time someone came in he couldnt bear the teenage anxiety creeping up on him at times like this his mind would gang up on him and hed find himself thinking about the other thing that made him anxious that promise hed made to the people of seville to find the ultimate perpetrators of the bombing the sight of himself on the television in the galician bar came back to him again and again along with juans sarcastic comment had that been a crazy thing to do or as juan had said just sentimental no it hadnt been he was sure of it he had his ideas he knew when he had more time where he was going to start looking its always the way that just as your mind engages elsewhere the person youve been waiting for all this time arrives she was over him before he knew it the pensive inspector jefe she said his heart leapt in his chest so that he sprang to his feet as usual he said youre looking beautiful consuelo acknowledgements this book would have been impossible without extensive research in morocco especially to see how all levels of moroccan society are reacting to the friction between islam and the west i would like to thank laila for her hospitality and for introducing me to people from all walks of life they gave me valuable insights into the arab worlds point of view i
