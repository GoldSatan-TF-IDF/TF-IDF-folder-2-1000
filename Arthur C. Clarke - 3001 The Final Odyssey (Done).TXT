the final odyssey arthur c clarke prologue the firstborn call them the firstborn though they were not remotely human they were flesh and blood and when they looked out across the deeps of space they felt awe and wonder and loneliness as soon as they possessed the power they began to seek for fellowship among the stars in their explorations they encountered life in many forms and watched the workings of evolution on a thousand worlds they saw how often the first faint sparks of intelligence flickered and died in the cosmic night and because in all the galaxy they had found nothing more precious than mind they encouraged its dawning everywhere they became farmers in the fields of stars they sowed and sometimes they reaped and sometimes dispassionately they had to weed the great dinosaurs had long since passed away their morning promise annihilated by a random hammerblow from space when the survey ship entered the solar system after a voyage that had already lasted a thousand years it swept past the frozen outer planets paused briefly above the deserts of dying mars and presently looked down on earth spread out beneath them the explorers saw a world swarming with life for years they studied collected catalogued when they had learned all that they could they began to modify they tinkered with the destiny of many species on land and in the seas but which of their experiments would bear fruit they could not know for at least a million years they were patient but they were not yet immortal there was so much to do in this universe of a hundred billion suns and other worlds were calling so they set out once more into the abyss knowing that they would never come this way again nor was there any need the servants they had left behind would do the rest on earth the glaciers came and went while above them the changeless moon still carried its secret from the stars with a yet slower rhythm than the polar ice the tides of civilization ebbed and flowed across the galaxy strange and beautiful and terrible empires rose and fell and passed on their knowledge to their successors and now out among the stars evolution was driving towards new goals the first explorers of earth had long since come to the limits of flesh and blood as soon as their machines were better than their bodies it was time to move first their brains and then their thoughts alone they transferred into shining new homes of metal and gemstone in these they roamed the galaxy they no longer built spaceships they were spaceships but the age of the machineentities swiftly passed in their ceaseless experimenting they had learned to store knowledge in the structure of space itself and to preserve their thoughts for eternity in frozen lattices of light into pure energy therefore they presently transformed themselves and on a thousand worlds the empty shells they had discarded twitched for a while in a mindless dance of death then crumbled into dust now they were lords of the galaxy and could rove at will among the stars or sink like a subtle mist through the very interstices of space though they were freed at last from the tyranny of matter they had not wholly forgotten their origin in the warm slime of a vanished sea and their marvelous instruments still continued to function watching over the experiments started so many ages ago but no longer were they always obedient to the mandates of their creators like all material things they were not immune to the corruption of time and its patient unsleeping servant entropy and sometimes they discovered and sought goals of their own i star city comet cowboy captain dimitri chandler or dim to his very best friends was understandably annoyed the message from earth had taken six hours to reach the spacetug goliath here beyond the orbit of neptune if it had arrived ten minutes later he could have answered sorry cant leave now weve just started to deploy the sunscreen the excuse would have been perfectly valid wrapping a comets core in a sheet of reflective film only a few molecules thick but kilometers on a side was not the sort of job you could abandon while it was halfcompleted still it would be a good idea to obey this ridiculous request he was already in disfavor sunwards through no fault of his own collecting ice from the rings of saturn and nudging it towards venus and mercury where it was really needed had started back in the s three centuries ago captain chandler had never been able to see any real difference in the before and after images the solar conservers were always producing to support their accusations of celestial vandalism but the general public still sensitive to the ecological disasters of previous centuries had thought otherwise and the hands off saturn vote had passed by a substantial majority as a result chandler was no longer a ring rustler but a comet cowboy so here he was at an appreciable fraction of the distance to alpha centauri rounding up stragglers from the kuiper belt there was certainly enough ice out here to cover mercury and venus with oceans kilometers deep but it might take centuries to extinguish their hellfires and make them suitable for life the solar conservers of course were still protesting against this though no longer with so much enthusiasm the millions dead from the tsunami caused by the pacific asteroid in how ironic that a land impact would have done much less damage had reminded all future generations that the human race had too many eggs in one fragile basket well chandler told himself it would be fifty years before this particular package reached its destination so a delay of a week would hardly make much difference but all the calculations about rotation center of mass and thrust vectors would have to be redone and radioed back to mars for checking it was a good idea to do your sums carefully before nudging billions of tons of ice along an orbit that might take it within hailing distance of earth as they had done so many times before captain chandlers eyes strayed towards the ancient photograph above his desk it showed a threemasted steamship dwarfed by the iceberg that was looming above it as indeed goliath was dwarfed at this very moment how incredible he had often thought that only one long lifetime spanned the gulf between this primitive discovery and the ship that had carried the same name to jupiter and what would those antarctic explorers of a thousand years ago have made of the view from his bridge they would certainly have been disoriented for the wall of ice beside which goliath was floating stretched both upwards and downwards as far as the eye could see and it was strangelooking ice wholly lacking the immaculate whites and blues of the frozen polar seas in fact it looked dirty as indeed it was for only some ninety per cent was waterice the rest was a witchs brew of carbon and sulfur compounds most of them stable only at temperatures not far above absolute zero thawing them out could produce unpleasant surprises as one astrochemist had famously remarked comets have bad breath skipper to all personnel chandler announced theres been a slight change of program weve been asked to delay operations to investigate a target that spaceguard radar has picked up any details somebody asked when the chorus of groans over the ships intercom had died away not many but i gather its another millennium committee project theyve forgotten to cancel more groans everyone had become heartily sick of all the events planned to celebrate the end of the s there had been a general sigh of relief when january had passed uneventfully and the human race could resume its normal activities anyway it will probably be another false alarm like the last one well get back to work just as quickly as we can skipper out this was the third wildgoosechase chandler thought morosely hed been involved with during his career despite centuries of exploration the solar system could still produce surprises and presumably spaceguard had a good reason for its request he only hoped that some imaginative idiot hadnt once again sighted the fabled golden asteroid if it did exist which chandler did not for a moment believe it would be no more than a mineralogical curiosity it would be of far less real value than the ice he was nudging sunwards to bring life to barren worlds there was one possibility however which he did take quite seriously already the human race had scattered its robot probes through a volume of space a hundred lightyears across and the tycho monolith was sufficient reminder that much older civilizations had engaged in similar activities there might well be other alien artifacts in the solar system or in transit through it captain chandler suspected that spaceguard had something like this in mind otherwise it would hardly have diverted a class spacetug to go chasing after an unidentified radar blip five hours later the questing goliath detected the echo at extreme range even allowing for the distance it seemed disappointingly small however as it grew clearer and stronger it began to give the signature of a metallic object perhaps a couple of meters long it was travelling on an orbit heading out of the solar system so was almost certainly chandler decided one of the myriad pieces of spacejunk that mankind had tossed towards the stars during the last millennium and which might one day provide the only evidence that the human race had ever existed then it came close enough for visual inspection and captain chandler realized with awed astonishment that some patient historian was still checking the earliest records of the space age what a pity that the computers had given him the answer just a few years too late for the millennium celebrations goliath here chandler radioed earthwards his voice tinged with pride as well as solemnity were bringing aboard a thousandyearold astronaut and i can guess who it is awakening frank poole awoke but he did not remember he was not even sure of his name obviously he was in a hospital room even though his eyes were still closed the most primitive and evocative of his senses told him that each breath brought the faint and not unpleasant tang of antiseptics in the air and it triggered a memory of the time when of course as a reckless teenager he had broken a rib in the arizona hanggliding championship now it was all beginning to come back im deputy commander frank poole executive officer usss discovery on a top secret mission to jupiter it seemed as if an icy hand had gripped his heart he remembered in slowmotion playback that runaway spacepod jetting towards him metal claws outstretched then the silent impact and the notsosilent hiss of air rushing out of his suit after that one last memory of spinning helplessly in space trying in vain to reconnect his broken airhose well whatever mysterious accident had happened to the spacepod controls he was safe now presumably dave had made a quick eva and rescued him before lack of oxygen could do permanent brain damage good old dave he told himself i must thank just a moment im obviously not aboard discovery now surely i havent been unconscious long enough to be taken back to earth his confused train of thought was abruptly broken by the arrival of a matron and two nurses wearing the immemorial uniform of their profession they seemed a little surprised poole wondered if he had awakened ahead of schedule and the idea gave him a childish feeling of satisfaction hello he said after several attempts his vocal cords appeared to be very rusty how am i doing matron smiled back at him and gave an obvious dont try to talk command by putting a finger to her lips then the two nurses fussed swiftly over him with practiced skill checking pulse temperature reflexes when one of them lifted his right arm and let it drop again poole noticed something peculiar it fell slowly and did not seem to weigh as much as normal nor for that matter did his body when he attempted to move so i must be on a planet he thought or a spacestation with artificial gravity certainly not earth i dont weigh enough he was about to ask the obvious question when matron pressed something against the side of his neck he felt a slight tingling sensation and sank back into a dreamless sleep just before he became unconscious he had time for one more puzzled thought how odd they never spoke a single word all the time they were with me rehabilitation when he woke again and found matron and nurses standing round his bed poole felt strong enough to assert himself where am i surely you can tell me that the three women exchanged glances obviously uncertain what to do next then matron answered enunciating her words very slowly and carefully everything is fine mr poole professor anderson will be here in a minute he will explain explain what thought poole with some exasperation but at least she speaks english even though i cant place her accent anderson must have been already on his way for the door opened moments later to give poole a brief glimpse of a small crowd of inquisitive onlookers peering in at him he began to feel like a new exhibit at a zoo professor anderson was a small dapper man whose features seemed to have combined key aspects of several races chinese polynesian nordic in a thoroughly confusing fashion he greeted poole by holding up his right palm then did an obvious doubletake and shook hands with such a curious hesitation that he might have been rehearsing some quite unfamiliar gesture glad to see youre looking so well mr poolewell have you up in no time again that odd accent and slow delivery but the confident bedside manner was that of all doctors in all places and all ages im glad to hear it now perhaps you can answer a few questions of course of course but just a minute anderson spoke so rapidly and quietly to the matron that poole could catch only a few words several of which were wholly unfamiliar to him then the matron nodded at one of the nurses who opened a wallcupboard and produced a slim metal band which she proceeded to wrap around pooles head whats that for he asked being one of those difficult patients so annoying to doctors who always want to know just whats happening to them eec readout professor matron and nurses looked equally baffled then a slow smile spread across andersons face oh electroencephalogram he said slowly as if dredging the word up from the depth of memory youre quite right we just want to monitor your brain functions my brain would function perfectly well if youd let me use it poole grumbled silently but at least we seem to be getting somewhere finally mr poole said anderson still speaking in that curious stilted voice as if venturing in a foreign language you know of course that you were disabled in a serious accident while you were working outside discovery poole nodded agreement im beginning to suspect he said dryly that disabled is a slight understatement anderson relaxed visibly and a slow smile spread across his face youre quite correct tell me what you think happened well the best case scenario is that after i became unconscious dave bowman rescued me and brought me back to the ship how is dave no one will tell me anything all in due courseand the worst case it seemed to frank poole that a chill wind was blowing gently on the back of his neck the suspicion that had been slowly forming in his mind began to solidify that i died but was brought back here wherever here is and youve been able to revive me thank you quite correct and youre back on earth well very near it what did he mean by very near it there was certainly a gravity field here so he was probably inside the slowly turning wheel of an orbiting spacestation no matter there was something much more important to think about poole did some quick mental calculations if dave had put him in the hibernaculum revived the rest of the crew and completed the mission to jupiter why he could have been dead for as much as five years just what date is it he asked as calmly as possible professor and matron exchanged glances again poole felt that cold wind on his neck i must tell you mr poole that bowman did not rescue you he believed and we cannot blame him that you were irrevocably dead also he was facing a desperately serious crisis that threatened his own survival so you drifted on into space passed through the jupiter system and headed out towards the stars fortunately you were so far below freezing point that there was no metabolism but its a nearmiracle that you were ever found at all you are one of the luckiest men alive no ever to have lived am i poole asked himself bleakly five years indeed it could be a century or even more let me have it he demanded professor and matron seemed to be consulting an invisible monitor when they looked at each other and nodded agreement poole guessed that they were all plugged into the hospital information circuit linked to the headband he was wearing frank said professor anderson making a smooth switch to the role of longtime family physician this will be a great shock to you but youre capable of accepting it and the sooner you know the better were near the beginning of the fourth millennium believe me you left earth almost a thousand years ago i believe you poole answered calmly then to his great annoyance the room started to spin around him and he knew nothing more when he regained consciousness he found that he was no longer in a bleak hospital room but in a luxurious suite with attractive and steadily changing images on the walls some of these were famous and familiar paintings others showed land and seascapes that might have been from his own time there was nothing alien or upsetting that he guessed would come later his present surroundings had obviously been carefully programmed he wondered if there was the equivalent of a television screen somewhere but could see no sign of any controls near his bed there was so much he would have to learn in this new world he was a savage who had suddenly encountered civilization but first he must regain his strength and learn the language not even the advent of sound recording already more than a century old when poole was born had prevented major changes in grammar and pronunciation and there were thousands of new words mostly from science and technology though often he was able to make a shrewd guess at their meaning more frustrating however were the myriad of famous and infamous personal names that had accumulated over the millennium and which meant nothing to him for weeks until he had built up a data bank most of his conversations had to be interrupted with potted biographies as pooles strength increased so did the number of his visitors though always under professor andersons watchful eye they included medical specialists scholars of several disciplines and of the greatest interest to him spacecraft commanders there was little that he could tell the doctors and historians that was not recorded somewhere in mankinds gigantic data banks but he was often able to give them research shortcuts and new insights about the events of his own time though they all treated him with the utmost respect and listened patiently as he tried to answer their questions they seemed reluctant to answer his poole began to feel that he was being overprotected from culture shock and halfseriously wondered how he could escape from his suite on the few occasions he was alone he was not surprised to discover that the door was locked then the arrival of doctor indra wallace changed everything despite her name her chief racial component appeared to be japanese and there were times when with just a little imagination poole could picture her as a rather mature geisha girl it was hardly an appropriate image for a distinguished historian holding a virtual chair at a university still boasting real ivy she was the first visitor with a fluent command of pooles own english so he was delighted to meet her mr poole she began in a very businesslike voice ive been appointed your official guide and lets say mentor my qualifications ive specialized in your period my thesis was the collapse of the nationstate i believe we can help each other in many ways im sure we can first id like you to get me out of here so i can see a little of your world exactly what we intend to do but first we must give you an ident until then youll be what was the term a nonperson it would be almost impossible for you to go anywhere or get anything done no input device would recognize your existence just what i expected poole answered with a wry smile it was starting to get that way in my own time and many people hated the idea some still do they go off and live in the wilderness theres a lot more on earth than there was in your century but they always take their compaks with them so they can call for help as soon as they get into trouble the median time is about five days sorry to hear that the human race has obviously deteriorated he was cautiously testing her trying to find the limits of her tolerance and to map out her personality it was obvious that they were going to spend much time together and that he would have to depend upon her in hundreds of ways yet he was still not sure if he would even like her perhaps she regarded him merely as a fascinating museum exhibit rather to pooles surprise she agreed with his criticism that may be true in some respects perhaps were physically weaker but were healthier and better adjusted than most humans who have ever lived the noble savage was always a myth she walked over to a small rectangular plate set at eyelevel in the door it was about the size of one of the countless magazines that had proliferated in the faroff age of print and poole had noticed that every room seemed to have at least one usually they were blank but sometimes they contained lines of slowly scrolling text completely meaningless to poole even when most of the words were familiar once a plate in his suite had emitted urgent beepings which he had ignored on the assumption that someone else would deal with the problem whatever it was fortunately the noise stopped as abruptly as it had started dr wallace laid the palm of her hand upon the plate then removed it after a few seconds she glanced at poole and said smilingly come and look at this the inscription that had suddenly appeared made a good deal of sense when he read it slowly wallace indra i suppose it means female date of birth march and that youre associated with the department of history at oxford and i guess that is a personal identification number correct excellent mr poole ive seen some of your email addresses and credit card numbers hideous strings of alphanumeric gibberish that no one could possibly remember but we all know our date of birth and not more than other people will share it so a fivefigure number is all youll ever needand even if you forget that it doesnt really matter as you see its a part of you implant yes nanochip at birth one in each palm for redundancy you wont even feel yours when it goes in but youve given us a small problem whats that the readers youll meet most of the time are too simpleminded to believe your date of birth so with your permission weve moved it up a thousand years permission granted and the rest of the ident optional you can leave it empty give your current interests and location or use it for personal messages global or targeted some things poole was quite sure would not have changed over the centuries a high proportion of those targeted messages would be very personal indeed he wondered if there were still self or stateappointed censors in this day and age and if their efforts at improving other peoples morals had been more successful than in his own time he would have to ask dr wallace about that when he got to know her better a room with a view frank professor anderson thinks youre strong enough to go for a little walk im very pleased to hear it do you know the expression stir crazy no but i can guess what it means poole had so adapted to the low gravity that the long strides he was taking seemed perfectly normal half a gee he had estimated just right to give a sense of wellbeing they met only a few people on their walk all of them strangers but every one gave a smile of recognition by now poole told himself with a trace of smugness i must be one of the bestknown celebrities in this world that should be a great help when i decide what to do with the rest of my life at least another century if i can believe anderson the corridor along which they were walking was completely featureless apart from occasional numbered doors each bearing one of the universal recog panels poole had followed indra for perhaps two hundred meters when he came to a sudden halt shocked because he had not realized something so blindingly obvious this spacestation must be enormous he exclaimed indra smiled back at him didnt you have a saying you aint seen anything yet nothing he corrected absentmindedly he was still trying to estimate the scale of this structure when he had another surprise who would have imagined a spacestation large enough to boast a subway admittedly a miniature one with a single small coach capable of seating only a dozen passengers observation lounge three ordered indra and they drew silently and swiftly away from the terminal poole checked the time on the elaborate wristband whose functions he was still exploring one minor surprise had been that the whole world was now on universal time the confusing patchwork of time zones had been swept away by the advent of global communications there had been much talk of this back in the twentyfirst century and it had even been suggested that solar should be replaced by sidereal time then during the course of the year the sun would move right round the clock setting at the time it had risen six months earlier however nothing had come of this equal time in the sun proposal or of even more vociferous attempts to reform the calendar that particular job it had been cynically suggested would have to wait for somewhat major advances in technology some day surely one of gods minor mistakes would be corrected and the earths orbit would be adjusted to give every year twelve months of thirty exactly equal days as far as poole could judge by speed and elapsed time they must have traveled at least three kilometers before the vehicle came to a silent stop the doors opened and a bland autovoice intoned have a good view thirtyfive per cent cloudcover today at last thought poole were getting near the outer wall but here was another mystery despite the distance he had gone neither the strength nor the direction of gravity had altered he could not imagine a spinning spacestation so huge that the geevector would not be changed by such a displacementcould he really be on some planet after all but he would feel lighter usually much lighter on any other habitable world in the solar system when the outer door of the terminal opened and poole found himself entering a small airlock he realized that he must indeed be in space but where were the spacesuits he looked around anxiously it was against all his instincts to be so close to vacuum naked and unprotected one experience of that was enough were nearly there said indra reassuringly the last door opened and he was looking out into the utter blackness of space through a huge window that was curved both vertically and horizontally he felt like a goldfish in its bowl and hoped that the designers of this audacious piece of engineering knew exactly what they were doing they certainly possessed better structural materials than had existed in his time though the stars must be shining out there his lightadapted eyes could see nothing but black emptiness beyond the curve of the great window as he started to walk towards it to get a wider view indra restrained him and pointed straight ahead look carefully she said dont you see it poole blinked and stared into the night surely it must be an illusion even heaven forbid a crack in the window he moved his head from side to side no it was real but what could it be he remembered euclids definition a line has length but no thickness for spanning the whole height of the window and obviously continuing out of sight above and below was a thread of light quite easy to see when he looked for it yet so onedimensional that the word thin could not even be applied however it was not completely featureless there were barely visible spots of greater brilliance at irregular intervals along its length like drops of water on a spiders web poole continued walking towards the window and the view expanded until at last he could see what lay below him it was familiar enough the whole continent of europe and much of northern africa just as he had seen them many times from space so he was in orbit after all probably an equatorial one at a height of at least a thousand kilometers indra was looking at him with a quizzical smile go closer to the window she said very softly so that you can look straight down i hope you have a good head for heights what a silly thing to say to an astronaut poole told himself as he moved forward if i ever suffered from vertigo i wouldnt be in this business the thought had barely passed through his mind when he cried my god and involuntarily stepped back from the window then bracing himself he dared to look again he was looking down on the distant mediterranean from the face of a cylindrical tower whose gently curving wall indicated a diameter of several kilometers but that was nothing compared with its length for it tapered away down down down until it disappeared into the mist somewhere over africa he assumed that it continued all the way to the surface how high are we he whispered two thousand kay but now look upwards this time it was not such a shock he had expected what he would see the tower dwindled away until it became a glittering thread against the blackness of space and he did not doubt that it continued all the way to the geostationary orbit thirtysix thousand kilometers above the equator such fantasies had been well known in pooles day he had never dreamed he would see the reality and be living in it he pointed towards the distant thread reaching up from the eastern horizon that must be another one yes the asian tower we must look exactly the same to them how many are there just four equally spaced around the equator africa asia america pacifica the last ones almost empty only a few hundred levels completed nothing to see except water poole was still absorbing this stupendous concept when a disturbing thought occurred to him there were already thousands of satellites at all sorts of altitudes in my time how do you avoid collisions indra looked slightly embarrassed you know i never thought about that its not my field she paused for a moment clearly searching her memory then her face brightened i believe there was a big cleanup operation centuries ago there just arent any satellites below the stationary orbit that made sense poole told himself they wouldnt be needed the four gigantic towers could provide all the facilities once provided by thousands of satellites and spacestations and there have never been any accidents any collisions with spaceships leaving earth or reentering the atmosphere indra looked at him with surprise but they dont any more she pointed to the ceiling all the spaceports are where they should be up there on the outer ring i believe its four hundred years since the last rocket lifted off from the surface of the earth poole was still digesting this when a trivial anomaly caught his attention his training as an astronaut had made him alert to anything out of the ordinary in space that might be a matter of life or death the sun was out of view high overhead but its rays streaming down through the great window painted a brilliant band of light on the floor underfoot cutting across that band at an angle was another much fainter one so that the frame of the window threw a double shadow poole had to go almost down on his knees so that he could peer up at the sky he had thought himself beyond surprise but the spectacle of two suns left him momentarily speechless whats that he gasped when he had recovered his breath oh havent you been told thats lucifer earth has another sun well it doesnt give us much heat but its put the moon out of businessbefore the second mission went there to look for you that was the planet jupiter i knew i would have much to learn in this new world poole told himself but just how much i never dreamed education poole was both astonished and delighted when the television set was wheeled into the room and positioned at the end of his bed delighted because he was suffering from mild information starvation and astonished because it was a model which had been obsolete even in his own time weve had to promise the museum well give it back matron informed him and i expect you know how to use this as he fondled the remotecontrol poole felt a wave of acute nostalgia sweep over him as few other artifacts could it brought back memories of his childhood and the days when most television sets were too stupid to understand spoken commands thank you matron whats the best news channel she seemed puzzled by his question then brightened oh i see what you mean but professor anderson thinks youre not quite ready yet so archives has put together a collection that will make you feel at home poole wondered briefly what the storage medium was in this day and age he could still remember compact disks and his eccentric old uncle george had been the proud possessor of a collection of vintage videotapes but surely that technological contest must have finished centuries ago in the usual darwinian way with the survival of the fittest he had to admit that the selection was well done by someone familiar with the early twentyfirst century there was nothing disturbing no wars or violence and very little contemporary business or politics all of which would now be utterly irrelevant there were some light comedies sporting events classical and pop music and wildlife documentaries and whoever had put this collection together had a sense of humor or they would not have included episodes from each star trek series as a very small boy poole had met both patrick stewart and leonard nimoy he wondered what they would have thought if they could have known the destiny of the child who had shyly asked for their autographs a depressing thought occurred to him soon after he had started exploring much of the time in fastforward these relics of the past he had read somewhere that by the turn of the century his century there were approximately fifty thousand television stations broadcasting simultaneously if that figure had been maintained and it might well have increased by now millions of millions of hours of tv programming must have gone on the air so even the most hardened cynic would admit that there were probably at least a billion hours of worthwhile viewingand millions that would pass the highest standards of excellence how to find these few well few million needles in so gigantic a haystack the thought was so overwhelming indeed so demoralizing that after a week of increasingly aimless channelsurfing poole asked for the set to be removed perhaps fortunately he had less and less time to himself during his waking hours which were steadily growing longer as his strength came back there was no risk of boredom thanks to the continual parade not only of serious researchers but also inquisitive and presumably influential citizens who had managed to filter past the palace guard established by matron and professor anderson nevertheless he was glad when one day the television set reappeared he was beginning to suffer from withdrawal symptoms and this time he resolved to be more selective in his viewing the venerable antique was accompanied by indra wallace smiling broadly weve found something you must see frank we think it will help you to adjust anyway were sure youll enjoy it poole had always found that remark a recipe for guaranteed boredom and prepared for the worst but the opening had him instantly hooked taking him back to his old life as few other things could have done at once he recognized one of the most famous voices of his age and remembered that he had seen this very program before could it have been at its first transmission no he was only five then must have been a repeat atlanta december this is cnn international five minutes from the dawn of the new millennium with all its unknown perils and promise but before we try to explore the future lets look back a thousand years and ask ourselves could any persons living in ad even remotely imagine our world or understand it if they were magically transported across the centuries almost the whole of the technology we take for granted was invented near the very end of our millennium the steam engine electricity telephones radio television cinema aviation electronics and during a single lifetime nuclear energy and space travel what would the greatest minds of the past have made of these how long could an archimedes or a leonardo have retained his sanity if suddenly dumped into our world its tempting to think that we would do better if we were transported a thousand years hence surely the fundamental scientific discoveries have already been made though there will be major improvements in technology will there be any devices anything as magical and incomprehensible to us as a pocket calculator or a video camera would have been to isaac newton perhaps our age is indeed sundered from all those that have gone before telecommunications the ability to record images and sounds once irrevocably lost the conquest of the air and space all these have created a civilization beyond the wildest fantasies of the past and equally important copernicus newton darwin and einstein have so changed our mode of thinking and our outlook on the universe that we might seem almost a new species to the most brilliant of our predecessors and will our successors a thousand years from now look back on us with the same pity with which we regard our ignorant superstitious diseaseridden shortlived ancestors we believe that we know the answers to questions that they could not even ask but what surprises does the third millennium hold for us well here it comes a great bell began to toll the strokes of midnight the last vibration throbbed into silence and thats the way it was goodbye wonderful and terrible twentieth century then the picture broke into a myriad fragments and a new commentator took over speaking with the accent which poole could now easily understand and which immediately brought him up to the present now in the first minutes of the year three thousand and one we can answer that question from the past certainly the people of who you were just watching would not feel as utterly overwhelmed in our age as someone from would have felt in theirs many of our technological achievements they would have anticipated indeed they would have expected satellite cities and colonies on the moon and planets they might even have been disappointed because we are not yet immortal and have sent probes only to the nearest stars abruptly indra switched off the recording see the rest later frank youre getting tired but i hope it will help you to adjust thank you indra ill have to sleep on it but its certainly proved one point whats that i should be grateful im not a thousandandoner dropped into that would be too much of a quantum jump i dont believe anyone could adjust to it at least i know about electricity and wont die of fright if a picture starts talking at me i hope poole told himself that confidence is justified someone once said that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic will i meet magic in this new world and be able to handle it braincap im afraid youll have to make an agonizing decision said professor anderson with a smile that neutralized the exaggerated gravity of his words i can take it doctor just give it to me straight before you can be fitted with your braincap you have to be completely bald so heres your choice at the rate your hair grows youd have to be shaved at least once a month or you could have a permanent hows that done laser scalp treatment kills the follicles at the root hmmis it reversible yes but thats messy and painful and takes weeks then ill see how i like being hairless before committing myself i cant forget what happened to samson who character in a famous old book his girlfriend cut off his hair while he was sleeping when he woke up all his strength had gone now i remember pretty obvious medical symbolism still i wouldnt mind losing my beard id be happy to stop shaving once and for all ill make the arrangements and what kind of wig would you like poole laughed im not particularly vain think it would be a nuisance and probably wont bother something else i can decide later that everyone in this era was artificially bald was a surprising fact that poole had been quite slow to discover his first revelation had come when both his nurses removed their luxuriant tresses without the slightest sign of embarrassment just before several equally bald specialists arrived to give him a series of microbiological checks he had never been surrounded by so many hairless people and his initial guess was that this was the latest step in the medical professions endless war against germs like many of his guesses it was completely wrong and when he discovered the true reason he amused himself by seeing how often he would have been sure had he not known in advance that his visitors hair was not their own the answer was seldom with men never with women this was obviously the great age of the wigmaker professor anderson wasted no time that afternoon the nurses smeared some evilsmelling cream over pooles head and when he looked into the mirror an hour later he did not recognize himself well he thought perhaps a wig would be a good idea after all the braincap fitting took somewhat longer first a mold had to be made which required him to sit motionless for a few minutes until the plaster set he fully expected to be told that his head was the wrong shape when his nurses giggling most unprofessionally had a hard time extricating him ouch that hurt he complained next came the skullcap itself a metal helmet that fitted snugly almost down to the ears and triggered a nostalgic thought wish my jewish friends could see me now after a few minutes it was so comfortable that he was unaware of its presence now he was ready for the installation a process which he realized with something akin to awe had been the rite of passage for almost all the human race for more than half a millennium theres no need to close your eyes said the technician who had been introduced by the pretentious title of brain engineer almost always shortened to brainman in popular usage when setup begins all your inputs will be taken over even if your eyes are open you wont see anything i wonder if everyone feels as nervous as this poole asked himself is this the last moment ill be in control of my own mind still ive learned to trust the technology of this age up to now it hasnt let me down of course as the old saying goes theres always a first time as he had been promised he had felt nothing except a gentle tickling as the myriad of nanowires wormed their way through his scalp all his senses were still perfectly normal when he scanned his familiar room everything was exactly where it should be the brainman wearing his own skullcap wired like pooles to a piece of equipment that could easily have been mistaken for a twentiethcentury laptop computer gave him a reassuring smile ready he asked there were times when the old cliches were the best ones ready as ill ever be poole answered slowly the light faded or seemed to a great silence descended and even the gentle gravity of the tower relinquished its hold upon him he was an embryo floating in a featureless void though not in complete darkness he had known such a barely visible near ultraviolet tenebrosity on the very edge of night only once in his life when he had descended further than was altogether wise down the face of a sheer cliff at the outer edge of the great barrier reef looking down into hundreds of meters of crystalline emptiness he had felt such a sense of disorientation that he experienced a brief moment of panic and had almost triggered his buoyancy unit before regaining control needless to say he had never mentioned the incident to the space agency physicians from a great distance a voice spoke out of the immense void that now seemed to surround him but it did not reach him through his ears it sounded softly in the echoing labyrinths of his brain calibration starting from time to time you will be asked questions you can answer mentally but it may help to vocalize do you understand yes poole replied wondering if his lips were indeed moving there was no way that he could tell something was appearing in the void a grid of thin lines like a huge sheet of graph paper it extended up and down right and left to the limits of his vision he tried to move his head but the image refused to change numbers started to flicker across the grid too fast for him to read but presumably some circuit was recording them poole could not help smiling at the familiarity of it all this was just like the computerdriven eye examination that any oculist of his age would give a client the grid vanished to be replaced by smooth sheets of color filling his entire field of view in a few seconds they flashed from one end of the spectrum to the other could have told you that poole muttered silently my color visions perfect next for hearing i suppose he was quite correct a faint drumming sound accelerated until it became the lowest of audible cs then raced up the musical scale until it disappeared beyond the range of human hearing into bat and dolphin territory that was the last of the simple straightforward tests he was briefly assailed by scents and flavors most of them pleasant but some quite the reverse then he became or so it seemed a puppet on an invisible string he presumed that his neuromuscular control was being tested and hoped that there were no external manifestations if there were he would probably look like someone in the terminal stages of st vituss dance and for one moment he even had a violent erection but was unable to give it a reality check before he fell into a dreamless sleep or did he only dream that he slept he had no idea how much time had elapsed before he awoke the helmet had already gone together with the brainman and his equipment everything went fine beamed matron it will take a few hours to check that there are no anomalies if your readings ko i mean ok youll have your braincap tomorrow poole appreciated the efforts of his entourage to learn archaic english but he could not help wishing that matron had not made that unfortunate slipofthetongue when the time came for the final filling poole felt almost like a boy again about to unwrap some wonderful new toy under the christmas tree you wont have to go through all that settingup again the brainman assured him download will start immediately ill give you a fiveminute demo just relax and enjoy gentle soothing music washed over him though it was something very familiar from his own time he could not identify it there was a mist before his eyes which parted as he walked towards it yes he was walking the illusion was utterly convincing he could feel the impact of his feet on the ground and now that the music had stopped he could hear a gentle wind blowing through the great trees that appeared to surround him he recognized them as californian redwoods and hoped that they still existed in reality somewhere on earth he was moving at a brisk pace too fast for comfort as if time was slightly accelerated so he could cover as much ground as possible yet he was not conscious of any effort he felt he was a guest in someone elses body the sensation was enhanced by the fact that he had no control over his movements when he attempted to stop or to change direction nothing happened he was going along for the ride it did not matter he was enjoying the novel experience and could appreciate how addictive it could become the dream machines that many scientists of his own century had anticipated often with alarm were now part of everyday life poole wondered how mankind had managed to survive he had been told that much of it had not millions had been brainburned and had dropped out of life of course he would be immune to such temptations he would use this marvelous tool to learn more about the world of the fourth millennium and to acquire in minutes new skills that would otherwise take years to master well he might just occasionally use the braincap purely for fun he had come to the edge of the forest and was looking out across a wide river without hesitation he walked into it and felt no alarm as the water rose over his head it did seem a little strange that he could continue breathing naturally but he thought it much more remarkable that he could see perfectly in a medium where the unaided human eye could not focus he could count every scale on the magnificent trout that went swimming past apparently oblivious to this strange intruder then a mermaid well he had always wanted to meet one but he had assumed that they were marine creatures perhaps they occasionally came upstream like salmon to have their babies she was gone before he could question her to confirm or deny this revolutionary theory the river ended in a translucent wall he stepped through it on to the face of a desert beneath a blazing sun its heat burned him uncomfortably yet he was able to look directly into its noonday fury he could even see with unnatural clarity an archipelago of sunspots near one limb and this was surely impossible there was the tenuous glory of the corona quite invisible except during total eclipse reaching out like a swans wings on either side of the sun everything faded to black the haunting music returned and with it the blissful coolness of his familiar room he opened his eyes and found an expectant audience waiting for his reaction wonderful he breathed almost reverently some of it seemed well realer than real then his engineers curiosity never far from the surface started nagging him even that short demo must have contained an enormous amount of information hows it stored in these tablets the same your audiovisual system uses but with much greater capacity the brainman handed poole a small square apparently made of glass silvered on one surface it was almost the same size as the computer diskettes of his youth but twice the thickness as poole tilted it back and forth trying to see into its transparent interior there were occasional rainbowhued flashes but that was all he was holding he realized the end product of more than a thousand years of electrooptical technology as well as other technologies unborn in his era and it was not surprising that superficially it resembled closely the devices he had known there was a convenient shape and size for most of the common objects of everyday life knives and forks books handtools furnitureand removable memories for computers whats its capacity he asked in my time we were up to a terabyte in something this size im sure youve done a lot better not as much as you might imagine theres a limit of course set by the structure of matter by the way what was a terabyte afraid ive forgotten shame on you kilo mega giga terathats ten to the twelfth bytes then the petabyte ten to the fifteenth thats as far as i ever got thats about where we start its enough to record everything any person can experience during one lifetime it was an astonishing thought yet it should not have been so surprising the kilogram of jelly inside the human skull was not much larger than the tablet poole was holding in his hand and it could not possibly be as efficient a storage device it had so many other duties to deal with and thats not all the brainman continued with some data compression it could store not only the memories but the actual person and reproduce them again of course straightforward job of nanoassembly so id heard poole told himself but i never really believed it back in his century it seemed wonderful enough that the entire lifework of a great artist could be stored on a single small disk and now something no larger could hold the artist as well debriefing im delighted said poole to know that the smithsonian still exists after all these centuries you probably wouldnt recognize it said the visitor who had introduced himself as dr alistair kim director of astronautics especially as its now scattered over the solar system the main offearth collections are on mars and the moon and many of the exhibits that legally belong to us are still heading for the stars some day well catch up with them and bring them home were particularly anxious to get our hands on pioneer the first manmade object to escape from the solar system i believe i was on the verge of doing that when they located me lucky for you and for us you may be able to throw light on many things we dont know frankly i doubt it but ill do my best i dont remember a thing after that runaway spacepod charged me though i still find it hard to believe ive been told that hal was responsible thats true but its a complicated story everything weve been able to learn is in this recording about twenty hours but you can probably fast most of it you know of course that dave bowman went out in the number pod to rescue you but was then locked outside the ship because hal refused to open the podbay doors why for gods sake dr kim winced slightly it was not the first time poole had noticed such a reaction there was a major programming error in hals instructions hed been given control of aspects of the mission you and bowman didnt know about its all in the recording anyway he also cut off the lifesupport systems to the three hybernauts the alpha crew and bowman had to jettison their bodies as well what happened to them poole asked couldnt they have been rescued just as i was im afraid not weve looked into it of course bowman ejected them several hours after hed taken back control from hal so their orbits were slightly different from yours just enough for them to burn up in jupiter while you skimmed by and got a gravity boost that would have taken you to the orion nebula in a few thousand more years doing everything on manual override really a fantastic performance bowman managed to get discovery into orbit round jupiter and there he encountered what the second expedition called big brother an apparent twin of the tycho monolith but hundreds of times larger and thats where we lost him he left discovery in the remaining spacepod and made a rendezvous with big brother for almost a thousand years weve been haunted by his last message by deus its full of stars apparently the pod was drawn into the monolith by some kind of inertial field because it and presumably bowman survived an acceleration which should have crushed them instantly and that was the last information anyone had for almost ten years until the joint usrussian leonov mission which made a rendezvous with the abandoned discovery so that dr chandra could go aboard and reactivate hal yes i know that dr kim looked slightly embarrassed sorry i wasnt sure how much youd been told already anyway thats when even stranger things started to happen apparently the arrival of leonov triggered something inside big brother if we did not have these recordings no one would have believed what happened let me show youheres dr heywood floyd keeping the midnight watch aboard discovery after power had been restored of course youll recognize everything a message was coming up on one of the monitors and floyd answered lazily ok hal who is calling no identification floyd looked slightly annoyed very well please give me the message it is dangerous to remain here you must leave within fifteen days that is absolutely impossible our launch window does not open until twentysix days from now we do not have sufficient propellant for an earlier departure i am aware of these facts nevertheless you must leave within fifteen days i cannot take this warning seriously unless i know its originwho is speaking to me i was david bowman it is important that you believe me look behind you heywood floyd slowly turned in his swivel chair away from the banked panels and switches of the computer display towards the velcrocovered catwalk behind watch this carefully said dr kim as if i needed telling thought poole the zerogravity environment of discoverys observation deck was much dustier than he remembered it he guessed that the airfiltration plant had not yet been brought on line the parallel rays of the distant yet still brilliant sun streaming through the great windows lit up a myriad of dancing motes in a classic display of brownian movement and now something strange was happening to these particles of dust some force seemed to be marshalling them herding them away from a central point yet bringing others towards it until they all met on the surface of a hollow sphere that sphere about a meter across hovered in the air for a moment like a giant soap bubble then it elongated into an ellipsoid whose surface began to pucker to form folds and indentations poole was not really surprised when it started to assume the shape of a man he had seen such figures blown out of glass in museums and science exhibitions but this dusty phantom did not even approximate anatomical accuracy it was like a crude clay figurine or one of the primitive works of art found in the recesses of stone age caves only the head was fashioned with care and the face beyond all shadow of doubt was that of commander david bowman hello dr floyd now do you believe me the lips of the figure never moved poole realized that the voice yes certainly bowmans voice was actually coming from the speaker grille this is very difficult for me and i have little time i have been allowed to give this warning you have only fiffeen days why and what are you but the ghostly figure was already fading its grainy envelope beginning to dissolve back into the constituent particles of dust goodbye doctor floyd we can have no further contact but there may be one more message if all goes well as the image dissolved poole could not help smiling at that old space age cliche if all goes well how many times he had heard that phrase intoned before a mission the phantom vanished only the motes of dancing dust were left resuming their random patterns in the air with an effort of will poole came back to the present well commander what do you think of that asked kim poole was still shaken and it was several seconds before he could reply the face and the voice were bowmans id swear to that but what was it thats what were still arguing about call it a hologram a projection of course there are plenty of ways it could be faked if anyone wanted to but not in those circumstances and then of course theres what happened next lucifer yes thanks to that warning the leonov had just sufficient time to get away before jupiter detonated so whatever it was the bowmanthing was friendly and trying to help presumably and it may have been responsible for that one more message we did receive it was sent only minutes before the detonation another warning dr kim brought the screen to life once more it showed plain text all these worlds are yours except europa attempt no landings there the same message was repeated about a hundred times then the letters became garbled and we never have tried to land there asked poole only once by accident thirtysix years later when the usss galaxy was hijacked and forced down there and her sister ship universe had to go to the rescue its all here with what little our robot monitors have told us about the europans im anxious to see them theyre amphibious and come in all shapes and sizes as soon as lucifer started melting the ice that covered their whole world they began to emerge from the sea since then theyve developed at a speed that seems biologically impossible from what i remember about europa werent there lots of cracks in the ice perhaps theyd already started crawling through and having a look round thats a widely accepted theory but theres another much more speculative one the monolith may have been involved in ways we dont yet understand what triggered that line of thought was the discovery of tma zero right here on earth almost five hundred years after your time i suppose youve been told about that only vaguely theres been so much to catch up with i did think the name was ridiculous since it wasnt a magnetic anomaly and it was in africa not tycho youre quite right of course but were stuck with the name and the more we learn about the monoliths the more the puzzle deepens especially as theyre still the only real evidence for advanced technology beyond the earth thats surprised me i should have thought that by this time wed have picked up radio signals from somewhere the astronomers started searching when i was a boy well there is one hint and its so terrifying that we dont like to talk about it have you heard of nova scorpio i dont believe so stars go nova all the time of course and this wasnt a particularly impressive one but before it blew up n scorp was known to have several planets inhabited absolutely no way of telling radio searches had picked up nothing and heres the nightmare luckily the automatic nova patrol caught the event at the very beginning and it didnt start at the star one of the planets detonated first and then triggered its sun my gahsorry go on you see the point its impossible for a planet to go nova except in one way i once read a sick joke in a sciencefiction novel supernovae are industrial accidents it wasnt a supernova but that may be no joke the most widely accepted theory is that someone else had been tapping vacuum energy and had lost control or it could have been a war just as bad well probably never know but as our own civilization depends on the same energy source you can understand why n scorp sometimes gives us nightmares and we only had melting nuclear reactors to worry about not any longer thank deus but i really wanted to tell you more about tma zeros discovery because it marked a turning point in human history finding tma one on the moon was a big enough shock but five hundred years later there was a worse one and it was much nearer home in every sense of the word down there in africa return to olduvai the leakeys dr stephen del marco often told himself would never have recognized this place even though its barely a dozen kilometers from where louis and mary five centuries ago dug up the bones of our first ancestors global warming and the little ice age had transformed the landscape and completely altered its biota oaks and pine trees were still fighting it out to see which would survive the changes in climatic fortune and it was hard to believe that by this year there was anything left in olduvai undug by enthusiastic anthropologists however recent flashfloods which were not supposed to happen any more had resculpted this area and cut away several meters of topsoil del marco had taken advantage of the opportunity and there at the limit of the deepscan was something he could not quite believe it had taken more than a year of slow and careful excavation to reach that ghostly image and to learn that the reality was stranger than anything he had dared to imagine robot digging machines had swiftly removed the first few meters then the traditional slavecrews of graduate students had taken over they had been helped or hindered by a team of four kongs who del marco considered more trouble than they were worth however the students adored the geneticallyenhanced gorillas whom they treated like retarded but muchloved children it was rumored that the relationships were not always completely platonic for the last few meters however everything was the work of human hands usually wielding toothbrushes softbristled at that and now it was finished howard carter seeing the first glint of gold in tutankhamens tomb had never uncovered such a treasure as this from this moment onwards del marco knew human beliefs and philosophies would be irrevocably changed the monolith appeared to be the exact twin of that discovered on the moon five centuries earlier even the excavation surrounding it was almost identical in size and like tma one it was totally nonreflective absorbing with equal indifference the fierce glare of the african sun and the pale gleam of lucifer as he led his colleagues the directors of the worlds halfdozen most famous museums three eminent anthropologists the heads of two media empires down into the pit del marco wondered if such a distinguished group of men and women had ever been so silent for so long but that was the effect that this ebon rectangle had on all visitors as they realized the implications of the thousands of artifacts that surrounded it for here was an archaeologists treasuretrove crudelyfashioned flint tools countless bones some animal some human and almost all arranged in careful patterns for centuries no millennia these pitiful gifts had been brought here by creatures with only the first glimmer of intelligence as tribute to a marvel beyond their understanding and beyond ours del marco had often thought yet of two things he was certain though he doubted if proof would ever be possible this was where in time and space the human species had really begun and this monolith was the very first of all its multitudinous gods skyland there were mice in my bedroom last night poole complained only half seriously is there any chance you could find me a cat dr wallace looked puzzled then started to laugh you must have heard one of the cleaning microts ill get the programming checked so they dont disturb you try not to step on one if you catch it at work if you do it will call for help and all its friends will come to pick up the pieces so much to learn so little time no that wasnt true poole reminded himself he might well have a century ahead of him thanks to the medical science of this age the thought was already beginning to fill him with apprehension rather than pleasure at least he was now able to follow most conversations easily and had learned to pronounce words so that indra was not the only person who could understand him he was very glad that anglish was now the world language though french russian and mandarin still flourished ive another problem indra and i guess youre the only person who can help when i say god why do people look embarrassed indra did not look at all embarrassed in fact she laughed thats a very complicated story i wish my old friend dr khan was here to explain it to you but hes on ganymede curing any remaining true believers he can find there when all the old religions were discredited let me tell you about pope pius xx sometime one of the greatest men in history we still needed a word for the prime cause or the creator of the universe if there is one there were lots of suggestions deo theo jove brahma they were all tried and some of them are still around especially einsteins favorite the old one but deus seems to be the fashion nowadays ill try to remember but it still seems silly to me youll get used to it ill teach you some other reasonably polite expletives to use when you want to express your feelings you said that all the old religions have been discredited so what do people believe nowadays as little as possible were all either deists or theists youve lost me definitions please they were slightly different in your time but here are the latest versions theists believe theres not more than one god deists that there is not less than one god im afraid the distinctions too subtle for me not for everyone youd be amazed at the bitter controversies its aroused five centuries ago someone used whats known as surreal mathematics to prove theres an infinite number of grades between theists and deists of course like most dabblers with infinity he went insane by the way the bestknown deists were americans washington franklin jefferson a little before my time though youd be surprised how many people dont realize it now ive some good news joe prof anderson has finally given his what was the phrase ok youre fit enough to go for a little trip upstairsto the lunar level wonderful how far is that oh about twelve thousand kilometers twelve thousand that will take hours indra looked surprised at his remark then she smiled not as long as you think no we dont have a star trek transporter yet though i believe theyre still working on it but youll need new clothes and someone to show you how to wear them and to help you with the hundreds of little everyday jobs that can waste so much time so weve taken the liberty of arranging a human personal assistant for you come in danil danil was a small lightbrown man in his midthirties who surprised poole by not giving him the usual palmtop salute with its automatic exchange of information indeed it soon appeared that danil did not possess an ident whenever it was needed he produced a small rectangle of plastic that apparently served the same purpose as the twentyfirst centurys smart cards danil will also be your guide and what was that word i can never remember rhymes with ballet hes been specially trained for the job im sure youll find him completely satisfactory though poole appreciated this gesture it made him feel a little uncomfortable a valet indeed he could not recall ever meeting one in his time they were already a rare and endangered species he began to feel like a character from an earlytwentiethcentury english novel you have a choice said indra though i know which one youll take we can go up on an external elevator and admire the view or an interior one and enjoy a meal and some light entertainment i cant imagine anyone wanting to stay inside youd be surprised its too vertiginous for some people especially visitors from down below even mountain climbers who say theyve got a head for heights may start to turn green when the heights are measured in thousands of kilometers instead of meters ill risk it poole answered with a smile ive been higher when they had passed through a double set of airlocks in the exterior wall of the tower they entered what might have been the auditorium of a very small theatre rows of ten seats were banked up in five tiers they all faced towards one of the huge picture windows which poole still found disconcerting as he could never quite forget the hundreds of tons of air pressure striving to blast it out into space the dozen or so other passengers who had probably never given the matter any thought seemed perfectly at ease they all smiled as they recognized him nodded politely then turned away to admire the view welcome to skylounge said the inevitable autovoice ascent begins in five minutes you will find refreshments and toilets on the lower floor just how long will this trip last poole wondered were going to travel over twenty thousand klicks there and back this will be like no elevator ride ive ever known on earth while he was waiting for the ascent to begin he enjoyed the stunning panorama laid out two thousand kilometers below it was winter in the northern hemisphere but the climate had indeed changed drastically for there was little snow south of the arctic circle europe was almost cloudfree and there was so much detail that the eye was overwhelmed one by one he identified the great cities whose names had echoed down the centuries they had been shrinking even in his time as the communications revolution changed the face of the world and had now dwindled still further there were also some bodies of water in improbable places the northern saharas lake saladin was almost a small sea poole was so engrossed by the view that he had forgotten the passage of time suddenly he realized that much more than five minutes had passed yet the elevator was still stationary had something gone wrong or were they waiting for late arrivals and then he noticed something so extraordinary that at first he refused to believe the evidence of his eyes the panorama had expanded as if he had already risen hundreds of kilometers even as he watched he noticed new features of the planet below creeping into the frame of the window then poole laughed as the obvious explanation occurred to him you could have fooled me indra i thought this was real not a video projection indra looked back at him with a quizzical smile think again frank we started to move about ten minutes ago by now we must be climbing at oh at least a thousand kilometers an hour though im told these elevators can reach a hundred gee at maximum acceleration we wont touch more than ten on this short run thats impossible six is the maximum they ever gave me in the centrifuge and i didnt enjoy weighing half a ton i know we havent moved since we stepped inside poole had raised his voice slightly and suddenly became aware that the other passengers were pretending not to notice i dont understand how its done frank but its called an inertial field or sometimes a sharp one the s stands for a famous russian scientist sakharov i dont know who the others were slowly understanding dawned in pooles mind and also a sense of awestruck wonder here indeed was a technology indistinguishable from magic some of my friends used to dream of space drives energy fields that could replace rockets and allow movement without any feeling of acceleration most of us thought they were crazy but it seems they were right i can still hardly believe itand unless im mistaken were starting to lose weight yes its adjusting to the lunar value when we step out youll feel were on the moon but for goodness sake frank forget youre an engineer and simply enjoy the view it was good advice but even as he watched the whole of africa europe and much of asia flow into his field of vision poole could not tear his mind away from this astonishing revelation yet he should not have been wholly surprised he knew that there had been major breakthroughs in space propulsion systems since his time but had not realized that they would have such dramatic applications to everyday life if that term could be applied to existence in a thirtysixthousandkilometerhigh skyscraper and the age of the rocket must have been over centuries ago all his knowledge of propellant systems and combustion chambers ion thrusters and fusion reactors was totally obsolete of course that no longer mattered but he understood the sadness that the skipper of a windjammer must have felt when sail gave way to steam his mood changed abruptly and he could not help smiling when the robovoice announced arriving in two minutes please make sure that you do not leave any of your personal belongings behind how often he had heard that announcement on some commercial flight he looked at his watch and was surprised to see that they had been ascending for less than half an hour so that meant an average speed of at least twenty thousand kilometers an hour yet they might never have moved what was even stranger for the last ten minutes or more they must actually have been decelerating so rapidly that by rights they should all have been standing on the roof heads pointing towards earth the doors opened silently and as poole stepped out he again felt the slight disorientation he had noticed on entering the elevator lounge this time however he knew what it meant he was moving through the transition zone where the inertial field overlapped with gravity at this level equal to the moons indra and danil followed him walking carefully now at a third of their customary weight as they went forward to meet the next of the days wonders though the view of the receding earth had been awesome even for an astronaut there was nothing unexpected or surprising about it but who would have imagined a gigantic chamber apparently occupying the entire width of the tower so that the far wall was more than five kilometers away perhaps by this time there were larger enclosed volumes on the moon and mars but this must surely be one of the largest in space itself they were standing on a viewing platform fifty meters up on the outer wall looking across an astonishingly varied panorama obviously an attempt had been made to reproduce a whole range of terrestrial biomes immediately beneath them was a group of slender trees which poole could not at first identify then he realized that they were oaks adapted to onesixth of their normal gravity what he wondered would palm frees look like here giant reeds probably in the middledistance there was a small lake fed by a river that meandered across a grassy plain then disappeared into something that looked like a single gigantic banyan tree what was the source of the water poole had become aware of a faint drumming sound and as he swept his gaze along the gently curving wall he discovered a miniature niagara with a perfect rainbow hovering in the spray above it he could have stood here for hours admiring the view and still not exhausting all the wonders of this complex and brilliantly contrived simulation of the planet below as it spread out into new and hostile environments perhaps the human race felt an everincreasing need to remember its origins of course even in his own time every city had its parks as usually feeble reminders of nature the same impulse must be acting here on a much grander scale central park africa tower lets go down said indra theres so much to see and i dont come here as often as id like followed by the silent but everpresent danil who always seemed to know when he was needed but otherwise kept out of the way they began a leisurely exploration of this oasis in space though walking was almost effortless in this low gravity from time to time they took advantage of a small monorail and stopped once for refreshments at a cafe cunningly concealed in the trunk of a redwood that must have been at least a quarter of a kilometer tall there were very few other people about their fellow passengers had long since disappeared into the landscape so it was as if they had all this wonderland to themselves everything was so beautifully maintained presumably by armies of robots that from time to time poole was reminded of a visit he had made to disney world as a small boy but this was even better there were no crowds and indeed very little reminder of the human race and its artifacts they were admiring a superb collection of orchids some of enormous size when poole had one of the biggest shocks of his life as they walked past a typical small gardeners shed the door opened and the gardener emerged frank poole had always prided himself on his selfcontrol and never imagined that as a fullgrown adult he would give a cry of pure fright but like every boy of his generation he had seen all the jurassic movies and he knew a raptor when he met one eye to eye im terribly sorry said indra with obvious concern i never thought of warning you pooles jangling nerves returned to normal of course there could be no danger in this perhaps toowellordered world but still the dinosaur returned his stare with apparent total disinterest then doubled back into the shed and emerged again with a rake and a pair of garden shears which it dropped into a bag hanging over one shoulder it walked away from them with a birdlike gait never looking back as it disappeared behind some tenmeterhigh sunflowers i should explain said indra contritely we like to use bioorganisms when we can rather than robots i suppose its carbon chauvinism now there are only a few animals that have any manual dexterity and weve used them all at one time or another and heres a mystery that no ones been able to solve youd think that enhanced herbivores like orangutans and gorillas would be good at this sort of work well theyre not they dont have the patience for it yet carnivores like our friend here are excellent and easily trained whats more heres another paradox after theyve been modified theyre docile and goodnatured of course theres almost a thousand years of genetic engineering behind them and look what primitive man did to the wolf merely by trial and error indra laughed and continued you may not believe this frank but they also make good babysitters children love them theres a fivehundredyearold joke would you trust your kids to a dinosaur what and risk injuring it poole joined in the laughter partly in shamefaced reaction to his own fright to change the subject he asked indra the question that was still worrying him all this he said its wonderful but why go to so much trouble when anyone in the tower can reach the real thing just as quickly indra looked at him thoughtfully weighing her words thats not quite true its uncomfortable even dangerous for anyone who lives above the halfgee level to go down to earth even in a hoverchair so it has to be this or as you used to say virtual reality homage to icarus his depression quickly passed there was so much to do and see a thousand lifetimes would not have been enough and the problem was to choose which of the myriad distractions this age could offer he tried not always successfully to avoid the trivia and to concentrate on the things that mattered notably his education the braincap and the booksized player that went with it inevitably called the brainbox was of enormous value here he soon had a small library of instant knowledge tablets each containing all the material needed for a college degree when he slipped one of these into the brainbox and gave it the speed and intensity adjustments that most suited him there would be a flash of light followed by a period of unconsciousness that might last as long as an hour when he awoke it seemed that new areas of his mind had been opened up though he only knew they were there when he searched for them it was almost as if he was the owner of a library who had suddenly discovered shelves of books he did not know he possessed to a large extent he was the master of his own time out of a sense of duty and gratitude he acceded to as many requests as he could from scientists historians writers and artists working in media that were often incomprehensible to him he also had countless invitations from other citizens of the four towers virtually all of which he was compelled to turn down most tempting and most hard to resist were those that came from the beautiful planet spread out below of course professor anderson had told him youd survive if you went down for short time with the right lifesupport system but you wouldnt enjoy it and it might weaken your neuromuscular system even further its never really recovered from that thousandyear sleep his other guardian indra wallace protected him from unnecessary intrusions and advised him which requests he should accept and which he should politely refuse by himself he would never understand the sociopolitical structure of this incredibly complex culture but he soon gathered that although in theory all class distinctions had vanished there were a few thousand supercitizens george orwell had been right some would always be more equal than others there had been times when conditioned by his twentyfirstcentury experience poole had wondered who was paying for all this hospitality would he one day be presented with the equivalent of an enormous hotel bill but indra had quickly reassured him he was a unique and priceless museum exhibit so would never have to worry about such mundane considerations anything he wanted within reason would be made available to him poole wondered what the limits were never imagining that one day he would attempt to discover them all the most important things in life happen by accident and he had set his wall display browser on random scan silent when a striking image caught his attention stop scan sound up he shouted with quite unnecessary loudness he recognized the music but it was a few minutes before he identified it the fact that his wall was filled with winged humans circling gracefully round each other undoubtedly helped but tchaikovsky would have been utterly astonished to see this performance of swan lake with the dancers actually flying poole watched entranced for several minutes until he was fairly confident that this was reality and not a simulation even in his own day one could never be quite certain presumably the ballet was being performed in one of the many lowgravity environments a very large one judging by some of the images it might even be here in africa tower i want to try that poole decided he had never quite forgiven the space agency for banning one of his greatest pleasures delayed parachute formation jumping even though he could see the agencys point in not wanting to risk a valuable investment the doctors had been quite unhappy about his earlier hanggliding accident fortunately his teenage bones had healed completely well he thought theres no one to stop me now unless its prof anderson to pooles relief the physician thought it an excellent idea and he was also pleased to find that every one of the towers had its own aviary up at the onetenthgee level within a few days he was being measured for his wings not in the least like the elegant versions worn by the performers of swan lake instead of feathers there was a flexible membrane and when he grasped the handholds attached to the supporting ribs poole realized that he must look much more like a bat than a bird however his move over dracula was completely wasted on his instructor who was apparently unacquainted with vampires for his first lessons he was restrained by a light harness so that he did not move anywhere while he was taught the basic strokes and most important of all learned control and stability like many acquired skills it was not quite as easy as it looked he felt ridiculous in this safetyharness how could anyone injure themselves at a tenth of a gravity and was glad that he needed only a few lessons doubtless his astronaut training helped he was the wingmaster told him the best pupil he had ever taught but perhaps he said that to all of them after a dozen freeflights in a chamber forty meters on a side crisscrossed with various obstacles which he easily avoided poole was given the allclear for his first solo and felt nineteen years old again about to take off in the flagstaff aero clubs antique cessna the unexciting name the aviary had not prepared him for the venue of this maiden flight though it seemed even more enormous than the space holding the forests and gardens down at the lunargee level it was almost the same size since it too occupied an entire floor of the gently tapering tower a circular void half a kilometer high and over four kilometers wide it appeared truly enormous as there were no features on which the eye could rest because the walls were a uniform pale blue they contributed to the impression of infinite space poole had not really believed the wingmasters boast you can have any scenery you like and intended to throw him what he was sure was an impossible challenge but on this first flight at the dizzy altitude of fifty meters there were no visual distractions of course a fall from the equivalent altitude of five meters in the tenfold greater earth gravity could break ones neck however even minor bruises were unlikely here as the entire floor was covered with a network of flexible cables the whole chamber was a giant trampoline one could thought poole have a lot of fun here even without wings with firm downward strokes poole lifted himself into the air in almost no time it seemed that he was a hundred meters in the air and still rising slow down said the wingmaster i cant keep up with you poole straightened out then attempted a slow roll he felt lightheaded as well as lightbodied and wondered if the concentration of oxygen had been increased this was wonderful quite different from zero gravity as it posed more of a physical challenge the nearest thing to it was scuba diving he wished there were birds here to emulate the equally colorful coral fish who had so often accompanied him over tropical reefs one by one the wingmaster put him through a series of maneuvers rolls loops upsidedown flying hovering finally he said nothing more i can teach you now lets enjoy the view just for a moment poole almost lost control as he was probably expected to do for without the slightest warning he was surrounded by snowcapped mountains and was flying down a narrow pass only meters from some unpleasantly jagged rocks of course this could not be real those mountains were as insubstantial as clouds and he could fly right through them if he wished nevertheless he veered away from the cliffface and headed for more open space the mountains vanished suddenly it was night and then the stars came out not the miserable few thousand in the impoverished skies of earth but legions beyond counting and not only stars but the spiral whirlpools of distant galaxies the teeming closepacked sunswarms of globular clusters there was no possible way this could be real even if he had been magically transported to some world where such skies existed for those galaxies were receding even as he watched stars were fading exploding being born in stellar nurseries of glowing firemist every second a million years must be passing the overwhelming spectacle disappeared as quickly as it had come he was back in the empty sky alone except for his instructor in the featureless blue cylinder of the aviary i think thats enough for one day said the wingmaster hovering a few meters above poole what scenery would you like the next time you come here poole did not hesitate with a smile he answered the question here be dragons he would never have believed it possible even with the technology of this day and age how many terabytes petabytes was there a large enough word of information must have been accumulated over the centuries and in what sort of storage medium better not think about it and follow indras advice forget youre an engineer and enjoy yourself he was certainly enjoying himself now though his pleasure was mixed with an almost overwhelming sense of nostalgia for he was flying or so it seemed at an altitude of about two kilometers above the spectacular and unforgotten landscape of his youth of course the perspective was false since the aviary was only half a kilometer high but the illusion was perfect he circled meteor crater remembering how he had scrambled up its sides during his earlier astronaut training how incredible that anyone could ever have doubted its origin and the accuracy of its name yet well into the twentieth century distinguished geologists had argued that it was volcanic not until the coming of the space age was it reluctantly accepted that all planets were still under continual bombardment poole was quite sure that his comfortable cruising speed was nearer twenty than two hundred kilometers an hour yet he had been allowed to reach flagstaff in less than fifteen minutes and there were the whitelygleaming domes of the lowell observatory which he had visited so often as a boy and whose friendly staff had undoubtedly been responsible for his choice of career he had sometimes wondered what his profession might have been had he not been born in arizona near the very spot where the most longenduring and influential of martian fantasies had been created perhaps it was imagination but poole thought he could just see lowells unique tomb close to the great telescope which had fuelled his dreams from what year and what season had this image been captured he guessed it had come from the spy satellites which had watched over the world of the early twentyfirst century it could not be much later than his own time for the layout of the city was just as he remembered perhaps if he went low enough he would even see himself but he knew that was absurd he had already discovered that this was the nearest he could get if he flew any closer the image would start to breakup revealing its basic pixels it was better to keep his distance and not destroy the beautiful illusion and there it was incredible was the little park where he had played with his junior and highschool friends the city fathers were always arguing about its maintenance as the water supply became more and more critical well at least it had survived to this time whenever that might be and then another memory brought tears to his eyes along those narrow paths whenever he could get home from houston or the moon he had walked with his beloved rhodesian ridgeback throwing sticks for him to retrieve as man and dog had done from time immemorial poole had hoped with all his heart that rikki would still be there to greet him when he returned from jupiter and had left him in the care of his younger brother martin he almost lost control and sank several meters before regaining stability as he once more faced the bitter truth that both rikki and martin had been dust for centuries when he could see properly again he noticed that the dark band of the grand canyon was just visible on the far horizon he was debating whether to head for it he was growing a little tired when he became aware that he was not alone in the sky something else was approaching and it was certainly not a human flyer although it was difficult to judge distances here it seemed much too large for that well he thought im not particularly surprised to meet a pterodactyl here indeed its just the sort of thing id expect i hope its friendly or that i can outfly it if it isnt oh no a pterodactyl was not a bad guess maybe eight points out of ten what was approaching him now with slow flaps of its great leathery wings was a dragon straight out of fairyland and to complete the picture there was a beautiful lady riding on its back at least poole assumed she was beautiful the traditional image was rather spoiled by one trifling detail much of her face was concealed by a large pair of aviators goggles that might have come straight from the open cockpit of a world war i biplane poole hovered in midair like a swimmer treading water until the oncoming monster came close enough for him to hear the flapping of its great wings even when it was less than twenty meters away he could not decide whether it was a machine or a bioconstruct probably both and then he forgot about the dragon for the rider removed her goggles the trouble with cliches some philosopher remarked probably with a yawn is that they are so boringly true but love at first sight is never boring danil could provide no information but then poole had not expected any from him his ubiquitous escort he certainly would not pass muster as a classic valet seemed so limited in his functions that poole sometimes wondered if he was mentally handicapped unlikely though that seemed he understood the functioning of all the household appliances carried out simple orders with speed and efficiency and knew his way about the tower but that was all it was impossible to have an intelligent conversation with him and any polite queries about his family were met with a look of blank incomprehension poole had even wondered if he too was a biorobot indra however gave him the answer he needed right away oh youve met the dragon lady is that what you call her whats her real name and can you get me her ident we were hardly in a position to touch palms of course no problemo where did you pick up that indra looked uncharacteristically confused ive no idea some old book or movie is it a good figure of speech not if youre over fifteen ill try to remember now tell me what happened unless you want to make me jealous they were now such good friends that they could discuss any subject with perfect frankness indeed they had laughingly lamented their total lack of romantic interest in each other though indra had once commented i guess that if we were both marooned on a desert asteroid with no hope of rescue we could come to some arrangement first you tell me who she is her names aurora mcauley among many other things shes president of the society for creative anachronisms and if you thought draco was impressive wait until you see some of their other ah creations like moby dick and a whole zooful of dinosaurs mother nature never thought of this is too good to be true thought poole i am the biggest anachronism on planet earth frustration until now he had almost forgotten that conversation with the space agency psychologist you may be gone from earth for at least three years if you like i can give you a harmless anaphrodisiac implant that will last out the mission i promise well more than make it up when you get home no thanks poole had answered trying to keep his face straight when he continued i think i can handle it nevertheless he had become suspicious after the third or fourth week and so had dave bowman ive noticed it too dave said i bet those damn doctors put something in our diet whatever that something was if indeed it had ever existed it was certainly long past its shelflife until now poole had been too busy to get involved in any emotional entanglements and had politely turned down generous offers from several young ladies he was not sure whether it was his physique or his fame that appealed to them perhaps it was nothing more than simple curiosity about a man who for all they knew might be an ancestor from twenty or thirty generations in the past to pooles delight mistress mcauleys ident conveyed the information that she was currently between lovers and he wasted no further time in contacting her within twentyfour hours he was pillionriding with his arms enjoyably around her waist he had also learned why aviators goggles were a good idea for draco was entirely robotic and could easily cruise at a hundred klicks poole doubted if any real dragons had ever attained such speeds he was not surprised that the everchanging landscapes below them were straight out of legend ali baba had waved angrily at them as they overtook his flying carpet shouting cant you see where youre going yet he must be a long way from baghdad because the dreaming spires over which they now circled could only be oxford aurora confirmed his guess as she pointed down thats the pub the inn where lewis and tolkien used to meet their friends the inklings and look at the river that boat just coming out from the bridge do you see the two little girls and the clergyman in it yes he shouted back against the gentle susurration of dracos slipstream and i suppose one of them is alice aurora turned and smiled at him over her shoulder she seemed genuinely delighted quite correct shes an accurate replica based on the reverends photos i was afraid you wouldnt know so many people stopped reading soon after your time poole felt a glow of satisfaction i believe ive passed another test he told himself smugly riding on draco must have been the first how many more i wonder fighting with broadswords but there were no more and the answer to the immemorial your place or mine was pooles the next morning shaken and mortified he contacted professor anderson everything was going splendidly he lamented when she suddenly became hysterical and pushed me away i was afraid id hurt her somehow then she called the roomlight wed been in darkness and jumped out of bed i guess i was just staring like a fool he laughed ruefully she was certainly worth staring at im sure of it go on after a few minutes she relaxed and said something ill never be able to forget anderson waited patiently for poole to compose himself she said im really sorry frank we could have had a good time but i didnt know that youd been mutilated the professor looked baffled but only for a moment oh i understand im sorry too frank perhaps i should have warned you in my thirty years of practice ive only seen half a dozen cases all for valid medical reasons which certainly didnt apply to you circumcision made a lot of sense in primitive times and even in your century as a defense against some unpleasant even fatal diseases in backward countries with poor hygiene but otherwise there was absolutely no excuse for it and several arguments against as youve just discovered i checked the records after id examined you the first time and found that by midtwentyfirst century there had been so many malpractice suits that the american medical association had been forced to ban it the arguments among the contemporary doctors are very entertaining im sure they are said poole morosely in some countries it continued for another century then some unknown genius coined a slogan please excuse the vulgarity god designed us circumcision is blasphemy that more or less ended the practice but if you want it would be easy to arrange a transplant you wouldnt be making medical history by any means i dont think it would work afraid id start laughing every time thats the spirit youre already getting over it somewhat to his surprise poole realized that andersons prognosis was correct he even found himself already laughing now what frank auroras society for creative anachronisms id hoped it would improve my chances just my luck to have found one anachronism she doesnt appreciate stranger in a strange time indra was not quite as sympathetic as he had hoped perhaps after all there was some sexual jealousy in their relationship and much more serious what they wryly labeled the dragon debacle led to their first real argument it began innocently enough when indra complained people are always asking me why ive devoted my life to such a horrible period of history and its not much of an answer to say that there were even worse ones then why are you interested in my century because it marks the transition between barbarism and civilization thank you just call me conan conan the only one i know is the man who invented sherlock holmes never mind sorry i interrupted of course we in the socalled developed countries thought we were civilized at least war wasnt respectable any more and the united nations was always doing its best to stop the wars that did break out not very successfully id give it about three out of ten but what we find incredible is the way that people right up to the early s calmly accepted behavior we would consider atrocious and believed in the most mindboggled boggling nonsense which surely any rational person would dismiss out of hand examples please well your really trivial loss started me doing some research and i was appalled by what i found did you know that every year in some countries thousands of little girls were hideously mutilated to preserve their virginity many of them died but the authorities turned a blind eye i agree that was terrible but what could my government do about it a great deal if it wished but that would have offended the people who supplied it with oil and bought its weapons like the landmines that killed and maimed civilians by the thousand you dont understand indra often we had no choice we couldnt reform the whole world and didnt somebody once say politics is the art of the possible quite true which is why only secondrate minds go into it genius likes to challenge the impossible well im glad you have a good supply of genius so you can put things right do i detect a hint of sarcasm thanks to our computers we can run political experiments in cyberspace before trying them out in practice lenin was unlucky he was born a hundred years too soon russian communism might have worked at least for a while if it had had microchips and had managed to avoid stalin poole was constantly amazed by indras knowledge of his age as well as by her ignorance of so much that he took for granted in a way he had the reverse problem even if he lived the hundred years that had been confidently promised him he could never learn enough to feel at home in any conversation there would always be references he did not understand and jokes that would go over his head worse still he would always feel on the verge of some faux pas about to create some social disaster that would embarrass even the best of his new friends such as the occasion when he was lunching fortunately in his own quarters with indra and professor anderson the meals that emerged from the autochef were always perfectly acceptable having been designed to match his physiological requirements but they were certainly nothing to get excited about and would have been the despair of a twentyfirstcentury gourmet then one day an unusually tasty dish appeared which brought back vivid memories of the deerhunts and barbecues of his youth however there was something unfamiliar about both flavor and texture so poole asked the obvious question anderson merely smiled but for a few seconds indra looked as if she was about to be sick then she recovered and said you tell him after weve finished eating now what have i done wrong poole asked himself half an hour later with indra rather pointedly absorbed in a video display at the other end of the room his knowledge of the third millennium made another major advance corpsefood was on the way out even in your time anderson explained raising animals to ugh eat them became economically impossible i dont know how many acres of land it took to feed one cow but at least ten humans could survive on the plants it produced and probably a hundred with hydroponic techniques but what finished the whole horrible business was not economics but disease it started first with cattle then spread to other food animals a kind of virus i believe that affected the brain and caused a particularly nasty death although a cure was eventually found it was too late to turn back the clock and anyway synthetic foods were now far cheaper and you could get them in any flavor you liked remembering weeks of satisfying but unexciting meals poole had strong reservations about this for why he wondered did he still have wistful dreams of spareribs and cordon bleu steaks other dreams were far more disturbing and he was afraid that before long he would have to ask anderson for medical assistance despite everything that was being done to make him feel at home the strangeness and sheer complexity of this new world were beginning to overwhelm him during sleep as if in an unconscious effort to escape he often reverted to his earlier life but when he awoke that only made matters worse he had traveled across to america tower and looked down in reality and not in simulation on the landscape of his youth and it had not been a good idea with optical aid when the atmosphere was clear hed got so close that he could see individual human beings as they went about their affairs sometimes along streets that he remembered and always at the back of his mind was the knowledge that down there had once lived everyone he had ever loved mother father dear uncle george and aunt lil brother martin and not least a succession of dogs beginning with the warm puppies of his earliest childhood and culminating in rikki above all there was the memory and mystery of helena it had begun as a casual affair in the early days of his astrotraining but had become more and more serious as the years went by just before he had left for jupiter they had planned to make it permanent when he returned and if he did not helena wished to have his child he still recalled the blend of solemnity and hilarity with which they had made the necessary arrangements now a thousand years later despite all his efforts he had been unable to find if helena had kept her promise just as there were now gaps in his own memory so there were also in the collective records of mankind the worst was that created by the devastating electromagnetic pulse from the asteroid impact which had wiped out several per cent of the worlds information banks despite all backups and safety systems poole could not help wondering if among all the exabytes that were irretrievably lost were the records of his own children even now his descendants of the thirtieth generation might be walking the earth but he would never know it helped a little to have discovered that unlike aurora some ladies of this era did not consider him to be damaged goods on the contrary they often found his alteration quite exciting but this slightly bizarre reaction made it impossible for poole to establish any close relationship nor was he anxious to do so all that he really needed was the occasional healthy mindless exercise mindless that was the trouble he no longer had arty purpose in life and the weight of too many memories was upon him echoing the title of a famous book he had read in his youth he often said to himself i am a stranger in a strange time there were even occasions when he looked down at the beautiful planet on which if he obeyed doctors orders he could never walk again and wondered what it would be like to make a second acquaintance with the vacuum of space though it was not easy to get through the airlocks without triggering some alarm it had been done every few years some determined suicide made a brief meteoric display in the earths atmosphere perhaps it was just as well that deliverance was on its way from a completely unexpected direction nice to meet you commander poole for the second time im sorry dont recall but then i see so many people no need to apologize first time was out round neptune captain chandler delighted to see you can i get something from the autochef anything with over twenty per cent alcohol will be fine and what are you doing back on earth they told me you never come inside mars orbit almost true though i was born here i think its a dirty smelly place too many people creeping up to a billion again more than ten billion in my time by the way did you get my thank you message yes and i know i should have contacted you but i waited until i headed sunwards again so here i am your good health as the captain disposed of his drink with impressive speed poole tried to analyze his visitor beards even small goatees like chandlers were very rare in this society and he had never known an astronaut who wore one they did not coexist comfortably with spacehelmets of course a captain might go for years between evs and in any case most outside jobs were done by robots but there was always the risk of the unexpected when one might have to get suited in a hurry it was obvious that chandler was something of an eccentric and pooles heart warmed to him youve not answered my question if you dont like earth what are you doing here oh mostly contacting old friends its wonderful to forget hourlong delays and to have realtime conversations but of course thats not the reason my old rustbucket is having a refit up at the rim shipyard and the armor has to be replaced when it gets down to a few centimeters thick i dont sleep too well armor dust shield not such a problem in your time was it but its a dirty environment out round jupiter and our normal cruise speed is several thousand klicks a second so theres a continuous gentle pattering like raindrops on the roof youre joking course i am if we really could hear anything wed be dead luckily this sort of unpleasantness is very rare last serious accident was twenty years ago we know all the main comet streams where most of the junk is and are careful to avoid them except when were matching velocity to round up ice but why dont you come aboard and have a look around before we take off for jupiter id be delighteddid you say jupiter well ganymede of course anubis city weve a lot of business there and several of us have families we havent seen for months poole scarcely heard him suddenly unexpectedly and perhaps none too soon he had found a reason for living commander frank poole was the sort of man who hated to leave a job undone and a few specks of cosmic dust even moving at a thousand kilometers a second were not likely to discourage him he had unfinished business at the world once known as jupiter ii goliath a farewell to earth anything you want within reason he had been told frank poole was not sure if his hosts would consider that returning to jupiter was a reasonable request indeed he was not quite sure himself and was beginning to have second thoughts he had already committed himself to scores of engagements weeks in advance most of them he would be happy to miss but there were some he would be sorry to forgo in particular he hated to disappoint the senior class from his old high school how astonishing that it still existed when they planned to visit him next month however he was relieved and a little surprised when both indra and professor anderson agreed that it was an excellent idea for the first time he realized that they had been concerned with his mental health perhaps a holiday from earth would be the best possible cure and most important of all captain chandler was delighted you can have my cabin he promised ill kick the first mate out of hers there were times when poole wondered if chandler with his beard and swagger was not another anachronism he could easily picture him on the bridge of a battered threemaster with skull and crossbones flying overhead once his decision had been made events moved with surprising speed he had accumulated very few possessions and fewer still that he needed to take with him the most important was miss pringle his electronic alter ego and secretary now the storehouse of both his lives and the small stack of terabyte memories that went with her miss pringle was not much larger than the handheld personal assistants of his own age and usually lived like the old wests colt in a quickdraw holster at his waist she could communicate with him by audio or braincap and her prime duty was to act as an information filter and a buffer to the outside world like any good secretary she knew when to reply in the appropriate format ill put you through now or much more frequently im sorry mr poole is engaged please record your message and he will get back to you as soon as possible usually this was never there were very few farewells to be made though realtime conversations would be impossible owing to the sluggish velocity of radio waves he would be in constant touch with indra and joseph the only genuine friends he had made somewhat to his surprise poole realized that he would miss his enigmatic but useful valet because he would now have to handle all the small chores of everyday life by himself danil bowed slightly when they parted but otherwise showed no sign of emotion as they took the long ride up to the outer curve of the worldcircling wheel thirtysix thousand kilometers above central africa im not sure dim that youll appreciate the comparison but do you know what goliath reminds me of they were now such good friends that poole could use the captains nickname but only when no one else was around something unflattering i assume not really but when i was a boy i came across a whole pile of old sciencefiction magazines that my uncle george had abandoned pulps they were called after the cheap paper they were printed onmost of them were already falling to bits they had wonderful garish covers showing strange planets and monsters and of course spaceships as i grew older i realized how ridiculous those spaceships were they were usually rocketdriven but there was never any sign of propellant tanks some of them had rows of windows from stem to stem just like ocean liners there was one favorite of mine with a huge glass dome a spacegoing conservatory well those old artists had the last laugh too bad they could never know goliath looks more like their dreams than the flying fueltanks we used to launch from the cape your inertial drive still seems too good to be true no visible means of support unlimited range and speed sometimes i think im the one whos dreaming chandler laughed and pointed to the view outside does that look like a dream it was the first time that poole had seen a genuine horizon since he had come to star city and it was not quite as far away as he had expected after all he was on the outer rim of a wheel seven times the diameter of earth so surely the view across the roof of this artificial world should extend for several hundred kilometers he used to be good at mental arithmetic a rare achievement even in his time and probably much rarer now the formula to give the horizon distance was a simple one the square root of twice your height times the radius the sort of thing you never forgot even if you wanted to lets see were about meters up so root this is easy say big r is knock off those three zeros to make it all klicks times root hmm just over well twentyfive kilometers was a fair distance and certainly no spaceport on earth had ever seemed this huge even knowing perfectly well what to expect it was uncanny to watch vessels many times the size of his longlost discovery lifting off not only with no sound but with no apparent means of propulsion though poole missed the flame and fury of the oldtime countdowns he had to admit that this was cleaner more efficient and far safer strangest of all though was to sit up here on the rim in the geostationary orbit itself and to feel weight just meters away outside the window of the tiny observation lounge servicing robots and a few spacesuited humans were gliding gently about their business yet here inside goliath the inertial field was maintaining standard marsgee sure you dont want to change your mind frank captain chandler had asked jokingly as he left for the bridge still ten minutes before liftoff wouldnt be very popular if i did would i no as they used to say back in the old days we have commit ready or not here i come poole felt the need to be alone when the drive went on and the tiny crew only four men and three women respected his wish perhaps they guessed how he must be feeling to leave earth for the second time in a thousand years and once again to face an unknown destiny jupiterlucifer was on the other side of the sun and the almost straight line of goliaths orbit would take them close to venus poole looked forward to seeing with his own unaided eyes if earths sister planet was now beginning to live up to that description after centuries of terraforming from a thousand kilometers up star city looked like a gigantic metal band around earths equator dotted with gantries pressure domes scaffolding holding halfcompleted ships antennas and other more enigmatic structures it was diminishing swiftly as goliath headed sunwards and presently poole could see how incomplete it was there were huge gaps spanned only by a spiders web of scaffolding which would probably never be completely enclosed and now they were falling below the plane of the ring it was midwinter in the northern hemisphere so the slim halo of star city was inclined at over twenty degrees to the sun already poole could see the american and asian towers as shining threads stretching outwards and away beyond the blue haze of the atmosphere he was barely conscious of time as goliath gained speed moving more swiftly than any comet that had ever fallen sunwards from interstellar space the earth almost full still spanned his field of view and he could now see the full length of the africa tower which had been his home in the life he was now leaving perhaps he could not help thinking leaving for ever when they were fifty thousand kilometers out he was able to view the whole of star city as a narrow ellipse enclosing the earth though the far side was barely visible as a hairline of light against the stars it was aweinspiring to think that the human race had now set this sign upon the heavens then poole remembered the rings of saturn infinitely more glorious the astronautical engineers still had a long long way to go before they could match the achievements of nature or if that was the right word deus transit of venus when he woke the next morning they were already at venus but the huge dazzling crescent of the still cloudwrapped planet was not the most striking object in the sky goliath was floating above an endless expanse of crinkled silver foil flashing in the sunlight with everchanging patterns as the ship drifted across it poole remembered that in his own age there had been an artist who had wrapped whole buildings in plastic sheets how he would have loved this opportunity to package billions of tons of ice in a glittering envelopeonly in this way could the core of a comet be protected from evaporation on its decadeslong journey sunwards youre in luck frank chandler had told him this is something ive never seen myself it should be spectacular impact due in just over an hour weve given it a little nudge to make sure it comes down in the right place dont want anyone to get hurt poole looked at him in astonishment you mean there are already people on venus about fifty mad scientists near the south pole of course theyre well dug in but we should shake them up a bit even though ground zero is on the other side of the planet or i should say atmosphere zero it will be days before anything except the shockwave gets down to the surface as the cosmic iceberg sparkling and flashing in its protective envelope dwindled away towards venus poole was struck with a sudden poignant memory the christmas trees of his childhood had been adorned with just such ornaments delicate bubbles of colored glass and the comparison was not completely ludicrous for many families on earth this was still the right season for gifts and goliath was bringing a present beyond price to another world the radar image of the tortured venusian landscape its weird volcanoes pancake domes and narrow sinuous canyons dominated the main screen of goliaths control center but poole preferred the evidence of his own eyes although the unbroken sea of clouds that covered the planet revealed nothing of the inferno beneath he wanted to see what would happen when the stolen comet struck in a matter of seconds the myriad of tons of frozen hydrates that had been gathering speed for decades on the downhill run from neptune would deliver all their energy the initial flash was even brighter than he had expected how strange that a missile made of ice could generate temperatures that must be in the tens of thousands of degrees though the filters of the viewport would have absorbed all the dangerous shorter wavelengths the fierce blue of the fireball proclaimed that it was hotter than the sun it was cooling rapidly as it expanded through yellow orange redthe shockwave would now be spreading outwards at the velocity of sound and what a sound that must be so in a few minutes there should be some visible indication of its passage across the face of venus and there it was only a tiny black ring like an insignificant puff of smoke giving no hint of the cyclonic fury that must be blasting its way outwards from the point of impact as poole watched it slowly expanded though owing to its scale there was no sense of visible movement he had to wait for a full minute before he could be quite sure that it had grown larger after a quarter of an hour however it was the most prominent marking on the planet though much fainter a dirty gray rather than black the shockwave was now a ragged circle more than a thousand kilometers across poole guessed that it had lost its original symmetry while sweeping over the great mountain ranges that lay beneath it captain chandlers voice sounded briskly over the ships address system putting you through to aphrodite base glad to say theyre not shouting for help shook us up a bit but just what we expected monitors indicate some rain already over the nokomis mountains it will soon evaporate but thats a beginning and there seems to have been a flashflood in hecate chasm too good to be true but were checking there was a temporary lake of boiling water there after the last delivery i dont envy them poole told himself but i certainly admire them they prove that the spirit of adventure still exists in this perhaps toocomfortable and toowelladjusted society and thanks again for bringing this little load down in the right place with any luck and if we can get that sunscreen up into sync orbit well have some permanent seas before long and then we can plant coral reefs to make lime and pull the excess co out of the atmosphere hope i live to see it i hope you do thought poole in silent admiration he had often dived in the tropical seas of earth admiring weird and colorful creatures so bizarre that it was hard to believe anything stranger would be found even on the planets of other suns package delivered on time and receipt acknowledged said captain chandler with obvious satisfaction goodbye venus ganymede here we come miss pringle file wallace hello indra yes you were quite right i do miss our little arguments chandler and i get along fine and at first the crew treated me this will amuse you rather like a holy relic but theyre beginning to accept me and have even started to pull my leg its annoying not to be able to have a real conversation weve crossed the orbit of mars so radio roundtrip is already over an hour but theres one advantage you wont be able to interrupt me even though it will take us only a week to reach jupiter i thought id have time to relax not a bit of it my fingers started to itch and i couldnt resist going back to school so ive begun basic training all over again in one of goliaths minishuttles maybe dim will actually let me solo its not much bigger than discoverys pods but what a difference first of all of course it doesnt use rockets i cant get used to the luxury of the inertial drive and unlimited range could fly back to earth if i had to though id probably get remember the phrase i used once and you guessed its meaning stir crazy the biggest difference though is the control system its been a big challenge for me to get used to handsoff operation and the computer has had to learn to recognize my voice commands at first it was asking every five minutes do you really mean that i know it would be better to use the braincap but im still not completely confident with that gadget not sure if ill ever get used to something reading my mind by the way the shuttles called falcon its a nice name and i was disappointed to find that no one aboard knew that it goes all the way back to the apollo missions when we first landed on the moon uhhuh there was a lot more i wanted to say but the skipper is calling back to the classroom love and out store transmit hello frank indra calling if thats right word on my new thoughtwriter old one had nervous breakdown ha ha so be lots of mistakes no time to edit before i send hope you can make sense comset channel one oh three record from twelve thirty correction thirteen thirty sorry hope i can get old unit fixed knew all my shortcuts and abbrieves maybe should get psychoanalyzed like in your time never understood how that fraudian mean freudian ha ha nonsense lasted as long as it did reminds me came across late twentieth defin other day may amuse you something like this quote psychoanalysis contagious disease originating vienna circa now extinct in europe but occasional outbreaks among rich americans unquote funny sorry again trouble with thoughtwriters hard to stick to point xz w jslyebdc damnstop backup did i do something wrong then will try again you mentioned danilsorry we always evaded your questions about him knew you were curious but we had very good reason remember you once called him a nonpersonnot bad guess once you asked me about crime nowadays i said any such interest pathological maybe prompted by the endless sickening television programs of your time never able to watch more than few minutes myselfdisgusting door acknowledge oh hello melinda excuse sit down nearly finished yes crime always somesocietys irreducible noise level what to do your solution prisons statesponsored perversion factories costing ten times average family income to hold one inmate utterly crazyobviously something very wrong with people who shouted loudest for more prisons they should be psychoanalyzed but lets be fair really no alternative before electronic monitoring and control perfected you should see the joyful crowds smashing the prison walls then nothing like it since berlin fifty years earlier yes danil i dont know what his crime was wouldnt tell you if i did but presume his psych profile suggested hed make a good what was the word ballet no valet very hard to get people for some jobs dont know how wed manage if crime level zero anyway hope hes soon decontrolled and back in normal society sorry melinda nearly finished thats it frank regards to dimitri you must be halfway to ganymede now wonder if theyll ever repeal einstein so we can talk across space in realtime hope this machine soon gets used to me otherwise be looking round for genuine antique twentieth century word processorwould you believe once even mastered that qwertyiyuiop nonsense which you took a couple of hundred years to get rid of love and goodbye hello frank here i am again still waiting acknowledgement of my last strange you should be heading towards ganymede and my old friend ted khan but perhaps its not such a coincidence he was drawn by the same enigma that you were first i must tell you something about him his parents played a dirty trick giving him the name theodore that shortens dont ever call him that to theo see what i mean cant help wondering if thats what drives him dont know anyone else whos developed such an interest in religion no obsession better warn you he can be quite a bore by the way how am i doing i miss my old thinkwriter but seem to be getting this machine under control havent made any bad what did you call them bloopers glitches fluffs so far at least not sure i should tell you this in case you accidentally blurt it out but my private nickname for ted is the last jesuit you must know something about them the order was still very active in your time amazing people often great scientists superb scholars did a tremendous amount of good as well as much harm one of historys supreme ironies sincere and brilliant seekers of knowledge and truth yet their whole philosophy hopelessly distorted by superstition xuednkjn deer leidj dwpp damn got emotional and lost control one two three fournow is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the partythats better anyway ted has that same brand of highminded determination dont get into any arguments with him hell go over you like a steamroller by the way what were steamrollers used for pressing clothes can see how that could be very uncomfortable trouble with thinkwriterstoo easy to go off in all directions no matter how hard you try to discipline yourselfsomething to be said for keyboards after allsure ive said that before ted khanted khanted khan hes still famous back on earth for at least two of his sayings civilization and religion are incompatible and faith is believing what you know isnt true actually i dont think the last one is original if it is thats the nearest he ever got to a joke he never cracked a smile when i tried one of my favorites on him hope you havent heard it before it obviously dates from your time the deans complaining to his faculty why do you scientists need such expensive equipment why cant you be like the maths department which only needs a blackboard and a wastepaper basket better still like the department of philosophy that doesnt even need a wastepaper basket well perhaps ted had heard it beforei expect most philosophers have anyway give him my regards and dont repeat dont get into any arguments with him love and best wishes from africa tower transcribe store transmit poole the captains table the arrival of such a distinguished passenger had caused a certain disruption in the tight little world of goliath but the crew had adapted to it with good humor every day at hours all personnel gathered for dinner in the wardroom which in zerogee could hold at least thirty people in comfort if spread uniformly around the walls however most of the time the ships working areas were held at lunar gravity so there was an undeniable floor and more than eight bodies made a crowd the semicircular table that unfolded around the autochef at mealtimes could just seat the entire sevenperson crew with the captain at the place of honor one extra created such insuperable problems that somebody now had to eat alone for every meal after much goodnatured debate it was decided to make the choice in alphabetical order not of proper names which were hardly ever used but of nicknames it had taken poole some time to get used to them bolts chips first life props and stars during the tenday voyage as he listened to the stories jokes and complaints of his temporary shipmates poole learned more about the solar system than during his months on earth all aboard were obviously delighted to have a new and perhaps naive listener as an attentive oneman audience but poole was seldom taken in by their more imaginative stories yet sometimes it was hard to know where to draw the line no one really believed in the golden asteroid which was usually regarded as a twentyfourthcentury hoax but what about the mercurian plasmoids which had been reported by at least a dozen reliable witnesses during the last five hundred years the simplest explanation was that they were related to balllightning responsible for so many unidentified flying object reports on earth and mars but some observers swore that they had shown purposefulness even inquisitiveness when they were encountered at close quarters nonsense answered the skeptics merely electrostatic attraction inevitably this led to discussions about life in the universe and poole found himself not for the first time defending his own era against its extremes of credulity and skepticism although the aliens are among us mania had already subsided when he was a boy even as late as the s the space agency was still plagued by lunatics who claimed to have been contacted or abducted by visitors from other worlds their delusions had been reinforced by sensational media exploitation and the whole syndrome was later enshrined in the medical literature as adamskis disease the discovery of tma one had paradoxically put an end to this sorry nonsense by demonstrating that though there was indeed intelligence elsewhere it had apparently not concerned itself with mankind for several million years tma one had also convincingly refuted the handful of scientists who argued that life above the bacterial level was such an improbable phenomenon that the human race was alone in this galaxy if not the cosmos goliaths crew was more interested in the technology than the politics and economics of pooles era and were particularly fascinated by the revolution that had taken place in his own lifetime the end of the fossilfuel age triggered by the harnessing of vacuum energy they found it hard to imagine the smogchoked cities of the twentieth century and the waste greed and appalling environmental disasters of the oil age dont blame me said poole fighting back gamely after one round of criticism anyway see what a mess the twentyfirst century made there was a chorus of what do you means around the table well as soon as the socalled age of infinite power got under way and everyone had thousands of kilowatts of cheap clean energy to play with you know what happened oh you mean the thermal crisis but that was fixed eventually after youd covered half the earth with reflectors to bounce the suns heat back into space otherwise it would have been as parboiled as venus by now the crews knowledge of third millennium history was so surprisingly limited that poole thanks to the intensive education he had received in star city could often amaze them with details of events centuries after his own time however he was flattered to discover how wellacquainted they were with discoverys log it had become one of the classic records of the space age they looked on it as he might have regarded a viking saga often he had to remind himself that he was midway in time between goliath and the first ships to cross the western ocean on your day stars reminded him at dinner on the fifth evening you passed within two thousand kay of asteroid and shot a probe into it do you remember of course i do poole answered rather brusquely to me it happened less than a year ago um sorry well tomorrow well be even closer to like to have a look with autoguidance and freezeframe we should have a window all of ten milliseconds wide a hundredth of a second that few minutes in discovery had seemed hectic enough but now everything would happen fifty times faster how large is it poole asked thirty by twenty by fifteen meters stars replied looks like a battered brick sorry we dont have a slug to fire at it said props did you ever wonder if would hit back never occurred to us but it did give the astronomers a lot of useful information so it was worth the riskanyway a hundredth of a second hardly seems worth the bother thanks all the same i understand when youve seen one asteroid youve seen them not true chips when i was on eros as youve told us at least a dozen times pooles mind tuned out the discussion so that it was a background of meaningless noise he was a thousand years in the past recalling the only excitement of discoverys mission before the final disaster though he and bowman were perfectly aware that was merely a lifeless airless chunk of rock that knowledge scarcely affected their feelings it was the only solid matter they would meet this side of jupiter and they had stared at it with the emotions of sailors on a long sea voyage skirting a coast on which they could not land it was turning slowly end over end and there were mottled patches of light and shade distributed at random over its surface sometimes it sparkled like a distant window as planes or outcroppings of crystalline material flashed in the sun he remembered also the mounting tension as they waited to see if their aim had been accurate it was not easy to hit such a small target two thousand kilometers away moving at a relative velocity of twenty kilometers a second then against the darkened portion of the asteroid there had been a sudden dazzling explosion of light the tiny slug pure uranium had impacted at meteoric speed in a fraction of a second all its kinetic energy had been transformed into heat a puff of incandescent gas had erupted briefly into space and discoverys cameras were recording the rapidly fading spectral lines looking for the telltale signatures of glowing atoms a few hours later back on earth the astronomers learned for the first time the composition of an asteroids crust there were no major surprises but several bottles of champagne changed hands captain chandler himself took little part in the very democratic discussions around his semicircular table he seemed content to let his crew relax and express their feelings in this informal atmosphere there was only one unspoken rule no serious business at mealtimes if there were any technical or operational problems they had to be dealt with elsewhere poole had been surprised and a little shocked to discover that the crews knowledge of goliaths systems was very superficial often he had asked questions which should have been easily answered only to be referred to the ships own memory banks after a while however he realized that the sort of indepth training he had received in his days was no longer possible far too many complex systems were involved for any man or womans mind to master the various specialists merely had to know what their equipment did not how reliability depended on redundancy and automatic checking and human intervention was much more likely to do harm than good fortunately none was required on this voyage it had been as uneventful as any skipper could have hoped when the new sun of lucifer dominated the sky ahead iii the worlds of galileo even today the giant satellites of what was once jupiter present us with major mysteries why are four worlds orbiting the same primary and very similar in size so different in most other respects only in the case of io the innermost satellite is there a convincing explanation it is so close to jupiter that the gravitational tides constantly kneading its interior generate colossal quantities of heat so much indeed that ios surface is semimolten it is the most volcanically active world in the solar system maps of io have a halflife of only a few decades though no permanent human bases have ever been established in such an unstable environment there have been numerous landings and there is continuous robot monitoring europa second in distance from jupiter was originally entirely covered in ice and showed few surface features except a complicated network of cracks the tidal forces which dominate io were much less powerful here but produced enough heat to give europa a global ocean of liquid water in which many strange lifeforms have evolved in the chinese ship tsien touched down on europa on one of the few outcrops of solid rock protruding through the crust of ice in doing so it disturbed a creature of the europan abyss and was destroyed since the conversion of jupiter into the minisun lucifer in virtually all of europas icecover has melted and extensive vulcanism has created several small islands as is wellknown there have been no landings on europa for almost a thousand years but the satellite is under continuous surveillance ganymede largest moon in the solar system has also been affected by the creation of a new sun and its equatorial regions are warm enough to sustain terrestrial lifeforms though it does not yet have a breathable atmosphere most of its population is actively engaged in terraforming and scientific research the main settlement is anubis near the south pole callisto is again wholly different its entire surface is covered by impact craters of all sizes so numerous that they overlap the bombardment must have continued for millions of years for the newer craters have completely obliterated the earlier ones there is no permanent base on callisto but several automatic stations have been established there ganymede it was unusual for frank poole to oversleep but he had been kept awake by strange dreams past and present were inextricably mixed sometimes he was on discovery sometimes in the africa tower and sometimes he was a boy again among friends he had thought longforgotten where am i he asked himself as he struggled up to consciousness like a swimmer trying to get back to the surface there was a small window just above his bed covered by a curtain not thick enough to completely block the light from outside there had been a time around the midtwentieth century when aircraft had been slow enough to feature first class sleeping accommodation poole had never sampled this nostalgic luxury which some tourist organizations had still advertised in his own day but he could easily imagine that he was doing so now he drew the curtain and looked out no he had not awakened in the skies of earth though the landscape unrolling below was not unlike the antarctic but the south pole had never boasted two suns both rising at once as goliath swept towards them the ship was orbiting less than a hundred kilometers above what appeared to be an immense ploughed field lightly dusted with snow but the ploughman must have been drunk or the guidance system must have gone crazy for the furrows meandered in every direction sometimes cutting across each other or turning back on themselves here and there the terrain was dotted with faint circles ghost craters from meteor impacts aeons ago so this is ganymede poole wondered drowsily mankinds furthest outpost from home why should any sensible person want to live here well ive often thought that when ive flown over greenland or iceland in wintertime there was a knock on the door a mind if i come in and captain chandler did so without waiting for a reply thought wed let you sleep until we landed that endoftrip party did last longer than id intended but i couldnt risk a mutiny by cutting it short poole laughed has there ever been a mutiny in space oh quite a few but not in my time now weve mentioned the subject you might say that hal started the traditionsorry perhaps i shouldnt look theres ganymede city coming up over the horizon was what appeared to be a crisscross pattern of streets and avenues intersecting almost at rightangles but with the slight irregularity typical of any settlement that had grown by accretion without central planning it was bisected by a broad river poole recalled that the equatorial regions of ganymede were now warm enough for liquid water to exist and it reminded him of an old woodcut he had seen of medieval london then he noticed that chandler was looking at him with an expression of amusementand the illusion vanished as he realized the scale of the city the ganymedeans he said dryly must have been rather large to have made roads five or ten kilometers wide twenty in some places impressive isnt it and all the result of ice stretching and contracting mother nature is ingeniousi could show you some patterns that look even more artificial though theyre not as large as this one when i was a boy there was a big fuss about a face on mars of course it turned out to be a hill that had been carved by sandstormslots of similar ones in earths deserts didnt someone say that history always repeats itself same sort of nonsense happened with ganymede city some nuts claimed it had been built by aliens but im afraid it wont be around much longer why asked poole in surprise its already started to collapse as lucifer melts the permafrost you wont recognize ganymede in another hundred yearstheres the edge of lake gilgamesh if you look carefully over on the right i see what you mean whats happening surely the waters not boiling even at this low pressure electrolysis plant dont know how many skillions of kilograms of oxygen a day of course the hydrogen goes up and gets lost we hope chandlers voice trailed off into silence then he resumed in an unusually diffident tone all that beautiful water down there ganymede doesnt need half of it dont tell anyone but ive been working out ways of getting some to venus easier than nudging comets as far as energy is concerned yes ganymedes escape velocity is only three klicks per second and much much quicker years instead of decades but there are a few practical difficulties i can appreciate that would you shoot it off by a masslauncher oh no id use towers reaching up through the atmosphere like the ones on earth but much smaller wed pump the water up to the top freeze it down to near absolute zero and let ganymede sling it off in the right direction as it rotated there would be some evaporation loss in transit but most of it would arrive whats so funny sorry im not laughing at the idea it makes good sense but youve brought back such a vivid memory we used to have a garden sprinkler driven round and round by its water jets what youre planning is the same thing on a slightly bigger scaleusing a whole world suddenly another image from his past obliterated all else poole remembered how in those hot arizona days he and rikki had loved to chase each other through the clouds of moving mist from the slowly revolving spray of the garden sprinkler captain chandler was a much more sensitive man than he pretended to be he knew when it was time to leave gotta get back to the bridge he said gruffly see you when we land at anubis grand hotel the grand ganymede hotel inevitably known throughout the solar system as hotel grannymede was certainly not grand and would be lucky to get a rating of oneandahalf stars on earth as the nearest competition was several hundred million kilometers away the management felt little need to exert itself unduly yet poole had no complaints though he often wished that danil was still around to help him with the mechanics of life and to communicate more efficiently with the semiintelligent devices with which he was surrounded he had known a brief moment of panic when the door had closed behind the bellboy who had apparently been too awed by his guest to explain how any of the rooms services functioned after five minutes of fruitless talking to the unresponsive walls poole had finally made contact with a system that understood his accent and his commands what an all worlds news item it would have made historic astronaut starves to death trapped in ganymede hotel room and there would have been a double irony perhaps the naming of the grannymedes only luxury suite was inevitable but it had been a real shock to meet an ancient lifesize holo of his old shipmate in fulldress uniform as he was led into the bowman suite poole even recognized the image his own official portrait had been made at the same time a few days before the mission began he soon discovered that most of his goliath crewmates had domestic arrangements in anubis and were anxious for him to meet their significant others during the ships planned twentyday stop almost immediately he was caught up in the social and professional life of this frontier settlement and it was africa tower that now seemed a distant dream like many americans in their secret hearts poole had a nostalgic affection for small communities where everyone knew everyone else in the real world and not the virtual one of cyberspace anubis with a resident population less than that of his remembered flagstaff was not a bad approximation to this ideal the three main pressure domes each two kilometers in diameter stood on a plateau overlooking an icefield which stretched unbroken to the horizon ganymedes second sun once known as jupiter would never give sufficient heat to melt the polar caps this was the principal reason for establishing anubis in such an inhospitable spot the citys foundations were not likely to collapse for at least several centuries and inside the domes it was easy to be completely indifferent to the outside world poole when he had mastered the mechanisms of the bowman suite discovered that he had a limited but impressive choice of environments he could sit beneath palm trees on a pacific beach listening to the gentle murmur of the waves or if he preferred the roar of a tropical hurricane he could fly slowly along the peaks of the himalayas or down the immense canyons of mariner valley he could walk through the gardens of versailles or down the streets of half a dozen great cities at several widely spaced times in their history even if the hotel grannymede was not one of the solar systems most highly acclaimed resorts it boasted facilities which would have astounded all its more famous predecessors on earth but it was ridiculous to indulge in terrestrial nostalgia when he had come halfway across the solar system to visit a strange new world after some experimenting poole arranged a compromise for enjoyment and inspiration during his steadily fewer moments of leisure to his great regret he had never been to egypt so it was delightful to relax beneath the gaze of the sphinx as it was before its controversial restoration and to watch tourists scrambling up the massive blocks of the great pyramid the illusion was perfect apart from the nomansland where the desert clashed with the carpet of the bowman suite the sky however was one that no human eyes had seen until five thousand years after the last stone was laid at giza but it was not an illusion it was the complex and everchanging reality of ganymede because this world like its companions had been robbed of its spin aeons ago by the tidal drag of jupiter the new sun born from the giant planet hung motionless in its sky one side of ganymede was in perpetual luciferlight and although the other hemisphere was often referred to as the night land that designation was as misleading as the much earlier phrase the dark side of the moon like the lunar farside ganymedes night land had the brilliant light of old sol for half of its long day by a coincidence more confusing than useful ganymede took almost exactly one week seven days three hours to orbit its primary attempts to create a one mede day one earth week calendar had generated so much chaos that they had been abandoned centuries ago like all the other residents of the solar system the locals employed universal time identifying their twentyfourhour standard days by numbers rather than names since ganymedes newborn atmosphere was still extremely thin and almost cloudless the parade of heavenly bodies provided a neverending spectacle at their closest io and callisto each appeared about half the size of the moon as seen from earth but that was the only thing they had in common io was so close to lucifer that it took less than two days to race around its orbit and showed visible movement even in a matter of minutes callisto at over four times ios distance required two mede days or sixteen earth ones to complete its leisurely circuit the physical contrast between the two worlds was even more remarkable deepfrozen callisto had been almost unchanged by jupiters conversion into a minisun it was still a wasteland of shallow ice craters so closely packed that there was not a single spot on the entire satellite that had escaped from multiple impacts in the days when jupiters enormous gravity field was competing with saturns to gather up the debris of the outer solar system since then apart from a few stray shots nothing had happened for several billion years on io something was happening every week as a local wit had remarked before the creation of lucifer it had been hell now it was hell warmed up often poole would zoom into that burning landscape and look into the sulphurous throats of volcanoes that were continually reshaping an area larger than africa sometimes incandescent fountains would soar briefly hundreds of kilometers into space like gigantic trees of fire growing on a lifeless world as the floods of molten sulfur spread out from volcanoes and vents the versatile element changed through a narrow spectrum of reds and oranges and yellows when chameleonlike it was transformed into its varicolored allotropes before the dawn of the space age no one had ever imagined that such a world existed fascinating though it was to observe it from his comfortable vantage point poole found it hard to believe that men had ever risked landing there where even robots feared to treadhis main interest however was europa which at its closest appeared almost exactly the same size as earths solitary moon but raced through its phases in only four days though poole had been quite unconscious of the symbolism when he chose his private landscape it now seemed wholly appropriate that europa should hang in the sky above another great enigma the sphinx even with no magnification when he requested the nakedeye view poole could see how greatly europa had changed in the thousand years since discovery had set out for jupiter the spiders web of narrow bands and lines that had once completely enveloped the smallest of the four galilean satellites had vanished except around the poles here the global crust of kilometerthick ice remained unmelted by the warmth of europas new sun elsewhere virgin oceans seethed and boiled in the thin atmosphere at what would have been comfortable room temperature on earth it was also a comfortable temperature to the creatures who had emerged after the melting of the unbroken ice shield that had both trapped and protected them orbiting spysats showing details only centimeters across had watched one europan species starting to evolve into an amphibious stage though they still spent much of their time underwater the europs had even begun the construction of simple buildings that this could happen in a mere thousand years was astonishing but no one doubted that the explanation lay in the last and greatest of the monoliths the manykilometerlong great wall standing on the shore of the sea of galilee and no one doubted that in its own mysterious way it was watching over the experiment it had started on this world as it had done on earth four million years before the madness of mankind miss pringle file indra my dear indra sorry ive not even voicemailed you before usual excuse of course so i wont bother to give it to answer your question yes im now feeling quite at home at the grannymede but am spending less and less time there though ive been enjoying the sky display ive had piped into my suite last night the io fluxtube put on a fine performance thats a kind of lightning discharge between io and jupiter i mean lucifer rather like earths aurora but much more spectacular discovered by the radio astronomers even before i was born and talking about ancient times did you know that anubis has a sheriff i think thats overdoing the frontier spirit reminds me of the stories my grandfather used to tell me about arizonamust try some of them on the medes this may sound silly im still not used to being in the bowman suite i keep looking over my shoulder how do i spend my time much the same as in africa tower im meeting the local intelligentsia though as you might expect theyre rather thin on the ground and ive interacted real and virtual with the educational system very good it seems though more technically oriented than youd approve thats inevitable of course in this hostile environment but its helped me to understand why people live here theres a challenge a sense of purpose if you like that i seldom found on earth its true that most of the medes were born here so dont know any other home though theyre usually too polite to say so they think that the home planet is becoming decadent are you and if so what are you terries as the locals call you going to do about it one of the teenage classes ive met hopes to wake you up theyre drawing up elaborate top secret plans for the invasion of earth dont say i didnt warn you ive made one trip outside anubis into the socalled night land where they never see lucifer ten of us chandler two of goliaths crew six medes went into farside and chased the sun down to the horizon so it really was night awesome much like polar winters on earth but with the sky completely blackalmost felt i was in space we could see all the galileans beautifully and watched europa eclipse sorry occult io of course the trip had been timed so we could observe this several of the smaller satellites were just also visible but the double star earthmoon was much more conspicuous did i feel homesick frankly no though i miss my new friends back there and im sorry i still havent met dr khan though hes left several messages for me i promise to do it in the next few days earth days not mede ones best wishes to joe regards to danil if you know whats happened to him is he a real person again and my love to yourself store transmit back in pooles century a persons name often gave a clue to hisher appearance but that was no longer true thirty generations later dr theodore khan turned out to be a nordic blond who might have looked more at home in a viking longboat than ravaging the steppes of central asia however he would not have been too impressive in either role being less than a hundred and fifty centimeters tall poole could not resist a little amateur psychoanalysis small people were often aggressive overachievers which from indra wallaces hints appeared to be a good description of ganymedes sole resident philosopher khan probably needed these qualifications to survive in such a practicallyminded society anubis city was far too small to boast a university campus a luxury which still existed on the other worlds though many believed that the telecommunications revolution had made it obsolete instead it had something much more appropriate as well as centuries older an academy complete with a grove of olive trees that would have fooled plato himself until he had attempted to walk through it indras joke about departments of philosophy requiring no more equipment than blackboards clearly did not apply in this sophisticated environment its built to hold seven people said dr khan proudly when they had settled down on chairs obviously designed to be nottoocomfortable because thats the maximum one can efficiently interact with and if you count the ghost of socrates it was the number present when phaedo delivered his famous address the one on the immortality of the soul khan was so obviously surprised that poole could not help laughing i took a crash course in philosophy just before i graduated when the syllabus was planned someone decided that we hairyknuckled engineers should be exposed to a little culture im delighted to hear it that makes things so much easier you know i still cant credit my luck your arrival here almost tempts me to believe in miracles id even thought of going to earth to meet you has dear indra told you about my ah obsession no poole answered not altogether truthfully dr khan looked very pleased he was clearly delighted to find a new audience you may have heard me called an atheist but thats not quite true atheism is unprovable so uninteresting equally however unlikely it is we can never be certain that god once existed and has now shot off to infinity where no one can ever find himlike gautama buddha i take no position on this subject my field of interest is the psychopathology known as religion psychopathology thats a harsh judgement amply justified by history imagine that youre an intelligent extraterrestrial concerned only with verifiable truths you discover a species which has divided itself into thousands no by now millions of tribal groups holding an incredible variety of beliefs about the origin of the universe and the way to behave in it although many of them have ideas in common even when theres a ninetynine per cent overlap the remaining one per cent is enough to set them killing and torturing each other over trivial points of doctrine utterly meaningless to outsiders how to account for such irrational behavior lucretius hit it on the nail when he said that religion was the byproduct of fear a reaction to a mysterious and often hostile universe for much of human prehistory it may have been a necessary evil but why was it so much more evil than necessary and why did it survive when it was no longer necessary i said evil and i mean it because fear leads to cruelty the slightest knowledge of the inquisition makes one ashamed to belong to the human speciesone of the most revolting books ever published was the hammer of witches written by a couple of sadistic perverts and describing the tortures the church authorized encouraged to extract confessions from thousands of harmless old women before it burned them alivethe pope himself wrote an approving foreword but most of the other religions with a few honorable exceptions were just as bad as christianityeven in your century little boys were kept chained and whipped until theyd memorized whole volumes of pious gibberish and robbed of their childhood and manhood to become monks perhaps the most baffling aspect of the whole affair is how obvious madmen century after century would proclaim that they and they alone had received messages from god if all the messages had agreed that would have settled the matter but of course they were wildly discordant which never prevented selfstyled messiahs from gathering hundreds sometimes millions of adherents who would fight to the death against equally deluded believers of a microscopically differing faith poole thought it was about time he got a word in edgeways youve reminded me of something that happened in my hometown when i was a kid a holy man quote unquote set up shop claimed he could work miracles and collected a crowd of devotees in next to no time and they werent ignorant or illiterate often they came from the best families every sunday i used to see expensive cars parked round his ah temple the rasputin syndrome its been called there are millions of such cases all through history in every country and about one time in a thousand the cult survives for a couple of generations what happened in this case well the competition was very unhappy and did its best to discredit him wish i could remember his name he used a long indian one swami somethingorother but it turned out he came from alabama one of his tricks was to produce holy objects out of thin air and hand them to his worshippers as it happened our local rabbi was an amateur conjuror and gave public demonstrations showing exactly how it was done didnt make the slightest difference the faithful said that their mans magic was real and the rabbi was just jealous at one time im sorry to say mother took the rascal seriously it was soon after dad had run off which may have had something to do with it and dragged me to one of his sessions i was only about ten but i thought id never seen anyone so unpleasantlooking he had a beard that could have held several birds nests and probably did he sounds like the standard model how long did he flourish three or four years and then he had to leave town in a hurry he was caught running teenage orgies of course he claimed he was using mystical soulsaving techniques and you wont believe this try me even then lots of his dupes still had faith in him their god could do no wrong so he must have been framed framed sorry convicted by faked evidence sometimes used by the police to catch criminals when all else fails hmm well your swami was perfectly typical im rather disappointed but he does help to prove my case that most of humanity has always been insane at least some of the time rather an unrepresentative sample one small flagstaff suburb true but i could multiply it by thousands not only in your century but all down the ages theres never been anything however absurd that countless people werent prepared to believe often so passionately that theyd fight to the death rather than abandon their illusions to me thats a good operational definition of insanity would you argue that anyone with strong religious beliefs was insane in a strictly technical sense yes if they really were sincere and not hypocrites as i suspect ninety per cent were im certain that rabbi berenstein was sincere and he was one of the sanest men i ever knew as well as one of the finest and how do you account for this the only real genius i ever met was dr chandra who led the hal project i once had to go into his office there was no reply when i knocked and i thought it was unoccupied he was praying to a group of fantastic little bronze statues draped with flowers one of them looked like an elephantanother had more than the regular number of armsi was quite embarrassed but luckily he didnt hear me and i tiptoed out would you say he was insane youve chosen a bad example genius often is so lets say not insane but mentally impaired owing to childhood conditioning the jesuits claimed give me a boy for six years and he is mine for life if theyd got hold of little chandra in time hed have been a devout catholic not a hindu possibly but im puzzled why were you so anxious to meet me im afraid ive never been a devout anything what have i got to do with all this slowly and with the obvious enjoyment of a man unburdening himself of a heavy longhoarded secret dr khan told him apostate record poole hello frankso youve finally met ted yes you could call him a crank if you define that as an enthusiast with no sense of humor but cranks often get that way because they know a big truth can you hear my capitals and no one will listenim glad you did and i suggest you take him quite seriously you said you were surprised to see a popes portrait prominently displayed in teds apartment that would have been his hero pius xx im sure i mentioned him to you look him up hes usually called the impius its a fascinating story and exactly parallels something that happened just before you were born you must know how mikhail gorbachev the president of the soviet empire brought about its dissolution at the end of the twentieth century by exposing its crimes and excesses he didnt intend to go that far hed hoped to reform it but that was no longer possible well never know if pius xx had the same idea because he was assassinated by a demented cardinal soon after hed horrified the world by releasing the secret files of the inquisition the religious were still shaken by the discovery of tma zero only a few decades earlier that had a great impact on pius xx and certainly influenced his actions but you still havent told me how ted that old cryptodeist thinks you can help him in his search for god i believe hes still mad at him for hiding so successfully better not say i told you that on second thoughts why not love indra store transmit miss pringle record hello indra ive had another session with dr ted though ive still not told him just why you think hes angry with god but ive had some very interesting arguments no dialogues with him though he does most of the talking never thought id get into philosophy again after all these years of engineering perhaps i had to go through them first to appreciate it wonder how hed grade me as a student yesterday i tried this line of approach to see his reaction perhaps its original though i doubt it thought youd like to hear it will be interested in your comments heres our discussion miss pringle copy audio surely ted you cant deny that most of the greatest works of human art have been inspired by religious devotion doesnt that prove something yes but not in a way that will give much comfort to any believers from time to time people amuse themselves making lists of the biggests and greatests and bests im sure that was a popular entertainment in your day it certainly was well there have been some famous attempts to do this with the arts of course such lists cant establish absolute eternal values but theyre interesting and show how tastes change from age to age the last list i saw it was on the earth artnet only a few years ago was divided into architecture music visual artsi remember a few of the examplesthe parthenon the taj mahalbachs toccata and fugue was first in music followed by verdis requiem mass in art the mona lisa of course then not sure of the order a group of buddha statues somewhere in ceylon and the golden deathmask of young king tut even if i could remember all the others which of course i cant it doesnt matter the important thing is their cultural and religious backgrounds overall no single religion dominated except in music and that could be due to a purely technological accident the organ and the other preelectronic musical instruments were perfected in the christianized west it could have worked out quite differentlyif for example the greeks or the chinese had regarded machines as something more than toys but what really settles the argument as far as im concerned is the general consensus about the single greatest work of human art over and over again in almost every listing its angkor wat yet the religion that inspired that has been extinct for centuries no one even knows precisely what it was except that it involved hundreds of gods not merely one wish i could have thrown that at dear old rabbi berenstein im sure hed have had a good answer i dont doubt it i wish i could have met him myself and im glad he never lived to see what happened to israel end audio there you have it indra wish the grannymede had angkor wat on its menu ive never seen it but you cant have everything now the question you really wanted answeredwhy is dr ted so delighted that im here as you know hes convinced that the key to many mysteries lies on europa where no one has been allowed to land for a thousand years he thinks i may be an exception he believes i have a friend there yes dave bowman or whatever hes now become we know that he survived being drawn into the big brother monolith and somehow revisited earth afterwards but theres more that i didnt know very few people do because the medes are embarrassed to talk about it ted khan has spent years collecting the evidence and is now quite certain of the facts even though he cant explain them on at least six occasions about a century apart reliable observers here in anubis have reported seeing an apparition just like the one that heywood floyd met aboard discovery though not one of them knew about that incident they were all able to identify dave when they were shown his hologram and there was another sighting aboard a survey ship that made a close approach to europa six hundred years ago individually no one would take these cases seriously but altogether they make a pattern teds quite sure that dave bowman survives in some form presumably associated with the monolith we call the great wall and he still has some interest in our affairs though hes made no attempt at communication ted hopes we can make contact he believes that im the only human who can do it im still trying to make up my mind tomorrow ill talk it over with captain chandler will let you know what we decide love frank store transmit indra quarantine do you believe in ghosts dim certainly not but like every sensible man im afraid of them why do you ask if it wasnt a ghost it was the most vivid dream ive ever had last night i had a conversation with dave bowman poole knew that captain chandler would take him seriously when the occasion required nor was he disappointed interesting but theres an obvious explanation youve been living here in the bowman suite for deuss sake you told me yourself it feels haunted im sure well ninetynine per cent sure that youre right and the whole thing was prompted by the discussions ive been having with prof ted have you heard the reports that dave bowman occasionally appears in anubis about once every hundred years just as he did to dr floyd aboard discovery after shed been reactivated what happened there ive heard vague stories but never taken them seriously dr khan does and so do i ive seen the original recordings floyds sitting in my old chair when a kind of dustcloud forms behind him and shapes itself into dave though only the head has detail then it gives that famous message warning him to leave who wouldnt have but that was a thousand years ago plenty of time to fake it what would be the point khan and i were looking at it yesterday id bet my life its authentic as a matter of fact i agree with you and i have heard those reports chandlers voice trailed away and he looked slightly embarrassed long time ago i had a girlfriend here in anubis she told me that her grandfather had seen bowman i laughed i wonder if ted has that sighting on his list could you put him in touch with your friend er rather not we havent spoken for years for all i know she may be on the moon or marsanyway why is professor ted interested thats what i really wanted to discuss with you sounds ominous go ahead ted thinks that dave bowman or whatever hes become may still exist up there on europa after a thousand years well look at me one sample is poor statistics my maths prof used to say but go on its a complicated story or maybe a jigsaw with most of the pieces missing but its generally agreed that something crucial happened to our ancestors when that monolith appeared in africa four million years ago it marks a turning point in prehistory the first appearance of tools and weapons and religionthat cant be pure coincidence the monolith must have done something to us surely it couldnt have just stood there passively accepting worship teds fond of quoting a famous paleontologist who said tma zero gave us an evolutionary kick in the pants he argues that the kick wasnt in a wholly desirable direction did we have to become so mean and nasty to survive maybe we didas i understand him ted believes that theres something fundamentally wrong with the wiring of our brains which makes us incapable of consistent logical thinking to make matters worse though all creatures need a certain amount of aggressiveness to survive we seem to have far more than is absolutely necessary and no other animal tortures its fellows as we do is this an evolutionary accident a piece of genetic bad luck its also widely agreed that tma one was planted on the moon to keep track of the project experiment whatever it was and to report to jupiter the obvious place for solar system mission control thats why another monolith big brother was waiting there had been waiting four million years when discovery arrived agreed so far yes ive always thought that was the most plausible theory now for the more speculative stuff bowman was apparently swallowed up by big brother yet something of his personality seems to have survived twenty years after that encounter with heywood floyd in the second jupiter expedition they had another contact aboard universe when floyd joined it for the rendezvous with halleys comet at least so he tells us in his memoirs though he was well over a hundred when he dictated them could have been senile not according to all the contemporary accounts also perhaps even more significant his grandson chris had some equally weird experiences when galaxy made its forced landing on europa and of course thats where the monolith or a monolith is right now surrounded by europans im beginning to see what dr teds driving at this is where we came in the whole cycles starting over again the europs are being groomed for stardom exactly everything fits jupiter ignited to give them a sun to thaw out their frozen world the warning to us to keep our distance presumably so that we wouldnt interfere with their development where have i heard that idea before of course frank it goes back a thousand years to your own time the prime directive we still get lots of laughs from those old star trek programs did i ever tell you i once met some of the actors they would have been surprised to see me nowand ive always had two thoughts about that noninterference policy the monolith certainly violated it with us back there in africa one might argue that did have disastrous results so better luck next time on europa poole laughed without much humor khan used those exact words and what does he think we should do about it above all where do you come into the picture first of all we must find whats really happening on europa and why merely observing it from space is not enough what else can we do all the probes the medes have sent there were blown up just before landing and ever since the mission to rescue galaxy crewcarrying ships have been diverted by some field of force which no one can figure out very interesting it proves that whatever is down there is protective but not malevolent and this is the important point it must have some way of scanning whats on the way it can distinguish between robots and humans more than i can do sometimes go on well ted thinks theres one human being who might make it down to the surface of europa because his old friend is there and may have some influence with the powersthatbe captain dimitri chandler gave a long low whistle and youre willing to risk it yes what have i got to lose one valuable shuttle craft if i know what you have in mind is that why youve been learning to fly falcon well now that you mention itthe idea had occurred to me ill have to think it over ill admit im intrigued but there are lots of problems knowing you im sure they wont stand in the way once youve decided to help me venture miss pringle list priority messages from earth record dear indra im not trying to be dramatic but this may be my last message from ganymede by the time you receive it i will be on my way to europa though its a sudden decision and no one is more surprised than i am ive thought it over very carefully as youll have guessed ted khan is largely responsiblelet him do the explaining if i dont come back please dont misunderstand me in no way do i regard this as a suicide mission but im ninety per cent convinced by teds arguments and hes aroused my curiosity so much that id never forgive myself if i turned down this onceinalifetime opportunity maybe i should say once in two lifetimes im flying goliaths little oneperson shuttle falcon how id have loved to demonstrate her to my old colleagues back at the space administration judging by past records the most likely outcome is that ill be diverted away from europa before i can land even this will teach me something and if it presumably the local monolith the great wall decides to treat me like the robot probes its zapped in the past ill never know thats a risk im prepared to take thank you for everything and my very best to joe love from ganymede and soon i hope from europa store transmit iv the kingdom of sulphur falcon europas about four hundred thousand kay from ganymede at the moment captain chandler informed poole if you stepped on the gas thanks for teaching me that phrase falcon could get you there in an hour but i wouldnt recommend it our mysterious friend might be alarmed by anyone coming in that fast agreed and i want time to think im going to take several hours at least and im still hoping pooles voice trailed off into silence hoping what that i can make some sort of contact with dave or whatever it is before i attempt to land yes its always rude to drop in uninvited even with people you know let alone perfect strangers like the europs perhaps you should take some gifts what did the oldtime explorers use i believe mirrors and beads were once popular chandlers facetious tone did not disguise his real concern both for poole and for the valuable piece of equipment he proposed to borrow and for which the skipper of goliath was ultimately responsible im still trying to decide how we work this if you come back a hero i want to bask in your reflected glory but if you lose falcon as well as yourself what shall i say that you stole the shuttle while we werent looking im afraid no one would buy that story ganymede traffic controls very efficient has to be if you left without advance notice theyd be on to you in a microsec well a millisecond no way you could leave unless i file your flightplan ahead of time so this is what i propose to do unless i think of something better youre taking falcon out for a final qualification test everyone knows youve already soloed youll go into a twothousandkilometerhigh orbit above europa nothing unusual about that people do it all the time and the local authorities dont seem to object estimated total flight time five hours plus or minus ten minutes if you suddenly change your mind about coming home no one can do anything about it at least no one on ganymede of course ill make some indignant noises and say how astonished i am by such gross navigational errors etc etc whatever will look best in the subsequent court of enquiry would it come to that i dont want to do anything that will get you into trouble dont worry its time there was a little excitement round here but only you and i know about this plot try not to mention it to the crew i want them to have what was that other useful expression you taught me plausible deniability thanks dim i really appreciate what youre doing and i hope youll never have to regret hauling me aboard goliath out round neptune poole found it hard to avoid arousing suspicion by the way he behaved towards his new crewmates as they prepared falcon for what was supposed to be a short routine flight only he and chandler knew that it might be nothing of the kind yet he was not heading into the totally unknown as he and dave bowman had done a thousand years ago stored in the shuttles memory were highresolution maps of europa showing details down to a few meters across he knew exactly where he wished to go it only remained to see if he would be allowed to break the centurieslong quarantine escape manual control please are you sure frank quite sure falconthank you illogical though it seemed most of the human race had found it impossible not to be polite to its artificial children however simpleminded they might be whole volumes of psychology as well as popular guides had been written on the subject of manmachine etiquette long ago it had been decided that however inconsequential rudeness to robots might appear to be it should be discouraged all too easily it could spread to human relationships as well falcon was now in orbit just as her flightplan had promised at a safe two thousand kilometers above europa the giant moons crescent dominated the sky ahead and even the area not illuminated by lucifer was so brilliantly lit by the much more distant sun that every detail was clearly visible poole needed no optical aid to see his planned destination on the stillicy shore of the sea of galilee not far from the skeleton of the first spacecraft to land on this world though the europans had long ago removed all its metal components the illfated chinese ship still served as a memorial to its crew and it was appropriate that the only town even if an alien one on this whole world should have been named tsienville poole had decided to come down over the sea and then fly very slowly towards tsienville hoping that this approach would appear friendly or at least nonaggressive though he admitted to himself that this was very naive he could think of no better alternative then suddenly just as he was dropping below the thousandkilometer level there was an interruption not of the kind he had hoped for but one which he had been expecting this is ganymede control calling falcon you have departed from your flightplan please advise immediately what is happening it was hard to ignore such an urgent request but in the circumstances it seemed the best thing to do exactly thirty seconds later and a hundred kilometers closer to europa ganymede repeated its message once again poole ignored it but falcon did not are you quite sure you want to do this frank asked the shuttle though poole knew perfectly well that he was imagining it he would have sworn there was a note of anxiety in its voice quite sure falcon i know exactly what im doing that was certainly untrue and any moment now further lying might be necessary to a more sophisticated audience seldomactivated indicator lights started to flash near the edge of the control board poole smiled with satisfaction everything was going according to plan this is ganymede control do you receive me falcon you are operating on manual override so i am unable to assist you what is happening you are still descending towards europa please acknowledge immediately poole began to experience mild twinges of conscience he thought he recognized the controllers voice and was almost certain that it was a charming lady he had met at a reception given by the mayor soon after his arrival at anubis she sounded genuinely alarmed suddenly he knew how to relieve her anxiety as well as to attempt something which he had previously dismissed as altogether too absurd perhaps after all it was worth a try it certainly wouldnt do any harm and it might even work this is frank poole calling from falcon i am perfectly ok but something seems to have taken over the controls and is bringing the shuttle down towards europa i hope you are receiving this i will continue to report as long as possible well he hadnt actually lied to the worried controller and one day he hoped he would be able to face her with a clear conscience he continued to talk trying to sound as if he was completely sincere instead of skirting the edge of truth this is frank poole aboard the shuttle falcon descending towards europa i assume that some outside force has taken charge of my spacecraft and will be landing it safely dave this is your old shipmate frank are you the entity that is controlling me i have reason to think that you are on europa if so i look forward to meeting you wherever or whatever you are not for a moment did he imagine there would be any reply even ganymede control appeared to be shocked into silence and yet in a way he had an answer falcon was still being permitted to descend towards the sea of galilee europa was only fifty kilometers below with his naked eyes poole could now see the narrow black bar where the greatest of the monoliths stood guard if indeed it was doing that on the outskirts of tsienville no human being had been allowed to come so close for a thousand years fire in the deep for millions of years it had been an ocean world its hidden waters protected from the vacuum of space by a crust of ice in most places the ice was kilometers thick but there were lines of weakness where it had cracked open and torn apart then there had been a brief battle between two implacably hostile elements that came into direct contact on no other world in the solar system the war between sea and space always ended in the same stalemate the exposed water simultaneously boiled and froze repairing the armor of ice the seas of europa would have frozen completely solid long ago without the influence of nearby jupiter its gravity continually kneaded the core of the little world the forces that convulsed io were also working there though with much less ferocity everywhere in the deep was evidence of that tugofwar between planet and satellite in the continual roar and thunder of submarine earthquakes the shriek of gases escaping from the interior the infrasonic pressure waves of avalanches sweeping over the abyssal plains by comparison with the tumultuous ocean that covered europa even the noisy seas of earth were muted here and there scattered over the deserts of the deep were oases that would have amazed and delighted any terrestrial biologist they extended for several kilometers around tangled masses of pipes and chimneys deposited by mineral brines gushing from the interior often they created natural parodies of gothic castles from which black scalding liquids pulsed in a slow rhythm as if driven by the beating of some mighty heart and like blood they were the authentic sign of life itself the boiling fluids drove back the deadly cold leaking down from above and formed islands of warmth on the seabed equally important they brought from europas interior all the chemicals of life such fertile oases offering food and energy in abundance had been discovered by the twentiethcentury explorers of earths oceans here they were present on an immensely larger scale and in far greater variety delicate spidery structures that seemed to be the analogue of plants flourished in the tropical zones closest to the sources of heat crawling among these were bizarre slugs and worms some feeding on the plants others obtaining their food directly from the mineralladen waters around them at greater distances from the submarine fires around which all these creatures warmed themselves lived sturdier more robust organisms not unlike crabs or spiders armies of biologists could have spent lifetimes studying one small oasis unlike the paleozoic terrestrial seas the europan abyss was not a stable environment so evolution had progressed with astonishing speed producing multitudes of fantastic forms and all were under the same indefinite stay of execution sooner or later each fountain of life would weaken and die as the forces that powered it moved their focus elsewhere all across the europan seabed was evidence of such tragedies countless circular areas were littered with the skeletons and mineralencrusted remains of dead creatures where entire chapters of evolution had been deleted from the book of life some had left as their only memorial huge empty shells like convoluted trumpets larger than a man and there were clams of many shapes bivalves and even trivalves as well as spiral stone patterns many meters across exactly like the beautiful ammonites that disappeared so mysteriously from earths oceans at the end of the cretaceous period among the greatest wonders of the europan abyss were rivers of incandescent lava pouring from the calderas of submarine volcanoes the pressure at these depths was so great that the water in contact with the redhot magma could not flash into steam so the two liquids coexisted in an uneasy truce there on another world and with alien actors something like the story of egypt had been played out long before the coming of man as the nile had brought life to a narrow ribbon of desert so this river of warmth had vivified the europan deep along its banks in a band never more than a few kilometers wide species after species had evolved and flourished and passed away and some had left permanent monuments often they were not easy to distinguish from the natural formations around the thermal vents and even when they were clearly not due to pure chemistry one would be hard put to decide whether they were the product of instinct or intelligence on earth the termites reared condominiums almost as impressive as any found in the single vast ocean that enveloped this frozen world along the narrow band of fertility in the deserts of the deep whole cultures and even civilizations might have risen and fallen armies might have marched or swum under the command of europan tamberlanes or napoleons and the rest of their world would never have known for all their oases were as isolated from one another as the planets themselves the creatures who basked in the glow of the lava rivers and fed around the hot vents could not cross the hostile wilderness between their lonely islands if they had ever produced historians and philosophers each culture would have been convinced that it was alone in the universe yet even the space between the oases was not altogether empty of life there were hardier creatures who had dared its rigors some were the europan analogues of fish streamlined torpedoes propelled by vertical tails steered by fins along their bodies the resemblance to the most successful dwellers in earths oceans was inevitable given the same engineering problems evolution must produce very similar answers witness the dolphin and the shark superficially almost identical yet from far distant branches of the tree of life there was however one very obvious difference between the fish of the europan seas and those in terrestrial oceans they had no gills for there was hardly a trace of oxygen to be extracted from the waters in which they swam like the creatures around earths own geothermal vents their metabolism was based on sulfur compounds present in abundance in this volcanic environment and very few had eyes apart from the flickering glow of lava outpourings and occasional bursts of bioluminescence from creatures seeking mates or hunters questing prey it was a lightless world it was also a doomed one not only were its energy sources sporadic and constantly shifting but the tidal forces that drove them were steadily weakening even if they developed true intelligence the europans were trapped between fire and ice barring a miracle they would perish with the final freezing of their little world lucifer had wrought that miracle tsienville in the final moments as he came in over the coast at a sedate hundred kilometers an hour poole wondered if there might be some lastminute intervention but nothing untoward happened even when he moved slowly along the black forbidding face of the great wall it was the inevitable name for the europa monolith as unlike its little brothers on earth and moon it was lying horizontally and was more than twenty kilometers long although it was literally billions of times greater in volume than tma zero and tma one its proportions were exactly the same that intriguing ratio inspirer of so much numerological nonsense over the centuries as the vertical face was almost ten kilometers high one plausible theory maintained that among its other functions the great wall served as a windbreak protecting tsienville from the ferocious gales that occasionally roared in from the sea of galilee they were much less frequent now that the climate had stabilized but a thousand years earlier they would have been a severe discouragement to any lifeforms emerging from the ocean though he had fully intended to do so poole had never found time to visit the tycho monolith still top secret when he had left for jupiter and earths gravity made its twin at olduvai inaccessible to him but he had seen their images so often that they were much more familiar than the proverbial back of the hand apart from the enormous difference in scale there was absolutely no way of distinguishing the great wall from tma one and tma zero or for that matter the big brother monolith that discovery and the leonov had encountered orbiting jupiter according to some theories perhaps crazy enough to be true there was only one archetypal monolith and all the others whatever their size were merely projections or images of it poole recalled these ideas when he noticed the spotless unsullied smoothness of the great walls towering ebon face surely after so many centuries in such a hostile environment it should have collected a few patches of grime yet it looked as immaculate as if an army of windowcleaners had just polished every square centimeter then he recalled that although everyone who had ever come to view tma one and tma zero felt an irresistible urge to touch their apparently pristine surfaces no one had ever succeeded fingers diamond drills laser knives all skittered across the monoliths as if they were coated by an impenetrable film or as if and this was another popular theory they were not quite in this universe but somehow separated from it by an utterly impassable fraction of a millimeter he made one complete leisurely circuit of the great wall which remained totally indifferent to his progress then he brought the shuttle still on manual in case ganymede control made any further attempts to rescue him to the outer limits of tsienville and hovered there looking for the best place to land the scene through falcons small panoramic window was wholly familiar to him he had examined it so often in ganymede recordings never imagining that one day he would be observing it in reality the europs it seemed had no idea of town planning hundreds of hemispherical structures were scattered apparently at random over an area about a kilometer across some were so small that even human children would feel cramped in them though others were big enough to hold a large family none was more than five meters high and they were all made from the same material which gleamed a ghostly white in the double daylight on earth the esquimaux had found the identical answer to the challenge of their own frigid materialspoor environment tsienvilles igloos were also made of ice in lieu of streets there were canals as best suited creatures who were still amphibious and apparently returned to the water to sleep also it was believed to feed and to mate though neither hypothesis had been proved tsienville had been called venice made of ice and poole had to agree that it was an apt description however there were no venetians in sight the place looked as if it had been deserted for years and here was another mystery despite the fact that lucifer was fifty times brighter than the distant sun and was a permanent fixture in the sky the europs still seemed locked to an ancient rhythm of night and day they returned to the ocean at sunset and emerged with the rising of the sun despite the fact that the level of illumination had changed by only a few per cent perhaps there was a parallel on earth where the life cycles of many creatures were controlled as much by the feeble moon as the far more brilliant sun it would be sunrise in another hour and then the inhabitants of tsienville would return to land and go about their leisurely affairs as by human standards they certainly were the sulfurbased biochemistry that powered the europs was not as efficient as the oxygendriven one that energized the vast majority of terrestrial animals even a sloth could outrun a europ so it was difficult to regard them as potentially dangerous that was the good news the bad news was that even with the best intentions on both sides attempts at communication would be extremely slow perhaps intolerably tedious it was about time poole decided that he reported back to ganymede control they must be getting very anxious and he wondered how his coconspirator captain chandler was dealing with the situation falcon calling ganymede as you can doubtless see i have er been brought to rest just above tsienville there is no sign of hostility and as its still solar night here all the europs are underwater will call you again as soon as im on the ground dim would have been proud of him poole thought as he brought falcon down gently as a snowflake on a smooth patch of ice he was taking no chances with its stability and set the inertial drive to cancel all but a fraction of the shuttles weight just enough he hoped to prevent it being blown away by any wind he was on europa the first human in a thousand years had armstrong and aldrin felt this sense of elation when eagle touched down on the moon probably they were too busy checking their lunar modules primitive and totally unintelligent systems falcon of course was doing all this automatically the little cabin was now very quiet apart from the inevitable and reassuring murmur of welltempered electronics it gave poole a considerable shock when chandlers voice obviously prerecorded interrupted his thoughts so you made it congratulations as you know were scheduled to return to the belt week after next but that should give you plenty of time after five days falcon knows what to do shell find her way home with or without you so good luck miss pringle activate crypto program store hello dim thanks for that cheerful message i feel rather silly using this program as if im a secret agent in one of the spy melodramas that used to be so popular before i was born still it will allow some privacy which may be useful hope miss pringle has downloaded it properlyof course miss p im only joking by the way im getting a barrage of requests from all the news media in the solar system please try to hold them off or divert them to dr ted hell enjoy handling them since ganymede has me on camera all the time i wont waste breath telling you what im seeing if all goes well we should have some action in a few minutes and well know if it really was a good idea to let the europs find me already sitting here peacefully waiting to greet them when they come to the surface whatever happens it wont be as big a surprise to me as it was to dr chang and his colleagues when they landed here a thousand years ago i played his famous last message again just before leaving ganymede i must confess it gave me an eerie feeling couldnt help wondering if something like that could possibly happen againwouldnt like to immortalize myself the way poor chang did of course i can always lift off if something starts going wrongand heres an interesting thought thats just occurred to mei wonder if the europs have any history any kind of recordsany memory of what happened just a few kilometers from here a thousand years ago ice and vacuum this is dr chang calling from europa i hope you can hear me especially dr floyd i know youre aboard leonovi may not have much timeaiming my suit antenna where i think you areplease relay this information to earth tsien was destroyed three hours ago im the only survivor using my suit radio no idea if it has enough range but its the only chance please listen carefully there is life on europa i repeat there is life on europa we landed safely checked all the systems and ran out the hoses so we could start pumping water into our propellant tanks immediatelyjust in case we had to leave in a hurry everything was going according to planit seemed almost too good to be true the tanks were half full when dr lee and i went out to check the pipe insulation tsien stands stood about thirty meters from the edge of the grand canal pipes went directly from it and down through the ice very thin not safe to walk on jupiter was quarter full and we had five kilowatts of lighting strung up on the ship she looked like a christmas tree beautiful reflected on the ice lee saw it first a huge dark mass rising up from the depths at first we thought it was a school of fish too large for a single organism then it started to break through the ice and began moving towards us it looked rather like huge strands of wet seaweed crawling along the ground lee ran back to the ship to get a camera i stayed to watch reporting over the radio the thing moved so slowly i could easily outrun it i was much more excited than alarmed thought i knew what kind of creature it was ive seen pictures of the kelp forests off california but i was quite wrong i could tell it was in trouble it couldnt possibly survive at a temperature a hundred and fifty below its normal environment it was freezing solid as it moved forward bits were breaking off like glass but it was still advancing towards the ship a black tidal wave slowing down all the time i was still so surprised that i couldnt think straight and i couldnt imagine what it was trying to do even though it was heading towards tsien it still seemed completely harmless like well a small forest on the move i remember smiling it reminded me of macbeths birnam wood then i suddenly realized the danger even if it was completely inoffensive it was heavy with all the ice it was carrying it must have weighed several tons even in this low gravity and it was slowly painfully climbing up our landing gearthe legs were beginning to buckle all in slow motion like something in a dream or a nightmare not until the ship started to topple did i realize what the thing was trying to do and then it was far too late we could have saved ourselves if wed only switched off our lights perhaps its a phototrope its biological cycle triggered by the sunlight that filters down through the ice or it could have been attracted like a moth to a candle our floodlights must have been more brilliant than anything that europa has ever known even the sun itself then the ship crashed i saw the hull split a cloud of snowflakes form as moisture condensed all the lights went out except for one swinging back and forth on a cable a couple of meters above the ground i dont know what happened immediately after that the next thing i remember i was standing under the light beside the wreck of the ship with a fine powdering of fresh snow all around me i could see my footsteps in it very clearly i must have run there perhaps only a minute or two had elapsed the plant i still thought of it as a plant was motionless i wondered if it had been damaged by the impact large sections as thick as a mans arms had splintered off like broken twigs then the main trunk started to move again it pulled away from the hull and began to crawl towards me that was when i knew for certain that the thing was lightsensitive i was standing immediately under the thousandwatt lamp which had stopped swinging now imagine an oak tree better still a banyan with its multiple trunks and roots flattened out by gravity and trying to creep along the ground it got to within five meters of the light then started to spread out until it had made a perfect circle around me presumably that was the limit of its tolerance the point at which photoattraction turned to repulsion after that nothing happened for several minutes i wondered if it was dead frozen solid at last then i saw that large buds were forming on many of the branches it was like watching a timelapse film of flowers opening in fact i thought they were flowers each about as big as a mans head delicate beautifully colored membranes started to unfold even then it occurred to me that no one no thing could ever have seen these colors properly until we brought our lights our fatal lights to this world tendrils stamens waving feeblyi walked over to the living wall that surrounded me so that i could see exactly what was happening neither then or at any other time had i felt the slightest fear of the creature i was certain that it was not malevolent if indeed it was conscious at all there were scores of the big flowers in various stages of unfolding now they reminded me of butterflies just emerging from the chrysalis wings crumpled still feeble i was getting closer and closer to the truth but they were freezing dying as quickly as they formed then one after another they dropped off from the parent buds for a few moments they flopped around like fish stranded on dry land and at last i realized exactly what they were those membranes werent petals they were fins or their equivalent this was the freeswimming larval stage of the creature probably it spends much of its life rooted on the seabed then sends these mobile offspring in search of new territory just like the corals of earths oceans i knelt down to get a closer look at one of the little creatures the beautiful colors were fading now to a drab brown some of the petalfins had snapped off becoming brittle shards as they froze but it was still moving feebly and as i approached it tried to avoid me i wondered how it sensed my presence then i noticed that the stamens as id called them all carried bright blue dots at their tips they looked like tiny star sapphires or the blue eyes along the mantle of a scallop aware of light but unable to form true images as i watched the vivid blue faded the gems became dull ordinary stones dr floyd or anyone else who is listening i havent much more time my lifesupport system alarm has just sounded but ive almost finished i knew then what i had to do the cable to that thousandwatt lamp was hanging almost to the ground i gave it a few tugs and the light went out in a shower of sparks i wondered whether it was too late for a few minutes nothing happened so i walked over to the wall of tangled branches around me and kicked it slowly the creature started to unweave itself and to retreat back to the canal i followed it all the way back to the water encouraging it with more kicks when it slowed down feeling the fragments of ice crunching all the time beneath my bootsas it neared the canal it seemed to gain strength and energy as if it knew it was approaching its natural home i wondered if it would survive to bud again it disappeared through the surface leaving a few last dead larvae on the alien land the exposed free water bubbled for a few minutes until a scab of protective ice sealed it from the vacuum above then i walked back to the ship to see if there was anything to salvage i dont want to talk about that ive only two requests to make doctor when the taxonomists classify this creature i hope theyll name it after me and when the next ship comes home ask them to take our bones back to china ill lose power in a few minutes wish i knew whether anyone was receiving me anyway ill repeat this message as long as i can this is professor chang on europa reporting the destruction of the spaceship tsien we landed beside the grand canal and set up our pumps at the edge of the ice the little dawn miss pringle record here comes the sun strange how quickly it seems to rise on this slowly turning world of course of course the discs so small that the whole of it pops above the horizon in no timenot that it makes much difference to the light if you werent looking in that direction youd never notice that there was another sun in the sky but i hope the europs have noticed usually it takes them less than five minutes to start coming ashore after the little dawn wonder if they already know im here and are scared no could be the other way round perhaps theyre inquisitive even anxious to see what strange visitor has come to tsienvillei rather hope so here they come hope your spysats are watching falcons cameras recording how slowly they move im afraid its going to be very boring trying to communicate with themeven if they want to talk to me rather like the thing that overturned tsien but much smallerthey remind me of little trees walking on half a dozen slender trunks and with hundreds of branches dividing into twigs which divide againand again just like many of our generalpurpose robotswhat a long time it took us to realize that imitation humanoids were ridiculously clumsy and the proper way to go was with myriad of small manipulators whenever we invent something clever we find that mother natures already thought of it arent the little ones cute like tiny bushes on the move wonder how they reproduce budding i hadnt realized how beautiful they are almost as colorful as coral reef fish maybe for the same reasonsto attract mates or fool predators by pretending to be something else did i say they looked like bushes make that rosebushes theyve actually got thorns must have a good reason for them im disappointed they dont seem to have noticed me theyre all heading into town as if a visiting spacecraft was an everyday occurrenceonly a few leftmaybe this will work i suppose they can detect sound vibrations most marine creatures can though this atmosphere may be too thin to carry my voice very far falcon external speaker hello can you hear me my name is frank pooleahemi come in peace for all mankind makes me feel rather stupid but can you suggest anything better and it will be good for the record nobodys taking the slightest notice big ones and little ones theyre all creeping towards their igloos wonder what they actually do when they get there perhaps i should follow im sure it would be perfectly safe i can move so much faster ive just had an amusing flashback all these creatures going in the same direction they look like the commuters who used to surge back and forth twice a day between home and office before electronics made it unnecessary lets try again before they all disappear hello there this is frank poole a visitor from planet earth can you hear me i hear you frank this is dave the ghosts in the machine frank pooles immediate reaction was one of utter astonishment followed by overwhelming joy he had never really believed that he would make any kind of contact either with the europs or the monolith indeed he had even had fantasies of kicking in frustration against that towering ebon wall and shouting angrily is there anybody home yet he should not have been so amazed some intelligence must have monitored his approach from ganymede and permitted him to land he should have taken ted khan more seriously dave he said slowly is that really you who else could it be a part of his mind asked yet it was not a foolish question there was something curiously mechanical impersonal about the voice that came from the small speaker on falcons control board yes frank i am dave there was a very brief pause then the same voice continued without any change of intonation hello frank this is hal miss pringle record well indra dim im glad i recorded all that otherwise youd never believe me i guess im still in a state of shock first of all how should i feel about someone who tried to who did kill me even if it was a thousand years ago but i understand now that hal wasnt to blame nobody was theres a very good piece of advice ive often found useful never attribute to malevolence what is merely due to incompetence i cant feel any anger towards a bunch of programmers i never knew whove been dead for centuries im glad this is encrypted as i dont know how it should be handled and a lot that i tell you may turn out to be complete nonsense im already suffering from information overload and had to ask dave to leave me for a while after all the trouble ive gone through to meet him but i dont think i hurt his feelings i m not sure yet if he has any feelings what is he good question well he really is dave bowman but with most of the humanity stripped away like ah like the synopsis of a book or a technical paper you know how an abstract can give all the basic information but no hint of the authors personality yet there were moments when i felt that something of the old dave was still there i wouldnt go so far as to say hes pleased to meet me again moderately satisfied might be more like itfor myself im still very confused like meeting an old friend after a long separation and finding that theyre now a different person well it has been a thousand years and i cant imagine what experiences hes known though as ill show you presently hes tried to share some of them with me and hal hes here too without question most of the time theres no way i can tell which of them is speaking to me arent there examples of multiple personalities in the medical records maybe its something like that i asked him how this had happened to them both and he they dammit halman tried to explain let me repeat i may have got it partly wrong but its the only working hypothesis i have of course the monolith in its various manifestations is the key no thats the wrong word didnt someone once say it was a kind of cosmic swiss army knife you still have them ive noticed though both switzerland and its army disappeared centuries ago its a generalpurpose device that can do anything it wants to or was programmed to do back in africa four million years ago it gave us that evolutionary kick in the pants for better or for worse then its sibling on the moon waited for us to climb out of the cradle that weve already guessed and daves confirmed it i said that he doesnt have many human feelings but he still has curiosity he wants to learn and what an opportunity hes had when the jupiter monolith absorbed him cant think of a better word it got more than it bargained for though it used him apparently as a captured specimen and a probe to investigate earth hes also been using it with hals assistance and who should understand a supercomputer better than another one hes been exploring its memory and trying to find its purpose now this is something thats very hard to believe the monolith is a fantastically powerful machine look what it did to jupiter but its no more than that its running on automatic it has no consciousness i remember once thinking that i might have to kick the great wall and shout is there anyone there and the correct answer would have to be no one except dave and hal worse still some of its systems may have started to fail dave even suggests that in a fundamental way its become stupid perhaps its been left on its own for too long its time for a service check and he believes the monolith has made at least one misjudgment perhaps thats not the right word it may have been deliberate carefully considered in any event its well truly awesome and terrifying in its implications luckily i can show it to you so you can decide for yourselves yes even though it happened a thousand years ago when leonov flew the second mission to jupiter and all this time no one has ever guessed im certainly glad you got me fitted with the braincap of course its been invaluable i cant imagine life without it but now its doing a job it was never designed for and doing it remarkably well it took halman about ten minutes to find how it worked and to set up an interface now we have mindtomind contact which is quite a strain on me i can tell you i have to keep asking them to slow down and use babytalk or should i say babythink im not sure how well this will come through its a thousandyearold recording of daves own experience somehow stored in the monoliths enormous memory then retrieved by dave and injected into my braincap dont ask me exactly how and finally transferred and beamed to you by ganymede central phew hope you dont get a headache downloading it over to dave bowman at jupiter early twentyfirst century foamscape the millionkilometerlong tendrils of magnetic force the sudden explosion of radio waves the geysers of electrified plasma wider than the planet earth they were as real and clearly visible to him as the clouds banding the planet in multihued glory he could understand the complex pattern of their interactions and realized that jupiter was much more wonderful than anyone had ever guessed even as he fell through the roaring heart of the great red spot with the lightning of its continentwide thunderstorms detonating under him he knew why it had persisted for centuries though it was made of gases far less substantial than those that formed the hurricanes of earth the thin scream of hydrogen wind faded as he sank into the calmer depths and a sheet of waxen snowflakes some already coalescing into barely palpable mountains of hydrocarbon foam descended from the heights above it was already warm enough for liquid water to exist but there were no oceans there this purely gaseous environment was too tenuous to support them he descended through layer after layer of cloud until he entered a region of such clarity that even human vision could have scanned an area more than a thousand kilometers across it was only a minor eddy in the vaster gyre of the great red spot and it held a secret that men had long guessed but never proved skirting the foothills of the drifting foam mountains were myriad of small sharply defined clouds all about the same size and patterned with similar red and brown mottling they were small only as compared with the inhuman scale of their surroundings the very least would have covered a fairsized city they were clearly alive for they were moving with slow deliberation along the flanks of the aerial mountains browsing off their slopes like colossal sheep and they were calling to each other in the meter band their radio voices faint but clear against the cracklings and concussions of jupiter itself nothing less than living gasbags they floated in the narrow zone between freezing heights and scorching depths narrow yes but a domain far larger than all the biosphere of earth they were not alone moving swiftly among them were other creatures so small that they could easily have been overlooked some of them bore an almost uncanny resemblance to terrestrial aircraft and were of about the same size but they too were alive perhaps predators perhaps parasites perhaps even herdsmen a whole new chapter of evolution as alien as that which he had glimpsed on europa was opening before him there were jetpropelled torpedoes like the squids of the terrestrial oceans hunting and devouring the huge gasbags but the balloons were not defenseless some of them fought back with electric thunderbolts and with clawed tentacles like kilometerlong chainsaws there were even stranger shapes exploiting almost every possibility of geometry bizarre translucent kites tetrahedra spheres polyhedra tangles of twisted ribbonsthe gigantic plankton of the jovian atmosphere they were designed to float like gossamer in the uprising currents until they had lived long enough to reproduce then they would be swept down into the depths to be carbonized and recycled in a new generation he was searching a world more than a hundred times the area of earth and though he saw many wonders nothing there hinted of intelligence the radio voices of the great balloons carried only simple messages of warning or of fear even the hunters who might have been expected to develop higher degrees of organization were like the sharks in earths oceans mindless automata and for all its breathtaking size and novelty the biosphere of jupiter was a fragile world a place of mists and foam of delicate silken threads and paperthin tissues spun from the continual snowfall of petrochemicals formed by lightning in the upper atmosphere few of its constructs were more substantial than soap bubbles its most awesome predators could be torn to shreds by even the feeblest of terrestrial carnivores like europa but on a vastly grander scale jupiter was an evolutionary culdesac intelligence would never emerge here even if it did it would be doomed to a stunted existence a purely aerial culture might develop but in an environment where fire was impossible and solids scarcely existed it could never even reach the stone age nursery miss pringle record well indra dim i hope that came through in good shape i still find it hard to believe all those fantastic creatures surely we should have detected their radio voices even if we couldnt understand them wiped out in a moment so that jupiter could be made into a sun and now we can understand why it was to give the europs their chance what pitiless logic is intelligence the only thing that matters i can see some long arguments with ted khan over this the next question is will the europs make the grade or will they remain forever stuck in the kindergarten not even that the nursery though a thousand years is a very short time one would have expected some progress but according to dave theyre exactly the same now as when they left the sea perhaps thats the trouble they still have one foot or one twig in the water and heres another thing we got completely wrong we thought they went back into the water to sleep its just the other way round they go back to eat and sleep when they come on land as we might have guessed from their structure that network of branches theyre plankton feeders i asked dave about the igloos theyve built arent they a technological advance and he said not really theyre only adaptations of structures they make on the seabed to protect themselves from various predators especially something like a flying carpet as big as a football field theres one area though where they have shown initiative even creativity theyre fascinated by metals presumably because they dont exist in pure form in the ocean thats why tsien was stripped the same things happened to the occasional probes that have come down in their territory what do they do with the copper and beryllium and titanium they collect nothing useful im afraid they pile it all together in one place in a fantastic heap that they keep reassembling they could be developing an aesthetic sense ive seen worse in the museum of modern artbut ive got another theory did you ever hear of cargo cults during the twentieth century some of the few primitive tribes that still existed made imitation aeroplanes out of bamboo in the hope of attracting the big birds in the sky that occasionally brought them wonderful gifts perhaps the europs have the same idea now that question you keep asking mewhat is dave and how did he and hal become whatever it is they are now the quick answer of course is that theyre both emulations simulations in the monoliths gigantic memory most of the time theyre inactivated when i asked dave about this he said hed been awake his actual word for only fifty years altogether in the thousand since his er metamorphosis when i asked if he resented this takeover of his life he said why should i resent it i am performing my functions perfectly yes that sounds exactly like hal but i believe it was dave if theres any distinction now remember that swiss army knife analogy halman is one of this cosmic knifes myriad of components but hes not a completely passive tool when hes awake he has some autonomy some independence presumably within limits set by the monoliths overriding control during the centuries hes been used as a kind of intelligent probe to examine jupiter as youve just seen as well as ganymede and the earth that confirms those mysterious events in florida reported by daves old girlfriend and the nurse who was looking after his mother just moments before her deathas well as the encounters in anubis city and it also explains another mystery i asked dave directly why was i allowed to land on europa when everyone else has been turned away for centuries i fully expected to be the answers ridiculously simple the monolith uses dave halman from time to time to keep an eye on us dave knew all about my rescue even saw some of the media interviews i made on earth and on ganymede i must say im still a little hurt he made no attempt to contact me but at least he put out the welcome mat when i did arrive dim i still have fortyeight hours before falcon leaves with or without me i dont think ill need them now ive made contact with halman we can keep in touch just as easily from anubisif he wants to do so and im anxious to get back to the grannymede as quickly as possible falcons a fine little spacecraft but her plumbing could be improved its beginning to smell in here and im itching for a shower look forward to seeing you and especially ted khan we have much to talk about before i return to earth transmit store v termination the toil of all that be heals not the primal fault it rains into the sea and still the sea is salt a e housman more poems a gentleman of leisure on the whole it had been an interesting but uneventful decades punctuated by the joys and sorrows which time and fate bring to all mankind the greatest of those had been wholly unexpected in fact before he left for ganymede poole would have dismissed the very idea as preposterous there is much truth in the saying that absence makes the heart grow fonder when he and indra wallace met again they discovered that despite their bantering and occasional disagreements they were closer than they had imagined one thing led to another including to their mutual joy dawn wallace and martin poole it was rather late in life to start a family quite apart from that little matter of a thousand years and professor anderson had warned them that it might be impossible or even worse you were lucky in more ways than you realize he told poole radiation damage was surprisingly low and we were able to make all essential repairs from your intact dna but until we do some more tests i cant promise genetic integrity so enjoy yourselves but dont start a family until i give the ok the tests had been timeconsuming and as anderson had feared further repairs were necessary there was one major setback something that could never have lived even if it had been allowed to go beyond the first few weeks after conception but martin and dawn were perfect with just the right number of heads arms and legs they were also handsome and intelligent and barely managed to escape being spoiled by their doting parents who continued to be the best of friends when after fifteen years each opted for independence again because of their social achievement rating they would have been permitted indeed encouraged to have another child but they decided not to put any more of a burden on their astonishingly good luck one tragedy had shadowed pooles personal life during this period and indeed had shocked the whole solar community captain chandler and his entire crew had been lost when the nucleus of a comet they were reconnoitering exploded suddenly destroying goliath so completely that only a few fragments were ever located such explosions caused by reactions among unstable molecules which existed at very low temperatures were a wellknown danger to cometcollectors and chandler had encountered several during his career no one would ever know the exact circumstances which caused so experienced a spaceman to be taken by surprise poole missed chandler very badly he had played a unique role in his life and there was no one to replace him no one except dave bowman with whom he had shared so momentous an adventure he and chandler had often made plans to go into space together again perhaps all the way out to the oort cloud with its unknown mysteries and its remote but inexhaustible wealth of ice yet some conflict of schedules had always upset their plans so this was a wishedfor future that would never exist another longdesired goal poole had managed to achieve despite doctors orders he had been down to earth and once was quite enough the vehicle in which he had traveled looked almost identical to the wheelchairs used by the luckier paraplegics of his own time it was motorized and had balloon tires which allowed it to roll over reasonably smooth surfaces however it could also fly at an altitude of about twenty centimeters on an aircushion produced by a set of small but very powerful fans poole was surprised that so primitive a technology was still in use but inertiacontrol devices were too bulky for such smallscale applications seated comfortably in his hoverchair he was scarcely conscious of his increasing weight as he descended into the heart of africa though he did notice some difficulty in breathing he had experienced far worse during his astronaut training what he was not prepared for was the blast of furnaceheat that smote him as he rolled out of the gigantic skypiercing cylinder that formed the base of the tower yet it was still morning what would it be like at noon he had barely accustomed himself to the heat when his sense of smell was assailed a myriad odors none unpleasant but all unfamiliar clamored for his attention he closed his eyes for a few minutes in an attempt to avoid overloading his input circuits before he had decided to open them again he felt some large moist object palpating the back of his neck say hello to elizabeth said his guide a burly young man dressed in traditional great white hunter garb much too smart to have seen any real use shes our official greeter poole twisted round in his chair and found himself looking into the soulful eyes of a baby elephant hello elizabeth he answered rather feebly elizabeth lifted her trunk in salute and emitted a sound not usually heard in polite society though poole felt sure it was wellintentioned altogether he spent less than an hour on planet earth skirting the edge of a jungle whose stunted trees compared unfavorably with skylands and encountering much of the local fauna his guides apologized for the friendliness of the lions who had been spoilt by tourists but the malevolent expressions of the crocodiles more than compensated here was nature raw and unchanged before he returned to the tower poole risked taking a few steps away from his hoverchair he realized that this would be the equivalent of carrying his own weight on his back but that did not seem an impossible feat and he would never forgive himself unless he attempted it it was not a good idea perhaps he should have tried it in a cooler climate after no more than a dozen steps he was glad to sink back into the luxurious clutches of the chair thats enough he said wearily lets go back to the tower as he rolled into the elevator lobby he noticed a sign which he had somehow overlooked during the excitement of his arrival it read welcome to africa in wildness is the preservation of the world henry david thoreau observing pooles interest the guide asked did you know him it was the sort of question poole heard all too often and at the moment he did not feel equipped to deal with it i dont think so he answered wearily as the great doors closed behind them shutting out the sights scents and sounds of mankinds earliest home his vertical safari had satisfied his need to visit earth and he did his best to ignore the various aches and pains acquired there when he returned to his apartment at level a prestigious location even in this democratic society indra however was mildly shocked by his appearance and ordered him straight to bed just like antaeus but in reverse she muttered darkly who asked poole there were times when his wifes erudition was a little overwhelming but he had determined never to let it give him an inferiority complex son of the earth goddess gaea hercules wrestled with him but every time he was thrown to the ground antaeus renewed his strength who won hercules of course by holding antaeus in the air so ma couldnt recharge his batteries well im sure it wont take me long to recharge mine and ive learned one lesson if i dont get more exercise i may have to move up to lunar gravity level pooles good resolution lasted a full month every morning he went for a brisk fivekilometer walk choosing a different level of the africa tower each day some floors were still vast echoing deserts of metal which would probably never be occupied but others had been landscaped and developed over the centuries in a bewildering variety of architectural styles many were borrowings from past ages and cultures others hinted at futures which poole would not care to visit at least there was no danger of boredom and on many of his walks he was accompanied at a respectful distance by small groups of friendly children they were seldom able to keep up with him for long one day as poole was striding down a convincing though sparsely populated imitation of the champs elysees he suddenly spotted a familiar face danil he called the other man took not the slightest notice even when poole called again more loudly dont you remember me danil and now that he had caught up with him poole did not have the slightest doubt of his identity looked genuinely baffled im sorry he said youre commander poole of course but im sure weve never met before now it was pooles turn to be embarrassed stupid of me he apologized must have mistaken you for someone else have a good day he was glad of the encounter and was pleased to know that danil was back in normal society whether his original crime had been axemurders or overdue library books should no longer be the concern of his onetime employer the account had been settled the books closed although poole sometimes missed the copsandrobbers dramas he had often enjoyed in his youth he had grown to accept the current wisdom excessive interest in pathological behavior was itself pathological with the help of miss pringle mk iii poole had been able to schedule his life so that there were even occasional blank moments when he could relax and set his braincap on random search scanning his areas of interest outside his immediate family his chief concerns were still among the moons of jupiterlucifer not least because he was recognized as the leading expert on the subject and a permanent member of the europa committee this had been set up almost a thousand years ago to consider what if anything could and should be done about the mysterious satellite over the centuries it had accumulated a vast amount of information going all the way back to the voyager flybys of and the first detailed surveys from the orbiting galileo spacecraft of like most longlived organizations the europa committee had become slowly fossilized and now met only when there was some new development it had woken up with a start after halmans reappearance and appointed an energetic new chairperson whose first act had been to coopt poole though there was little that he could contribute that was not already recorded poole was very happy to be on the committee it was obviously his duty to make himself available and it also gave him an official position he would otherwise have lacked previously his status was what had once been called a national treasure which he found faintly embarrassing although he was glad to be supported in luxury by a world wealthier than all the dreams of warravaged earlier ages could have imagined he felt the need to justify his existence he also felt another need which he seldom articulated even to himself halman had spoken to him if only briefly at their strange encounter two decades ago poole was certain that if he wished halman could easily do so again were all human contacts no longer of interest to him he hoped that was not the case yet that might be one explanation of his silence he was frequently in touch with theodore khan as active and acerbic as ever and now the europa committees representative on ganymede ever since poole had returned to earth ted had been trying in vain to open a channel of communication with bowman he could not understand why long lists of important questions on subjects of vital philosophical and historic interest received not even brief acknowledgements does the monolith keep your friend halman so busy that he cant talk to me he complained to poole what does he do with his time anyway it was a very reasonable question and the answer came like a thunderbolt out of a cloudless sky from bowman himself as a perfectly commonplace vidphone call contact hello frank this is dave i have a very important message for you i assume that you are now in your suite in africa tower if you are there please identify yourself by giving the name of our instructor in orbital mechanics i will wait for sixty seconds and if there is no reply will try again in exactly one hour that minute was hardly long enough for poole to recover from the shock he felt a brief surge of delight as well as astonishment before another emotion took over glad though he was to hear from bowman again that phrase a very important message sounded distinctly ominous at least it was fortunate poole told himself that hes asked for one of the few names i can remember yet who could forget a scot with a glasgow accent so thick it had taken them a week to master it but he had been a brilliant lecturer once you understood what he was saying dr gregory mcvitty accepted now please switch on your braincap receiver it will take three minutes to download this message do not attempt to monitor i am using tentoone compression i will wait two minutes before starting how is he managing to do this poole wondered jupiterlucifer was now over fifty lightminutes away so this message must have left almost an hour ago it must have been sent with an intelligent agent in a properly addressed package on the ganymedeearth beam but that would have been a trivial feat to halman with the resources he had apparently been able to tap inside the monolith the indicator light on the brainbox was flickering the message was coming through at the compression halman was using it would take half an hour for poole to absorb the message in realtime but he needed only ten minutes to know that his peaceful lifestyle had come to an abrupt end judgement in a world of universal and instantaneous communication it was very difficult to keep secrets this was a matter poole decided immediately for facetoface discussion the europa committee had grumbled but all its members had assembled in his apartment there were seven of them the lucky number doubtless suggested by the phases of the moon that had always fascinated mankind it was the first time poole had met three of the committees members though by now he knew them all more thoroughly than he could possibly have done in a prebraincapped lifetime chairperson oconnor members of the committee id like to say a few words only a few i promise before you download the message ive received from europa and this is something i prefer to do verbally thats more natural for me im afraid ill never be quite at ease with direct mental transfer as you all know dave bowman and hal have been stored as emulations in the monolith on europa apparently it never discards a tool it once found useful and from time to time it activates halman to monitor our affairs when they begin to concern it as i suspect my arrival may have done though perhaps i flatter myself but halman isnt just a passive tool the dave component still retains something of its human origins even emotions and because we were trained together shared almost everything for years he apparently finds it much easier to communicate with me than with anyone else i would like to think he enjoys doing it but perhaps thats too strong a word hes also curious inquisitive and perhaps a little resentful of the way hes been collected like a specimen of wildlife though thats probably what we are from the viewpoint of the intelligence that created the monolith and where is that intelligence now halman apparently knows the answer and its a chilling one as we always suspected the monolith is part of a galactic network of some kind and the nearest node the monoliths controller or immediate superior is lightyears away much too close for comfort this means that the report on us and our affairs that was transmitted early in the twentyfirst century was received half a millennium ago if the monoliths lets say supervisor replied at once any further instructions should be arriving just about now and thats exactly what seems to be happening during the last few days the monolith has been receiving a continuous string of messages and has been setting up new programs presumably in accordance with these unfortunately halman can only make guesses about the nature of those instructions as youll gather when youve downloaded this tablet he has some limited access to many of the monoliths circuits and memory banks and can even carry on a kind of dialogue with it if thats the right word since you need two people for that i still cant really grasp the idea that the monolith for all its powers doesnt possess consciousness doesnt even know that it exists halmans been brooding over the problem for a thousand years on and off and has come to the same answer that most of us have done but his conclusion must surely carry far more weight because of his inside knowledge sorry i wasnt intending to make a joke but what else could you call it whatever went to the trouble of creating us or at least tinkering with our ancestors minds and genes is deciding what to do next and halman is pessimistic no thats an exaggeration lets say he doesnt think much of our chances but is now too detached an observer to be unduly worried the future the survival of the human race isnt much more than an interesting problem to him but hes willing to help poole suddenly stopped talking to the surprise of his intent audience thats strange ive just had an amazing flashbackim sure it explains whats happening please bear with me dave and i were walking together one day along the beach at the cape a few weeks before launch when we noticed a large beetle lying on the sand as often happens it had fallen on its back and was waving its legs in the air struggling to get rightwayup i ignored it we were engaged in some complicated technical discussion but not dave he stepped aside and carefully flipped it over with his shoe as it flew away i commented are you sure that was a good idea now it will go off and chomp somebodys prize chrysanthemums and he answered maybe youre right but id like to give it the benefit of the doubt my apologies id promised to say only a few words but im very glad i remembered that incident i really believe it puts halmans message in the right perspective hes giving the human race the benefit of the doubt now please check your braincaps this is a highdensity recording top of the uv band channel make yourselves comfortable but be sure youre free line of sight here we go council of war no one asked for a replay once was sufficient there was a brief silence when the playback finished then chairperson dr oconnor removed her braincap massaged her shining scalp and said slowly you taught me a phrase from your period that seems very appropriate now this is a can of worms but only bowman halman has opened it said one of the committee members does he really understand the operation of something as complex as the monolith or is this whole scenario a figment of his imagination i dont think he has much imagination dr oconnor answered and everything checks perfectly especially the reference to nova scorpio we assumed that was an accident apparently it was a judgement first jupiter now scorpio said dr kraussman the distinguished physicist who was popularly regarded as a reincarnation of the legendary einstein a little plastic surgery it was rumored had also helped who will be next in line we always guessed said the chair that the tmas were monitoring us she paused for a moment then added ruefully what bad what incredibly bad luck that the final report went off just after the very worst period in human history there was another silence everyone knew that the twentieth century had often been branded the century of torture poole listened without interrupting while he waited for some consensus to emerge not for the first time he was impressed by the quality of the committee no one was trying to prove a pet theory score debating points or inflate an ego he could not help drawing a contrast with the often badtempered arguments he had heard in his own time between space agency engineers and administrators congressional staffs and industrial executives yes the human race had undoubtedly improved the braincap had not only helped to weed out misfits but had enormously increased the efficiency of education yet there had also been a loss there were very few memorable characters in this society offhand he could think of only four indra captain chandler dr khan and the dragon lady of wistful memory the chairperson let the discussion flow smoothly back and forth until everyone had had a say then began her summing up the obvious first question how seriously should we take this threat isnt worth wasting time on even if its a false alarm or a misunderstanding its potentially so grave that we must assume its real until we have absolute proof to the contrary agreed good and we dont know how much time we have so we must assume that the danger is immediate perhaps halman may be able to give us some further warning but by then it may be too late so the only thing we have to decide is how can we protect ourselves against something as powerful as the monolith look what happened to jupiter and apparently nova scorpio im sure that brute force would be useless though perhaps we should explore that option dr kraussman how long would it take to build a superbomb assuming that the designs still exist so that no research is necessary oh perhaps two weeks thermonuclear weapons are rather simple and use common materials after all they made them back in the second millennium but if you wanted something sophisticated say an antimatter bomb or a miniblackhole well that might take a few months thank you could you start looking into it but as ive said i dont believe it would work surely something that can handle such powers must also be able to protect itself against them so any other suggestions can we negotiate one councilor asked not very hopefully with whator whom kraussman answered as weve discovered the monolith is essentially a pure mechanism doing just what its been programmed to do perhaps that program is flexible enough to allow of changes but theres no way we can tell and we certainly cant appeal to head office thats half a thousand lightyears away poole listened without interrupting there was nothing he could contribute to the discussion and indeed much of it was completely over his head he began to feel an insidious sense of depression would it have been better he wondered not to pass on this information then if it was a false alarm no one would be any the worse and if it was not well humanity would still have peace of mind before whatever inescapable doom awaited it he was still mulling over these gloomy thoughts when he was suddenly alerted by a familiar phrase a quiet little member of the committee with a name so long and difficult that poole had never been able to remember still less pronounce it had abruptly dropped just two words into the discussion trojan horse there was one of those silences generally described as pregnant then a chorus of why didnt i think of that of course very good idea until the chairperson for the first time in the session had to call for order thank you professor thirugnanasampanthamoorthy said dr oconnor without missing a beat would you like to be more specific certainly if the monolith is indeed as everyone seems to think essentially a machine without consciousness and hence with only limited selfmonitoring ability we may already have the weapons that can defeat it locked up in the vault and a delivery system halman precisely just a minute dr t we know nothing absolutely nothing about the monoliths architecture how can we be sure that anything our primitive species ever designed would be effective against it we cant but remember this however sophisticated it is the monolith has to obey exactly the same universal laws of logic that aristotle and boole formulated centuries ago thats why it may no should be vulnerable to the things locked up in the vault we have to assemble them in such a way that at least one of them will work its our only hope unless anybody can suggest a better alternative excuse me said poole finally losing patience will someone kindly tell me what and where is this famous vault youre talking about chamber of horrors history is full of nightmares some natural some manmade by the end of the twentyfirst century most of the natural ones smallpox the black death aids the hideous viruses lurking in the african jungle had been eliminated or at least brought under control by the advance of medicine however it was never wise to underestimate the ingenuity of mother nature and no one doubted that the future would still have unpleasant biological surprises in store for mankind it seemed a sensible precaution therefore to keep a few specimens of all these horrors for scientific study carefully guarded of course so that there was no possibility of them escaping and again wreaking havoc on the human race but how could one be absolutely sure that there was no danger of this happening there had been understandably quite an outcry in the late twentieth century when it was proposed to keep the last known smallpox viruses at disease control centers in the united states and russia however unlikely it might be there was a finite possibility that they might be released by such accidents as earthquakes equipment failures or even deliberate sabotage by terrorist groups a solution that satisfied everyone was to ship them to the moon and to keep them in a laboratory at the end of a kilometerlong shaft drilled into the isolated mountain pico one of the most prominent features of the mare imbrium and here over the years they were joined by some of the most outstanding examples of misplaced human ingenuity indeed insanity there were gases and mists that even in microscopic doses caused slow or instant death some had been created by religious cultists who though mentally deranged had managed to acquire considerable scientific knowledge many of them believed that the end of the world was at hand in case god was absentminded enough not to perform as scheduled they wanted to make sure that they could rectify his unfortunate oversight the first assaults of these lethal cultists were made on such vulnerable targets as crowded subways world fairs sports stadiums pop concertstens of thousands were killed and many more injured before the madness was brought under control in the early twentyfirst century as often happens some good came out of evil because it forced the worlds lawenforcement agencies to cooperate as never before even rogue states which had promoted political terrorism were unable to tolerate this random and wholly unpredictable variety the chemical and biological agents used in these attacks as well as in earlier forms of warfare joined the deadly collection in pico their antidotes when they existed were also stored with them it was hoped that none of this material would ever concern humanity again but it was still available under heavy guard if it was needed in some desperate emergency the third category of items stored in the pico vault although they could be classified as plagues had never killed or injured anyone directly they had not even existed before the late twentieth century but in a few decades they had done billions of dollars worth of damage and often wrecked lives as effectively as any bodily illness could have done they were the diseases which attacked mankinds newest and most versatile servant the computer taking names from the medical dictionaries viruses prions tapeworms they were programs that often mimicked with uncanny accuracy the behavior of their organic relatives some were harmless little more than playful jokes contrived to surprise or amuse computer operators by unexpected messages and images on their visual displays others were far more malicious deliberately designed agents of catastrophe in most cases their purpose was entirely mercenary they were the weapons that sophisticated criminals used to blackmail the banks and commercial organizations that now depended utterly upon the efficient operation of their computer systems on being warned that their data banks would be erased automatically at a certain time unless they transferred a few megadollars to some anonymous offshore number most victims decided not to risk possibly irreparable disaster they paid up quietly often to avoid public or even private embarrassment without notifying the police this understandable desire for privacy made it easy for the network highwaymen to conduct their electronic holdups even when they were caught they were treated gently by legal systems which did not know how to handle such novel crimes and after all they had not really hurt anyone had they indeed after they had served their brief sentences many of the perpetrators were quietly hired by their victims on the old principle that poachers make the best gamekeepers these computer criminals were driven purely by greed and certainly did not wish to destroy the organizations they preyed upon no sensible parasite kills its host but there were other and much more dangerous enemies of society at work usually they were maladjusted individuals typically adolescent males working entirely alone and of course in complete secrecy their aim was to create programs which would simply create havoc and confusion when they had been spread over the planet by the worldwide cable and radio networks or on physical carriers such as diskettes and cd roms then they would enjoy the resulting chaos basking in the sense of power it gave their pitiful psyches sometimes these perverted geniuses were discovered and adopted by national intelligence agencies for their own secretive purposes usually to break into the data banks of their rivals this was a fairly harmless line of employment as the organizations concerned did at least have some sense of civic responsibility not so the apocalyptic sects who were delighted to discover this new armory holding weapons far more effective and more easily disseminated than gas or germs and much more difficult to counter since they could be broadcast instantaneously to millions of offices and homes the collapse of the new yorkhavana bank in the launching of indian nuclear missiles in the shutdown of paneuropean air traffic control in the paralysis of the north american telephone network in that same year all these were cultinspired rehearsals for doomsday thanks to brilliant feats of counterintelligence by normally uncooperative and even warring national agencies this menace was slowly brought under control at least so it was generally believed there had been no serious attacks at the very foundations of society for several hundred years one of the chief weapons of victory had been the braincap though there were some who believed that this achievement had been bought at too great a cost though arguments over the freedom of the individual versus the duties of the state were old when plato and aristotle attempted to codify them and would probably continue until the end of time some consensus had been reached in the third millennium it was generally agreed that communism was the most perfect form of government unfortunately it had been demonstrated at the cost of some hundreds of millions of lives that it was only applicable to social insects robots class ii and similar restricted categories for imperfect human beings the leastworst answer was demosocracy frequently defined as individual greed moderated by an efficient but not too zealous government soon after the braincap came into general use some highly intelligent and maximally zealous bureaucrats realized that it had a unique potential as an earlywarning system during the settingup process when the new wearer was being mentally calibrated it was possible to detect many forms of psychosis before they had a chance of becoming dangerous often this suggested the best therapy but when no cure appeared possible the subject could be electronically tagged or in extreme cases segregated from society of course this mental monitoring could test only those who were fitted with a braincap but by the end of the third millennium this was as essential for everyday life as the personal telephone had been at its beginning in fact anyone who did not join the vast majority was automatically suspect and checked as a potential deviant needless to say when mindprobing as its critics called it started coming into general use there were cries of outrage from civilrights organizations one of their most effective slogans was braincap or braincop slowly even reluctantly it was accepted that this form of monitoring was a necessary precaution against far worse evils and it was no coincidence that with the general improvement in mental health religious fanaticism also started its rapid decline when the longdrawnout war against the cybernet criminals ended the victors found themselves owning an embarrassing collection of spoils all of them utterly incomprehensible to any past conqueror there were of course hundreds of computer viruses most of them very difficult to detect and kill and there were some entities for want of a better name that were much more terrifying they were brilliantly invented diseases for which there was no cure in some cases not even the possibility of a cure many of them had been linked to great mathematicians who would have been horrified by this corruption of their discoveries as it is a human characteristic to belittle a real danger by giving it an absurd name the designations were often facetious the godel gremlin the mandelbrot maze the combinatorial catastrophe the transfinite trap the conway conundrum the turing torpedo the lorentz labyrinth the boolean bomb the shannon snare the cantor cataclysm if any generalization was possible all these mathematical horrors operated on the same principle they did not depend for their effectiveness on anything as naive as memoryerasure or code corruption on the contrary their approach was more subtle they persuaded their host machine to initiate a program which could not be completed before the end of the universe or which the mandelbrot maze was the deadliest example involved a literally infinite series of steps a trivial example would be the calculation of pi or any other irrational number however even the most stupid electrooptic computer would not fall into such a simple trap the day had long since passed when mechanical morons would wear out their gears grinding them to powder as they tried to divide by zero the challenge to the demon programmers was to convince their targets that the task set them had a definite conclusion that could be reached in a finite time in the battle of wits between man and machine the machine almost invariably lost it would have been possible though in some cases difficult and even risky to destroy the captured obscenities by eraseoverwrite commands but they represented an enormous investment in time and ingenuity which however misguided seemed a pity to waste and more important perhaps they should be kept for study in some secure location as a safeguard against the time when some evil genius might reinvent and deploy them the solution was obvious the digital demons should be sealed with their chemical and biological counterparts it was hoped for ever in the pico vault operation damocles poole never had much contact with the team who assembled the weapon everyone hoped would never have to be used the operation ominously but aptly named damocles was so highly specialized that he could contribute nothing directly and he saw enough of the task force to realize that some of them might almost belong to an alien species indeed one key member was apparently in a lunatic asylum poole had been surprised to find that such places still existed and chairperson oconnor sometimes suggested that at least two others should join him have you ever heard of the enigma project she remarked to poole after a particularly frustrating session when he shook his head she continued im surprised it was only a few decades before you were born i came across it while when i was researching material for damocles very similar problem in one of your wars a group of brilliant mathematicians was gathered together in great secrecy to break an enemy codeincidentally they built one of the very first real computers to make the job possible and theres a lovely story i hope its true that reminds me of our own little team one day the prime minister came on a visit of inspection and afterwards he said to enigmas director when i told you to leave no stone unturned to get the men you needed i didnt expect you to take me so literally presumably all the right stones had been turned for project damocles however as no one knew whether they were working against a deadline of days weeks or years at first it was hard to generate any sense of urgency the need for secrecy also created problems since there was no point in spreading alarm throughout the solar system not more than fifty people knew of the project but they were the people who mattered who could marshal all the forces necessary and who alone could authorize the opening of the pico vault for the first time in five hundred years when halman reported that the monolith was receiving messages with increasing frequency there seemed little doubt that something was going to happen poole was not the only one who found it hard to sleep in those days even with the help of the braincaps antiinsomnia programs before he finally did get to sleep he often wondered if he would wake up again but at last all the components of the weapon were assembled a weapon invisible untouchable and unimaginable to almost all the warriors who had ever lived nothing could have looked more harmless and innocent than the perfectly standard terabyte memory tablet used with millions of braincaps every day but the fact that it was encased in a massive block of crystalline material crisscrossed with metal bands indicated that it was something quite out of the ordinary poole received it with reluctance he wondered if the courier who had been given the awesome task of carrying the hiroshima atom bombs core to the pacific airbase from which it was launched had felt the same way and yet if all their fears were justified his responsibility might be even greater and he could not be certain that even the first part of his mission would be successful because no circuit could be absolutely secure halman had not yet been informed about project damocles poole would do that when he returned to ganymede then he could only hope that halman would be willing to play the role of trojan horse and perhaps be destroyed in the process preemptive strike it was strange to be back in the hotel grannymede after all these years strangest of all because it seemed completely unchanged despite everything that had happened poole was still greeted by the familiar image of bowman as he walked into the suite named after him and as he expected bowmanhalman was waiting looking slightly less substantial than the ancient hologram before they could even exchange greetings there was an interruption that poole would have welcomed at any other time than this the room vidphone gave its urgent trio of rising notes also unchanged since his last visit and an old friend appeared on the screen frank cried theodore khan why didnt you tell me you were coming when can we meet why no video someone with you and who were all those officiallooking types who landed at the same time please ted yes im sorry but believe me ive got very good reasons ill explain later and i do have someone with me call you back just as soon as i can goodbye as he belatedly gave the do not disturb order poole said apologetically sorry about that you know who it was of course yes dr khan he often tried to get in touch with me but you never answered may i ask why though there were far more important matters to worry about poole could not resist putting the question ours was the only channel i wished to keep open also i was often away sometimes for years that was surprising yet it should not have been poole knew well enough that halman had been reported in many places in many times yet away for years he might have visited quite a few star systems perhaps that was how he knew about nova scorpio only forty lightyears distant but he could never have gone all the way to the node there and back would have been a ninehundredyear journey how lucky that you were here when we needed you it was very unusual for halman to hesitate before replying there was much longer than the unavoidable threesecond timelag before he said slowly are you sure that it was luck what do you mean i do not wish to talk about it but twice i have glimpsed powers entities far superior to the monoliths and perhaps even their makers we may both have less freedom than we imagine that was indeed a chilling thought poole needed a deliberate effort of will to put it aside and concentrate on the immediate problem let us hope we have enough freewill to do what is necessary perhaps this is a foolish question does the monolith know that we are meeting could it be suspicious it is not capable of such an emotion it has numerous faultprotection devices some of which i understand but that is all could it be overhearing us now i do not believe so i wish that i could be sure it was such a naive and simpleminded supergenius thought poole as he unlocked his briefcase and took out the sealed box containing the tablet in this low gravity its weight was almost negligible it was impossible to believe that it might hold the destiny of mankind there was no way we could be certain of getting a secure circuit to you so we couldnt go into details this tablet contains programs which we hope will prevent the monolith from carrying out any orders which threaten mankind there are twenty of the most devastating viruses ever designed on this most of which have no known antidote in some cases it is believed that none is possible there are five copies of each we would like you to release them when and if you think it is necessary dave hal no one has ever been given such a responsibility but we have no other choice once again the reply seemed to take longer than the threesecond round trip from europa if we do this all the monoliths functions may cease we are uncertain what will happen to us then we have considered that of course but by this time you must surely have many facilities at your command some of them probably beyond our understanding i am also sending you a petabyte memory tablet ten to the fifteenth bytes is more than sufficient to hold all the memories and experiences of many lifetimes this will give you one escape route i suspect you have others correct we will decide which to use at the appropriate time poole relaxed as far as was possible in this extraordinary situation halman was willing to cooperate he still had sufficient links with his origins now we have to get this tablet to you physically its contents are too dangerous to risk sending over any radio or optical channel i know you possess longrange control of matter did you not once detonate an orbiting bomb could you transport it to europa alternatively we could send it in an autocourier to any point you specify that would be best i will collect it in tsienville here are the coordinates poole was still slumped in his chair when the bowman suite monitor admitted the head of the delegation that had accompanied him from earth whether colonel jones was a genuine colonel or even if his name was jones were minor mysteries which poole was not really interested in solving it was sufficient that he was a superb organizer and had handled the mechanics of operation damocles with quiet efficiency well frank its on its way will be landing in one hour ten minutes i assume that halman can take it from there but i dont understand how he can actually handle is that the right word these tablets i wondered about that until someone on the europa committee explained it theres a wellknown though not to me theorem stating that any computer can emulate any other computer so im sure that halman knows exactly what hes doing he would never have agreed otherwise i hope youre right replied the colonel if not well i dont know what alternative we have there was a gloomy pause until poole did his best to relieve the tension by the way have you heard the local rumor about our visit which particular one that were a special commission sent here to investigate crime and corruption in this raw frontier township the mayor and the sheriff are supposed to be running scared how i envy them said colonel jones sometimes its quite a relief to have something trivial to worry about deicide like all the inhabitants of anubis city dr theodore khan woke soon after local midnight to the sound of the general alarm his first reaction was not another icequake for deuss sake he rushed to the window shouting open so loudly that the room did not understand and he had to repeat the order in a normal voice the light of lucifer should have come streaming in painting the patterns on the floor that so fascinated visitors from earth because they never moved even a fraction of a millimeter no matter how long they waited that unvarying beam of light was no longer there as khan stared in utter disbelief through the huge transparent bubble of the anubis dome he saw a sky that ganymede had not known for a thousand years it was once more ablaze with stars lucifer had gone and then as he explored the forgotten constellations kahn noticed something even more terrifying where lucifer should have been was a tiny disc of absolute blackness eclipsing the unfamiliar stars there was only one possible explanation khan told himself numbly lucifer has been swallowed by a black hole and it may be our turn next on the balcony of the grannymede hotel poole was watching the same spectacle but with more complex emotions even before the general alarm his comsec had woken him with a message from halman it is beginning we have infected the monolith but one perhaps several of the viruses have entered our own circuits we do not know if we will be able to use the memory tablet you have given us if we succeed we will meet you in tsienville then came the surprising and strangely moving words whose exact emotional content would be debated for generations if we are unable to download remember us from the room behind him poole heard the voice of the mayor doing his best to reassure the now sleepless citizens of anubis though he opened with that most terrifying of official statements no cause for alarm the mayor did indeed have words of comfort we dont know whats happening but lucifers still shining normally i repeat lucifer is still shining weve just received news from the interorbit shuttle alcyone which left for callisto half an hour ago heres their view poole left the balcony and rushed into his room just in time to see lucifer blaze reassuringly on the vidscreen whats happened the mayor continued breathlessly is that something has caused a temporary eclipse well zoom in to look at itcallisto observatory come in please how does he know its temporary thought poole as he waited for the next image to come up on the screen lucifer vanished to be replaced by a field of stars at the same time the mayor faded out and another voice took over twometer telescope but almost any instrument will do its a disc of perfectly black material just over ten thousand kilometers across so thin it shows no visible thickness and its placed exactly obviously deliberately to block ganymede from receiving any light well zoom in to see if it shows any details though i rather doubt it from the viewpoint of callisto the occulting disc was foreshortened into an oval twice as long as it was wide it expanded until it completely filled the screen thereafter it was impossible to tell whether the image was being zoomed as it showed no structure whatsoever as i thought theres nothing to see lets pan over to the edge of the thing again there was no sense of motion until a field of stars suddenly appeared sharply defined by the curving edge of the worldsized disc it was exactly as if they were looking past the horizon of an airless perfectly smooth planet no it was not perfectly smooth thats interesting commented the astronomer who until now had sounded remarkably matteroffact as if this sort of thing was an everyday occurrence the edge looks jagged but in a very regular fashion like a sawblade a circular saw poole muttered under his breath is it going to carve us up dont be ridiculous this is as close as we can get before diffraction spoils the image well process it later and get much better detail the magnification was now so great that all trace of the discs circularity had vanished across the vidscreen was a black band serrated along its edge with triangles so identical that poole found it hard to avoid the ominous analogy of a sawblade yet something else was nagging at the back of his mind like everyone else on ganymede he watched the infinitely more distant stars drifting in and out of those geometrically perfect valleys very probably many others jumped to the same conclusion even before he did if you attempt to make a disc out of rectangular blocks whether their proportions are or any other it cannot possibly have a smooth edge of course you can make it as near a perfect circle as you like by using smaller and smaller blocks yet why go to that trouble if you merely wanted to build a screen large enough to eclipse a sun the mayor was right the eclipse was indeed temporary but its ending was the precise opposite of a solar one first light broke through at the exact center not in the usual necklace of baileys beads along the very edge jagged lines radiated from a dazzling pinhole and now under the highest magnification the structure of the disc was being revealed it was composed of millions of identical rectangles perhaps the same size as the great wall of europa and now they were splitting apart it was as if a gigantic jigsaw puzzle was being dismantled its perpetual but now briefly interrupted daylight was slowly returning to ganymede as the disc fragmented and the rays of lucifer poured through the widening gaps now the components themselves were evaporating almost as if they needed the reinforcement of each others contact to maintain reality although it seemed like hours to the anxious watchers in anubis city the whole event lasted for less than fifteen minutes not until it was all over did anyone pay attention to europa itself the great wall was gone and it was almost an hour before the news came from earth mars and moon that the sun itself had appeared to flicker for a few seconds before resuming business as usual it had been a highly selective set of eclipses obviously targeted at humankind nowhere else in the solar system would anything have been noticed in the general excitement it was a little longer before the world realized that tma zero and tma one had both vanished leaving only their fourmillionyearold imprints on tycho and africa it was the first time the europs could ever have met humans but they seemed neither alarmed nor surprised by the huge creatures moving among them at such lightning speed of course it was not too easy to interpret the emotional state of something that looked like a small leafless bush with no obvious sense organs or means of communication but if they were frightened by the arrival of alcyone and the emergence of its passengers they would surely have remained hiding in their igloos as frank poole slightly encumbered by his protective suit and the gift of shining copper wire he was carrying walked into the untidy suburbs of tsienville he wondered what the europs thought of recent events for them there had been no eclipse of lucifer but the disappearance of the great wall must surely have been a shock it had stood there for a thousand years as a shield and doubtless much more then abruptly it was gone as if it had never been the petabyte tablet was waiting for him with a group of europs standing around it demonstrating the first sign of curiosity that poole had ever observed in them he wondered if halman had somehow told them to watch over this gift from space until he came to collect it and to take it back since it now contained not only a sleeping friend but terrors which some future age might exorcise to the only place where it could be safely stored midnight pico it would be hard poole thought to imagine a more peaceful scene especially after the trauma of the last weeks the slanting rays of a nearly full earth revealed all the subtle details of the waterless sea of rains not obliterating them as the incandescent fury of the sun would do the small convoy of mooncars was arranged in a semicircle a hundred meters from the inconspicuous opening at the base of pico that was the entrance to the vault from this viewpoint poole could see that the mountain did not live up to the name that the early astronomers misled by its pointed shadow had given to it it was more like a rounded hill than a sharp peak and he could well believe that one of the local pastimes was bicycleriding to the summit until now none of those sportsmen and women could have guessed at the secret hidden beneath their wheels he hoped that the sinister knowledge would not discourage their healthy exercise an hour ago with a sense of mingled sadness and triumph he had handed over the tablet he had brought never letting it out of his sight from ganymede directly to the moon goodbye old friends he had murmured youve done well perhaps some future generation will reawaken you but on the whole i rather hope not he could imagine all too clearly one desperate reason why halmans knowledge might be needed again by now surely some message was on its way to that unknown control center bearing the news that its servant on europa no longer existed with reasonable luck it would take years give or take a few before any response could be expected poole had often cursed einstein in the past now he blessed him even the powers behind the monoliths it now appeared certain could not spread their influence faster than the speed of light so the human race should have almost a millennium to prepare for the next encounter if there was to be one perhaps by that time it would be better prepared something was emerging from the tunnel the trackmounted semihumanoid robot that had carried the tablet into the vault it was almost comic to see a machine enclosed in the kind of isolation suit used as protection against deadly germs and here on the airless moon but no one was taking any chances however unlikely they might seem after all the robot had moved among those carefully sequestered nightmares and although according to its video cameras everything appeared in order there was always a chance that some vial had leaked or some canisters seal had broken the moon was a very stable environment but during the centuries it had known many quakes and meteor impacts the robot came to a halt fifty meters outside the tunnel slowly the massive plug that sealed the vault swung back into place and began to rotate in its threads like a giant bolt being screwed into the mountain all not wearing dark glasses please close your eyes or look away from the robot said an urgent voice over the mooncar radio poole twisted round in his seat just in time to see an explosion of light on the roof of the vehicle when he turned back to look at pico all that was left of the robot was a heap of glowing slag even to someone who had spent much of his life surrounded by vacuum it seemed altogether wrong that tendrils of smoke were not slowly spiralling up from it sterilization completed said the voice of the mission controller thank you everybody now returning to plato city how ironic that the human race had been saved by the skilful deployment of its own insanities what moral poole wondered could one possibly draw from that he looked back at the beautiful blue earth huddling beneath its tattered blanket of clouds for protection against the cold of space up there a few weeks from now he hoped to cradle his first grandson in his arms whatever godlike powers and principalities lurked beyond the stars poole reminded himself for ordinary humans only two things were important love and death his body had not yet aged a hundred years he still had plenty of time for both epilogue their little universe is very young and its god is still a child but it is too soon to judge them when we return in the last days we will consider what should be saved
