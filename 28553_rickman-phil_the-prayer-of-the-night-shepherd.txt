the prayer of the night shepherd the sixth book in the merrily watkins series a novel by phil rickman they had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the night shepherds upon the moorlands and they cried to him to know if he had seen the hunt and the man as the story goes was so crazed with fear that he could scarce speak sir arthur conan doyle the hound of the baskervilles no record in cold print can give the reader an idea of the pleasure experienced in collecting the elusive material we call folklore from the living brains of men and women of whose lives it has formed an integral part in some cases with regard to superstitious beliefs there is a deep reserve to be overcome the more real the belief the greater the difficulty the folk of the welsh districts are more superstitious as a rule ella mary leather the folklore of herefordshire under stanner in the summer should have known he really should that morning even though it was a fine morning coming up to high summer the whole valley was singing with unease oh bugger jeremy berrows said to danny you seen that up on stanner rocks knobs of stone poked out like weathered gargoyles on an old church or ancient skulls browned by the earth halfburied with scrubby trees in their eye sockets from one side you could sometimes see a whole body of rock that danny reckoned looked like the remains of a dead giant thrown back into the greenery encrusting the cliff face but jeremy wasnt looking up at stanner likely he blamed the rocks for taking mary morson away though in dannys view the rocks done him a favour on that one he was staring instead at the smoky firs across the valley the dark trees that said this is wales now boy make no mistake what danny said big black crow hovering no really just flew over real low then he come back flew over again gotter hand it to these scavengers danny said awful thorough bollocks he was thinking you could drive yourself daft seeing signs everywhere even if you were jeremy berrows with ditchwater in your veins and the valley talking to you all your life could see where the boy was coming from today mind even without crows everything visible in the west seemed like a warning about wales a stiffened finger under your nose but when you actually crossed the border into wales the countryside relaxed into the easy lightcoloured sheepshaved hills where danny thomas had been born and bred and still lived still lived jesus how had that happened danny was grinning in dismay rubbing his beard and the boy glanced at him but danny just shook his head and tramped on down the dewy field under the freshrinsed morning sky not sure any more which side of the border they were on or if it mattered he was a welshman himself he supposed although the way he talked wasnt recognizably welsh either to real welsh people or to the english whose country was within shouting distance and all the shouting from either side done in near enough the same accent as his confusing really if danny was from the lighter more englishlooking country down the radnor valley which was actually in wales then jeremy back here under the dark firs and the knuckles of stanner rocks must be you english then jeremy me jeremy glanced warily at danny instinctively patting his thigh for flag the sheepdog to come close dunno do it matter matters to some danny said so they tells me it was real confusing hereabouts mind for instance the little town a mile or so behind them was in england despite being on the welsh side of offas dyke even so with its narrow main street and its closedin feel it felt welsh kington an anomaly this was dannys current favourite word the naturalists he met in the pub used it about stanner rocks said to be some of the oldest rocks in the country anomaly meant strange stuff going on odd climatic things occurring up on the tops resulting in plants that grew on stanner and nowhere else in these islands local people rarely went up on the rocks these days it being a national nature reserve protected by the countryside commission mostly it was just the naturalists and a few tourists with permission but mary morson went up one day and got a bit of a thing going with one of the naturalists and never come back to jeremy berrows and mabbe the boy didnt want reminding boy he must be late thirties now but he had this fresh complexion which was rare for a farmer most of them had skin like old brick like dannys skin in fact what you could see of it between the grey beard and the seaweed hair but it wasnt only that there was an innocence about jeremy and that was rare too in a farmer especially a good one jeremy also had commitment an intense bonding was the word they used now with this marginal ground the kind of bonding that hinged on knowing that if the ash came out before the oak you were in for a soak and that kind of stuff whatever you wanted to call it it had drained out of danny thomas long ago leaving a bleak old desert of regrets down by there it is the boy was nodding his head towards the copse at the bottom of the field where a bunch of fat lambs was gathering other side of the ole conker tree see him they were up on a bit of a tump now and you could see all of jeremys ground almost surrounded by the huge area owned by sebbie three farms the robber baron and you could see the big naked feet of the giant on the side of stanner below the rock face was the main road where it turned into the kington bypass and a long yellow container lorry sailed past like something out of a different time zone danny wondered if jeremy even noticed the lorry if all the boy saw wasnt just grass and trees and the plumpening lambs and the hawthorn trees sprinkled with floury blossom and the intrusion the vans that shouldnt be there dannys gaze followed a sheep track down to the bottom field where he could make out a cool blue roof slashed by a blade of sunlight but no movement down there no noise likely they wont be up and about yet he said always stays up late these folks with the booze and the dope and music you year any music last night jeremy shook his head and danny looked wistfully away towards hergest ridge a long arm pushing into wales made famous by mike oldfield when he named his second album after it mike oldfield was the most exciting thing that had ever happened to kington up on the ridge with his kites and at home in his farmhouse with the thought of it still made danny thomas catch his breath twenty guitars danny had three guitars in his stone barn two acoustics and a les paul hed sold his classic strat last christmas broke his heart but they needed a new stove and greta had gone without too long and mike oldfield was long gone now and danny was left sitting in his stone barn riffing into the night and counting all them lost opportunities to get out of farming for ever no music no jeremy said they was probly laying low the first night you reckon in dannys experience laying low wasnt what they did its where the ole crow was hovering jeremy said direcly over that van halfpast six this morning when the boy had phoned him hippies hed said not dannys favourite word there hadnt been any hippies for over thirty years but folks in this area loved to hang on to the obsolete and it was what theyd always called danny himself danny thomas bloody hippy we all knows what he grows in bryncot dingle if his ole man was alive itd kill him dead danny had turned off the toaster lowered the volume on wishbone ash and sought some clarification to some of the old farmers a hippy was anybody not wearing a tweed cap wellies and green waterproof trousers ole van jeremy said with little windows at the top and a minibus with one of them funny stars painted on the side pentagram sort of thing just the two vehicles fars i can see could be more in the trees you ent been down to check jeremy had said nothing he wouldnt have gone near not even after dark when he was known to move around among the sheep and the cattle looking like a poacher but in fact a guardian jeremy never lost a lamb to the fox it was like he and the fox had come to an agreement greta had come into the kitchen then flipflopping across the stained lino had on the old pink dressing gown and there was purple under her eyes and danny thought about the stove herd never asked for and how it wasnt enough he sighed and waited on the phone until jeremy coughed and said real tentative only i thought as how you might you know aye i know danny said it had been flattering at one time when the new age travellers used to turn up in force back in the eighties and nineties the local farmers had felt threatened by the sheer numbers and it took the police a long time to get the necessary court orders to move them on danny had come into his own then a farmer who looked like a traveller and was into their music and understood their ways one summer night hed taken his les paul and his littlest generator and the crate miniamp up to this travellers camp by forest inn and hung out there jamming till dawn with a bloke called judas from nuneaton biggest bloody audience danny ever had hed donated a drum of diesel for the buses and off theyd all trundled next day no bother the farmers were well pleased even sebbie dacre bigtime magistrate whod been about to have the invaders dealt with might be a raggedyhaired druggy danny thomas but he had his priorities right when it come down to it danny the negotiator danny the diplomat the hippywhisperer some bugger said one night in the eagle in new radnor not imagining for one moment that when danny thomas was up there jamming with the travellers hed been screaming inside take me with you please get me out of yere and things wasnt all that bad then nowadays agriculture was a sick joke gasping on the lifesupport of ec grants danny wasnt hardly replacing stock in the hope that something would come up prices were laughable and he wasnt even looking forward to the haymaking which seemed pointless he was letting the docks grow and the thistles hed even started doing the national bloody lottery and that was totally despicable all right give me quarter of an hour boy danny turned to his wife jeremy berrows got travellers in his bottom field you makes it sound like a disease gret said danny smiled and went off to find his classic king crimson tshirt the problem was not that jeremy was scared just that he was plain shy and avoided the company of other men who were cynical about farming and treated their animals like a crop never had nothing to do with his neighbour sebbie dacre gentleman farmer and master of the middle marches hunt even after his mam left the farm jeremy ignored the pubs and the livestock markets when he could everybody thought he was coming out of it when he hooked up with mary morson nicelooking girl solid farming family her and jeremy theyd go out together into kington and they had the engagement ring from the jewellers there mary flashing it around jeremy proud as a peacock if peacocks wore work shirts and baggy jeans the van was below them now about seventy yards away and danny could see most of it light blue with bits of dark blue showing through on the roof hard to say what make it was bit bigger than a transit sure to be and quite old so that would likely rule out foreign tourists who didnt know no better than to camp on somebodys ground foreign tourists had classy new camper vans and winnebagos jeremy was looking tense already hunched up tell you what danny said why dont i go down there talk to the buggers on my own it made sense jeremy looked grateful and his shoulders relaxed flag the dog sensing a release of tension lay down in the grass panting and danny went down there on his own into the dip where the bank was eroded the stream at the bottom was almost dried up the blossomy hedge hid the bypass though not stanner rocks and danny could still see the faces on the rocks and the dead giant way back when he was doing acid hed once watched the giants head rotting into green slime jesus christ never again hello there danny shouted now he was close up he could tell this wasnt travellers in the new age sense the van might be old and have windows punched in the sides but it was tidy clean and lookedafter with nothing painted on it no slogans no pentagrams and the windows had proper blinds and it was the only vehicle here where was the minibus then danny stepped over a bunch of elder branches neatly sawn and stacked and left to rot on account of jeremy never burned elder which was the devils wood and would bring you no luck anybody about he walked over to the van and peered inside the cab remembering how on his own farm one time hed found this car posh car bmw tucked up against a field gate with the engine running and a length of hose from the exhaust jammed in the window and a man in a black suit in there all pinkfaced and well dead a wood pigeon came blundering out of the hedge making as much racket as a bunch of yobs with baseball bats danny spun round and saw that they were above him both of them a woman and a girl they were standing on the bank in full sun and danny thomas could see them clearly and they werent exactly what hed been expecting howre you he said mildly was he a bit disappointed because they were so ordinarylooking both in lightcoloured tops and jeans and trainers because they wasnt wildhaired creatures with tattoos and chains and rings in their lips oh hell the woman scrambled down i suppose were trespassing danny shrugged it was late the woman said and we were exhausted im sorry danny said whered the other one go the woman blinked shook out her dark brown hair the girl came down and joined her sticking close like flag the sheepdog had with jeremy the girl looked about fourteen minibus danny said pentagram on the side oh yeah right the woman had an english accent theyve gone they left early what happened we met them last night a girl and two guys we both pulled into this garage forecourt only it was closed and we were nearly out of fuel and it was getting dark and im like oh christ what are we going to do if theyre all closed i mean obviously i dont know this area too well and i couldnt think of anywhere to stop for the night then this girl in the bus says oh weve been round here loads of times we can show you a good campsite and thats how we she shrugged im sorry i mean it was dark and i we didnt light a fire or anything we wouldnt do anything like that is this your farm can i pay you danny became aware of jeremy berrows up on the bank danny said its his farm it is oh he watched the woman approaching jeremy she was very thin and her bare arms were tanned she was real sexy in fact in a more managed way like a rock chick of the old school hi im er im nat she said natalie thats clancy the girl nodded and said nothing jeremy didnt move at all but he wasnt still either he was so much a part of this land that he seemed suspended in the air currents and his sparse fluffy hair was dusted by the sun when the woman moved towards jeremy leaving the girl by the van danny would swear he saw a hell of a shiver go through the boy as if there was a sudden stiff breeze come out of nowhere that no one else could feel danny felt an apprehension for over a week the blue van stayed in the bottom field then it wasnt there any more about a month after this gwilym bufton the feed dealer and gossipy bastard from hundred house told danny thomas that hed seen a blue van parked up in jeremy berrowss yard hidden behind the old dairy like it was meant to be hidden by september people were starting to talk in october danny saw jeremy berrows one lunchtime in the eagle at new radnor sitting at a table in the shadows with the woman with dark brown hair jeremy nodded and said howre you in a nervous kind of voice and danny didnt push it the woman smiled at danny and it was a nice smile no question and she was a lovelylooking woman no question about that either but her eyes were watchful danny supposed he could understand that the way people were talking next thing he heard about the van was that it had been sold bit of irony here to the naturalists working up at stanner to use as a mobile site hq and for overnight accommodation serious burning of boats here in dannys view then he hears the womans gone to work for the latest london fantasists to take over the ruinous stanner hall hotel manager no less a few days later greta said when they were watching telly during the adverts rhoda morson you know marys mother well i was talking to her in the paper shop see and her says oh hes just doing it to make mary jealous you what her well rhoda morson was mad as hell sure t be when mary blew it with jeremy and lost the farm getting his own back now thats what she reckons rubbing it in thats what her reckons is it danny said lost the farm bloody hell it was all they ever thought about bringing another bloody farm into the family where was love in the equation or was that a sixties thing greta looked at him thoughtful you could find out eh how permanent it is whyd i wanner do that ent my affair ah but is it greta said is it just an affair or has that tart got her big feet firmly under the table the girls going to school over at moorfield now cording to lynne in the hairdressers now thats got the ring of permanent about it isnt it danny yawned and watched a car commercial he liked because it had a soundtrack of travellin in style by free hed never had an actual car only secondhand trucks he didnt mention to greta about the van being sold if she hadnt heard he wasnt going to give her more gossip to spread across the valley you knows jeremy berrows better than most she said you could find out i probly could gret danny said if i gave a shit and the matter was never raised again because that was the night of the terrible fire that wrecked gomer parrys planthire depot down the valley killing gomers nephew fat nev bit of a shock for everybody in radnor valley that was and danny spent a lot of time helping poor old gomer salvage what could be salvaged and restore what could be restored rebuilding the perimeter fence to keep out the scavengers and dealing with the particular area of the site that he realized gomer couldnt bear to go near and out of the blackened ruins of gomers business came the glimmering of a new future for danny it wasnt admittedly the career in music hed always dreamed of but it would mean whole days out of the valley new places new people and he was a good ole boy gomer parry for a while danny thomas was so excited that like the great david crosby he almost cut his hair he never saw much of jeremy berrows again until the winter when the trees were all rusty and the skulls of stanner rocks gleamed with damp like cold sweat and the traditional stability of the border country was very much called into question traditional stability that was a bloody joke part one it occurred to a man who was cycling home to kington late at night hed been working at the munitions factory during the war near hergest court he saw this enormous hound which hed never seen before and never saw again the hound had huge eyes thats what impressed him most the size of its eyes the hound didnt attack him and he just kept cycling and i would imagine he cycled very fast he had a feeling that there was something that just wasnt real about it bob jenkins journalist kington without the song normally she wouldnt think of fogging the air around nonsmoking parishioners especially so soon after a service tonight was different tonight merrily needed not only this cigarette but what it was saying about her the cigarette said this woman is human this woman is weak also given the alleged findings on secondary smoking this woman is selfish and inconsiderate this is a serial sinner only it wasnt getting through brenda prossers eyes were glowing almost golden now twice shed tried to sit down at the kitchen table and been pushed back to her feet by the electricity inside her she had to hold on to the back of the chair to stop her hands trembling and then the joy would make her mouth go slack and shed shake her head smiling helplessly gone maybe the fourth time shed said that brenda relishing the hard finality in the word gone gone gone just like it never was there vicar big jim prosser said his light grey suit was soaked and blackened across the shoulders he stood with his back to the old aga in the vicarage kitchen and the aga rumbled sourly and merrily smoked and wondered how she should be responding but the inner screen was blank just like annmaries scan this is a miracle sure tbe jim said oh christ any word but that and see like i kept saying to jim hardly the first one is it rain was still bubbled on brendas forehead like the remains of a bornagain baptism not the first since you brought back the evensong without the song merrily sat down then abruptly stood up again and went to fill the kettle for tea a dense curtain of rain swished across the dark window over the sink as though it had been hosed they could have waited for her in the church porch brenda and jim but when the congregation was filing out umbrellas going up there theyd been standing among the wet tombs and the headstones both of them bareheaded as though they were unaware of the sometimessleety rain like they were in some parallel dimension where it wasnt cold and it wasnt raining at all the truth was jim had said as they followed merrily to the vicarage that they didnt want to talk to anyone else didnt want to answer all the obvious questions about annmarie they thought it was only right that the vicar should be the first to know this was the first time that either jim or brenda had been to the sunday evening service theyd been among those older parishioners who were huffily avoiding it because theyd heard it was all changed had become a bit unconventional a bit not for the likes of us i pray well be forgiven for ever doubting what you were trying to do merrily brenda said now so much for the experiment in mystery evensong as in most parishes the sunday evening service had been killed a while ago by falling congregations and then merrily had suddenly brought it back sunday evening in the church everyone welcome just that nothing about a service the truth was that after what had happened with jenny box shed been feeling guilty deliverance work had been separating her too often from her own parish from the daytoday cure of souls shed been too busy to notice the anomalous buds in the local flower bed until they were bursting into black blossom when shed put this to the bishop hed waved it away congregations were in free fall it was a phase or it wasnt a phase but something truly sinister the beginning of the end for organized christianity what about children the bishop asked the new archbishop of canterbury was particularly worried about the absence of children in churches merrily had raised this issue with jane who seemed to have been a child like yesterday and jane had wrinkled her nose who needs kids in church anyway look at it this way kids are not supposed to drink in pubs until theyre eighteen so pubs are slightly mysterious therefore cool so like obviously the best way to invest in the future would be to ban the little sods from the church altogether that way they wouldnt turn out like me so the monthly family service with kids doing readings the quiz totally crap idea i always said that it just makes the church look needy and pathetic you have to cultivate the mystery if you dont bring back the mystery youre stuffed mum it was worrying increasingly these days the kid was making a disturbing kind of sense ok then when she brought back the service she didnt call it evensong because there was no song no hymns no psalms and no sermon definitely no preaching it was an experiment with mystery she didnt even call it a service she didnt wear the kit no cassock not even a dog collar after the first time and she sat on a car cushion on the chancel steps the heating for what it was worth would be on full and pews were pulled out and angled into a semicircle haloed by a wooden standard lamp that shed liberated from the vestry it was a quiet time a lowkey prelude to the working week the first time only four people had turned up which partly dictated the form five weeks later it was a congregation of around twenty and growing although congregation was hardly the word it would begin with tea and coffee and chat turning into a discussion of peoples problems sometimes solutions were arrived at before the villagers went home small difficulties sorted babysitters found gardeners for old people sometimes it would quietly feed notions into the village and issues would be resolved during the following week the church as forum the church as catalyst the polishscented air as balm how it should be and the mystery as early as the third week more personal issues had started to emerge the ones you wouldnt hear discussed on the street certainly not by the people involved marital problems anxieties over illness and fears over kids and what they might be getting into there was a surprising focus to these discussions and when prayer came into it as it usually did in the end it would happen spontaneously rising like a ground mist in the nave real prayer and somehow this was a seal of confidentiality none of the problems raised in the church and distilled into prayer had ever drifted back to merrily as gossip she was elated it had been cooking what she didnt need at this stage was anything boiling over into mythmaking jim and brenda prosser ran the eight till late in the centre of the village their daughter annmarie who last summer had been painlessly divorced had moved into the flat over the shop helping out there at weekends before going off clubbing in hereford with her mates annmaries illness had been a rumour for some weeks pastedon smiles at the checkout whispers about tests on a sunday night two weeks ago alice meek who had the fish and chip shop in old barn lane had said brenda wont talk about it but it dont look good ent there nothing we can do alice brenda said now you know what alice is like calls a spade a bloody ole shovel jim said we met alice when we were coming back from dr kents house this afternoon and she seemed to know only by your face love jim said with affection the kettle began to hiss and merrily put tea in the pot brenda sat down at last she was in her early sixties had lost weight recently no surprise there and her bleachblonde hair was fading back to white periodically a hand trembled brenda folded both of them in her lap and stared across the refectory table at merrily like she was seeing the vicar in a strange new light alice told us about the special prayers you had for annmarie well not merrily looked down at the table top of course it was special all prayer should be special alice said she lost track of time she said she felt as if everybody there was together united you know and that was also some of the newcomers she didnt know all united and they were part of something that was bigger said shed never known anything like that before alice said emotion had brought up the welshness in brendas voice the prossers had moved across from brecon about fifteen years ago merrily felt flushed and uncertain happy of course happy for the prossers and annmarie it was luminously wonderful and shed been conscious of reaching an unexpected level of conscious worship but what did dr kent say exactly he phoned for annmarie just after lunch jim said he admitted hed known since friday but he was afraid to say in case it was wrong in case theyd somehow got the wrong medical records or whatever he said he didnt think it was possible the new tests had drawn a blank couldnt like get his head around it so he was trying to get the consultant on the phone all of yesterday and it wasnt until this morning see when he managed to reach him at his home couldnt believe it neither of them he definitely confirmed that the scan was clear nothing there and it was hers no question of that no mistake here merrily what did the consultant say about it jim shrugged you know these fellers maybe they merrily bit her lip made a mistake the first time see to be frank merrily ive never been what youd call a real churchgoer jim said im a local shopkeeper struggling to stay in business sometimes ive come because it seemed to be expected brenda sat up jim no let me say this i want to its like being a social drinker i was a how would you put it social worshipper merrily smiled thats perilously close to martyrdom jim what im trying to say hed reddened at last well if this isnt a bloody miracle merrily i wouldnt recognize one thats all merrily tried to hold the smile big word brenda said quickly alice said you also prayed for percy joyces arthritis and yes but that and now hes come off the steroids youre healing people merrily the words echoed once clearly in her head as the kettle began to scream and shake and the kitchen lights seemed too bright i merrily ground her cigarette into the ashtray twisting it from side to side sometimes god heals people sometimes it was a crucial word because most times people were not healed big jim said gently we understands that but he do need asking the right way dont he what im saying merrily something happened during that service to concentrate peoples minds on it something a bit powerful sort of thing its a new kind of service and youre a new kind of vicar not what we was used to alice is telling everybody probably wheres annmarie now brenda smiled in the pub i expect with her friends shell be coming to thank you have no doubts about no look merrily stood up im really really happy for her and for you and it does seem like a miracle but the bodys a wonderful thing and sometimes id just be really glad if you didnt say too much about that aspect of it for the moment for the time being until until when exactly well go now jim said you havent had your tea im sorry we never wanted to embarrass you merrily brenda said most weeks lol would pull the property section out of profs hereford times and toss it on the pile of papers they kept for lighting the stoves woodburners in a recording studio prof had been unsure about this but the punters liked it when the sound of a log collapsing into ash had filtered like a sigh into the mix of the final acoustic song that the guitar legend tom storey had recorded here last week tom had refused to lose it tom whod left yesterday was superstitious about these things tonight prof would be working in here tinkering with toms music perhaps until dawn about eight pm lol went out to the woodshelter and packed a pile of blocks into a big basket brought the basket into the stable that now housed the studio and bent to build a fire in the second stove sometimes his work here amounted to little more than domestic chores and working on his own material prof didnt seem to mind that but lol did he was crumpling the property pages to take the kindling when he noticed a small photograph of a tiny tilting house with a white door he stood up and carried the paper to the light over the mixing desk ledwardine church street exquisite small terraced house grade two listed close to the centre of this soughtafter village beamed living room kitchen two bedrooms and bathroom open green area and orchards to rear must be viewed he stood for a while by the mixing desk then he tore out the page folded it and pushed it into a back pocket of his jeans while he was packing the rest of the property section into the stove and adding twigs he saw himself walking in through that white door draped over the post at the foot of the stairs was an old woollen poncho then you went through into the lowbeamed parlour you sat down at lucys desk in the window overlooking church street with two lamps switched on you heard a movement looked over your shoulder and saw jane watkins fifteen standing in the doorway and jane said desolately i thought she would be here i really didnt think shed left us for ever lucy devenish honorary aunt to jane mentor to lol lucy had introduced him to the inspirational seventeenthcentury herefordshire poet thomas traherne and indirectly to janes mother the rev watkins lucy in her poncho face like an old red indian voice like a duchess you have to learn to open up let the world flow into you again he could still see jane standing in the doorway that night at lucys lucy not yet buried after dying in the road hit and run jane standing in the doorway confused and a pink moon hanging outside jane talking about her mother she does like you i can tell i think the way things turned out you probably did the best thing not actually sleeping with her it will stand you in good stead getting to sleep with merrily had taken more than a year a year in which lol had turned away from music taken a course in psychotherapy and then turned away in disgust from psychotherapy and gone back to the music but neither he nor merrily was all that young any more they lived over half an hour apart and their lives were very different but every day when he didnt see her seemed like a wasted day and there was nothing like the music business for teaching you about passing time lol struck a match and put it to the paper ledwardine hed been living there when theyd first met but circumstances had moved him away now he wanted to go back he wanted that house and everything it once had promised when the prossers had gone merrily lit a cigarette feeling leaden and ungracious she was thinking miserably about healing thinking about the corrupted bible belt evangelism of the former radnor valley minister father nick ellis about an event called the big bible fest shed attended with a crowd of other students at theological college where thered been speaking in tongues and calls to the disabled to have faith and rise up out of those wheelchairs and if they didnt rise up then their faith wasnt strong enough tough she thought about a girl called heather redfern seventeen janes age who despite prayers in at least six churches had died of leukaemia less than a month after leading a twentymile sponsored walk around the black and white villages of north herefordshire to raise money for macmillan nurses and she thought about annmarie herdman dizzy superficial often seen swaying across the square at one am towing some bloke up to the flat over the eight till late some bloke who in the morning she probably wouldnt even recognize annmarie a woman for whom the church gate was just a convenient place to wait for your lift into hereford healing was like the bloody national lottery the good guys rarely hit the jackpot merrily stood up and went without thinking into the scullery because what you did now you phoned your spiritual director or you would do that if your spiritual director wasnt wrestling with his own crisis in a place far away where no mobile phones were permitted a primitive monastic community not in the midwales wilderness but on a concrete estate south of manchester where the police would raid flats and find guns a place huw owen described as like an open wound turning septic more suited to his condition he said than bare hills safe and sanitized by wind and rain huw was running hard from his alltoohuman emotions hed lost a woman the love of his midlife because of a man of unfathomable evil and the alltoohuman part of huw had sought closure through revenge and although maybe because this man was dead it hadnt happened there had been no closure and huw was terrified that his faith wasnt sufficient to take him beyond that merrily sat down at the desk glimpsing a dispiriting image of her own faith as a small nutlike core inside a protective shell too small too shrivelled to absorb the concept of miracles jane rang from the hotel just before ten the same jane who should have been home by now erm i told gomer i wouldnt need a lift back tonight ok i see merrily said dont be like that theres no problem about going straight to school from here in the morning as it happens ive got the clobber in my case how prescient of you flower its as well to be prepared youre always saying that it looked like snow earlier it comes down heavily up here when it starts being at least seven miles closer to the arctic circle janes weekend job had altered the format of both their lives it was good that she had a job not so good that it involved overnights on saturdays because all they had left then was sunday merrilys working day which left sunday night and now that was gone too and it was the fact that jane was working in a hotel and spending nights there this was really stupid but merrily kept thinking about donna furlowe daughter of the woman huw owen had loved at janes age maybe a little older donna had been working at a hotel holiday job and had gone missing and been found murdered possibly one of the cromwell street killings of course that was in gloucestershire and this was on the edge of herefordshire where it hardened into wales it wasnt even a coincidence just paranoia you all right mum why do you want to stay there it came out sharper than shed intended sorry do they want you to stay they could use the extra help yeah mmm it was wise in this kind of situation not to ask too many questions to convey the illusion of trust of course if youre lonely jane said insouciantly you could always give lol a ring jane oh no its sunday isnt it mustnt risk having a man seen sneaking into the vicarage on a sunday and not leaving until wooooh monday merrily said nothing when are you two going to like grow up jane said game afoot and left her there her lifeblood oozing into the rug pausing for a moment lean and elegant in his black suit he stared right through the faces watching him out of the shadows the table lamp with the frosted globe put shards of ice into his eyes oh my god a woman whispered jane was thinking grown people now he was spinning back sighting down his nose at the man in the wingbacked brocaded chair and the man was shifting uncomfortably and the stiff white cuffs were chafing janes wrists and then you crept up to your room and waited until the entire household was silent what time would that have been midnight a quarterpast yes let us say a quarterpast twelveseventeen being the precise time of the full moon which i suspect would appeal to your sense of drama with the log fire down to embers the globeshaded oil lamp was the only light in the drawing room more shiveringly alive than electricity spraying complex shadows up the oak panels jane dropped her resistance she was part of the whole scam now anyway piffle said the man in the wingbacked chair oh i think not major i think that barely half an hour after the murder you crept back down the stairs and into the study where you began to overturn chairs and pull out drawers making as much noise as you possibly could finally with the handle of your stick you smashed not one but two windows in swift succession so that the sound might be mistaken for a single impact sir your imagination is i would suggest even more hysterical than your abominable fiddleplaying a thin hand disdainfully flicked away the insult and then you moved silently up the back stairs this time and immediately reemerged onto the main landing dragging on your dressing gown shouting and spluttering jane remembered it well it had been seriously startling she must have been in bed about twenty minutes and was half asleep when this huge roar went up whos there whos making all that damn noise what the hells going on when shed grabbed at the switch of the bedside lamp it hadnt come on and then when she got out of bed shed found that the ceiling light wouldnt work either shed gone to open the door but remembered just in time never be seen outside your room in your normal clothes no matter what happens anyhow her jeans and stuff were in the case under the bed so shed thrown on the awful stiff black dress edwardian maids standard issue before venturing out into the cold and musty darkness of the upper landing flicking switches to find that none of the electric lights was functioning feeling her way to the top of the stairs under this eerie green glow from the smoke alarm peering down to see most of the guests stumbling onto the main landing which was dim and full of shadows but a little brighter than upstairs because it was lit by wow cool an incandescent thimble on a bracket shed noticed several of these gas mantles around the place but never imagined that they might actually work this was like totally disorientating a timeshift a sliding century she recalled a woman saying faintly is this real you roused the entire household major a raised forefinger the major tried to rise but fell back into the wings of the chair but you made very sure that you would be the first one to reenter the study this sombre room of death where poor lady hartland lay cooling in her own congealing blood and you had to be the first one to enter is that not so fairytale nonsense sir but the majors voice was slurred with guilt was he really a major hed been chatting in the bar an hour or so ago explaining that hed been based at brecon until his retirement was that all made up the lamplight wavered jane felt bemused it was working last night when theyd all come staggering down the major had been standing at the foot of the stairs his back to the door of the study which all yesterday had been kept locked oh lord something terrible appears to have happened please madam youd best not look at this point the study door had swung ajar behind him and you could see the bare lower legs of the corpse pale as altar candles receding into shadow that had worked too christ jane had thought for that one crucial moment so the man in black cleared his throat we know why you murdered her and now we know how there remains only the question of proof of which you have none the major waved a dismissive hand and turned away gazing towards the long window headlamps flashed on it tongues of creamy light distorting in the rainy panes it was probably the cravens reversing out to go home oh hell jane thought i was supposed to have drawn the curtains at least ben had his back to the window so he wouldnt have noticed jane put up a hand to her white frilly headband making sure it hadnt slid off again proof major a faint sneer a languid hand reaching down by the side of the chair if were looking for proof leave that alone how dare you sir then we need hardly look very far the man in black had found a walking stick ebony with a brass handle in the shape of a cobras head as he weighed it in his hands you could hear the distant visceral scraping of a solo violin should have sounded naff but it was somehow exactly right timed to underscore the tension as the stick was proffered to the man in the chair if you please major or shall i i dont know what youre talking about then we shall waste no more time snatching back the stick and holding it over the table next to the oil lamp so that everyone could see him twist the cobras head no the major sat up that the snake head came off the hollow shaft of the walking stick was very gently shaken the man in black was somehow manipulating the light so that everyones attention was on his hands and on the stick and on this big red stone that rolled out and lay there glowing on the very edge of the table hmm the fontaine ruby i imagine the major half rose from his chair as though he was about to make a break for it several spontaneous gasps wafted out of the shadows from people who had spent most of the afternoon searching for this paste ruby with the walking stick conspicuously propped up in the hallstand the whole time the man in black didnt even glance at it gems in themselves clearly held no big fascination for him even his interest in the major was waning now that guilt was proved they both glanced towards the door which had opened to reveal this guy bulked out by a huge tweed overcoat the major slumped back i think this is all the evidence we require the man in black said mildly you may arrest him now lestrade silence and then the electric lights came up and the applause kicked in genuine appreciation a couple of actual cheers a triumph you couldnt fault it when the lights came fully on everything seemed duller and shabbier the countryhouse drawing room reverting to hotel lounge the oil lamp dimming into history and sherlock holmes was ben foley again closing his eyes in relief afterwards when the bar was closed jane went down to the kitchen to collect mugs of bedtime hot chocolate to serve to the twelve guests earlier shed heard ben saying that twelve was barely enough to make the weekend pay for itself and they were all too old and the whole thing was an embarrassment the kitchen had flagged floors and high windows and room for a whole bunch of servants but it was dominated by the new island unit that ben had assembled from the debris of a bankrupt butchers shop in leominster if most domestic island units were the isle of wight this was australia amber who didnt have any staff to speak of was on her own bending over a corner of the unit adding something herbal and aromatic to the cauldron of hot chocolate she looked up is he all right basking in adulation yes hes quite good at that amber said no sarcasm there amber didnt do sarcasm last night all woundup before the guests came down for dinner ben had snarled that yeah he might have done live theatre before but that was over twenty years ago and back then he didnt have to work with school pantomime props and a bunch of crappy amateurs he was brilliant amber genuine massive applause well as massive as you can get from anyway youd have thought there was a lot more of them to hear it amber was wearily rubbing her eyes shoulderlength ashblonde hair tinted pink by the halogen lights she was probably about fifteen years younger than ben maybe midthirties but more well more mature she was wearing a big pink sweater and an apron with a cartoon cat on it mustve taken for ever to plan jane said like the gas mantles i didnt even know they worked amber looked worried some kind of bottled gas i dont like to think of the safety regulations hes broken plus messing with the trip switches last night to make sure the normal lights didnt work i mean what if one of those old women had fallen down the stairs well they didnt it was brilliant jane liked amber moaning to her you only moaned to people you could trust oh yeah good news only one of the punters correctly identified both the murderer and the motive so thats just the one bottle of champagne to give away amber blinked you did phone your mother didnt you i did phone my mother and there wasnt a problem about staying over because id hate there was no problem its very good of you jane amber said the girl we had before wouldnt do saturday nights they dont seem to want weekend jobs any more jesus amber jane said this isnt a job a holiday more like a regular weekend break and they gave you money at the end of it well usually at first jane had thought amber was a bit like mum but now she saw a clear difference ambers modesty came out of this essential selfbelief shed handled the food end of two significant london restaurants fronted by flash gits who treated customers like morons knowing that she was the reason they could afford the arrogance flash gits faded fast but amber was never going to be out of work ben had remarked talking about it to guests in the bar naming names i like to think i rescued her from that little scumbag can you bear to watch his crappy tv show to ben virtually everything on the box including the news and weather had become crap from the day he finally negotiated his severance deal with bbc drama a couple of weeks ago a face from casualty or eastenders someone vaguely familiar from something jane wouldnt have watched if the alternative was the open university had come to stay overnight at the hotel accompanied by a gorgeouslooking woman who sat propping up her smile while the face and ben got ratarsed and ranted on for hours about the bunch of totally talentless twats who ran the corporation these days so who was the winner jane amber started setting out empty mugs on the wooden trolley oh guy with white hair like steve martin without the humour dr kennedy hes the serious expert the others are just here for fun kennedys written books on conan doyle and sherlock holmes he knows a lot i thought ben knew a lot ben all bens ever done is produce the missing casebook for the bbc youre probably too young no i think i saw a couple im sure youre too young to remember the fuss apparently the missing casebook had not been adapted from the conan doyle stories it was this semiserious spoof supposed to be about what holmes was really doing after everyone thought hed died at the reichenbach falls the joke being possibly for copyright reasons that the central character in the missing casebook was incognito he looked like sherlock holmes he spoke like sherlock holmes he played his violin in the night and shot himself up with cocaine and everyone knew who he was really but he was always called something else a different name in every episode i dont actually remember that jane admitted the second series was cancelled the first one didnt go down well particularly in holmes circles the orthodox versions sacrosanct to those people they want the same stories done over and over again as if its history not fiction and they dont like people taking the piss he wasnt taking the piss this weekend though was he ok the story was invented but you cant have a murder weekend where everybody already knows whos done it can you murder weekends amber sighed no but it worked amber i was trying to be cynical because you know but it was all beautifully done given the tiny budget amber said i mean he really dominated it he was holmes gave up acting when he was twentysix amber said he didnt think he was good enough to be one of the greats its the way he is he needs to be great he needs to succeed against the odds i suppose amber dipped a wooden spoon into the chocolate and tasted it anyway the most important guest this weekend is dr kennedy because hes the secretary of the baker street league and we need their conference theyre not the biggest or the oldest of the holmes societies but ben knows a few members already and obviously it would help for us to be linked with a group like that jane sniffed at the hot chocolate you could pass out with longing amber what do you really need this holmes connection to make the hotel work amber blew out her cheeks the closest she ever came to scowling jane knew that ben had spotted this place in a copy of country life at the dentists making an impulse call and discovering that it was still on the market after five months so there was ben with what seemed like a decent amount of money to invest in a future out of tv ben who didnt want to go crawling to any more witless tossers who couldnt see further than cops and hospitals who didnt want to have to watch any more projects crash after months of hassle who wanted something he was completely in control of he kept saying that and here it was in a beautiful atmospheric and unspoiled area less than half a day from central london a structurally sound country house kind of with the possibility of twenty bedrooms if you developed outbuildings a house with a history that although not extensive included a literary connection of curious significance to ben foley surely this was some kind of i mean i know he said it was an omen jane said now hes finding out that the concept of total independence is a myth especially with limited funds and hes still having to crawl to people like kennedy and put on murder weekends which he claims he does for fun but which really are all weve got which isnt good is it jane but this conan doyle thing jane looked around the vast kitchen imagining a grandfatherly figure with a heavy moustache waiting politely for his mug of chocolate the face she saw was very distinct it was the face from a blownup photograph framed above the fireplace in the lounge we dont actually know if he stayed here regularly or even once but rumour and legend have always been enough for ben what he doesnt know hell invent lifes like television if its on the screen it must have happened and thats enough to build a business image around maybe he was just afraid you wouldnt come if you thought he had an agenda no amber said sadly i always go along with things she began to pour the chocolate into a big earthenware jug i just wish it wasnt so victorian theres something cold and ungiving about victorian houses everythings bigger than it needs to be too many passageways mmm jane said ben had shown her the secret passage under the stairs where lady hartland played by natalie craven had waited to die not so bad in the summer but now i realize i dont like the forestry and those gnarled old rocks the way they seem to be watching you watching everything crumbling around you while theyve been here for ever mmm jane said again in two minds as a weird person she really liked stanner rocks naturally but this seemed like a good opportunity to bring up the thing that had been bothering her a little er while were on the subject of everything being bigger than it needs to be my room certainly is sorry jane the tower room i mean its fantastic to have a room that size but i feel a bit like im not used to a room that big thats all oh we thought and i keep waking up in the night stupid really so like i just wondered if i could have my old room back jane felt deceitful and a bit ashamed shed been switched around twice over the past couple of weekends as the foleys continued their winter programme of refurbishing the bedrooms one by one amber looked at her thoughtfully just too big stupid really jane said well if you dont like that room jane its not that i dont like it then you can move your stuff back to the old one tonight if you like jane nodded trying not to show her relief which was kind of despicable frankly thanks amber back in the lounge ben helped her serve the chocolate thanks sweetheart youve been terrific his hair was wisping out of the holmes greaseslick the curls reforming he bent down to her ear and whispered some of these old guys seeing a little maid around the place in a starchy uniform it gives them a delicious little frisson you know i dont do frissons jane said primly and ben laughed and went to play holmes again for two elderly ladies the kind that it was nice to think still existed outside of old agatha christie films a few of the people here were regulars at murder weekends all over the country there was a network of them now the major came over for his chocolate terribly sorry my dear but ive been assuming you were bens daughter just paid help major it felt this was stupid a little weird talking to a guy whod just been exposed as having beaten a womans brains out it was surprising how the scenario crawled into some area of your mind and lodged there maybe something to do with the house she shook herself the maids headband fell off and she caught it and laughed are you really a major he pushed his tongue into a cheek he was stocky sixtyish and his tufty white moustache looked genuine frank sampson avad sorry arrow valley amateur dramatics jane grinned had me fooled not like this area isnt full of retired soldiers except the real ones tend to be exregiment younger fitter not how you imagine them any more frank sampson nodded towards ben fun though working with a pro id like to see them make the place work i remember the first time it was a hotel bad well that was back in the sixties when walking holidays were for the hardup so i suppose it was more of a hostel after that an old folks home then some sort of specialist language school then an old folks home again not for long though elderly people hate to be dumped this far out they want life around them not dripping trees so what was it when conan doyle stayed here frank sampson shrugged just a house presumably quite a new one then obviously thats a bone of contention isnt it thats a can of worms clancy jane smiled im jane clancys gone home sorry he covered his mouth cant seem to get anything right tonight cant even get away with murder dont suppose theres any more of this incredible chocolate is there not getting paid for this but im buggered if im passing up the side benefits the last of the logs collapsed in the grate behind them jane brought the earthenware jug and topped up franks mug how do you mean can of worms weeeeell you know did he spend time here or didnt he i dont know i dont know anyone who does why would anybody think he did then the fake major blinked well that friends ben was in the middle of the room clapping his hands together for attention his edwardian jacket was undone and his hair was flowing back from his shining dome in case i dont see any of you in the morning just want to say a big thanks thanks for being our guinea pigs great fun one of the agatha christie ladies said hope therell be more well ah weve certainly learned some things ben sank his hands into his jacket pockets opening the coat out like wings the way kids did for instance quite a few people have said that theyd rather it had started on friday evening through saturday because they really needed to leave today to get to work tomorrow sorry about that as you can no doubt guess were pretty much amateurs at the hotel game but he raised a forefinger we learn fast ah he paused and looked across at the portrait over the fireplace the bluetinted blowup photo of the kindlooking man with neat hair and a weighty moustache and eyes which seemed to be focused with a glint of mild wonder on something in the middle distance i know theres still some controversy about whether sir arthur spent time here ben said but i feel he did sometimes when i walk through these rooms late at night or early in the morning i like to feel hes perhaps well we all know what an ardent spiritualist he was so lets not get into that i just feel there are mysteries about sir arthur which might be solved here i dont know why i say that i just sorry babbling ben wiped the air apologies no go on a woman said not one of the agathas this one was elegant middleaged with long nearwhite hair and halfglasses and jane thought shed come on her own are we talking about the hound of the baskervilles because i was rather disappointed that none of this came up during the weekend ah well ben looked putout that deserves more than a single weekend cant divulge all our secrets in one burst darling an agatha chuckled didnt want to waste it on the likes of us eh ben did this camp simper not denying it jane looked at frank sampson the erstwhile murderer can of worms frank murmured later in the lobby with its shabby flock wallpaper and victorianlooking wall lamps jane heard ben talking to the thin man with bristly white hair seemed this guy kennedy was one of those who would have preferred to leave this morning he was leaving now with his bottle of champagne for solving the murder so well be hearing from you ben said about your conference he was carefully standing with his back to one of the places where the panelling had been poorly patched with stained plywood unfortunately just above his head an area of unpapered plaster was dark with damp and he might as well have been pointing at it well i dr kennedy hefted his canvas overnight bag his voice was nasal and tinny not a lot like steve martin i do need to talk to my colleagues on the committee ill confirm my decision in writing by the end of the week wonderful ben said thats marvellous neil not exactly rubbing his hands but aglow with satisfaction as he followed dr kennedy to the main door jane moved ahead of them and held it open for kennedy to pull his bag through after him ben and jane stood under the big brass lamp in the conservatoryporch its long gothic windows streaming with rain watching him run for his car games afoot jane ben said sorry oh yeah holmesspeak the game is finally afoot now he really was rubbing his hands maybe just being deliberately theatrical the piece of carpet that they were standing on was soaked through jane hoped dr kennedy hadnt walked into one of the pondsize puddles on the terrace or stumbled on the eroded steps down to the car park there was no sign of him now anyway beyond the car park you could see nothing but darkness and all you could hear was the rain in the pines and then a shot ben was standing in the doorway and his head twisted sharply as if hed been hit and was about to go down it was that close a blast loud enough to blow a hole in the rain jane found that shed backed away against one of the glass panels she was momentarily frozen half expecting ben to fall but he straightened up and breathed in hard right in the golden light of the brass lamp his eyes were bright with rage thats it thats fucking it he stepped out into the rain and splashed across to the low stone wall at the edge of the terrace ben jane followed him out feeling her frilly headband falling off behind her the car park was on a slope bordered by pines and through their tiered trunks jane thought she saw a blurry light moving a car door slammed an engine started up and then the much brighter lights of dr kennedys car shone into her eyes and she couldnt see anything else this was the country shots happened it was supposed to be illegal to let off a shotgun at night and in weather like this it was seriously crazy but it happened it certainly happened here jane went tense remembering last night bastards ben climbed up on the wall dr kennedys car passing below him the rain thudding on the shoulders of his edwardian jacket his fists were clenched his long face shining with fury scumbags dont think i dont know who you are i told i warned you not on my land this time youre fucking dog meat nobody replied ben stood for a moment longer with his head bowed his back to the hall with its mockmullion windows and its witchshat towers then he slammed his right fist into his left hand and came down from the wall his hair was slicked flat to his head again like sherlock holmess hair he walked back towards the door taking hold of janes arm when do you ever hear of one being revoked what jane had been dredging her headband from a puddle shotgun licence when do you ever hear of anyones shotgun licence being revoked for misuse of firearms jane never because all the bloody magistrates are farmers like this guy dacre and they all stand together bastards i said i didnt want them on my land disturbing my guests killing my wildlife i said no who are they ben steered jane back into the porch some kind of gun club think they can safely ignore me because ill be gone soon like all the others when it all goes down when were declared bankrupt its what this area does you see jane ruins you eventually nothing creative ever thrives because its a wilderness a hunting ground thats what its always been its the way they like it but they dont know me jane they go out shooting in these conditions she hadnt heard about his row with the gun club i think they just saw the lights the cars its a gesture you dont interfere with us well leave you alone they think im soft effete some arty bastard from london here today gone ben pushed his fingers through his wet hair wiping his shoes on the sodden carpet they dont bother me why should they half of them arent even locals yobs jane thick barbaric yobs no subtlety he suddenly flashed a big grin where i come from we have real hard bastards wheres that exactly oh the city country people think theyre tough because they can pull lambs out of ewes and have to walk further for the bus because they can shoot things and watch foxes get torn to bits without feeling pity is that tough jane is that what youd call tough jane wrinkled her nose i think huntings totally psychotic and a waste of time and money but then so do a lot of country people on the quiet do they ben was either surprised or disappointed nobody really likes having their land churned up and their cats killed like by mistake most of them keep it to themselves because hunt people can turn nasty when theyre threatened and country people dont like confrontation ben did though ben was into drama and although he didnt seem to be aggressive in a violent way you got the idea that he actually needed to feel a lot of people were against him needed this to fire him up maintain his energy level needs to succeed against the odds amber had said which when you thought about it made him a dangerous sort of person to be living here on the border like actually on the actual border jane had theories about the border and what it meant what it really was this excited her most of the time but now her cheap maids outfit was blotting up the wet and she was clammycold and starting to shiver and actually wish she was in her apartment back at the vicarage how wimpish was that youre a smart girl ben said im awfully glad weve got you here ambers a hugely talented woman and very very decent but she needs support and because we can only afford parttime staff you and natalie youre he didnt finish he smiled and turned away opening the main door for jane who noticed the rain coming into the glass porch through the gaps in the putty they were very close last night jane said who were the gun club there was one shot sounded like it was just outside the window really ben said what consultants are for on thursday morning in the church the holy ghost was waiting alice meek from the chip shop in old barn lane was doing the flowers on the altar dusty pillars of white light were dropping from the upper windows and alices voice was carrying like a crows across the chancel my niece the one in solihull she did one of them alpha courses at her church did i tell you after the decree nisi come through this was big gap in her life usual story alice was smoothing out the altar cloth replacing the candlesticks this alpha she reckoned it dcreep up on you somehow it dont seem like much at first but near the end of it she felt the holy spirit was in her heart like a big white bird and you could feel its wings fluttering thats what she said vicar as if this big bird was trying to escape from her breast and alice spread her arms wide fill the whole world with love and healing thats nice merrily went on dusting the choir stalls wondering where this was going it was the first time shed encountered alice since the prossers had told her about annmarie but we prevents it happening see alice came back to the chancel steps for the pewter vase that shed filled with flowers we dont let it out its the way we are were all scared to open up so we keeps him in his cage the poor old holy spirit i never quite got that before see she scuttled back and set the pewter vase on the altar nothing like freesias is there you ent thought of having one of them alpha courses yere vicar well its no youre dead right its not necessary alice came stomping back down the chancel steps a fiercefaced little woman in a pink nylon overall i yeard as how jenny driscoll god rest her poor soul used to say there was angelic light around ledwardine church and now i know exacly what she meant its crept up on all of us it has like me i only come to your sunday night service because somebody said there wasnt no hymns voice like mine you dont wanner do no singing if you can help it do you scare the bloody angels off the roof alice cackled was there a new energy about her or was that imagination merrily sat down in one of the choir stalls as with most parishes nowadays there hadnt been a choir here for years some ministers even liked to condense their congregations into the stalls now more intimate alice came to sit next to her ill be honest vicar some of us wasnt too sure about you at first bit too nervous in the pulpit like you wasnt too certain of what you was trying to say but it ent all about preaching is it and it ent all about singin the same ole hymns and not hearing none of the words no more its the quiet times ennit its the quiet times when things starts to happen things merrily grew nervous alice winked like there was a great secret floating in the dusty air between them brenda prossers voice seemed to echo in the void alice said she lost track of time she said she felt as if everybody there was together and they were part of something that was you know bigger its prayer merrily said thats all whatever you wanner call its all right with me alice said its like you being the exorcist we wasnt sure about that either at first but when i was talking to mrs hitchin works in the library at leominster she says its all part of the same thing oh so anyway alice said i was planning to have a word with you about my nephew works at the tyre place in hereford merrily looked at her asthma alice said later when the ledwardine gp kent asprey phoned about next years village marathon merrily knew he wanted something else this was how things were done in the sticks she took the call in the scullery sitting at her desk next to the window overlooking the sodden grey garden i see from my list that you havent entered your name asprey said its next april isnt it anyway you wouldnt either if you had legs as short as mine merrily lit a cigarette but you could put me down to be one of the people who pushes drinks at the runners righto he said she could hear him writing she waited looking across the lawn to the ancient apple orchard which was creeping back into the churchyard so that the church and the vicarage were enmeshed again in a skein of hoary branches apple trees were not graceful and not pretty once the fruit was gone in the old days the cider would have been made and stored by now the cider would see the village through the winter the cider and the church but no cider was produced here any more annmarie herdman he said youll have heard i suppose its remarkable isnt it merrily began to draw an apple on the sermon pad at least you didnt use the word miracle not one of my very favourite words kent i i know annmarie pretty well im sure this was the man who in the cause of preventative medicine used to lead groups of women from ledwardine and surrounding villages on fun runs until word reached his wife that for a select few the serious fun had begun after the run so your position on this would be what id say let them all keep their illusions not often people in my profession get to impart that kind of good news and if it helps you people fill your churches in these difficult times thats very generous of you doctor we need all the crumbs we can get entirely off the record it could be a medical anomaly but its my suspicion that there was an error at the hospital with those first tests whether it was technical or a mixup of names is a matter of conjecture and well probably never really know but you mean annmarie herdman never had a tumour i cant say that obviously but you mustve had a reason to refer her to the consultant in the first place its what consultants are for merrily to take the heat of course but mistakes do occur its inevitable and yet you told the prossers youd done some checks and you couldnt find evidence of any mixup merrily in these litigious times i see anyway asprey said i thought you ought to know i realize it can be quite embarrassing for someone in your position when people latch on to something like this and blow it up into something it isnt yes merrily said that was very thoughtful of you when he hung up she was looking at the moon over paul klees rooftops in the print opposite the desk the moon was very faintly blue she looked down at the sermon pad and saw that under the apple shed printed the words smug and git at dusk merrily went to lock up the church glancing on the way out at the prayer board on which parishioners could write the names of people for whom theyd like prayers to be said there were twice as many as usual one had the final sentence underlined it said this is for sunday night walking back through the churchyard an isolated spurt of sleet hit her like grit from under lorry wheels and she hurried under the lych gate what did you do here what did you do about healing how did you explain all those times when there was no cure when the condition worsened what did you say to them when after the quiet times after the unity after the being part of something bigger what did you say to them when after all that god appeared to have let them down badly back in the scullery with about twenty minutes before janes school bus was due on the square she prodded in the number for sophie at the hereford cathedral gatehouse time to make an appointment with bernie dunmore gatehouse male voice bishop merrily watkins as i live and breathe bernie sniffed well with slight difficulty at the moment seem to be developing a cold sophies just popped across to fodder to get me some herbal thing which she insists is going to deal with it echinacea whats wrong with sudafed i say its a drug and bernie merrily said where do we stand on healing as in spiritual we brought out an extensive report the bishop reminded her its called a time for healing a time to heal no when i say we i mean we the diocese as distinct from we the church bugger said the bishop have you no pity for a man with a cold your department were talking about here isnt it healing and deliverance remember is it though my job description says deliverance healing sounds like the c of e spin doctors softening it up less bell book and candle more touchyfeely caring you have a specific problem with that possibly the bishop didnt reply he would know better than to quote st marks version of jesuss parting message preascension as well as the churchs healing mission it appeared to advocate picking up snakes cause of many deaths in the us bible belt all right ive been doing this slightly experimental sundayevening service merrily said loose openended i thought it was working i mean it brought in some of the villagers who normally wouldnt notice if the steeple fell off even janes been a couple of times when the weekend job allows so a modest success what i like to hear people actually saying theyre reaching something deeper in the way of understanding and awareness and discovering you can actually learn meditation for free but it wasnt meant to be i mean it didnt start out as a healing session we did pray though as you would for a woman whod been told she had a malignant tumour a week later she was told that she didnt have a tumour at all congratulations the bishop said dont get me wrong i couldnt be more delighted but you cant help wondering if it was an answer to your prayers in the strictest sense the local gp rang to point out that it was probably a misdiagnosis or a technological problem with the scanner or an administrative cockup or at worst one of those very rare medical anomalies now he could be entirely wrong or covering something up and hes massively outnumbered by all those people who would clearly like to think that something did happen obviously but bernie theyve started to bring out their sick theyre recalling lesser ailments prayed for and subsequently eased this morning i was asked if id mind curing someones asthma even though he doesnt live in the parish they believe youre a latent healer i stress that if its happening its not down to me but i suspect theres a feeling that the deliverance minister has a hot line like the fourth emergency service the nature of the sundayevening service has been misrepresented the bishop breathed so heavily into the phone that it was like the germs were coming down the line you do have a more exciting ministry than most of us dont you merrily maybe im missing the humour here bishop young guy who gets acute asthma attacks and whose aunt is afraid that the next time it happens there was a long pause down the phone she could hear the traffic in broad street a door opening and closing quick footsteps on the stone stairway to the gatehouse offices you know jeavons is back the bishop said jeav oh i mean if you wanted to talk to someone about this someone who actually knows about it as distinct from a knackered old admin bloke like me i was only thinking with huw owen being away ive never met jeavons merrily said the bishop blew his nose youre not the first to raise the question of healing lately healing groups is the normal approach i think we all agree its better to share the burden it also raises ecumenical possibilities particularly with the catholics and im quite drawn to that ah hold on one moment she heard another voice she heard the bishop saying well i dont know how to work the blessed thing she thought about catholic priests she knew and how theyd react to the idea of working with a woman bernie came back on the line sophie goes out for five minutes place ceases to function did i mention jeavons hes in worcestershire right hes been abroad semiretired now of course rather prematurely few years ago there was a move to fasttrack him into purple view to canterbury one suspects the little greaseball blair was keen for obvious reasons red faces all round when jeavons tosses it back at them and says hell retire instead what he wanted we discover was his freedom to pursue his specialist interests hover over psychic surgeons in chile at the churchs expense dunno my information is that hes back in the country and available as a consultant to selected clerics although i was once told it would be unwise to refer just anybody huw talked about him once merrily recalled only because if anyones on the edge of a crisis jeavons has been known to tip them over only huw reckoned he was mad merrily said since the days when hundreds of medieval pilgrims had dragged their crippled limbs to the shrine of st thomas cantilupe in hereford cathedral the church had become increasingly uncomfortable about healing you prayed for sick people you might even light a candle and if there was a cure you thanked god beyond that a certain wariness crept in not strictly our thing in which case what was the churchs thing the way congregations were crashing it was clear that this was a question not going unasked while jane was changing out of her school gear merrily dug out the report a time to heal a contribution towards the ministry of healing in his introduction george carey archbishop of canterbury at the time referred to our lords injunction to heal the sick and suggested that the report might be studied and reflected upon and considered for action as appropriate in dioceses and parishes as appropriate merrily smiled in relation to parishes the report recommended that clergy involved in healing should consider combining their resources with those of doctors community nurses and carers operating according to a working theology of the ministry of healing oh sure like kent asprey and lorraine bonner the district nurse who maintained shed seen too much of life to be anything but an atheist the report was sniffy about some healing services lack of preparation misunderstandings unjustified claims and emotionalism leading to subsequent disappointment it was more supportive of what it called intercessory groups in which a number of instructed persons met regularly to pray for the sick layingon of hands by the minister in the context of a normal service or eucharist was also accepted as were services of penance underlining the healing benefits of forgiveness merrily looked up canon llewellyn jeavons in the phone book there was a jeavons lcd at suckley mad huw had said without explanation she knew where suckley was a rambling hamlet not far over the herefordshire border and not far at all in fact from the frome valley where lol robinson was still living out of suitcases in the granary at prof levins recording studio merrily sometimes caught a frightening image of herself in twenty years time it was in sepia this small monklike person in the bottom lefthand corner of the huge old vicarage hunched over the desk dark chilly cramped very much alone she saw it quite often these days sometimes it was so detailed and yet so stark that it was almost like an engraving that night building a fire of apple logs in the sittingroom inglenook jane said you dont make fires like this when im not here do you like last weekend for instance i was busy i think you probably didnt come in here even once i could almost smell the damp saturday night i wrote the sermon sunday night we had the service and then the prossers came to tell me about annmarie wasnt really worth it afterwards the paper and the kindling flared yellow jane on the hearthrug in her jeans and an overstretched white sweater looked like a little girl again seventeen now scary its just the kid positioned a small log over a mesh of thorny kindling i like this job i like stanner hall you get to meet people different kinds of people i just dont like to think of you all alone here like everywhere dark except the kitchen and the scullery ive got the cat and of course lets keep him out of this jane snapped the point is in under two years ill probably be gone whether its university or whatever but i might be gone for like for good and youll be kind of lodged down in that scullery like the last jelly baby in the jar writing your sermons into the empty night actually it was going to bed that was the worst time putting out the bedside light knowing that the attic apartment directly above you was empty thinking of all the empty rooms and all the people who had been and gone janes dad long gone janes dad that was how she thought of sean now as though jane was the best thing hed done in his foreshortened corrupted life biting her lip she stood over jane and bent and kneaded the kids shoulders two years is still a long time i used to think that but it isnt jane looked up at her youll be nearly forty then have you even thought about that too old for sex jane pulled away stop it it was a joke how are things at the hotel dont change the subject youre here in this mausoleum on your own every weekend and lols twenty miles away with no real home at all and he cant get near half the time because of appearances and the church and all that hypocritical bollocks i mean if you were gay if you were a lesbian nobody would jane broke off blushing probably remembering a certain misunderstanding and theres the question of restarting lols career merrily said the album out in march the chance of a tour the kid smiled maliciously and groupies do they have groupies any more just trying to inflame the situation groupies and lol doesnt arise jane looked up again an apple glow on her face but you have to do something soon face it most people know about you and him now anyway yeah but cohabiting in the vicarage might just be a step too far and i dont think hed want that anyway now that hes finding his feet youre so unimpulsive you piss me off sometimes its what im here for merrily said later just before nine she left jane in front of the tv and slipped away to the scullery on the blue blotter on her desk next to the sermon pad was a folded copy of the property section of the hereford times just above the fold an advert encircled said ledwardine church street exquisite small terraced house grade two listed close to the centre of this soughtafter village it could be the answer tomorrow shed call the agent tonight she lifted the phone and tapped in the number of canon llewellyn jeavons so he was mad maybe she could use some of that the room under the witchshat tower the pines were matt black against the bloodorange sky when jane was walking up the hotel drive friday late afternoon and here it came again that shivery anticipation her senses honed as sharp as the air as the cold tide of night swept in towards the border the border it was right here she could actually be standing on it now the hotel was in england but the rocks it was named after were in wales and here where the track divided was where it all coalesced in a burst of sunset letting her school case and her overnight bag slip to the ground jane stopped at the fork the independent working woman on the border two witcheshat towers were prodding up between the ragged pines stanner hall was victorian gothic therefore more lavishly gothic than the original and from this distance at least it looked like it belonged here if only as a piece of skyline on the border and the border like all borders was more than just a political division it was about magic and transformation a zone out of time where things normally unseen might for tiny bright moments become visible some part of jane felt this to be true and responded to it christianity would be like turn away from the dark shun the numinous take no pleasure in the nearness of other spheres which was why jane reckoned that she was always going to be a pagan at the core ok maybe shed mellowed a little towards mums faith but it didnt go far enough it had no sense of place this was the holy land looking up the lefthand stony track that led to the top of the mysterious stanner rocks she stood for a moment feeling the night beating in like heavy downy wings then she picked up her bags and took the righthand path between the gateposts of stanner hall these sculpted stone buttresses against the trespassing woods most of a foxhound was preserved on the top of the lefthand post its muzzle pointing rigidly at the sky as if it was about to begin howling on the righthand post only the paws remained nothing here was completely intact the sign at the bottom still said stanner hall hote are we talking about the hound of the baskervilles voices from last sunday rather disappointed that none of this came up during the weekend that ah probably deserves more than a single weekend can of worms can of worms well shed read the hound of the baskervilles years ago when she was quite young hadnt liked it much always managed to avoid the films on tv at school when shed raised the issue clancy had said yeah i think theres some local connection but she didnt seem interested tonight jane and clancy had come off the school bus at the usual junction at the end of the kington bypass but clancy had gone off down the gladestry road to the farm clancy said her mum was coming down heavy on the subject of homework like it had to be done on friday night or the kid didnt get out on saturday changing schools so often shed fallen behind and this was her last chance to pull back so jane had been seeing more of clancys mum than clancy and now when she lugged her bags into the courtyard of stanner hall here was natalie leaning against the open kitchen door massaging a mug of coffee hi jane this warm pithy voice travelling easily across the darkening yard it was a voice that jane imagined blokes finding very sexy nat too she was quite tall and supple with high pointy breasts inside her black jumper she had dense shaggy hair the colour of dark tobacco and she was well very beautiful in this enviably careless way clan has gone home jane she was certainly heading that way hmm nat said doubtfully clancy had shown up for the first time at the beginning of this term she was only about a year younger than jane but actually two years behind her at school which not surprisingly had left her isolated with no real friends jane who knew what it was like being the new kid had realized that clancys situation must be a whole lot worse having to take lessons with little children shed gone out of her way to talk to clancy at lunchtimes and theyd become mates kind of which was what had led indirectly to the offer of regular weekend work at the hotel where clancys mother was receptionist barmaid and the person who made this joint seem halfway professional nursing her mug for warmth natalie came out into the yard smiling in a bruised kind of way and raising her eyes to the purpling sky like the fall of fucking troy in there today jane the earthy talk was one of nats contradictions treated her own daughter like a kid and was oldfashioned about stuff like bedtimes and homework and pubs but shed address jane like a real mate a colleague nat had clearly been around and not only in hotels and restaurants unexpected guests jane looked over at the car park and saw jeremys old daihatsu which nat must be using and bens mg and that was all if only nat said the letter was crinkly and discoloured and some of the print had smudged amber flattened it out on the baronial island unit slid it across to jane and switched on the halogen spotlights i had to dry it on the stove ben threw it in the sink on his way out oh jane looked at the letter but didnt pick it up its ok to please do amber said otherwise youll spend the rest of the night wondering why hes drinking too much and smashing things anyway youre one of us now jane felt a grateful blush coming on she picked up the letter it was printed on what she guessed to be very expensive finequality vellum and it was brief and kind of shocking the baker street league dear foley as expected the management committee of the league has confirmed my decision in regard to its annual conference and the stanner hall hotel i was mildly diverted to hear of your intention to develop the link between the hotel doyle and the hound however as the majority of my members firmly reject this theory they did not feel it would be appropriate to associate the name of the league with your establishment sincerely pp dr np kennedy hon secretary jane let the letter fall to the island unit pp and its not even signed by anybody thats like deliberately insulting isnt it no its probably just careless ambers dolllike face was squashedin with strain her hair pushed back over her high forehead amber the bastard blatantly led ben to think you were going to get the conference i heard him natalie pushed the letter away with a forefinger he was hardly going to say that to bens face was he yeah but he jane felt personally hurt remembering the way that ben had forced himself to smarm the guy thats terrific neil perhaps kennedy had pressures we dont know about amber said theres nothing we can do anyway you did say ben knew other members of this outfit though didnt you maybe he can find out what the real reason is that probably is the real reason jane they dont believe the story they think were pulling some scam jane sat down on a wooden stool i dont really understand what thats about the hound of the baskervilles when i read the book it was set in devon dartmoor amber leaned over her corner of the island elbows on a double oven glove with burn marks on it the grimpen mire jane shuddered in the book a wild pony had been sucked to its death in the bog shed hated reading that shed probably been about twelve shed hated what happened to the hound too she might have wept at the time and anyway it was all a con you were led to believe it was going to be supernatural and it wasnt so like is there some suggestion that conan doyle wrote it here amber shook her head not exactly the story hangs on the legend of a ghostly hound which is a sign of death for the baskerville family so ok there was a baskerville family in this area longestablished wealthy they had a castle or something at eardisley which is only about six miles up the road and theres a pub called the baskerville arms over at clyro which is just over the other side of brilley mountain and did they have a ghostly hound no but the vaughan family did they lived at hergest court which is only a mile or so away from here across the valley there was a hound that was supposed to mean death for someone in the family if it was seen and it has been seen apparently over the years to this day amber shrugged there are no vaughans left now anyway conan doyle is supposed to have been related to either the baskervilles or the vaughans maybe both i dont remember and its believed that he stayed here in this house to research the story or he heard it while he was staying here or something jane was impressed if this was true it was well worth all bens efforts but why would conan doyle switch the story to devon we dont know amber said as kennedy says in his letter a lot of holmes enthusiasts reject the welsh border theory entirely because theres also a devon legend that fits maybe doyle liked the name baskerville enough to want to use it but didnt want to implicate the actual family so he set the novel somewhere where there arent any obvious baskervilles jane thought of the stone hounds on the stanner hall gateposts did the baskervilles have anything to do with this house not that we know of it was built by a family called chancery it must have been fairly new at the time the book came out in but it was built to look historic so maybe it gave conan doyle an idea of what he wanted i mean it certainly looks more like the baskerville hall he describes in the book than hergest court does just a farmhouse now honey its how novelists work natalie said you take a bit of this bit of that and muddle it all up so that there are no comebacks jane recalled something else a woman brought it up at the murder weekend she wanted ben to talk about it but he hinted he was saving it well of course he was amber said he was saving it for the annual conference of the baker street league the plan was that ben would get the league to endorse the evidence that this place is quite possibly the real baskerville hall and then wed start publicizing it and at the same time antony there was a loud clink and a muted splash natalie had tossed a soup ladle into one of the sinks she stood with her hands on her narrow hips annoyed its all my fault if id bothered to check out kennedy on the net before ben had invited him wed all have realized that as he was born in bloody tavistock he might not have been an ardent supporter of the theory that the hound had sodall to do with devon how much does all this matter jane asked you cant do all his thinking for him nat amber said he gets an idea and hes off doesnt do his homework he didnt even know kennedy had scotched the herefordshire theory in at least two of his own books she turned to jane dartmoor gets a lot of houndrelated tourism americans japanese its like king arthur in cornwall they dont exactly want to share it jane gazed around the vast kitchen the high windows were full of pine tops and dark purple dusk it wasnt very warm in here what will you do now amber shrugged bens still desperately trying to get hold of antony to put him off for a couple of weeks while he rethinks everything he wont give up he cant weve very little money left and if we sell up now we sell at a loss whos antony what amber closed her eyes opened them and blinked a few times shaking her head despairingly sorry sorry jane i thought you knew about that antony largo old mate of bens from beeb days independent producer documentaries theres a series that his outfits putting together for channel four called punching the clock about successful people hitting hard times and having to make a new start in midlife so antony approaches ben and ben tells him to stuff it i mean he refuses to think of himself as being in midlife for a start its always the beginning for ben jane smiled it was one of the aspects of ben she most approved of but it started him thinking amber said and he told antony about his plans to pinch a piece of the sherlock holmes tourist trade and now hes halfsold him on the idea of a separate documentary on all of that which would have launched the whole thing nationally brought us a lot of publicity for the hotel and some sort of fee presumably also nat said the crew would have to stay somewhere so that would tide us over the lean period before christmas amber looked doubtful crews arent what they used to be its usually one person with a handycam from boots and theyd have been doing most of their filming during the conference of the baker street league when wed be full up anyway but that obviously doesnt apply any more were stuffed she picked up the double oven glove and slid her hands into it and covered her eyes jane wasnt sure if this was a comic gesture or concealment of actual tears she imagined ben telling amber about the idyllic countryhouse hotel hed found for them open log fires big warm traditional kitchen where she could work her magic cosy and romantic amber not realizing then that bens idea of romance was a howling in the night and a fiery hound on the moors natalie walked over and put an arm around amber the worldly big sister taller and leaner and more together we can still do something we can rescue something we need more time and we havent got it antonys booked in for tonight ben cant reach him on his mobile he could turn up any time amber lowered the oven gloves her eyes were dry look at this place its like some old workhouse no its cool jane said really its bloody freezing jane i keep on at ben to check out this damp patch under the stairs and he avoids it he thinks burst pipes mystically seal themselves this makes it four leaks weve had since the autumn does that augur well jane looked up through the window moving to her right so that one of the ridges of stanner rocks came into view it was a proven scientific fact that stanner rocks were strange because of the standing wave that altered the climate the comparative darkness of the rock itself holding the heat and the thin soil where plants grew that you couldnt find anywhere else in britain jane felt that in ancient times stanner rocks would have been sacred like some gloomy miniature form of ayers rock in australia i mean until you live in a place like this you never realize what plumbings about amber wailed theres miles of pipe miles i mean theres an energy here jane said and its right on the border on the edge were all on the edge amber said bitterly ben however when he strode into the kitchen seemed to have recovered now apparently relishing the adversity refocused i think well put antony in the tower room you couldnt stop him amber said in dismay i stopped trying ben in tight black jeans and a white shirt was swaying like a tightrope walker reestablishing his balance the more i think about it we dont need the bloody baker street league what we have is strong enough oh god amber said you dont mind going back to your old room for a couple of nights do you jane she already has amber said why do you want to put antony largo in the tower room more of an atmosphere ben smiled at jane dont you think jane must have blushed or something because ben smirked and said nip up and open the windows jane would you and give the bedding a shake right oh well up the steps into the lobby which now merged with the hall up the baronial stairs and when you got to the top of the first flight and turned right through the fire doors into the illlit passage towards the west it was clear why this part of the house although it probably had the best rooms had been set aside by the foleys as staff quarters the problem was it had been dragged into the s or s and left there the walls were lined with woodchip probably to hide the damp and it was dim and dusty a languid light drifting from a tall narrow window at the bottom of the passage this area of the house needed a lot of money spending on it money they probably thought theyd have to spare but now it had gone on the basics keeping the damp out and the heat in or trying to the first room convenient for the stairs was ben and ambers own what must it have been like when they first arrived here and they were the only people sleeping in this huge house this was mums problem with ledwardine vicarage magnified about four times a lot of the time even now ben and amber would be alone here during the week most of the parttime staff cleaners and waiters came in daily during the summer or when there were guests jane the fire doors clicking together it was ben forgot to give you the key he strode ahead of her down the passage near to the end unlocking the last door on the right actually she was quite glad to have him here with her stupid huh inside the door there were steps up into the actual tower and then another door when jane had first started work here shed been flattered and excited to be given the room under the witchshat tower ok it was big cold needed redecorating but it was like you know the room under the witchshat tower ben put on the light the room had gloomy maroon flock wallpaper pretty old and less than half as much furniture as a space this size needed to look vaguely comfortable the threequarter divan the wooden stool serving as a bedside table the mahogany wardrobe with the cracked mirror the aim apparently was to create an ensuite bathroom at one end and this was actually essential before you could legitimately charge anyone for spending a night here and experiencing those incredible views across hergest ridge into wales with the light on all you could see through the triple windows now was a thin slash of electric mauve low in the sky like the light under a door ben stood in the middle of the room rubbing his hands couldnt take it then jane sorry you wanted out well you know look at it its like sleeping in in somewhere too big thats all all no other reason should there be sod this she was giving nothing away she was going to make him say it ben leaned over his folded arms rocking slightly so you had a perfectly untroubled nights sleep dont people usually one of the builders when we were having the partition wall taken down between the hall and lobby he stayed in here and he didnt want to spend a second night oh he thought it was haunted what happened oh noises he reckoned breathing and he said he thought he saw a womans shape outlined against the window next morning he was not a happy man said he thought wed set him up jane struggled to bring up a smile did you set me up i thought well youre quite interested in this sort of thing arent you weird stuff soso ghosts are a bit i mean theyre usually just imprints arent they emotional responses trapped in the atmosphere nothing to worry about she was furious the bastard i mean i wish youd told me youd have been expecting something then pointless exercise so you wouldnt mind moving back sometime if necessary look ben i wouldnt mind spending a night in a sleeping bag on a station platform but id rather have an ordinarysized room thanks ben grinned ah jane what i shouldve realized the most important thing for you would be retaining your cool look my mothers he lifted an eyebrow did he know she thought not my mothers a vicar theyre not bothered by this sort of you know right ben said that was close she didnt want mum involved in anything here this was her separate thing so youre going to try this guy erm in here antony largo if you think youre cool i dont jane said smarting going to turn down the bed clothes ben smiled and shook his head and wandered out left alone jane shook out the duvet remembering how when shed come up here to dump her case that first night last weekend and then gone down to get something to eat shed returned at bedtime to find the duvet had been roughly thrown back as if someone had started to make the bed and then abandoned it that couldve been ben couldnt it setting her up otherwise just an imprint just an emotional response trapped in the atmosphere jane sorted the bed and didnt hang around drink problem theyd moved the bed so that it faced the window and the lights of west malvern from this position on a dark night it looked as though the lights were away in the sky big stars and you could feel safe for a while lol said thoughtfully does this mean you get your own cult merrily sat up the lights of west malvern were now quite clearly just tall narrow buildings on a hill all the lanes around ledwardine full of crutches and sticks abandoned by the roadsides lol said you think this is funny dont you and then she started to laugh and it was one of those laughs that you could feel in your toes and the tips of your fingers and the pit of your stomach therapeutic probably a healing laugh oh god not two hours ago shed fed ethel the cat left a second catmeal in the timer bowl for the morning and then driven quietly away driven over to the granary at prof levins recording studio in the frome valley for the healing van morrison sang that such an easy guiltless word the granary was a tworoom tower house reached by exterior stone steps lols temporary home romantic the trysting place he was watching merrily an elbow propped on the pillow to lean on he had his little round brassrimmed glasses on sorry the last time we talked about this you were a bit nervous but it didnt seem like anything you couldnt handle he sat up beside her what happened where to start she told him about alice meek and her nephew and about a letter this morning from a woman in hereford whose grandchild had cerebral palsy nobody she knew the letter concluding i said to my husband that the doctors were hopeless so we ought to give the church a last chance last chance lol said save my child or else show us some action or youre finished and the point is they can finish us its like if you do a gig and only two people turn up no more gigs and gigs are what the church is about hence alpha all the dynamic youthoriented stuff a good gig you gotta do a good gig but isnt that what youre doing on sunday nights well i thought so only it wasnt meant to be a healing gig it was about i dunno helping people develop an inner life but you discover that most people dont want an inner life they just want a good outer life and you need to be fit and healthy for that and if the church can take away your ailments hey thats cool magic like if you look at the medieval church all those pilgrimages to the holy shrines with sick relatives on stretchers hundreds of amazing cures attributed to st thomas of hereford the church works magic so the church becomes rich and influential youre still identifying more with celtic hermits in caves maybe they were even worse nothing to be responsible for merrilys head sank down into the pillow healings about taking responsibility how can you take responsibility for something that that you cant totally believe is going to happen god help me what about this bloke it can happen she rolled away i mean it can she was sweating jesus am i ever going to be big enough for this job whats his name canon jeavons llewellyn jeavons llewellyn with two ls canon with two ns as in loose thats what he said on the phone he jokes around a lot he doesnt have a problem with it then evidently not she turned back to face lol but then hes a bloke crass and insensitive confident of his tradition lol said whats basically wrong with this idea of a healing group responsibility shared with catholics and methodists and whoever pentecostalists lol sighed if you must his parents had been out on that fevered frontier accusing him of amplifying the devils music then swapping his picture on the mantelpiece for one of jesus christ this had been one of the principal milestones on the road to victoria ward and the syringewielding dr gascoigne immortalized in the creepy cathartic heavy medication day on the new album its probably the best solution merrily said but its got to be more than healing i dont want to run an allsinging alldancing medicine show sometimes healings a byproduct like when youre in love you feel healthier thats a good point holistic she felt better more complete it should always be like this yesterday shed thought it could be she hadnt told him why and there didnt seem much point now however later lying spooned on the rim of sleep she heard lols voice hesitant feeling his breath warm on her ear in the darkness theres a house in ledwardine a hollow moment for sale lol said oh a small terraced house in church street did you know lucys house she said no i didnt know not until it was in yesterdays hereford times and the week befores i found it while i was making a fire with the paper it kind of leapt up at me i only saw it yesterday youd think someone would have but why should anyone have told her about it for the past year it had just been a weekend cottage for two solicitors from luton they never came to church shed met them once briefly it was a small investment they didnt care whose house it had been and because they werent there during the week no estate agents sign had gone up im never going to be a star lol said but it looks like i might make a living out of it for a while enough to cobble together a deposit if i do the tour and the album sells a few cant stay here indefinitely prof needs the space every time somebody comes in to record im back in the loft over the studio its not really convenient for anybody did you ring them up about it the agents i thought id better talk to you first lol was rebuilding foundations hed faced an audience again after many years some of them spent on psychiatric wards circumstances had meant she hadnt been there for him when the unforgiving lights came up she never again wanted him to feel alone lol her throat was dry its gone its sold the house im so sorry i rang the agents this morning a cloudy silence across the room the lights of malvern blurred and she realized that her eyes had filled with tears lol said you rang the agents well i it just seemed like the answer to the problem separate houses just two minutes walk away i thought it must be meant i thought how delighted lucy devenish would have been to have you living there and i thought that if you couldnt raise the deposit maybe we could somehow do it jointly youd do that of course lol expelled a long breath and put both his arms around her christ she closed her eyes the last thing she wanted was for him to feel grateful but its gone she said gone in the paper for a whole week and we never saw it and then we both did too late like it wasnt meant to happen at all and the point was being underlined for us its become a very desirable place ledwardine merrily said she shivered slightly unaccountably in his arms a goose walking over her grave for a time just around the time he was realizing he wasnt never going to make it as a rock star or even out of farming danny thomas had been into some serious drinking never quite an alky mind but his name was written in big dripping letters on the walls of half a dozen pubs in kington and the radnor valley it ended when he got banned for a year greta wasnt up for ferrying him to and from the halfdozen pubs so that was it danny stayed home cheaper than the betty ford clinic and the music was better and it was during this period of nearabstinence that hed come to realize that what he needed more than the booze was crowds sometimes loud mindless crowds so when hed got his licence back hed rationed himself to two nights a week and made sure he didnt go out until half an hour before closing time when the pubs was packed and so many folks was pissed it was almost contagious which was how come danny missed all the action tonight down at the eagle in new radnor when sebbie three farms had to be escorted to his range rover they was all still talking about it when danny arrived at twenty past ten all familiar faces in here tonight from gwilym bufton the feed dealer ole joe cadwallader from harpton young robin thorogood the american from old hindwell with his missus and his walking stick moves like lightning has him up against the wall both hands round his neck knee in his crotch gwilym said never seen sebbie move as fast not after seven scotches anyway so who was this danny asked fetching his beer over who was sebbie having a go at tommy francis felinfawr gwilym shaking his head in disbelief tommy francis been mates since tommy had the hunt kennels only feller yereabouts dares take the piss out of sebbie went too far tonight mind oh hell aye thought he was gonner kill him jed begley said jed who built scrambling bikes the other side of evenjobb did a fair impression of sebbie whadja mean by that hey whadja mean but what did he say danny asked him what did tommy say all he said gwilym looked round for support all he said was must be frustratin for you seein that boy comin home to this tasty piece thinkin whats he got that i ent that right close robin thorogood said surprised the hell out of me way the guy reacted its about ground it is gwilym said always comes back to ground round yere sebbie wont never be happy till hes lord of all he surveys and he cant survey all his ground from any direction without he closes one eye to block out the nant and who in his right minds gonner close an eye woman like that around jed begley said and people laughed not danny though hed last seen jeremy and this natalie here at the eagle when he and his new partner gomer had dropped in to grab some lunch week or so back this natalie with a half of lager jeremy with his usual limeade and this unmistakable stiff quietness around them well dannyd been in that situation himself enough times him and gret but this kind of atmosphere so early in a courting boded no particular good jeremys face for the first time ever had seemed lined and creased and there was a brightness in his eyes that was like harsh sunshine in a leaden sky been bloody strange lately mind jed begley went on look at them gunboys did sebbie hire them boys or ent he danny had heard of this shooters on the prowl welshies ennit south wales aye hired to shoot foxes do that make sense danny said sebbies the flamin hunt barry roberts at the arrow valley gun club he dont get it neither jed begley said and he ent happy sides you seen more foxes than normal lately i ent no see what you got with dacre is a drink problem plus hes mad got his own agenda and he plays his cards close gwilym said always has done danny knows danny nodded said nothing sebbie dacre sebbie three farms magistrate master of the hunt robber baron of the marches with this fancy but phoney norman coat of arms over his porch and his customized range rover what passed for gentry these days an apology for it in dannys view but sebbie was influential supported the local shops and the pubs and the feed dealers and he employed local labour well normally he did sebbie dacre and jeremy berrows had lived side by side all jeremys life with no socializing but no real trouble although if you stood on any one of jeremys boundaries you could feel sebbie glowering like storm clouds massing this was because sebbies ole man having bought emrys morgans farm had put in a good bid for the nant that was wedged between emryss farm and the dacre estate but the owners sebbies own relations had sold it to the berrowses instead for no good reason except that they liked the berrowses which was no reason at all in sebbies view ent been the same since he got divorced jed said whats that ten years now not so much losin the wife and kid as what her cost him plus the fees for big weale which is why he dont let women get closer than a quick bang nmore and heres jeremy berrows and this totally spectaclar woman delivered to his doorstep jed going back into sebbiespeak whats this hey whats this about shouldve seen him drive off danny when we finally got him in his motor hunches over the wheel crunching his bloody gears you wouldnt wanner be on the same road like his nan ole joe cadwallader said suddenly in his high voice gwilym bent down to him wassat joe his nan youre all too bloody young thats the trouble his nan her used to go to the pub in gladestry fore the war this was idea of a woman goin in a pub on her own them days unheard of idea of a woman drinkin pints well idea of a woman goin to the pub havin six pints then gettin behind the wheel of a big ole car jeez robin thorogood said she never kill anybody ole joe cadwallader didnt reply because robin thorogood was from off he just looked around big smile gaping mouth like an abandoned quarry whoop whoop he said and then he finished his guinness the discussion died then people drifting away last orders had been and gone danny drifted to the door and was sure he heard ole joe cadwallader still sitting there behind him going very quietly like a whistling wind whoop whoop somewhere in the middle of the night the wind came in from wales and rattled the eaves and made the pines shiver jane rolled out of bed wrapped herself in her fleece and went to the window amber was right it was freezing here and it wasnt even december yet but that was ok she wasnt a guest she wasnt expected to be warm shed spent two hours helping amber finish redecorating another bedroom tarting the place up amber had said desperately in case they ever needed to accommodate a conference ho ho well it was more fun than cleaning lavatories and changing bedding and jane was starting to take the injustice of this situation personally now these were good people who worked hard even if ben was inclined to mess people around like he was still working in tv in a way she was drawn to his philosophy lifes like television if its on the screen it must have happened well why not it was a way of actually making things happen or like amending reality amber had talked about it in a disparaging way as though she didnt understand why it was so intoxicating jane understood shed been going out with eirion for nearly a year now and eirion was obsessed with getting into the visual media and she herself well only another year at school after this one decisions had to be made through the window there was a crack in the pane and a thin draught oozing through it she could see a vague orangey moon and the clouds were sliding across it like they were on fastforward this little room wasnt quite an attic and there were much better views from inside the witchshat tower but it was high enough to overlook some of the forestry and you could see across to the long plateau of hergest ridge and the sombre conifers under the moon and down to the celtic border this seam in the earth the secret snake which sometimes awoke and writhed she experienced that familiar longing to feel the border and all it represented points of transition cultures in collision but not from the tower room thank you there was something about that room that was essentially mindshrinking unpleasant basically haunted rooms were fascinating but not on your own if eirion was here the irresistible smile the allegedly puppyfat spare tyre well that would be a whole different ball game that couldve been almost fun only she hadnt seen him in a fortnight and in a couple of weeks time when they should be getting together for the christmas holidays intimate hours in candlelit corners he would instead be on a plane with his wealthy welsh family bound for st moritz or one of those other cheesy overpriced overcrowded playgrounds for bored tossers it had been arranged months ago before she had this job and she could have gone with them ok so her mother was only a vicar on a pittance but they could have worked something out sure they could could have applied for a lottery grant jane felt resentful and unsettled a tiny light was moving somewhere below the ridge a white light bobbing as if someone was carrying it perhaps the shooters again the shooters who ben had ordered off his land men with guns at night bad news or maybe just jeremy clancy said jeremy would sometimes creep out in the night to check on his stock jeremy was married to his farm clancy had said which didnt hold out much hope for her mother and jane had thought huh wondering how clancy managed to see it that way around when you saw natalie this cool careless beauty with jeremy this stocky hesitant little farmer with limited communication skills and hair like the fluff you found under the bed you were like what however this unlikely liaison had come about jeremy must feel like it was his birthday every day it lasted the bobbing light went out or it disappeared into the forestry or something shedding her fleece jane went back to her single bed wishing eirion was here like here now the ironic thing was that eirion had admitted hed rather be coming here talking to ben meeting some of the telly people not so much the stars as the producers who according to ben were likely to drop in over the festive season like this documentary guy for instance largo eirion could talk their language hed done work experience at htv wales other kids got to hang around behind the counter in the natwest bank eirion spent a fortnight with a documentary team family connections daddys directorships a distant gunshot had her springing back from the bed back to the window nothing no lights they were very close last night shed said to ben last sunday when theyd come in from the rain and hed been raging about the gun club yeah so close one of them was right inside her head shed awoken in the tower room must have been about three in the morning with this single colossal angry bang deep inside her head this swelling echoing explosion that awoke her instantly absolutely cold with fear immediately thinking the way you always thought at three in the morning of a brain tumour or something and shed felt just totally sick nauseous headachy and considering the size of that room so horribly claustrophobic that shed rushed to open the window sliding her head under the sash into the freezing night there it was out shed relived it and it was of course probably something for mum and mum was the reason shed said nothing this was what she did separate from mum the independent working woman on the border did not go crying to her mum jane wrapped herself in the duvet and lay on her back with her eyes wide open to the grey window it was crap when something awoke you in the night you wanted to be alive to the magic in life but all you could see was the injustice of everything and the fragility and the darkness beyond the glass beastie the breakfast table was a battleground and ben was on his knees when jane came in with the extra toast that nobody had asked for antony largo the independent producer was saying no no that is a wee bit unfair pal i certainly wouldnae use the word shite largo must have got in very late last night he didnt look like hed had much sleep that room and he wasnt eating much of the food that jane was putting out for him and ben breakfast was good for eavesdropping because you could make frequent trips to and from the kitchen with fruit juice and toast and coffee and you could hang around a lot in the doorway ben was in his jogging gear hanging back in his chair probably thinking he was looking fit and relaxed and glowing in fact he looked nervous and he was laughing too much jane was wincing inside for him the dining room at stanner hall was long and chilly its end wall encrusted with a chipped and faded coatofarms over the fireplace where unlit logs were piled into a doggrate opposite was this churchsize gothic window which still had some stained glass in veins of cold blue and blood red the two men were sitting under the window next to a flaking grey concertina radiator that made more noise than heat ok antony largo said were mates we go back i can think aloud with you he gave ben this level stare amusement in his eyes you tell me wheres the contemporary dynamic wheres the now drama coming from bloodied sunlight flared on bens forehead hed have done his usual run down the drive in the early mist up through the forestry and back into the gardens working up an excuse for the sweat actors ben said antony largo studied the toast the set of his shoulders said give me strength he said patiently we talked about that we said we could ship over a few famous faces from your illustrious past old friends sampling the accommodation that is no a difficulty thats not ben picked up the silver pepperpot and jane thought for a moment that he was going to whizz it at largos head but he just brought it down again on the tablecloth to emphasize a point thats not what i meant if we have one fairly prominent actor playing doyle this would be the only speaking part all the rest vaughan ellen would be shadowy figures half seen in black and white or sepia so thats yeah yeah itd be entirely workmanlike and perfectly acceptable at seven pm on channel five this is peakhour channel and requires viscera sorry pal it still leaves me half a dozen good thrusts short of a decent climax antony largo looked up at jane and winked my apologies hen jane grinned antony largo leaned back and poured himself some coffee with a name like that you expected armani and suave what you got were faded old denims and this honed glasgow scepticism he was about thirtyfive and wiry with oiled black hair he had one earstud and a hard bluegrey stubble he looked like one of those guys who stayed fit without jogging and never put on weight an honorary life member of the gymnasium of the street antony ben laughed again his anxiety lines deepening why do you always always start off by talking everything down this is not tactics pal antony leaned forward shaking his head slowly way back when there was advertising coming out the networks ears money falling from the sky we just fenced around a bit for appearances sake but that was then this is now independent tv drama bellyup and barely twitching yes but dramadocumentary is the new drama yeah doco is the new drama but a doco with no contemporary propulsion no plot line ok see it from my angle i walk in there and i go this is about where the sherlock holmes guy got his idea for the hound of the baskervilles but hey its not what you think and theyre going why would we think anything why would we give a fart because ben looked up and saw jane who realized she must be standing there blatantly listening maybe with her head on one side and her mouth slightly open she turned away and started rearranging things on her tray thank you very much jane ben said meaning piss off his laughter had gone tepid sorry jane gave him an uncomfortable smile and slalomed away between tables that didnt match at one time there would have been a single banqueting job down the middle of the room now the small separate tables looked mean and utility kind of cafeteria symptomatic of what was wrong with this place she didnt hear ben explaining to antony how he thought the tv people could be made to care which would have been interesting passing the foot of the main stairs jane could hear the bagpipe wheeze of amber vacuuming up there staying well out of it natalie was bustling in from the lobby long legs in tight black jeans red leather coat over her arm that the tv guys car jane the old lexus probably jane glanced over her shoulder bens struggling i dont think hes even got round to telling the guy theres not going to be a holmes conference oh essentially theyre talking at cross purposes jane put down her tray on the second step the upstairs vacuuming droned on suggesting it was ok to talk she brought her voice down bens flogging his hound line and this largos trying to convey that hes only interested in bens struggle to revive stanner when shed first gone in with the fruit juice ben had been saying how well they were doing he said hed altered some bookings to keep the hotel empty so hed have time to show largo around the guy would have had to be blind to fall for that where was all the staff for instance the hotel trade looks like a pushover till youre in it natalie said soberly ill be surprised if they can afford to heat this place through the winter its that bad natalie waggled her fingers suggesting borderline wonky when youre full up in summer it feels like the escalators never going to stop in winter the outgoings mount up theyve got three women in kington on standby for that conference who wont be happy to stand by in the future ben ought to listen more to nat she had serious qualifications in catering and hotel management clancy said her mother had been running a big hotel at looe in cornwall before suddenly resigning after a relationship with a man crashed then thered been another admin job at a motel near slough but clancy had hated the school there and theyd moved on again when the summer holidays came round nat had bought this old camper van and theyd just set off looking for somewhere that felt right being gypsies clancy said nat shifted her leather coat from one arm to the other so this guys not interested in the hound at all only as one of bens wild schemes to attract trade in this punching the clock series and that would depend on having famous faces actors people like that come to stay like out of pity thats how itll look wont it humiliations big nat said we love to see people going facedown on the concrete especially arrogant bastards from glamour jobs jane nodded morosely seeing it all now like she was viewing the rushes meaningful cutaway shots of damp patches and peeling flock wallpaper stanner hall looking halfderelict under wintry skies ben striding around like some manic basil fawlty figure shed neither seen nor heard anything of antony largo until this weekend and call her psychic but she guessed that shafting his old mate wouldnt leave him feeling overgutted the vacuum cleaner cut out jane glanced up the stairs which had a new red carpet an important buy according to ben make the punters feel special going up to their rooms she shouldnt be doing that i should be doing it nat eyed the tray she got you to serve breakfast instead because she wants to stay in the background bloody shame jane a class chef and youre an experienced hotel manager jane thought yet here you both are but she didnt say anything about that because ben and antony largo had emerged from the dining room largo saying oh right down the shitter ma friend no question there im no saying you didnt get out at the right time i just think there mightve been better ways of he stopped hed seen natalie and he was looking at her the way male guests tended to she was standing in a diagonal funnel of sun from the long window on the first landing she looked typically gorgeous and typically unaware of it this is natalie craven ben took a step that put him between nat and antony natalies my house manager nat raised an eyebrow antony put his head on one side im sorry but youre no an actress by any chance when nat started to shake her head and he could see she wasnt smiling he went on hurriedly with a thickening of the accent wisnae meant to be an insult natalie i just thought ben mightve called in some old favour she doesnt owe me any favours ben said tightly hey antony put up his hands no offence pal none taken ben was looking a little weary now nat if you see amber anywhere can you tell her im taking antony to the church to ah meet the vaughans or perhaps youd like to join us antony said softly to nat be good to get another perspective i er gather the vaughans dont have a lot to say these days nat smiled at him ive been there before also there are people i need to phone bookings to make she looked at ben like all the ones you put off this weekend she threw her coat over the reception desk why dont you take jane janes got a perspective on most things ben shrugged jane glanced at natalie thinking she ought to be upstairs with amber cleaning and redecorating but maybe nat wanted to find out how this situation worked out come back with a report cool time for your break surely nat said confirming it and youve never met the vaughans have you jane kington parish church was alone on the edge of the town from the road it looked like a country church walled and raised up against the cold sky ben didnt even glance at it just drove straight past the entrance in his old blue mgb with the top down antony largo was beside him jane fleeced and huddled into the little seat behind them her hair blown across her face that was a church wasnt it largo said the chunky grey thing with the wee spire we just passed ive changed my mind on the edge of the town centre ben had turned right heading back into the country raising his voice above the engines dirty growl im going to take the story in sequence can we no have the damn top up its jammed if you must know great do you good a bit of air i know whatd do me good pal but we left her behind largo leaned his head back thats no offence to you jane but i dont think your mother would approve of me i wasnt looking for a new dad anyway jane said hmm largo mused feisty they came out of a shady lane with detached houses in it and now they were in hilly countryside jane had never been down here before she had no idea where the road led the sun was pulsing feebly a blister behind clouds like strips of yellowing bandage and you can keep your filthy paws off my staff largo ben said mildly natalies in a relationship and shes bloody good at what she does largo turned to ben how would you even know what something fractured then largo bawling at ben raising himself up in the bucket seat come on what do you know about the hotel trade i mean really what have you done you maniac you couldve found something in the independent sector no problem like every other bastard gets dumped by the beeb you couldve gone to kenny and zoë fitzroy you couldve come to me for christs sake how naive is this find you can afford some disneyesque mansion wi wee towers for the price of your dockland penthouse and you have to grab it like its now or never ben gripped the wheel ive remarried in case you failed to notice i have amber to consider aye and that the wind made a grab at antony largos voice and the folded fabric of the cars roof flapped violently behind jane she sank down in the little seat to hear the rest of the stuff he presumably hadnt felt able to say inside the hotel an artist and turned her into a skivvy you had to prove you didnt need any of us im gonnae show these bastards im getting out of london and create a wee paradise and get mself fit and youthful again and make them all as sick as pigs how naive is that truth of it is you do need us you arsehole ben hung grimly on to the wheel slowing the car breathing in deeply swallowing something the building on your left he said finally through his teeth is hergest court disappointing like it should have been bigger must have been bigger once seeing it was built on a motte an obvious castle mound above unkempt grounds and what might have been an old pond even a moat it was about fifty yards back from the road part stone part timbered the stone end had a sloping roof the timbered end just stopped like its been sawn off jane said this is only a fragment of what it used to be ben had reversed into a track of hard mud and turned the car to face the house it looked stark the way buildings with timber framing rarely did there ought to be wooded hills rising behind it but there were only the cold fields and the waxy sky on the sawnoff side were sporadic trees a gloomy yew a bent pine and then some industriallooking farm buildings rather forlorn now i admit ben said been let out in recent years by the owners lived in usually by tenant farmers and it was even a rural art gallery for a while you can tell by the mound its built on that it used to be fortified way back how far back jane asked interested now more so than if it had been tarted up inside some mockelizabethan knotgarden well thirteenth century at least thats recorded its no my idea of baskerville hall antony largo said ben switched off the engine and the atmosphere between him and largo seemed to tauten like some invisible sheet of cellophane dividing the front seats jane hunched into a corner of the back seat and kept her hands in the pockets of her fleece no other vehicle had passed since theyd arrived no smoke was coming out of any of the three visible chimneys of hergest court by the fifteenth century it had become the house of the vaughans ben said the most important family in the history of kington antony stretched his legs and theyre your prototype baskervilles there is a longestablished baskerville family in the area which accounts for the name but the vaughans have the history the central figure is thomas vaughan who switched from the lancastrian side to the yorkists in the wars of the roses killed at the battle of banbury in he was known as black vaughan naturally antony said ben frowned because of his black hair apparently to distinguish him from his brother who had red hair maybe you could just not mention that jane said quickly it was hugo baskerville in the book wasnt it the guy who was supposed to have brought down the curse on the family a wild profane and godless man according to conan doyles baskerville manuscript ben turned around to face her conan doyle brings his legend forward almost exactly two centuries to the time of the great rebellion the english civil war so both the historical background and doyles created one feature civil wars which tore the country apart doyle puts hugo in the seventeenth rather than the fifteenth century its exactly how an author would muddy the waters and there was a girl wasnt there jane said a neighbouring yeomans daughter whom hugo fancies and abducts he drags her back to baskerville hall but she escapes down the ivy from an upstairs room that night while he and his cronies are getting pissed the inference being that hearing their ribald laughter she suspects that theyre all going to come up and gangrape her when hugo finds that shes gone his nights pleasure denied him he offers himself body and soul to the powers of darkness if he can be allowed to catch up with her again then he mounts his horse orders the hunting pack to be unleashed and rides off furiously across the moor with his hounds to hunt her down across the moor antony looked around do i see a moor ben frowned for which if we were shooting the scene we might substitute hergest ridge which begins he jerked a thumb at where the land rose steeply behind the car just there its wild it has its curious features and stanner rocks are surely as brooding as any dartmoor tor antony smiled what happened to the girl jane asked i dont remember hugos companions go chasing after him ben said theyre scared of what hell do if he catches up with her they encounter a night shepherd on the moor whos in such a state of terror that he can hardly speak he tells them hes seen the hounds pursuing the hapless maiden followed by hugo on his black mare and then silently following hugo the worst thing of all another hound antony largo laid on this melodramatically spooky scottish voice like private fraser in those old dads army episodes only bigger and meaner they eventually find the girl in a clearing dead of fatigue or fear ben said and then they find hugo and standing over him a great black beast bigger than any hound ever seen by mortal eyes antony largo said ben finally turned to him youve actually read it then antony of course ive read it you tosser im a pro i do my prep even for this sh so heres your beastie plucking at hugos throat and then it finally rips it all away antony clenched his teeth and growled until his own laughter began to choke him and it turns on these guys with its jaws all dripping with blood and flesh and its eyes on fire and they all shit themselves on the spot and leg it end of legend ben didnt laugh not exactly yeah ok from then on if the hound is heard howling in the night or seen prowling the precincts then its no what youd call a fortunate omen for the baskervilles it means death ben said we know that jane said but like how closely does that match the story of this black vaughan ben didnt reply he put his shoulder against the drivers door crunched it open and stepped out onto the edge of the road obviously not that closely at all antony murmured ben leaned against the car there are actually local people who wont come down here at night dont smile antony this isnt the city this isnt even the soft country vaughan was associated with a black hound which some sources suggested was in some way satanic now although the spectral black dog is a familiar motif in british folklore the death connection is less common but i can tell you that there are still some local people who just wont come this way for fear of meeting it on the road i have that on good authority say that on camera will they pal i dont know maybe jane glanced across at hergest court nothing was moving have people seen something its odd ben said you talk to people in town and theyll say oh old soandsos seen the hound hell tell you about it and then when you find old soandso he looks blank never even heard of it which is extremely unconvincing and in my view the denials prove the fact of it as i understand it whats been seen is a big black dog that disappears into walls solid things and there are other related phenomena that ill explain about later but in the book it was a fiery hound jane said which turns out to have been phosphorous paint like when the hound starts appearing again in modern times like victorian times it turns out to have been an actual dog that was starved therefore given a good reason to howl in the night and painted with luminous paint ben nodded in the novel the fiery hound is a scam and in the end sherlock holmes just shoots it jane said and it was all coming back now why did he have to do that the poor dogs already been deliberately starved for weeks i hated him for that she was aware of both men looking at her with curiosity ok i was young i didnt realize he needed a dramatic finale i was just sorry for the dog and thats all i remembered and thats thats why ive always hated the book sorry a land rover discovery came around the bend quite fast tyres skidding in a patch of icy mud and ben slid quickly back into the mg jane actually makes an important point there why did doyle give his novel such a prosaic ending a real dog and a pot of phosphorous paint it was a sherlock holmes story antony reminded him sherlock holmes disnae believe in ghosties yes ben hissed but doyle did this is the whole point a medical man a scientist but for the last twenty years of his life also a spiritualist the most famous proponent of spiritism on the planet the guy was beyond fanatical tours of britain and the states promoting what he considered to be the absolutely proven scientific fact of life after death in fact towards the end antony ben put his face to within six inches of largos doyle lived for bloody ghosties then something caught his eye and he straightened up looking away down the lane to where the discovery had stopped to let two men out ah ben said the two men both wore armytype camouflage jackets and baseball caps one of them pulled open the back door of the vehicle reached inside and then handed the other something that jane thought at first was a spade them ben said the rear door was slammed shut and the discovery moved on leaving the two men standing in the road they started walking up the lane towards the mg heads down like they hadnt noticed it was there jane thought oh christ two men one shotgun how very opportune ben said through his teeth he stepped out into the road antony largo raised an amused eyebrow halfturning and leaning back against the passenger door for a better view did he know the history to this probably not you know one thing ive always admired about ben antony said is his ability to move into a new situation and form instant and lasting friendships he folded his arms waiting to be entertained jane looked at ben already all workedup and dismayed because he was fighting for his and ambers life and everything hed thrown at antony had been deflected antony in his professional body armour and ben bareknuckled im just so much in the right mood for these scum ben said he moved into the middle of the lane and stood there with his legs planted apart rocking slightly the healing of the dead it was one of those cottages with very small windows and so few of them that it needed lamps on all day in winter merrily counted seven of them on tables and in nooks all lowwattage whiteshaded and strung out like a chain of beacons so that you navigated through the house from lamp to lamp there was a dreamlike feel to this one day when im really old canon jeavons was leading her down a cramped passage like a tugboat on a canal he was balancing coffee cups and milk and sugar on a tin tray there gonna be a nice plain bungalow with windows so wide you think you living on the lawn his voice was crisp and biscuity like on highquality fm radio a cathedral voice too big for a farmworkers cottage that probably had not been much updated since the wattle first met the daub he ducked through a doorway you must be the first person in a long long time ive never had to warn to keep their head low till they sitting down theyd arrived in a room that needed no lamp it had whitewashed brick walls a square of white carpet and an uncurtained window revealing a small fenced garden wide fields and a hoary wooded hill the room had a sloping ceiling suggesting that it had begun as a leanto a black castiron flue pushed through the ceiling at a crooked angle serving a glassfronted potbellied stove in which coals glowed agreeably there was an earthenware coffeepot on the stove homely this place used to be for the family cow jeavons said or maybe the pig sometimes i see just one big pig snuffling around in here raised like a member of the family many tears shed at the parting of the ways sometimes i feel the presence of a single cow but mainly the pig what do you feel merrilee unrolling her name like ribbon his accent was a carnival lazy caribbean towed by oldfashioned fruity english clerical she couldnt decide how much of it was laid on cows are good she said carefully and er pigs are even better indeed jeavons beamed take a seat he scooped a huge grey and white cat from a fat lemonyellow armchair and sank into it transferring the cat to his knees when merrily took a matching chair on the other side of the stove she found it was so overstuffed that her feet didnt reach the floor well now jeavons sat back his chins on his chest ms deliverance this is interesting indeed it is merrily looked into the big squashnosed greysheened face wishing she knew more about his personal history the established facts were that hed been a canon attached to worcester cathedral the legends told of a seeded tennis player cured of multiple sclerosis and a fire victim whose disfiguring facial scars had vanished within a week canon jeavons and the big cat both looked placidly back at her because youre still not quite sure how to handle it jeavons said are you im sorry all of this the calling the job and most of all i would imagine the complexities of deliverance its a problem of i was gonna say confidence but it isnt that you have a fear lots suspicious now when shed finally reached him on the phone shed learned that sophie hill had already called on behalf of the bishop to make sure that he was still available for consultation sophie would have told him a little about her but nothing personal sophie didnt do personal id say you have a horror of being considered he looked at her sleepily through halfclosed eyes pious she thought she must have shaken physically what makes you say that mr jeavons you must call me lew he said now that im retired she didnt call him anything she just stared he wore a linen jacket with wide blue and lightgrey stripes like for punting under it was something you always guessed must be available somewhere but not in any ecclesiastical outfitters a highnecked black tshirt with a white dog collar that was part of the design maybe hed got it from a joke shop see merrilee most of the female clergy of my acquaintance they all very proud of what they achieved for their sex after all these centuries they wear the dog collar and the clerical shirt on all possible occasions maybe they sleep in a clerical nightdress i wouldnt know about that but always when they come to see a male priest thats when its extremely important to them that they be seen as equals you by contrast no collar no shirt only a cross so discreet it could even be an item of jewellery and youre not wearing too much makeup or a short skirt either so youre married widowed for some years there is a man oh his eyes went into a squint the cat purred the coffeepot burbled on the stove hes a musician he helps out at a recording studio in the frome valley we see each other not as often as wed like and im not sure what to do about that your people know about him in the parish his gut pushed out comfortably like a flour sack and the cat nestled into it some mustve guessed by now he used to live in the village we thought there might be an opportunity for him to move back but it wasnt to be wasnt to be had she conveyed some sense of foreboding in that phrase defensive now this man could pluck away your secrets like specks of fluff what do your prayers tell you about this relationship jeavons asked i feel its the right thing at this moment jeavons nodded there was a movement outside the window a cock pheasant on the lawn merrily blinked there was something about the light in here the white clarity of everything after the dimness of the rest of the cottage it was like snowlight everything was lit she had the curious feeling of emerging from an initiation she said slowly feeling the words drawn out of her martin israel in his book on exorcism says that some degree of psychic ability is probably necessary to do this job deliverance and you think you dont have whats necessary jeavons said how did you know about me and the word pious i didnt sophie didnt let it slip that pious was my most unfavourite word in the dictionary and that i have a fear of sophie sophie hill the bishop of herefords lay secretary ah a lady of evident discretion and diplomacy no she didnt tell me that but then she wouldnt would she you on the other hand canon jeavons gripped the cat and the cat purred fiercely merrilee youre an open person aspects of you stand out as if you carrying a placard its in your manner the way you dress that big old volvo you drive no doubt youre capable of considerable discretion when it comes to the affairs of others but about yourself you drop sizeable clues you know the word pious jeavons rocked back laughing you aint gonna let this go are you listen it dropped into my mind things do that sometimes if we take the time to absorb what people are telling us about themselves directly and indirectly and we are in a suitable state of relaxation a contemplative state then the clues come together and a feeling or a word sometimes drops into our minds just like like a packet out of a cigarette machine she frowned you can also see the nicotine on my teeth your teeth are like pearls and its always right is it this thing that drops into your mind hell no sometimes its so far out i feel like a horses ass but when you get to my age times too precious to keep it to yourself and sit and wonder this as it happens is at the heart of spiritual healing taking the time to know people making small deductions how many doctors have the time or the patience to do that now talking and considering and leaving time for small leaps of inspiration no its take two of these three times a day or ill make you an appointment to see a consultant send the next one in on your way out one time minor ailments were resolved without the need for pills because pills were expensive and time was cheap and doctors country doctors particularly would often be spiritual people capable of insight from insight to inspiration is only a small leap which may be divinely assisted are you following my reasoning i think so good lets have some of this coffee he eased himself around the cat and stood up merrily said what happened to your wife he raised an eyebrow as if shed turned the tables on him im sorry i didnt want to god would not permit me to heal her jeavons lifted the coffeepot from the stove she died five years ago around the time they wanted to groom me for bishop maybe if she lived id have gone for that if only to see catherine in a palace instead a row i said to them you dont know a thing about me you just want me cause purple and black go so nice together in new labour britain i said im going away instead i want to find out for myself why my wife was not healed and did you maybe haw youre suspicious of me now you thinking im some kind of oldtime shaman out of a travelling medicine show we should start again tell me what you want to know you know what i want i was appointed as deliverance consultant for the diocese of hereford suddenly whichever way i turn im finding the word deliverance linked with the word healing and that would naturally scare you it scares you like pious because it would mean people start to see you as wonderwoman mmm difficult jeavons said the names ben said consider the names driving back into town he seemed reenergized setting out his case for arthur conan doyle basing the hound of the baskervilles on what had happened in kington talking about the way the book and this area echoed each other in unexpected ways and the real clincher the remarkable coincidence of names key characters in the novel look at the names baskerville obviously a prominent family in this area as weve established but then the others mortimer dr mortimer is the local gp the man who first consults sherlock holmes over the case now mortimer as jane knows is probably the most significant name in the middlemarches this was the core domain of the mortimer dynasty of norman barons commemorated in place names like mortimers cross which is just a few miles from here along the border antony largo said nothing all right ben said you might argue thats not such an uncommon name but what about stapleton stapleton the naturalist who turns out to know rather more about hounds than butterflies stapleton jane tell him where stapleton is oh jane recalled a fragment of ruined castle on a hill a farm a few cottages its a hamlet just outside presteigne thats right on the border too isnt it presteignes in wales stapletons in england just thank you jane ben nodded happily baskerville mortimer stapleton key names strung out along the midborder it could be coincidence but would holmes himself have bought that i really dont think so doyles delicately encoding the real history the actual location of the hound of the baskervilles jane was impressed but antony said so what about the cabell family of devon what about sir richard cabell whos supposed tove followed a spooky hound across the moor on his black mare after making a pact with the devil so that story fits pretty damn well and we know for a fact that doyle went to devonshire to research the terrain we even know which hotel he stayed at and see i found all this on the net very easily arthur went down to dartmoor with his golfing pal fletcher robinson a devonian in fact robinson himself was said to have come up with the story for which doyle insisted on giving him a credit in the strand magazine which serialized his stuff am i right im not disputing that antony ben shook the wheel lightly however and was this on the net the then editor of the strand said that he understood fletcher robinson obtained the original story from and i quote a welsh guidebook i can show you that reference in two biographies of doyle so while i couldnt deny that he borrowed elements of the cabell legend to flesh out the scenario all the evidence still says it starts right here and the small fact that the coachman doyle and robinson employed in devon was one harry baskerville how does that equate my friend oh jane was dismayed is that true perfectly true ben confirmed and baskerville himself assumed that his name had been borrowed however stashower in his biography of conan doyle points out that doyle mentioned the proposed title the hound of the baskervilles in a letter to his mother before he and robinson went to devon before he even met harry baskerville i can show you the reference antony didnt reply jane was delighted the awkward encounter with the shooters seemed to have given ben a blast of confidence it had been almost funny these two guys with their south wales accents up from ebbw vale claiming theyd been hired by a local farmer to get rid of foxes well jane had realized at once that this was bollocks the usual situation with rough shooting was that guys like this paid the farmers for the privilege anyway the shooters had got totally the wrong idea assuming that ben despite the jogging kit was some local hunter warning them off his patch and ben being ben hadnt corrected the impression hed played to it jane could hear his voice changing acquiring this military edge initially hed just been rescuing the situation saving face but in the end hed had the ebbw vale guys backing defensively away up the public footpath to hergest ridge bawling after them bloody cowboys your cards marked in this area believe it he might not have been potentially one of the greats as amber had put it but he was still a bloody good actor and now he was on a roll his argument flowing so like why did conan doyle transfer the whole thing to dartmoor jane asked ben shrugged lifting his hands from the wheel dont you find that interesting in itself also why did doyle decide to rubbish the concept of a ghostly hound in the book when in real life hed have pounced on it with all the enthusiasm he lavished nearly twenty years later on those patently faked photos of the cottingley fairies right jane knew those pictures closeups of innocent young girls faces with these archetypal arthur rackhamstyle fairies frolicking in front of them obvious fakes now but convincing enough in the early days of photography it wasnt so much of an indictment of conan doyles gullibility ben turned into the tarmac drive leading to kington church whats also interesting is that originally the hound wasnt going to be a sherlock holmes story at all doyle had already killed holmes by then dragged over the reichenbach falls in the arms of his archenemy moriarty and then he writes whats become a famous letter to the editor of the strand announcing his plans for the hound with the words i have the idea of a real creeper but you see it wasnt at that time going to be a holmes adventure at all so when holmes was brought in doyle wrote the story as if it was something that had happened prereichenbach and did he antony eyed ben thoughtfully some respect at last jane thought im sorry i know he was a fellow scot but my knowledge here is a wee bit scant did conan doyle write other stories that were essentially supernatural ben nosed the car into some bushes where the ground was still furred with frost he pulled on the handbrake with a fusillade of ratchet clicks and switched off the engine yes antony of course so when he decided to make it a holmes tale he knew thatd be an aspect going out the window holmes being the ultimate rationalist if holmes is gonnae solve the case there has to be a rational explanation yes and what im wondering was doyle specifically asked by the baskerville family or someone else to put in some distance theres a traditional belief in this area that he was distantly related to the baskervilles who were in turn way back related by marriage to the vaughans obviously theres still a lot of research to be done here hidden connections he didnt have to use the name at all though did he still hell of a good name isnt it where would that title be without it still buzzing like hed been snorting coke or something ben stepped out onto the frosted grass come and meet the vaughans there was no tradition of shamanism or the priesthood in lew jeavonss family hed come to england from jamaica as a teenager his father working on the buses as a young man he went to new york where he was ordained and met an englishwoman on attachment to harvard an academic and we found our way back here which i always felt was my home you were into healing in america well ive always thought i was channelling healing he nodded at the big cat on his knees talk to lucius about it he was run over on the main road at fromes hill in the summer the driver didnt stop im the next car along and i pick him up along with his exploded intestines take him along to the vet who puts back the intestines shakes his head takes out his syringe but i shake my head bring lucius back here to be my cat for whatever time he has left he looks brilliant he limps a little now thats all cats respond directly to love and handson people are more complex my wife she shouldve recovered that was the point it wasnt such a big heart attack they didnt think it was a bypass situation i was convinced she was going to recover fully and i took my eye off of the ball and she had a second heart attack i was leading a healing ministry in oxford at the time and we were all full of it missionary zeal hey this is what the church of englands been lacking for so long and in the middle of all this healing frenzy my beloved wife she just ups and dies happens within a month what was that saying to me what was he telling me you mustve been bitter and bewildered i didnt think i was arrogant i didnt think i needed bringing down and there you see that proves i was arrogant my first thought was that it was because of me that she was taken away god telling the big healer you are nothing man how old was she fortynine no age yes i was bitter sure i was bitter what do they think we cant hate god because were priests merrily said the problem i have with this is the obvious one some people recover some dont some people who are prayed for really really prayed for by many people i know so all the hopes build up and in the end its a lottery or its not our decision not a decision we can or should try to influence despite what the gospel oh boy jeavons said you really dont get it do you we do it because its all we do its fundamental the care of bodies the care of souls the care of the living earth its how we develop within ourselves by suffering through our failure and trying again and suffering some more we suffer merrilee a doctor fails to heal someone he says well hell i prescribed all the right drugs i did what i could but we must suffer and that isnt what you wanted to hear is it i dont know what i wanted maybe you just dont understand about the nature of suffering and that suffering can be a truly positive state we should discuss this sometime why wasnt your wife healed merrily said jeavons lifted both hands from the cat held them in the air sat there in the white room like a bare rock on a beach freshly washed by the tide was the answer one he couldnt accept had he been forced to conclude in his suffering that her faith her faith in him lew had been insufficient was that it he opened out his hands a candid gesture it was because i didnt understand at the time that there was more than catherine in need of healing in this particular instance i didnt know i didnt know about the healing of the dead at home with the vaughans jane was kind of tingling now antony largo had demanded wheres the contemporary dynamic wheres the now drama and now he had his answer there was a totally worthwhile mystery here deeper than the grimpen mire subtler than phosphorous paint and panting for telly jane carried the excitement with her through the uncoloured wintry churchyard to the door of the church of st mary the virgin there were quite a few churches hereabouts dedicated to mary a sign of norman origins according to mum the conquerors emphasizing to the conquered that they had the support of the spiritual bighitters from the plateaued churchyard you had a wide view of the welsh hills above the english town and the beginning of hergest ridge a peninsula into wales the sky had closed in now the clouds tightening around the sun reduced to a hole at the end of a greywalled tunnel used to be a norman castle up here ben said soon abandoned though its thought the church itself was providing community defence against the welsh by about the thirteenth century people shut themselves up in the church jane looked up at the squat tower with its stubby steeple the tower was separated originally from the main body of the church ben said it has walls a good six feet thick apparently now i wont have to buy the guidebook antony said as they followed ben inside thanks jane had never been in here before shed been expecting stark and utility and she was surprised at the size of it and the luminous grottolike darkness the way the stained glass bestowed this old rosy warmth so different from the frigid dining hall at stanner although ben said some of the stained glass had been put in around the same time heavy victorian restoration then but it had worked there was a big window with generous reds and oranges and warm blue and opposite it high up in the west a tiny circular one with a white dove fluttering out of crimson the age of the place was underlined for visitors by a big modern white plaque listing all the ministers of kington beginning back in the days when parishioners would be putting the sixfoot walls between them and the marauding welsh hugh chabbenor rhys ap howell john walwyn ben was strolling around in the tinted gloom with his hands behind his back all this was far more spectacular in the middle ages were told wall paintings ornate screens antony was shaking his head slipping jane a wry smile that maybe contained just a touch of affection for ben perhaps he was at last getting into bens groove finding the motivation feeling the dynamic there were only the three of them in here or so it seemed as ben led them back towards the door past a table with guidebooks and magazines on it he stood there facing them jane could tell that he was in holmes mode again a sheen on his domed forehead the curly hair around it absorbed into the dark ben was excited well can you see them yet huh jane looked around such a sense of drama antony murmured he and jane were standing by the font to the left of the entrance ben stepped to one side extending an arm into the body of the church to their right from the side of the chancel nearest to them a different light a colder light was washing between the bars of a wooden screen from a stained window beyond this window was full of blues and whites and a thin gold and the light was hazy jane was aware of a separateness light colour mood about that whole area evidently a side chapel and then she saw two heads together from behind an alabaster couple lying on a hard white bed the wooden screen its headboard may i present thomas ben said softly and ellen it was one of those still hollow moments the heads conveyed a superiority an arrogance an hauteur jane hadnt noticed them before and now they were all she could see two effigies on a spectacular offwhite tomb at ease with their backs to the pews and to the door confident of their place in the medieval church of st mary the virgin and in history at home with the vaughans ben was saying cosy isnt it the double tomb came up to janes chest on the side nearest to her eight anonymous carved figures some of which might have been monks or even angels stood behind their shields to protect the remains inside black vaughan in fact all white now was nearest the altar his effigys praying hands projecting from its alabaster chest its face bland and cleanshaven jane noticed right away that below the feet of the effigy was a dog it was a disappointment however too small to be any kind of hound unless the fifteenthcentury monumental mason had reduced the scale to make it fit onto the tomb a lifesize hound would have spread over the whole width of it and under the feet of the woman jane thought vaughans own feet seemed too big like cartoon feet its like hes wearing doc martens she giggled for like giving the peasants a good kicking irreverence was compulsory in this situation the way these arrogant bastards had always claimed the place nearest to god like they honestly believed god was naive enough to fall for it but as soon as shed spoken she was sensing disapproval unsure of whether it was coming from ben or she was projecting it to black vaughan or his lady the lady might have been beautiful it was hard to judge from a tomb she wore a long gown with a girdle her slender arms bared in prayer on her pillowed head was a small cap fashionable probably coquettish maybe not her face was solemn but what would you expect what does it mean that theyre praying jane said i mean like are they praying for mercy because of all the corruption in their lives all the people they shafted all the peasants they exploited comely wench though antony observed nice body whats her name again ellen ben stood at her feet his hands clasped in front of him as if he was about to join the vaughans in prayer ellen gethin also known as ellen the terrible antony tongued his top lip to conceal a smile i trust that disnae mean she was terrible in the sack jane grinned nervously ben frowned it was because she killed a man antony tilted his head is that a fact she came from a village called llanbister over the border in radnorshire had a younger brother david of whom she was very fond he was killed in a sword fight with his cousin john hir a row over an inheritance ellen was shattered and bent on revenge she was a strong woman a formidable woman looks maybe taller than her man antony noted described as having masculine strength sexy though shut up antony ben said antony peered down at ellens breasts then looked up at ben and grinned jane said what happened there was an archery contest at llanddewi near llanbister ellen went along disguised as a man john hir was the champion archer and she challenged him john put his arrow into the target ellen put hers into john feisty antony said is it true or a legend its believed to be entirely true although it does rather correspond to a few classic myths about the vengefulhuntress figure its said to have happened in after ellens marriage to thomas vaughan she must have been a very young woman at the time because thomas was killed at the battle of banbury nearly forty years later i like it antony said we couldve used it ben turned to jane antony did a channel documentary series a few years ago about the psychology of women who kill women of the midnight aw i hated that title antony said it was imposed on me what i had in mind was to call it my milk for gall something like that lady macbeth jane said unsex me here and take my milk for gall you murdering ministers i wow she stared at antony with new respect this man was actually the producer of women of the midnight that was like heavy stuff not admitting that she hadnt actually seen it having been only about ten at the time but she saw now why ben was courting antony so assiduously she was fairly sure that women of the midnight had won some prestigious award for channel which must make antony a seriously influential producer like if he brought in an idea people would listen to him the people with money to hand out so the main problem for ben was convincing antony himself and perhaps this would be the only problem too late now though huh antony was looking down wistfully at ellen gethin again ellens eyes were shut such a shame ben purred jane thought milk for gall lady macbeth myra hindley ellen would probably have fitted nicely into the format antony moved away from ellen and stood at the feet of thomas with his doc martens and his little alabaster dog so what about this guy ben shrugged we dont know very much about him he was born in was initially a supporter of the lancastrians during the wars of the roses but for some reason changed sides one version says he was on his way to the battle of banbury in when he was captured by the lancastrians accused of treason and beheaded his body was brought back here and was he like hugo baskerville a bad guy a tyrant we dont know we dont know what kind of man he was when he was alive hes better known for his activities afterwards all the accounts say he made a very angry and destructive ghost haunting the stretch of road between hergest court and kington often in broad daylight rearing up in front of women and causing farm carts to overturn what did he have to be mad about dunno but its said the town was in terror the road to hergest was shunned taboo got so bad that kington market began to suffer because nobody wanted to come vaughan could change shape tormented horses as a fly appeared in this church as a bull roaring through the pews during a service but not a doggie that came later ben said after the exorcism jane said what apparently it had taken twelve experienced ministers to deal with vaughan all of them gathered inside a circle drawn on the floor at hergest court each with a lighted candle there was also a woman and a young baby presumably newly baptized and presumably representing purity when your mother was in the trade and left books lying around you learned quite a lot about the history of dispensing with demons ben said the story had been chronicled by the herefordshire folklorist ella leather and before that collected by the border diarist francis kilvert hell of a struggle candles going out slanging match with vaughans spirit but they eventually reduced him to something small and manageable and then they confined the spirit in a snuffbox snuffbox this angle sounded familiar and jane figured she was bound to have read about it at some stage in mrs leathers book it was a big book with thousands of stories many of which you forgot because they werent strictly relevant at the time shed go back to it check all this out vaughans spirit had expressed an aversion to water ben said so they buried the snuffbox at the bottom of hergest pool as you would antony said it would dramatize beautifully and if you wanted some authentic stuff on exorcisms jane said my mother might be able to she broke off her hand touching ellens white shiny elbow how broad and muscular that arm appeared now jane drew her hand away best on the whole not to say anything to mum about this she wouldnt exactly be in favour of dramatizing an exorcism however many centuries ago it had happened ben and antony were both looking at her of course ben said your mothers a vicar isnt she um yeah with a special interest in this area jane sighed had he heard whispers was mums name still mentioned at this end of the county in connection with her runin with the creepy evangelist ellis whatever it was too late now shes erm the deliverance consultant for the hereford diocese diocesan exorcist as was but like on second thoughts i think it would be best if she didnt know i was involved in anything like this dabbling you know they discourage it how interesting ben said she just got pushed into it by a previous bishop who thought itd be cool to have a woman operating in that area look i really dont want to tell her about this ok if you want any information weve got lots of books at home i could get you anything you needed fine ben said super you really are a slippery bastard foley antony said ben didnt look at him ah we dont know precisely when the vaughan exorcism was but the inference is that vaughan was never seen again not in person anyway however as recently as two women were visiting this church when one of them distinctly saw the shape of a bull form in the atmosphere in here jane glanced from side to side she said it seemed to coalesce as if it was composing itself from dust motes in the air she was from solihull in the midlands a tourist oddly her name was jenny vaughan the bull didnt do anything it just formed and then presumably dissolved again like a show of strength and the hound antony said its known simply as the hound of hergest it was said to appear before the death of a member of the vaughan family there were nine generations of vaughans after thomas and ellen and the last one to live at hergest court died childless at the beginning of the eighteenth century but the phenomenon remained other people over the years are said to have seen the hound in the lane leading to the court and a former tenant of hergest used to speak of hearing what sounded like a large dog padding across the floor upstairs this was quite recently and folk died not as far as im aware though perhaps some vaughan descendant somewhere ok its interesting antony conceded so tell me how important would it be to the devon people to prove that the conan doyle connection here is a load of shite well it makes them very angry indeed i only need to show you the terse letter ive just had from this guy kennedy of the baker street league whos evidently poisoning a lot of people against me it drives them crazy and youd take them on i mean im not sure thisd be enough but if you really got them fired up look this has become terribly important to me ben said its not just financial any more i mean not just a question of getting publicity and an image for the hotel sure itd be wonderful to be able to afford to fully revictorianize stanner down to the last gas mantle in the last lavatory which is how it started ill admit but its so much more than that now its about winning the border jane knows what i mean the borders a hard place a testing place people fail here all the time because they havent earned acceptance they dont have links with the past theyre not part of a tradition they dont understand he was standing beside thomas vaughan black vaughan the white blue and gold light was behind him he was giving antony largo his piecetocamera framing himself in the light the way hed done as holmes in the final act of the murdermystery weekend at stanner damn right id take them on ben said me and thomas and ellen he gazed into the two white faces i feel in a strange sort of way that were kind of a team now following this dramatic and jane thought slightly unhinged assertion there was silence in the chapel just as ben had intended what he hadnt intended was that it should be broken by a slow applause the sound of two hands clapping which was eerie enough in this setting to make jane turn around very slowly ask arthur she really wasnt spooky that was the first thing she had a wellworn sheepskin coat around her shoulders and a yellow silk headscarf and suede gloves jane didnt recognize her until she pulled off the scarf bravo mr foley she shook out her pale hair golly what a trek ive had your manager said youd be down at hergest court by now so of course i drove over there silent as the grave as usual never mind here we are yes bravo awful man neil kennedy ive always thought meanminded and elitist may i come in antony stepped aside to let her into the chapel his head tilted quizzical ben looked confused for a moment and defensive and then jane saw his hands flick as though hed suddenly turned over the right page in some mental cardindex of course you were on the murder weekend mrs elizabeth pollen beth beth yes and youre still here im often here mr foley i only live at pembridge good lord ben said weakly as though he was bemused that anybody who lived close enough to stanner hall to know what kind of dump it was would want to pay good money to stay there but jane was placing mrs pollen now the youngest of the agathas hanging out with them in the hotel bar in the evenings but clearly not a part of their weekend coachparty sleuthing scene the only time shed come out of the shadows was on that last night when shed tried to persuade ben to expand on the hound reference and ben had deflected it no way he could deflect it now beth pollen folded her silk scarf like someone who didnt have too many of them under the heavy coat she wore a pale grey dress and she was very slim mothlike probably in her late fifties but it was hard to be sure mr foley first of all as a member of the baker street league id like to apologize for the way kennedy treated you over the conference i was very much looking forward to that yes ben admitted quite a blow the membership wasnt consulted of course were treated like geriatrics most of the time i may forget to pay my subscription next year after this however ive been speaking to your manager mrs craven and i think we may have an alternative proposition to put to you ben blinked the league not the league im afraid our coffers may not be as deep as the leagues but i hope we can strike a deal mrs pollen placed her folded scarf in the cleft between ellen gethins alabaster waist and her praying hands isnt she adorable isnt she proud shes got something antony agreed sorry this is antony largo an old colleague of mine bens expression had sharpened jane noticed at the word proposition weve been discussing some tv possibilities so i hear mrs pollen wore this soft knowing smile and jane realized that her surprise arrival at the church had to be down to natalie the professional hotelier plotting efficiently behind the reception desk to retrieve a situation which could put her out of a job people i need to phone bookings to make it had to have been nat whod told this woman about kennedys brutal cancellation jane guessed that ben too had worked all this out look he said im terribly sorry beth but with so much happening im afraid ive rather forgotten you havent forgotten anything mr foley dont fuss ben ben her figure might be light and wafery but her voice was low and warm and soothing like dark coffee all you really need to remember is that while i might be a member of the baker street league i have a much more meaningful role with the white company and no you arent expected to have heard of them either one of doyles books surely antony said its an historical novel of which he was enormously proud about medieval mercenaries and i suppose it is rather good arthur as im sure you know considered holmes to be very much a secondary creation and always hoped to be recognized as a great historical novelist as far as were concerned though the white company was simply a phrase that came through repeatedly to our mr hardy and it stuck which gratifies arthur although im afraid most of us havent even read it im afraid i havent either ben said mr foley mrs pollen placed a calming gloved hand on bens arm that doesnt matter and the deal was done more or less right there in the cold blue vaughan chapel silently witnessed by ellen and thomas the white company would hold their annual conference or moot as beth pollen called it at the stanner hall hotel in the week before christmas effectively replacing the baker street leagues original booking there would be more than twenty of them including wives and husbands not as many as the league and unlikely to spend as much on meat and drink given that over half of them were vegetarians and too much drink was not encouraged even over the festive season like ben cared at this stage of the game facing the coldweather heating bills the burst pipes and the need to keep the fridges stocked for the benefit of a handful of masochists who were into punishing winter walks and cold bedrooms in the hollow of the night he must surely have wondered if the hound itself was out there somewhere howling to herald the death of the stanner hall hotel but now it was all turned around again they discussed special terms ben meeting every suggestion with absolutely talk to natalie about it knowing that nat would organize the very best most workable terms leaving ben to float around being entertaining and amber to cook antony largo had been leaning against the wall between the tomb and the stainedglass window arms folded listening to the onesided negotiations behind a foxy little smile which it seemed to jane was fronting a deeper amusement so beth antony casually uncoiled from the wall the white company is what exactly jane saw ben throw him a look that said back off she guessed that ben on the threshold of the bleak season didnt give a toss if the white company was a society of rubberfetishists as long as they left a deposit beth pollen gave him a candid look i think youve already guessed mr largo but you could humour me well the society was officially formed in the fiftieth anniversary of arthurs passing arthurs passing ah beth youre dropping wee clues the whole time well of course i am ben said antony would you please no no mrs pollen lifted a hand it was originally called the windlesham society after arthurs muchloved last home in sussex it wasnt terribly well supported in the early days and many of the members were rather elderly and found it increasingly difficult to get to meetings after a few years it faded virtually out of existence and then about six years ago alistair hardy of whom you might have heard a fellow scot big country beth antony said im sorry we do tend to think that because someones eminent in our particular field he must be a household name alistairs a very wellknown trancemedium from edinburgh his spirit guide at the time was dr joseph bell who if you recall doyles tutor at edinburgh university medical school impressed young arthur with his incredible deductive skills thus becoming the prototype for holmes himself arguably a useful guy to have as your spirit guide ben whispered youre spiritualists jane had to laugh mrs pollen said approximately six years ago dr bell communicated to alistair hardy that a friend and former student of his was most anxious to find an enlightened audience because he didnt feel his work here was complete now i wonder who that would be antony said beth pollen merely raised an eyebrow at him in the last years of his life arthurs beliefs were derided but lets not forget that when it was introduced in the west in victorian times spiritism was considered a science and had enormous credibility when arthur first applied to join the society for psychical research in its presidentelect was arthur balfour who would later become prime minister did i know that antony wondered i dont believe i did new technology was rampant if we could pull voices from the air into a radio set capture images on film how long before we would all be seeing and talking to the dead mrs pollen made a wry face by the twenties we had commercial aircraft phones cinema but spiritism wasnt felt to have come up with the goods so it was considered a crank fad everyones idea of a medium was madame arcati from noel coward so its quite reasonable to suppose that arthur was biding his time jane thought and she seemed such a balanced woman the way you always refer to him as arthur antony said suggests an affection hes our patron after all youre all spiritualists were all spiritists but were not all mediums if thats what youre asking im not essentially were a group of people committed to furthering the work which occupied a good twenty years of a fine mans life he was how should i put this a somewhat credulous man antony said avoiding bens agitated gaze not as credulous as his critics would have us believe mr largo he fought two elections he campaigned on behalf of the wrongly convicted he was a passionate liberalminded man who constantly questioned his own beliefs and fought against injustice the whole of his adult life his only flaw if thats how you want to regard it was a desire to offer hope nobody spoke for a few seconds mrs pollen turned away and spread her scarf over ellen gethins face as if she wanted to protect her from cold scepticism aye ok ill buy that beth antony leaned back against the wall im just no gonnae ask if you dont mind under what circumstances conan doyle became your patron the short drive back to stanner started in silence antony lounging against the passenger door of the mg chewing his lip and watching ben drive with one hand on the wheel and his hair flowing behind him bens expression was so bland that jane knew there had to be frantic action behind it which was understandable because like jesus coming up to the bypass antony said unsmiling my friend if this is a setup i think it would be wise if you were to tell me right now ben didnt look at antony jane had the impression hed been expecting this we go back pal the open cuff of antonys denim jacket rolled back along a muscular forearm and his forefinger came up like a knife but not far enough that i wouldnae he grabbed at the dash as ben spun the mg into the side of the road then up onto the grass hitting the brakes hard and tossing jane all over the small back seat sorry about that jane ben took both hands from the wheel and half turned as if offering his heart to antonys blade look ill say this once until half an hour ago all the white company meant to me was a boys own adventure story that i had no particular wish to read youll forgive me antony said for thinking it was all a wee bit lucky from your point of view it was quite awesomely serendipitous but im telling you i knew nothing about it this is natalie jane thought sliding back into the narrow rear seat saying nothing holding down her excitement nat arranged for all this to be unveiled in front of antony and whatever youre paying her it isnt enough you wanted a contemporary dynamic ben said now youve got one and some and you think theyd play ball all the way you came bloody close to asking her matey i was nearly soiling myself with anxiety im no quite that stupid antony said i realize that to appear too eager at this stage would not be the thing no ben leaned back into his bucket seat even i couldnt have dreamed up a woman with both a personal axe to grind against neil kennedy and a desire to prove if only because she happens to live in this area that the hound begins on the border and to set it up for us like i mean you can see it cant you to think i was originally going to offer you as a frame the tired old baker street league debating the origins of the hound jesus when all you needed antony said was for someone to ask arthur its what they do antony its what they bloody well do so were looking at this alistair hardy who has the temerity to claim dr joseph bell as his spirit guide seems like it at stanner you heard what i heard ben slid the gearstick into second and drove back onto the bypass and you think theyd let us shoot it all of it like theyre no gonnae give us any of this privacys crucial to the success of the operation kind of bullshit are you kidding listen some months after doyles death in more than five thousand people attended a memorial seance at the royal albert hall during which a chair was left empty for him how private was that and did he um manifest they had a wellknown medium called estelle roberts and doyles widow jean was on the stage great formal occasion everyone in evening dress a sign on the empty chair simply read sir arthur conan doyle and lady jean was seated next to it though she admitted she didnt expect to turn round and see him shucks however estelle roberts began the proceedings by describing several spirits present in the hall and their identities were confirmed by members of the audience plants benjamin antony sniffed mediums work with more plants than alan bloody titchmarsh antony im not making a case for the veracity of it im simply applauding the clever building of dramatic tension sure a few dozen people were unconvinced and some of them just walked out to the evident dismay of mrs roberts who started complaining that she couldnt work under these conditions then somebody started playing the organ to drown out the ah sounds of dissent and then just when it looked as if it might all be falling apart the medium suddenly shouted out ben raising his voice against the buffeting air he is here they rounded a bend in the bypass and the wooded face of stanner rocks was up ahead with those knobs of stone projecting like crumbling body parts and there was old arthur in the chair antony said placidly smoking his pipe well the medium claimed to have seen him she described him as being in full evening dress and striding with his old vigour across the stage to take his reserved seat always keep em waiting mrs roberts said arthur gave her a message for lady jean which she promptly passed on unfortunately it was drowned out by a dramatic fanfare from the organist and nobody in the audience dont antony do not say a word nobody in the audience heard it but jean maintained for the rest of her life that she was utterly convinced by its content that the message had come from her husband make of that what you will doesnt matter does it antony said as they slowed for the hotel drive doesnae matter at all not a toss they glanced at one another and they both smiled well i think im coming ben antony said i think im nearly there pal not in front of jane antony ben pushed the mg between the grey gateposts topped by damaged hounds wait till you get to your room and they both started laughing big mates again schoolboys his room was this some injoke she was not unaware that ben had never mentioned the room where antony had slept or asked him if hed experienced anything at least not in her hearing jane leaned back against the hard rear seat and wondered why she wasnt joining in ben glanced very briefly back at her and then at antony and she knew that look from a long time ago it was like pas devant les enfants she looked quickly away from them up through the strobing of light and pines to the turreted profile of baskerville hall and then ill tell you the rest ben murmured to antony and thatll really bring you off pal serious requiem you sound like you badly need to talk sophie hill had said when merrily phoned jeavons was right she was an open book the lights were on in the gatehouse when she drove under it alongside the sandstone cathedral was crouching like a big ginger cat in the rusting remains of some late sunshine in the office sophie had the kettle on most saturday afternoons shed go into the gatehouse office to sweep up the remains of the week what was he like bewildering merrily sat down at the desk by the window enigmatic worryingly perceptive you liked him he has charm she gazed through the window into broad street where the street lights were coming on along with chains of coloured bulbs newly hung across the road although christmas was still no more than a threat sophie poured boiling water into the white teapot i did some research so far this year six ministers in the diocese have made inquiries about the possibility of holding healing services i spoke to three of them one said i think we should be seen to be doing something another stressed he wanted nothing to do with deliverance figures merrilys attempt to set up a deliverance advisory group was still in the tray marked ongoing some of them quite obviously didnt want to know because she was a woman a month ago after consulting her over the phone about certain technicalities one rector had gone off and set up his own small group all male to deal with an alleged presence at a village shop theyd never told her what had happened another one sophie said volunteered to be involved in any healing initiative if there was someone else to lead it and as long as it wasnt and i quote anyone like jeavons sometimes one has to acknowledge that the clergy as a profession can be rather dispiriting sophie wore her mauve twinset her hair was white in a dog collar she would cut a reassuring figure but it would never happen sophie knew too much about the church merrily got out her cigarettes there were some things i hadnt realized about jeavons it came out when he told me about the death of his wife and why he couldnt heal her and yet might have if hed known then what he knows now sophie turned off the main ceiling lights switched on the desk lamp and set the teapot down between merrily and herself go on they actually went upstairs together ben and antony up the red carpet that ben had bought instead of rewiring or a dampproof course jane thought they looked like two kids whod found a porn cache she found natalie putting up christmas lights in the cocktail bar a room not yet fully victorianized it had pale green walls and colonial cane tables and fake oak beams across the ceiling supporting nothing so how long have you known about mrs pollen jane said nat was standing on the bar itself arranging the lights between steel hooks projecting from the oak beam over it why are these bastards not coming on maybe the fittings need tightening jane said stay there she climbed up from a stool to the bar and picked up the end of the string of miniature bulbs beth pollen found you then nat said at the church jane started turning the first peabulb in its plastic holder she seemed ok surprisingly why shouldnt she be nat had her reading glasses on the end of her nose and she peered over them at jane nat looked good in glasses would have looked good in a neck brace she got into it the way most of them do bereavement husband theyre not all cranks i just cant imagine ever wanting to contact someone whos dead cant you jane thought about it the thing is i knew a girl at school who thought she could do it and there was this other girl with problems who got involved and she was like unhinged mentally disturbed and the whole thing pushed her over the top it was unpleasant in the end horrible and your mother wouldnt like it would she spiritualism jane looked up thats nothing to do with it im not exactly intimidated by the church she tightened a second loose bulb the lights still didnt come on you do know what theyre planning dont you yeah i was just wondering if you did or if you were fishing pollen sounded me out during the murder weekend so when the baker street league went down she told you then at the murder weekend that the white company wanted to like seek confirmation from conan doyle that this was the source of the baskerville thing no that seems to have occurred to them later pollens late husband worked in the archive department at powys county council and he was interested in stanner she has copies of various deeds and documents so she knows a lot about this place she said how did i think ben would feel about hosting the company and i said why dont you ask him jane said hes like a little kid over it it fits in nicely doesnt it all the lights had come on a garish string of alternating sour lemon and livid blue natalie stared at them in clear disbelief do you think ben got them from the county highways department they look like fucking warning lights jane let go of the bulbs but didnt get down from the bar nat just now in the car ben said there was something he had to tell antony that would like you know really clinch things whats that about huh he gave antony a look like not in front of the kid and when they came in he took him upstairs oh you do know what its about right natalie frowned possibly but he wouldnt have been bothered about you hearing it hed have been she shut up as the door opened and then she turned and smiled and made a tada flourish towards the grim christmas lights well we got them working amber were just not sure if were glad or not amber in jeans and a mohair sweater stood in the doorway with her hands on her hips she looked horrified for gods sake theyre awful switch them off natalie tweaked a bulb but the lights didnt go out whered he get them i dont really care lets just get them down i think that pipes burst nat i think the whole heating systems all to cock oh hell nat said listen has he told you we have a mass booking ambers eyes widened jane saw a certain fear there i think im going to let ben tell you about it himself nat said not for me to pinch his glory where is he entertaining mr largo somewhere or other dont panic lovie its a week or so off yet well get some more lights by then well get the plumber well make this place look almost festive well the bits we allow them to film film oh i think so nat jumped down good eh and when amber had edged anxiously away nat smiled and shook her head and jane said why dont you want to pinch his glory its all down to you just that she may not thank me when she finds out nat said hell maybe want to choose his time jane she hates this place enough already if she knew thered been a murder it might not jane came down from the bar top in a hurry youre kidding long time ago before world war two pollen told me and i checked it out with that guy sampson who played the major and then i told ben what happened he decided to keep it to himself for a while just a domestic thing jane one of the chancery women killed her husband no big mystery no need to gather the suspects in the drawing room she was pissed at the time apparently natalie started to bundle the alleged christmas lights together on the bar top and they sent blue and yellow stripes flaring across her face on the one hand it adds to the atmosphere of the dump on the other might put some people off you dont know do you jane said erm did it happen in one of the bedrooms i think it was outside actually in the gardens merrily told sophie that sometimes she wished she was a catholic or belonged to some hardline nonconformist sect with strict liturgy and rules instead of guidelines just it would be nice to meet two deliverance ministers who operated to the same rules is jeavons a deliverance minister sophie asked not strictly but yeah of course he is in the cause of healing the sick he actually goes further into it than most of us this is where deliverance meets healing the healing of the dead his wife catherine merrily watched her cigarette end smouldering in the ashtray this cool fiercely intellectual academic theologian jeavons had said that he and catherine had been married in new york where he was a priest and she was lecturing as she was english and hed lived here too he wanted them to marry in england but catherine wouldnt hear of it nor would she invite her parents to the ceremony and when the jeavonses did eventually come back as a married couple she didnt even notify them whatever she told jeavons about her background it wasnt the truth some years later catherines father made contact with lew someone had sent him a local newspaper picture of the reverend and mrs jeavons when lew became rector of a parish in lincolnshire the old man said he and his wife had parted and hed very much like to get in touch with catherine again jeavons had been surprised to discover that catherines father was a fairly wellknown cambridge theologian hfh longman longman told jeavons thered been a row about an unsuitable boyfriend while catherine was at university but catherine still refused to see her father and became very agitated that he knew where she was so much so that jeavons had to negotiate a parishswap which was how theyd wound up in worcestershire merrily looked down into broad street nearly dark now the lights misting sophie poured more tea and merrily told her about the second time catherines father had been in touch when he was terminally ill begging lew to persuade his daughter to see him one more time before he died jeavons had told her shed regret it if she didnt and perhaps something would be lifted if she did although in the end she gave in catherine had refused to have jeavons with her at the cambridge hospice where longman was in his final coma sophie leaned back into the shadows behind the desk lamp when she got home merrily said jeavons was leaving for an international conference in cape town when he got back about three weeks later shed lost weight her hair was unwashed shed been drinking he found bottles of whisky under the sink and she was distant didnt want to talk to him and then she moved her stuff into a separate bedroom a temporary thing she said she just needed time on her own a few weeks later she had a minor heart attack i took my eye off the ball was how jeavons had put it and hed done it again after the doctors had given catherine a tentative allclear and the situation between her and lew was gradually restabilizing took his eye off the ball because this was when he was being courted by both the church and politicians hed thought shed secretly like the idea of him in episcopal purple when catherine had the second heart attack lew had thrown himself into three desperate days of prayer and handson rarely left her bedside never slept the bitterness and selfrecrimination lasting long after catherines funeral and the memorial service and lews rejection of the purple hed located catherines mother to ask if she wanted to be at the funeral and she hadnt even replied but some months later he tracked her down he said he was in a rocky mental state himself by then could often feel catherines presence in the rectory he said he awoke one night and saw her in the doorway of his bedroom but he could only hear the sobs as echoes at this stage lew had said he was close to dumping his ministry having been offered a teaching and community post back in brooklyn hed had his letter of acceptance in his pocket ready to post when the motherinlaw hed never met had arrived without warning at the rectory and hed finally learned the truth about his dead wifes relationship with her father oh god sophie said irritably intellectual sparks between a father and his brilliant daughter her mind excited him longman used to say that apparently when she was at oxford hed visit her at weekends sophie snorted jeavons said hed often suspected there might have been someone else someone she still thought about remembering the unsuitable boyfriend never imagining how unsuitable the boyfriend might actually have been its more common than we might imagine among the socalled educated classes sophie said they encourage their children to be liberalminded makes me sick merrily shook out a cigarette the reason catherines mother had come to see him was that she also was experiencing problems maybe it was guilt at having walked away or at her own resentment of catherine understandable its often hard to draw a line between mental unrest and and the other thing lew brought in another minister a friend to bless the vicarage sprinkle holy water around in the room where catherine had slept then they held a requiem eucharist for catherine in the presence of her mother which in normal circumstances you might expect to resolve it it didnt got worse he didnt go into details but he gave back word on the brooklyn job and just spent a lot of time praying for an answer also putting himself through a kind of ritual scourging sleeping in the bedroom that catherine had switched to because he felt it was their room you know the father jeavons felt that the fact that shed been there at the hospice when the old man died even if he wasnt conscious at least she thought he wasnt conscious that this might have created an opening maybe something had been reclaimed something renewed her father had wanted her back with him you know sophies face was hollowed behind the lamp thats horrible merrily sick lew didnt know what to do or who to turn to for advice just kept on returning to that bedroom every night with his bible and whenever he awoke which was several times every night hed pray for help he maintains that to heal we often have to suffer a priest must go on suffering without complaint until something turns around and you dont have to look very far into the new testament for his sources do you sophie looked momentarily anxious and then stern i do tend to wonder if you really need this merrily tell a woman about the need for suffering and you touch a very deep seam anyway it came to lew one night that there should be a requiem for this person hed grown to hate hfh longman so lew jeavons his motherinlaw his deliverance friend and two other colleagues gathered in the bedroom lew doing the honours part of the suffering merrily paused and sophie said he told me he went to bed that night for the last time in that room and he awoke in the night as he always did but this time he didnt feel the need to pray he simply turned over and and the other side of the bed was warm he got out of bed pulled up the sheets and went back to their old room sophie leaned forward into the lamplight merrily felt the heat of her own tears and was irritated somehow he gave me a copy of a book called healing the family tree by kenneth mcall who was a priest and a doctor i knew about it never read it it argues that your mental and physical health is often conditioned by your ancestors they fuck you up your mum and dad and their mums and dads and so on genetics merrily shook her head maybe related im no scientist jeavons spent about three years researching all this here and abroad visiting societies where the placating of the ancestors is still considered allimportant which was controversial as some of them were more or less pagan he thinks his wife was in some way destroyed by her father from beyond the grave lew thinks if hed known what he was looking for if the socalled maladjusted essence had been dealt with earlier catherine might still be alive like so much of this job its hard to separate the spiritual from the psychological he also talked about this tennis player kim redmond who was supposed to have been cured of ms jeavons said he spent a lot of time talking to kim and it came out that the kids father and his grandfather were both doctors and the grandad was furious when kim walked out of medical school with his tennis racquet accusing him of betraying the family and his obligations to the sick as if medicine was an ancestral obligation sophie said a tribal thing mmm during kims first wimbledon grandad dies by the end of the week just after the funeral the kids having nightmares beginning to feel his body is no longer his to control his games shot to pieces the doctors eventually start to suspect the worst jeavonss solution was a serious requiem for the old man conducted at the church where the funeral had been held and it obviously worked sophie followed tennis or something did the docs said it was probably an initial misdiagnosis which they would wouldnt they similarly you could say that the requiem the emotional weight of this ancient solemn ritual had an immediate psychological effect on kim removing the burden of guilt and related symptoms anyway jeavons says we generally do half a job who us deliverance because most of us dont take into consideration the true psychic weight of the family or tribe and because were only concerned about the dead when theyre conspicuously haunting us jeavonss view is that the dead always haunt us whether were aware of it or not sophie sat up thats untenable hes virtually saying every one needs deliverance to a degree and then in no time at all youve become like that man ellis exorcizing everything from the demon drink to the demon tobacco merrily said not as bad as ellis maybe but its perplexing its the quickest way to a nervous breakdown if you ask me sophie said my advice for what its worth is to avoid this man and all he stands for hes a very influential voice in deliverance worldwide he showed me his computer files hes in contact with more than three hundred priests in the us canada africa australia all submitting records of their work building up this huge database on the healing of the dead there are people out there whove been trying to heal i dunno hitler stop sophie pointed at her very calm very stern stop now dont go near that man again merrily just dont welshies the smoky dusk was settling over stanner rocks when gomer parry picked jane up in his truck and she wondered if he could see some kind of glow coming off her cold ole night janey gonner have at least one big snow before christmas id say gomers teeth were clenched like a monkey wrench on his ciggy with antony largo as the only guest amber and ben didnt need jane to stay over so shed phoned gomer and arranged for a lift home but before she left antony had cornered her and put this proposition to her and it was like incredible me and danny we falled this ole dead oak for mrs maginn cwmgaer gomer said then we sets up the tractor and the sawbench cuts him up for her stove gomer was now spending most days at danny thomass farm in the radnor valley ten minutes from stanner while his yard was cleaned up after the fire and the big shed was being rebuilt danny was gomers new partner in the planthire business which made all kinds of sense with gomers nephew nev dead and danny having discovered how much he hated farming rural serendipity in the dimness of the truck with no dashboard lights working jane watched the tip of gomers ciggy receding towards his mouth he had to be over seventy now not that anybody would ever prove it mum always maintained that gomer had his own organic generator and you could sometimes see light in his glasses when there wasnt any around to be reflected serendipity maybe antony would change his mind maybe it wouldnt happen she wouldnt be holding her breath exactly but like wow hope that buggers still paying you janey sorry foley word is he ent doing brilliant business dannys gretas sister she yeard as they wanted help in the bar over christmas and then when she gived em a call they said they was all right now but there ent been nobody else took on otherwise herd have yeard dont miss a thing yereabouts gret and grets sister thats bollocks jane was annoyed it was sunk deep into the collective psyche of this area the joy of failure in fact things are really picking up theyve just had a major conference booked from off of course from off offs where the money is gomer true gomer wasnt parochial himself he just mixed with people who were and nat can handle the bar anyway gomer slowed for the roundabout at the end of the bypass thisd be miz natalie craven jeremy berrowss friend why what are they saying about her jane had often wondered although she could probably guess oh hippy gomer said not danny mind he dont call her that that was probably because danny was a real hippy jane thought as gomer cleared the roundabout and the sporadic lights of kington were behind them dark fields on either side there was plenty folks see wanted jeremy to get back with mary morson after this do with the plant feller from the rocks well marys ma particly on account of jeremys worth a bob or two this plant feller he was just on some government work scheme gone now and never even said he was off im sorry gomer im not getting this she was interested naturally the enigma of nat and jeremy mary morson her was engaged to jeremy ok two year or more sure tbe then her goes to this rock music night at the eagle with some mates meets up with this smoothy plant feller you mean one of the botanists working on the rocks for the hereford and radnor nature trust there was a study project jane knew centred on this rare plant the early star of bethlehem found on stanner rocks and virtually nowhere else in britain sure tbe gomer confirmed bit of a fling course mary morson reckoned her could easy go back to jeremy on account of jeremy he ent going nowhere is he he dont never go nowhere that boy wont leave his stock no moren half a day but meantime this natalie turns up sudden with the kiddie in this van no accounting for circumstance janey served the bitch right if you ask me gomers grin flashed in the gloom exackly what dannyd say danny reckoned her was good for jeremy this natalie bring him out of isself quite right jane said she stared at him was good gomer clamped his teeth on about a millimetre of ciggy boy ent right nmore janey how do you mean but he just shook his head and said nothing and jane didnt push it maybe she ought to have pushed it if only for clancys sake but everything else was looking too good tonight the heavy stuff started for danny not long after he got in it started with greta pulling off the lefthand channel of his big old wharfedale cans and booming down his ear like her was taking over leadvocal danny sat up who greta said it again slowly jeremy berrows needs help at the nant urgent wont tell me nmore but you just be careful what you takes on danny thomas because bugger danny blinked at the telly the foo fighters still roaring somewhere in his brain the telly was on but danny had been watching the woodburner like he always did when he had his music playing on winter nights just gazing and gazing into the glass they had these lovely barndried ash logs on there tonight burning bright orange and molten gold just coming up to perfection and he could smell his tea cheese toasting and the curtains were drawn against the cold black night and bugger danny laid the cans on the back of his armchair where his head had been and greta shoved the cordless at him yeah danny ar they wont go away what they wont listen to me its like i ent yere theyre all over the yard all over the meadow what you on about who danny had greta leaning between him and the woodburner trying to hear what was coming down the line he waved at her to get out of his heat welshies jeremy said where are you im in the house i come back in the house see ent no way i can deal with all three of em danny i got the kid with me clancy well that dont know whatter do dont want no cops yere theyd just turn it back on me or itd get in the papers they threatenin you danny i ent good in these situations you know that lemme get this straight jeremy welshies this would be a raiding party come over the bloody border is it could say that jeremys voice had gone faint i dunno danny basically i dunno whats gonner happen when jane walked into the kitchen it was clear that mum hadnt been in long coat over the chair bag on the table jane placed her own overnight bag very carefully by the kitchen door shed need to get it upstairs as soon as poss tried not to keep looking at it as she helped mum cobble a meal together it might snow mum said from the fridge gomer said that i bet itll all be gone by christmas though i dont remember a white christmas there was one when you were little mum came over and looked at her with evident suspicion did something happen no why you seem strangely energized its the wonderful world of work invigorating jane sawed hard at a farmhouse cob keeping her head down over the bread knife hell was it that obvious are they going to want you much over christmas hard to say i think theres a conference of some kind coming off so um you got over to lol then er yeah good triffic bit of a drag though driving all the way over the other side of the county every time you feel like a proper chat actually we thought there might have been something mum went to the sink to fill the kettle well lucys old house in church street was for sale yet again and we thought this time well lol thought he could raise the deposit jane dropped the knife looked up in real delight wow really that would be incredible lucy had been lols mentor had helped turn him around after alison kinnersley dumped him it was what lucy did the naturemystic the keeper of the villages soul touching all their lives when theyd first arrived in ledwardine becoming janes fairygodmother figure kind of before dying thrown from her moped on the road near the old powell orchard only it was erm sold mum said before the agents could even get a sign up no we shouldve seen it earlier in the hereford times you dont think do you oh god that wouldve been so totally perfect like for both of you is there no chance mum shrugged whos got it looks like a weekendcottage situation bastards jane snatched up the bread knife that is so in a country this overcrowded there is no excuse for anybody to have more than one home its just like so totally unfair why dont the sodding government bring in some kind of crippling secondhome tax probably because most of the cabinet seem to have three or four homes each i think theyre lawyers from london these people well you have to do something with all that money dont you jane shook her head in sorrow mum im so sorry it wouldve been brilliant and lucy shed have wanted it more than anything she forced a smile plus it wouldve been somewhere for you to move into when ive left home and you finally come to your senses a retirement home oh its my firm belief jane said that youll be out of the church within two years you wish mum walked across the kitchen and scooped up the overnight bag id better get this lot in the washer before no mum turned with the overnight bag dangling from her hand jane frantically aware of the bulge in the side of it and of mums eyes narrowing she thought fast put that down at once cant you ever sit down and relax ill do it in the morning when when youre in church there was this horrible tense moment before mum did her wry smile and dumped the bag sounds like youve had a lousy enough day already jane said snatching it up god how close was that night exercise danny remembered the last time hed had the callout from jeremy a soft summer morning the air full of warm scents the brownhaired woman waiting in her caravan sending out the secret siren calls that only jeremy would hear now under an icy sky slashed by a thin moon danny backed gretas old subaru justy out of the barn little grey car discreet dont make no bank holiday parade out of this greta was opening the galvanized farm gate for him yowling the whole while you ent called me in half an hour im phoning the police you got that danny thomas whole bloody valley got it danny wound his window tight shoving a random cassette into the player turning up the sound cautiously in case it was one of grets jackie collins storybook tapes danny had his giveaway hair pushed up under his woolly hat no need for the buggers to know who he was the welshies sebbie three farms hired guns here according to the popular folktale put around by sebbie to reduce the fox population which was bullshit basically because there was never enough and never would be enough foxes around for sebbie dacre and the middle marches hunt and also seeing there was a local gunclub that would be only too grateful to be viewed by somebody as a bit useful why had sebbie hired from off the subaru sloshed down the track the tape on the stereo turning out to be the creedence collection starting with susie q which was all right but if it got as far as bad moon rising before he reached the nant danny was gonner take it as an omen truth was nobody knew why sebbie dacre had hired shooters from south wales to scrat about pretending to be after foxes you didnt go out of your way to fire hard questions at boys from off with loaded guns but when these boys was invading what was likely the only farm along the whole border that didnt have no firearms of any description that was seriously out of order dannys view of it at the walton turnoff he could see all the way to old radnor church jutting up like a castle on a horizon turned jagged by quarrying then just as creedence were unrolling proud mary the forestry rose up darker than the night sky making him feel like some insect crawling into a yard brush what you had to understand first about jeremy berrows see was that he was an only child normal thing was for a farming family to have a spare but eddie berrows was killed outright in a tractor accident when jeremy was still at school and his mother was pregnant at the time and her lost it likely due to the stress and that was that jeremy growing up knowing he had full responsibility for the farm there was still farm labour to be had cheapish in them days so they got by till the boy was sixteen and could take over official meantime it was like all his ole mans knowhow had come seeping into him from wherever his ole man was and now jeremy was truly part of his land in the way danny had felt part of the whole valley that time way back when hed dropped acid in the four stones field except that with jeremy who didnt even drink this was a natural chemical thing an organic thing ditchwater in his veins youd see him standing there like a little thorn tree bristling with the breeze stanner rocks behind him and the ewes around his legs if jeremy had played music this would have been his album cover and it was something close to mystical he just wasnt good with people that was all boy was shy and if folks thought he was just another thickasshit hillfarmer that was all right with him let the other buggers do the talking let sebbie do the shouting and go on thinking he ruled the valley sebbie three farms master of the hunt and all he surveyed except for this thriving little holding right in the middle of sebbies three farms that belonged to jeremy berrows danny took the gladestry turn always reckoned he knew this area as well as anybody but he still needed full beams to find the entrance to the nant no sign see used to be one till jeremys mam went into the sheltered bungalow in kington but jeremy didnt need telling what was his so when the sign fell off it stayed off and that was that full beams was a bit of a giveaway but the track was narrow and the ditches either side were four feet deep sure to be the headlights found some new trees that jeremy and the woman must have planted with strong stockades around them and chicken wire to keep the sheep off how many farmers planted trees without there was some big environmental grant for it jeremy berrows natural greenboy firm custodian of the land friend to all of christ danny slammed on both feet hard down the justys little tyres spinning and squealing like piglets in the mud the track had curved to the left and this big motor was blocking the whole of it like an outsize bull no lights without his own headlamps danny wouldve been up the back of it no question the justy slurped and stalled leaving danny slumped over the wheel breathing heavy mustve stayed there about half a minute getting hisself together switching his lights off before pushing his hair back under his woolly hat and climbing shakily out of the justy close shit danny staggered up to the big motor it was a discovery metallic light green with camouflage effects sprayed on he hated this paramilitary crap despised these bastards already still he made good and sure there was nobody inside the discovery before setting off to walk the last fifty or so yards to the buildings keeping to the narrow grass verge beside the ditch aware that hed left the justy blocking the way out too bad he was still shaking in the country the worst accidents happened on farms in his joltedup state hed forgotten to bring a torch with him but the place looked to be well lit up already the track ended in the farmyard with the black and white house to the left and the old stone barn on the right and one wall of the barn looked floodlit like an old church the big bay doors were shut but danny noticed that the small one to the side was ajar and this was where most of the light was and there were shadows moving and he stood there on the edge of the yard screwing up his eyes to try and make out what was there then calling out in a friendly kind of way hello there this was just before the light went out and he heard footsteps coming at him from three directions making him instinctively start whirling round clawing at the blackness when the light came back on a few seconds later it was full in his eyes and he was near flattened by the violence of it eirions voice in the phone said you total insufferable bitch how could you do this to me jane carried on unwrapping the package the mobile wedged between ear and shoulder she was smiling shed dug the big jiffy bag out of her overnight case and brought it over to the bed mustnt drop it on the floor an expensive and complex piece of equipment like this jane you still sure shed kept the overnight bag between her knees all the time she and mum were eating then said shed just have to whizz upstairs to the apartment to freshen up and unpack well eirion said look its the way it goes sunshine nobody compelled you to go to the alps with your creepy stepmother and a few corrupt members of the welsh assembly and their bimbos i think it was john lennon who said life is what happens to other people while youre busy shooting the piste with a bunch of inconsequential tossers right here we are jane released the camcorder from the bubblewrap and lay back on her bed with the phone i cant stand it eirion said whats it look like what sort is it well its a sony jane held the camcorder over her face with one hand she was going to have to cool this a little or he wouldnt play ball it says onefifty and some letters its kind of dinky sounds like the kind they hand out to people doing these videodiary pieces the punter sets it up on a tripod in his room and whispers intimate thoughts at it if it gets broken it doesnt make a major hole in the budget has it got one of those flaps you unfold like a wing and you can see the picture hang on jane sat up yep theres a flap cant see anything in it thats probably because its not switched on sockets for external mike could be couple of those little pinhole things in fact theres an actual microphone as well separate its longer than the camera eirion moaned piece of crap then is it irene no eirion sighed its a tidy bit of kit for the money and itll get very credible results on automatic setting jane im gutted yeah well im sorry i truly wish you were going to be there youd probably get much better stuff than me are you trying to make it worse whats he like antony hes quite funny very cynical at first you get the feeling he really couldnt give a toss but then he latches on to something and you can see this steely intensity in his eyes of course i dont know these guys like you do and i didnt realize he was that famous hes not famous jane pro doco guys are seldom famous hes respected is what counts which is what brings the work in and i mean why would a guy why would a guy of his stature allow an evil little bimbo like you to shoot for television they had him backed up against the farmhouse wall battering him with white light the fuck are you danny didnt respond stood there with his head bent away from the raging light knowing that they had him wedged in somebody pulled off his hat and his hair came down over his face nearwringing with cold sweat looks like one of them fuckin travellers another voice said higher younger danny placed the accent in the valleys somewhere down where there used to be coal mines and jobs a good fifty miles from local anyway it was them the light veered away from him and he looked down and saw the lamp one of them items you could send for out of the glossy catalogues that dropped out of local papers ten million kilowatts guaranteed to throw a beam halfway to rhayader assed you a question mun hot soupy breath in his face assed you a fuckin question what i am danny said through his clenched teeth is a feller got hisself invited yere by the owner unlike some bastards bullshit hes just a fuckin tenant is all scum he is it was blasted into his face along with some spit the light hit him again like a big white fist just giving him time before he had to shut his eyes against it to see two blokes in armylooking camouflage gear one with the lamp the other with something that was likely a rifle with a telescopic sight try again the welshie said im a neighbour whore you on your own youll mabbe find out just now danny said and cried out as somebody grabbed his hair and hauled his head back and they shone the light directly into his eyes and when he shut them the night turned bright orange like the logs in his stove danny jeremy his voice coming from above probably an open window call the cops jeremy danny said surprised how calm he sounded still held by his hair with his eyes tight shut from behind another bloke said ok hes on his own then they let go of dannys hair and he couldnt feel the heat from the lamp any more and he risked opening his eyes a fraction the first thing he saw was the gun oh shit danny said it wasnt what he was expecting it had a shortish single barrel and a skeleton butt like the end of a crutch look he said nervous as hell now whats this about if you didnt know better you might figure these blokes for the sas on some night exercise all the instructions shouted rasped out like soldiers and armed police did on tv a performance designed to put the shits up you and it was working no bugger in these parts had a gun like that not even danny said sebbie dacre sent you right shut the fuck up nathan the younger voice from a few yards away i can year the bastard movin about fetch the fuckin light now you wont move will you mun the closeup welshie said cause if we has to come and find you we gonner beat the shit out of you no arguments wherem i gonner move to danny just hoping jeremy had got over his suspicions of the police and was on the phone to them right now failing that it was all down to gret this wasnt normal not by a mile hes comin out the younger voice a shrill excitement there you could almost hear the adrenalin crackling boys with guns unstable danny saw one of them swing round levelling his rifle at the halfopen barn door going into a crouch behind danny back at the house there was the sound of a door bolt being slammed back no jeremy the boy bursting out of the farmhouse from inside the barn there was a scuffling of straw maybe the sound of something panting then a shadow was rising up in front of jeremy and he was going errrrrrr like all the breath had been punched out of him you dont wanner get hurt little man thats thats my jeremy fighting for breath thats my dog danny ran out into the yard the barn doorway was fully exposed in the bright beam two yellow bales on end inside he saw the butt of the rifle go back hard into the crook of the camouflage fellers shoulder his own breath came in like ice one of the welshies ran over and kicked the barn door wide open and then threw hisself to the side bawling shoot shoot shoot shoot the fucker the gun went off twice these crisp tight cracks jeremy screaming noooo amid the echoes danny heard rapid footsteps and saw something else flitting across the yard through the lamp beam to the barn stop her the first welshie striding out the lamp snatched up beam swinging all over the place like a bar of solid light and then jeremy berrows going no clancy stop christ almighty no jesus it was the girl danny found himself moving fast towards the open doorway aware of the feller with the gun coming up alongside him his face shinywhite in the light and danny thinking oh god oh god oh god what they done a couple of yards from the barn the gunman pulled ahead of danny and twisted back and danny saw it coming but he couldnt do a thing about it his head seemed to burst apart and he went down clawing at the frozen shit on the cobbles real personal spiritualism this essentially was the problem spiritualism was the keyhole in the door to hell and the deliverance ministry tended to take an inflexible line on it so this was why jane couldnt tell mum about the white company or er the camera you mean she doesnt know youre doing this eirion disapproved too naturally rigid welsh chapel ethic ok he didnt actually go to chapel but it had seeped into the whole culture she trusts me these days irene were into a new phase of mutual trust and support look ill tell her at some stage meanwhile dont be an old woman just give me a few like really basic hints ok please irene you dont deserve it youre evil and duplicitous irene ive had a lot of bad stuff happen to me you know that no father any more dragged out to the sticks adolescent crises mother in a permanent state of spiritual angst youre not just economical with the truth youre parsimonious not with you in fact shed told him virtually everything the church the vaughans the white company all the stuff she couldnt talk about to mum without risking the most godawful row which she frankly did not at this moment need how did largo put it eirion asked what did he actually say well it it was after we got back from the church and id been helping nat with these awful christmas lights and ambers determined to talk to ben so antony just wanders in and hes like jane could i have a wee word she told him how shed made antony some coffee in the lounge and hed said sit down a minute jane and started asking her questions what did she think of this and that on tv what did she have planned for when she left school i mean it was dead casual i thought he was just making conversation we were getting on pretty well better than when ben was around and like having a laugh about how serious ben was getting over all this and then he goes tell me jane have you ever used a decent video camera and then when you said no i didnt exactly say no as such i mean suddenly i was getting an incredible feeling of where this might be going which was just wow so i told him that my boyfriend i said my boyfriends family was connected with television in wales and id been on lots of shoots and like helped out filled in done a bit of this and that you know there was a silence what shed actually said was my exboyfriend wanting to keep whatever might be on the cards to herself and she felt desperately guilty about that despicable what kind of bitch did that to her guy ok he wouldnt be able to be involved anyway being out of the country but it was still well not the kind of thing eirion would ever do to her it just came out jane said you lied to antony largo jane swallowed realizing she was sweating you didnt mention my name to him did you eirion said because when this is all over and your name is like something scraped off his trainers after jogging across the dog pound look its no big deal she stared at the silvery little camera panic rising hell shoot the heavy stuff himself the seance he just wants me to keep track of stuff happening daytoday when hes not there just like point the thing at anything interesting going down around the place and especially at ben see he cant afford to spend whole days himself around stanner when he hasnt flogged the idea to anybody yet which can take like weeks and weeks and he needs to keep track of developments and he needs ben to be in some of the pictures so apparently theyre always getting people to do it these days shoot bits of stuff there used to be hassles with the unions but all thats so why dont you ask ben for a few hints because jane shut her eyes because bens clearly not happy about me doing it hed rather shoot it himself and not be in shot its all so confused antonys idea of this project may not quite tie in with bens like theyre mates but theres artistic friction you know i think what antonys got in mind is that if it all crashes at least itll make a funny episode for this punching the clock series about midlife crises launching new careers and these spiritualists the cranks who think theyre going to raise the spirit of sir arthur conan doyle theyre actually going along with this yeah theyre cool with it maybe theyre hoping for something amazing irene come on even if nothing happens it could still be totally brilliant stuff eirion did this bitter sigh i dont know why im doing this but the most basic piece of advice i can give you is to use the tripod whenever possible youve got a tripod antonys having one sent over to stanner for me right well dont get carried away with handheld stuff unless youve got a lot of experience and really steady hands it looks awful unusable right also stick to auto at all times or youll just get in a mess wont it look amateurish the difference will probably be minimal and largo can get rid of any fluffs in the editing and make sure your shots are long enough remember youre recording what might be a familiar scene to you for people whove never seen it before so hang in there dont pan unless its vital dont get carried away with the zoom and remember that the mike on the cameras ok for ambient sound or when youre tight but whats the other mike like directional or what well it i mean you can like point it look when you said zoom ration it severely my advice is to pretend that every time you use the zoom its going to cost you a tenner so the zoom where is that exactly well its oh bloody hell eirion said suppose i just come over and show you jane fisted the air i love you so much irene prove it well maybe jane said low and sexy and exultant inside maybe later this greasy lowwattage bulb over the door only a feeble light coated with dust and cobweb and dead flies but all light was pain silence in here the only sound was in his head the buzzsaw of pain standing in the doorway he was sick with the pain no its a friend jeremy said a friend danny held on to the door frame the girl in the straw didnt move her hair was the same colour as the straw in the rancid butter light she stared up at him and her eyes were full of fear and hate jeremy said oh christ they done that dannys face and head were wet he kept his hands away from it gone it was a tattered croak he couldnt believe the terror in his own voice all of em you sure on the flagged floor a broken bale and the girl sprawled forward in the straw looking up covering the black and white dog with her body how much time had passed danny didnt know his head felt like the time hed been kicked by a horse jeremy was staring at him they was gonner shoot the dog danny clancy she just hurled herself in front of em wasnt no answer to that they buggered off they was gonner shoot the dog what they hit you with butt of the gun i reckon why the dog dunno jeremy was wearing baggy jeans and an old sweater with holes in it he was quivering dunno what they thought dont you really boy i better get you an ambulance bugger off can you see out that eye it missed the eye you called the cops you cant drive home in that state jeremy said you called the police no i why not dont want no police danny itd all get twisted round you know how it is this is dacre ennit they never said not really jeremy ran his hands through his sparse fair hair his face all screwed up they never hell admit to hiring them but hes gonner deny responsibility for how they done it done what shot the foxes foxes balls hes the bloody hunt master he dont wanner see no foxes shot at night or by day he wants em all decently ripped in half by his hounds the bloody middle marches hunt looks like running out of foxes to chase sebbied have a couple crates of the buggers shipped over from the city you know that danny leaned back against the door frame breathing through his mouth the effort of saying all that had left him feeling faint he ent an easy man to deal with jeremy said hes a total bastard of a man jeremy we all know that he phoned me earlier oh did he said did i know what that feller foley was doing over at hergest with another feller and a girl why would you well cause cause natlie she dwork up at stanner yeah yeah you tell him told him i didnt know nothin about nothin jeremy looked down at the girl you best get inside clancy fore your mam gets in he smiled at her take the dog in with you youre gonner need some tea danny no ill get off home fore gret calls in the bloody armed response unit give her a call for me will you boy say i tripped on the cattle grid but im all right now in the end it was past midnight when danny made it home and jeremy had to take him in his land rover what had happened those bastards had rammed the justy out of the way with the bull bars on the discovery heaving it into the ditch the drivers door was stove in and danny didnt give a lot for the subframe bastards couldnt believe theyd done that couldnt believe any of this knowing for a fact that if he tried to make a claim against them even if he could find out their names theyd deny the whole lot anyway danny avoided lawyers the same way you didnt drink sheepdip i ent fully sure what this is about he told jeremy out on the bypass but far as im concerned it just got real personal leave it eh danny ent nothing to be done ent nothin ill pay for the damage you bloody will not boy happened on my ground me as called you out and im sorry i shouldnt have rung you i just didnt want nothing to happen to the girl right danny said whats going on jeremy nothings going on who are they just some shooting yobs from not the welshies you that girl and her mam danny was talking through the pain now so he didnt care what he said long as he could get it out whats the score there jeremy wheres it goin you and her whats that about jeremy said nothing all right whyd them welshies say it wasnt your ground sebbie dacre still think hes entitled is it i wouldnt know jeremy staring straight ahead driving slow ent his ent never gonner be his thats all i know i was born there ill die there not just an expression of intent danny thought it was like he knew it for a fact that he would die at the nant above them the wishywashy moonlight shone damply on stanner rocks and jeremy never spoke another word except for goodnight not much more than a clicking of the tongue when he dropped danny at his top gate part two my friend was still looking at the coat of arms and i walked to the archway here and just looked across at the blue curtain there was an image it wasnt even a shape i can only describe it as when motes hang in sunbeams but it was the image of a bull and he was giving out the feeling of being angry he was pawing at the ground but he was in the air the inside of his nostrils this was one of the most vivid things were very very red like a racehorse when its just stopped running and it was wet it was dripping moisture or something on to the ground it was as though it was hanging in sort of strings as we walked to the middle aisle it started to fade im a hardheaded business person but i cant deny it ive seen it ive experienced it jenny vaughan the ladies who prepare the flowers in the church did say on two separate occasions that the floral arrangement had taken the shape of a bulls head alan lloyd local historian kington fourteen word to the wise so danny went after sebbie three farms the wisdom of this well that was in question jeremy phoned early sunday morning to see how danny was feeling to repeat his offer of picking up the tab for gretas justy and to tell danny to leave well alone on account of sebbie dacre couldnt be counted on to behave like any kind of rational human being danny said hed bear that in mind hour or so later greta bathed his head again and said leave it you year me danny thomas you can patch him up the little car leave it till tomorrow at least longer we leaves it harder its gonner be you are not going to dacres place on your own suppose them fellers is there with their guns you can wait till tomorrow then you can take gomer with you take gomer with me danny stared at her you totally cracked woman gomer id feel safer with pockets full of bloody semtex ent as wild as he used to be gret said hes an ole man now look you promise me i promise danny went out shaking his head at the idea that age could mellow somebody like gomer parry but then gret had never seen gomer at the controls of his jcb that big gash of a smile around his ciggy hells own light in his glasses the sky was nearenough the colour of a shotgun barrel and the cold air ripped at dannys head wound like barbed wire as he crossed the yard to the land rover well no way was he gonner forget this couldnt live with himself couldnt afford another car for greta if this one got written off he was on his way to jeremys to see if he could somehow tow the justy home when as it happened he seen sebbie dacre in person turning right at walton towards radnor forest sebbie was in his mustardcoloured range rover and he was on his own seemed like fate last in the handshaking line outside the church porch after morning service was alice meek in sunday best not many people wore sunday best any more they came to church in fleeces and jeans the big man with alice wore jeans and a shiny leather jacket this yere is dexter harris vicar my nephew from the tyre place with the asthma didnt seem right just bringing him along tonight for the healing service the healing service merrily shook hands limply with dexter and then stood there shivering in the cold weak sunshine of the first day of december when for gods sake had her loose prayer meeting her meditative interlude her quiet time before the start of the working week become the healing service i told him there wasnt nothing to be scared of dont wanner bring on an attack do we alice cackled confident that this wouldnt happen not on a sunday not at the church of the healing vicar merrily looked up at dexter harris he was a big heavy man shavenheaded balding or both he had a lower lip that jutted like a spout from a jug he looked about thirtyfive he looked like hed rather be anywhere but here but few people argued with alice down by the lychgate she could see ted clowes retired solicitor senior churchwarden her mothers brother and the villages most reliable opponent of deliverance faith healing and anything else that was in his narrow view spiritually offthewall and fiscally unpromising if ted was waiting for her by the lychgate it was with the intention of following her home to bend her ear on neglect of crucial parish issues oh well how would you feel about a cup of tea dexter merrily suggested in fact there might even be a can or two of stella in the fridge mr sebastian dacre jp danny thomas and sebbie dacre they was about the same age and had known one another to a point since they was boys but danny was at the local schools and sebbie was a boarder at the cathedral school in hereford and riding to hounds at twelve and screeching around kington in a triumph spitfire at eighteen and sebbies ole man used to have close to a thousand wide acres while dannys dad had just under fortythree acres of hillside with soil skindeep over the rock and danny was danny thomas the rock n roll farmer as was and sebbie was mr sebastian dacre jp master of the middle marches local organizer for the countryside alliance it was like that sebbie was clearly headed for the eagle at new radnor nice pub situated just perfect in the middle of this nice quiet village big wide street widest in radnorshire sure to be overlooked by a lot of houses and cottages and a shop and the eagle danny was reminded of the streets in old western movies which were always very wide and quiet and just right for a shootout two fellers approaching each other real slow from opposite ends greta was wrong best to handle this on his own danny the negotiator danny the diplomat he wanted something out of this to repair the justy also it was very much time to put the arm on sebbie to keep his muscle off jeremy berrowss ground boy looked like hed enough to worry about right now without lying awake at night listening for tyres creeping up the track most of all though danny wanted to know what was behind it why was sebbie three farms employing these three hardbastard shooters from south wales a shedload of questions here and if he followed sebbie now to wherever he was going then he wouldnt have broken his promise to gret would he sebbie parked at the side of the road and danny come in behind him just as he was climbing down sebbie three farms all six foot whatever of him toughthin like streaky bacon sebbie put on his tweed cap always wore a cap because his reddish hair was sparse now and his skin was pale as watered milk a walking invitation to skin cancer was sebbie and yet he always walked tall and straight like he was defying the sun danny come right up behind him mr dacre it was how you talked to people in these parts only real close friends using first names sebbie didnt turn round at once like a normal person would he kept on walking towards the pub door and when he did turn it was only to flick a bleep at the range rover to lock the doors at which point he deigned to notice danny mr thomas howre you working with parry now hey diversification only course open in these constricting times you happen to ave a minute mr dacre sebbie frowned people say a minute when they mean half an hour his pale eyes had screwed up a bit now cautious last thing hed want would be danny in the pub with him where theyd be overheard and the word spread over half of two counties by sundown cause sebbie knew what this was about nothing surer ill keep it short then danny said three of your boys was rampaging over the nant last night loosing off the kind of gun you dont normally see this side of credenhill base and the end result mr thomas end result of this bit of a farminvasion is this danny touched his forehead winced doesnt look like a bullet wound to me mr thomas but more to the point more to the point mr dacre is my wifes car gets battered off the track and looks to me bearing in mind hes eleven year old like we could be looking at a writeoff and you saw who it was hey your boys it was like i said my boys my boys said you was payin em to shift foxes sebbie squinted like the sun had come out that sound awfully likely to you mr thomas im tellin you what they said three welshies from down the valleys sounded like and you saw them actually damaging your car did you these boys at night men they was more like and i sure enough seen you informed the police obviously i sure enough seen one of the buggers come over and clobber me with the butt end of his fancy gun and naturally youve told the police about that too no danny glanced down at his boots not yet and youre saying these men claimed to be working for me thats an actual allegation youd be prepared to make in front of witnesses and my solicitor danny fell silent you forgot how hard it was getting a feller like this to put his hands up to anything outsiders townies they didnt believe sebbies sort existed any more thought they was a joke musichall villains feudal stuff out of history but even now with the countryside shrinking faster than a pair of marketstall jeans danny could still point you out five or six like sebbie within twenty or thirty miles sebbie gave out a look that was all but a mouthful of spit i thought youd know better mr thomas than to come accosting me in the street with this kind of halfbaked drivel its the truth they named me aw come on everybody knows it mr dacre folk around yere ent daft nobody understands it why youre letting foreigners in with illegal shooters but they knows its down to you and they knows theres history between you and jeremy berrows who does sebbie was halfsmiling hadnt broken sweat who knows all this give me some names mr thomas hey give me some names and ill sue their arses orf in a court of law danny said nothing at all who was he supposed to drop in the slurry you didnt did you not to a man who never forgot a name danny felt ashamed he shouldve brought gomer along like gret said gomer to put it mildly wasnt fazed by nobs danny hadnt said half of what hed planned to say and already it was all going pearshaped on him his head throbbed and his vision was lopsided somehow so that he saw sebbie dacre like sebbie was some tripping image an acid flashback thin neck craning out of the collar of his viyella and his head under the beak of his cap like a hawks watching a rabbit easy target ent he jeremy berrows danny said mr thomas jeremy berrows would be an easy target for the womens institute bowling team now geddout of my hair i dont get it danny said how come you live next to jeremy all his life and suddenly youre turnin the heat on sebbie just looked and half turned away like the very sight of danny was starting to offend him or mabbe its the woman danny said natlie sebbie swayed just slightly and then he came out with this one real nonchalant like hed just been ferreting in dannys mind you still using drugs mr thomas that ent bloody fair danny blurted before he could stop hisself his head pulsed and he felt faint aint fair sebbies head shot forward like dannys words had pressed a button ill tell you what aint fair what aint fair is whats happening to the countryside under this fucking government if they persist in trying to stop us hunting with hounds make us subject to licensing and regulations put the countryside into a suburban straitjacket if they go on trying to challenge our traditional way of dealing with vermin then they can bloody well expect what one might call less orthodox methods of pest control at this point gwilym bufton the feed dealer came across the road towards the eagle with another feller and they exchanged owre yous with sebbie and sebbie raised two fingers to his cap in a kind of mockhumble salute when theyd gone into the pub he came a bit closer to danny his pinky eyes shining the street was quiet around them and danny had the feeling of folks at their windows like this really was a showdown in a western town starring the bigtime rancher and the shabby dustbowl farmer who couldnt afford a haircut sebbies voice was low what im saying is if theyre going to make us illegal turn decent people into poachers then they shouldnt be surprised to find bands of brigands roaming by night danny was thrown this was surreal what the hells that mean youre supposed to be a bloody magistrate and with more of our local police stations closing every year sebbie said they wont have the means or the manpower to counter it look i dont know what happened to your damn car and i expect youve got another halfdozen clappedout wrecks in your buildings to replace it but i can tell you one thing this is only the start and if youre not part of it you should stay at home get yourself quietly stoned and keep your nose out eh word to the wise mr thomas word to the wise he turned away danny didnt move couldnt believe what hed heard this was a magistrate he shouted after sebbie dacre whyd you tell them welshies jeremy berrows didnt own his own farm whyd you tell em jeremy was your tenant dont know what youre talking about you know what sebbie danny pointing the finger i dont believe you i think youre full of shit i reckon youre covering someing up boy and youre a faded old hippy full of pathetic druginduced conspiracy theories sebbie stopped at the pub door ill give you a question now why did berrows call to you for help why didnt he call the police hey give that some thought i would mr thomas and be sure to hide your stash somewhere safe because you can expect a visit in the early hours from the dyfedpowys drug squad good day to you then he went into the pub and danny saw the curtains twitching along the street and found he was shaking like with cold turkey milk into concrete when merrily brought dexter harris into the kitchen jane had already made soup and sandwiches not many big sunday lunches in this household and theyd shared them with dexter who at first was all shy and shambling twice using his inhaler he ate steadily glancing at jane and occasionally at merrily something evidently on his mind it took both cans of stella to bring it out they er they reckons youre the whatsit county exorcist well nowadays they dont merrilys shoulders sagged hed have seen the movie on dvd explanations were useless yeah kind of alice told you dexter shifted uncomfortably maybe he was expecting her to toss holy water at him thrust a cross in his face instructing the demon of asthma to vacate his system maybe that was a course of action lew jeavons might even advise in which case one of them was in the wrong job its probably not what you think merrily said but what was she going to do what did alice actually expect of her she smiled nervously at the big guy wedged into a dining chair with his leather jacket over the back she felt worse than inadequate she felt like someone recruited into a fraudulent enterprise a trainee on a travelling medicine show and while the lager had loosened dexter up it didnt make the situation any more promising he was eyeing jane now and claiming that today was the first time hed been inside a church since his christening tell the truth he was only doing this to shut alice up her nagging him and his ma about it dexter lived at home with his ma and his younger sister in the bobblestock area of hereford useful to have somebody around if he had an attack look also it was cheaper and most of his girlfriends had their own flats or houses so that was all right suppose he had an attack here what then merrily looked at jane if dexters breathing changed rhythm any layingon of hands would take place only while they were waiting for the paramedics to get here dexter started asking jane which clubs she went to in hereford at weekends jane named four merrily seriously hoping that she was lying dexter smirked at the last one telling jane hed probably see her there sometime maybe he didnt think of himself as being twice as old at about twothirty they heard a car pulling into the vicarage drive and jane sprang up conspicuously relieved its eirion janes boyfriend merrily stood up too moved to the door of the scullery lets leave them to it huh dexter boyfriend dexter looked like hed been shortchanged merrily held open the office door she was still in her dog collar and the morning worship kit minus surplice and this was probably for the best too much informality could well convey the wrong impression to an overweight doughfaced man of probably thirtyplus who seriously imagined someone janes age could fancy him they went in and sat down facing one another across the desk like one of them had come for a job on the desk computer answering machine phone bible sermon book now what lew this is at the heart of spiritual healing taking the time to know people making small deductions how many doctors have the time or the patience to do that now talking and considering and leaving time for small leaps of inspiration she had a cigarette half out of the packet when dexter blandly shook his head making wiping motions with his hands his lower lip projecting like an outlet pipe she pushed the cigarette back into the packet wondering how he survived in the clubs putting the silk cut packet out of reach we suffer jeavons had said an hour passed it was growing dark dexter was talking about the collapse of his engagement two years ago how it had really knocked him sideways to learn that his girlfriend farah had been seeing another bloke for months apparently weighing up which of them was the best bet and then deciding for some weird reason of her own that it wasnt dexter bitch made you stop trusting women dexter said made you want to start scoring a few points of your own dexter had hit the clubs shagger harris the foreman started calling him down the tyre depot dexter grinned looking down at the bible on merrilys desk if we take the time to absorb what people are telling us about themselves directly and indirectly and we are in a suitable state of relaxation a contemplative state then the clues they come together and a feeling or a word sometimes drops into our minds how old are you dexter me twennynine now soon be thirty yeah i know i look younger nobody special since farah just casual stuff just casual sex dexter said doesnt the asthma merrily broke off embarrassed dexter wasnt naw they reckons its stress brings it on look well i only gets stressedout when i ent having no luck most times i can go all night know what i mean dont get no problems that way he smiled at her funny thing that ennit merrily leaned back you dont really think this is going to help you do you dexter sniffed like i say if it keeps the old woman quiet its something no offence meant im not much of a believer cant help that can i no if you try and force yourself to believe that only causes stress doctor says ive gotter avoid that people gives me stress i dont bother with em no more do you remember the first one you what the first asthma attack you ever had he shook his head dunno do you remember how old you were or has it always been a problem bout twelve thirteen he didnt look at her she felt a tightening of the air between them do it matter i was just wondering what mightve brought it on if there was a particular emotional problem that mightve caused it i mean i dont know what alice told you but im not any kind of medical expert im just looking for maybe something we can focus on in our prayers prayers he looked at her now strange a nicelooking woman like you being a vicar and going on about prayers and that he looked down at her breasts you mustve been quite young when you had your daughter what do you think about when youre having an asthma attack eh what goes through your mind sorter questions that i dont know it just came into my head nobody ask you that before the doctors why would they id just like to know what its like he stared at her defiantly its like youre drinking a glass of milk and it turns into fuckin concrete halfway down your throat thats what its like thank you sounded like an image that went way back a childhood image dont you get me going dexter said if i starts thinkin about it ill get stressed he wasnt much more than a big silhouette now wide shoulders a pointed head it was dark enough to put on the lamp she reached out automatically then paused with a finger on the button of the anglepoise and i dont want people talkin about me in the church dexter said she said you was just gonner i dunno just do the healin it wouldnt be like that dexter people talking about you its just you know to give me some guidance everything you tell me is totally confidential just between the two of us nothing to tell have you really not been in a church since your christening no weddings funerals he didnt reply in the silence she thought his breath had coarsened she tapped the anglepoise button still didnt press it down the directional light might make this seem too much like an oldstyle police interrogation she thought of the basement interview rooms opposite the cells at hereford police headquarters the ventilator grilles high on the walls no windows you didnt need to be asthmatic to feel you couldnt breathe down there you ever been in bother with the police dexter it just came out on the back of the thought eh look im sorry if that was i fuckin knew it dexter was pushing back the chair im sorry with difficulty she didnt move i dont know why i said that a feeling or a word sometimes drops into our minds dexter was on his feet a terrifying rattle in his breath it was out of order merrily said im sorry i dunno dexter moved clumsily to the door dunno what shes been tellin you that ole bat he had his inhaler out but fuck this for a game of soldiers when eirion tried to ease jane back onto the bed she just couldnt go for it not with mum two floors below doing what she was doing doing the business doing the priest bit whatever she perceived that was today i really worry about her now jane sat on the edge of the bed with her elbows on her knees its probably reciprocated tenfold eirion said im serious the jenny box thing that whole affair it really messed her up this woman in desperate need of support sitting on awful secrets and mum not being there for her when it came to a head she couldnt know though jane could she it doesnt matter she still feels responsible male priests can be aloof from it all if they can get a few bums on pews then they feel they still have a role and a bit of status women everything that goes wrong they take it as their fault isnt that slightly sexist eirion said and with mum youve got this constant selfquestioning all this am i doing what im supposed to be doing to try and fill his bloody sandals eirion came and sat close to jane bending forward to peer into her face im not upset jane said just in case you were thinking i might be in need of a groin to cry on so what is she doing huh down there with this bloke i think shes been invited to cure whatever it is thats causing him to keep sucking his inhaler i dont understand ok jane let him take her hand it started with annmarie herdman its all round the village that annmarie herdman was cured of something very nasty that she may or may not have had after mum prayed for her now if it had been a regular prayer for the sick in the course of a normal service nobody wouldve said a word but because it was at one of the mysterious new sundaynight sessions where there are weird things like woooh meditation then it must be you know shes teaching meditation now in a simplistic christian way nothing esoteric i didnt realize how far it had got until i went down the shop a couple of hours ago for some stuff for sandwiches and there were these two women talking about it to brenda whos annmaries mum i mean i knew about annmarie but i thought it was just another nhs cockup i didnt realize mum was in the frame as god i cant bear it and if i cant bear it how does she feel theyre saying she has healing skills its the way people are thats all always desperate for evidence of miracles its like when all these idiots form queues to worship a potato with the face of jesus one of the women said alice meek had brought her nephew in to have the vicar pray for him to be healed and im imagining some little kid and im thinking oh god this is terrible thats all she needs then mum turns up with this big jerk with the inhaler who keeps leering at me and accidentally rubbing his leg against mine under the table itd be laughable if it wasnt so not funny so what exactly is she doing if shes got any sense irene shes explaining to him that shes unfortunately become the focus for a load of superstitious bollocks put about by old women with nothing better to occupy their minds and then maybe suggest to this guy dexter for heavens sake that they say a quick prayer together but dont expect to be throwing his inhaler into the river just yet eirion thought about this he was welsh a large number of them still took religion seriously but shes a priest he said er yes dont you see she has to acknowledge at least the possibility of miracles she has to accept that god can do it and that she could be a channel for it she cant just walk away from it if anybody thinks theres a small chance you know jane sighed its a fine line its not that fine jane the big joke jane stared at the mondrian walls big plaster squares in the timber framing that shed painted in primary colours the big joke is that women think getting ordained was some huge coup for their sex the fact is its the crappiest job there is and its getting worse all the time as society gets more and more secular and cynical its obvious that the ordination of women was actually a subtle conspiracy by the male clergy desperately searching for fall guys as everything around them collapses into some like prearmageddon bleakness i thought you were over that eirion stood up and walked to the window it had started snowing not much but it always looked worse from up here especially at dusk white on grey i have the occasional relapse jane said eirion sighed so do you want to know how to work this video camera or what maybe merrily should have realized that something was spinning out of control maybe if she hadnt been thinking about dexter harris she would have been curious about the extra cars on the village square she didnt even notice them it was becoming unexpectedly cold she was aware of that she saw snowflakes clustered like moths around the fake gaslamps on the square as soon as she slid into church wearing janes old duffel coat over jeans her black cashmere sweater and her smallest pectoral cross she made sure that the heating was on full checking that uncle ted hadnt crept in and turned it down he hadnt for once but she still felt a need to do more and lugged the little castiron calorgas stove out of the vestry wheeling it to the bottom of the chancel steps it wouldnt make much difference temperaturewise but a glimpse of real orange flames kind of warmed the soul she felt domestic about the church tonight wanting to turn the house of god into a big kitchen how she felt about dexter harris that was different the fact that he was so charmless and unresponsive somehow made it more important to try and help him the fact that he didnt want to be helped made it complicated if there was something in his past that had caused or advanced the asthma did she have any right let alone responsibility to try and find out about it responsibility where did it begin and where did it end sitting alone in the choir stalls she cleared dexter from her mind closed her eyes and became aware of her breathing allowing it to regulate itself a short meditation had become an essential preliminary to the sundayevening session when she sat down here twenty minutes before the start she would usually have no real idea at all what form it would be taking but when she stood up again that no longer mattered it was the sounds of movement that brought her out of it too much movement she knew her church she knew her congregations and the sounds of them familiar coughs and whispers when she came back into the body of the church standing next to the faintly hissing gas stove it was like she was in some other parish staring out at faces she didnt recognize a woman with a baby two teenage girls and in the aisles two wheelchairs one occupied by a boy of about eleven and the other by a woman in her fifties with a tartan rug over her knees there was a shuffling quiet in the church everybody looking at merrily in her black sweater and her jeans and she felt small bewildered desperate fraudulent it was snowing so hard that eirion had to leave jane had been hoping he wouldnt notice until it was too late so hed have to spend the night but hed borrowed his stepmothers car again needed to get it back to abergavenny jane stood at the front door cuddling ethel the cat and watching through the bare trees as he drove away red lights reflected in the halfinch of unsullied snow on church street much of what hed told her about the camera she was sure she hadnt really taken in but shed made notes she ought to practise with the gear before she went back to stanner in normal circumstances she could ask mum to help perhaps record an interview with her with the external mike plugged in except that because of the nature of what she might be shooting up at stanner it wasnt wise even to mention it christianity was a minefield you could talk about spirituality but not spiritualism open yourself to spiritual healing but never spirit healing if she told mum about the white company shed be letting herself in for one of those long serious talks ending with the usual warnings well its up to you youre intelligent and old enough to make up your own mind about what you get involved in but the rest unsaid the word betrayal never passing between them the phone was ringing normally shed let the machine grab it but she felt like talking to somebody she stepped back inside and shut the front door putting ethel down and dashing through the kitchen into the scullery to snatch up the receiver ledwardine vicarage mrs watkins female voice no shes in church can i help oh no its all right ill call back can i give her a message no its all right really the caller hung up just as jane recognized the voice was sure shed recognized the voice she dialled you were called at sevenfourteen today the caller withheld jane hung up two chairs were pulled away from the desk as if mum and dexter had left in a hurry jane sat down in one talk about betrayal danny tried to listen to some music but the foo fighters made his headache worse it was the first time this had happened normally the heavier the music the more it relaxed him in the end he watched telly with greta listening to heartbeat with his eyes shut identifying the sixties numbers on the soundtrack until he fell asleep and greta woke him again with the cordless phone no danny mumbled please god gwilym bufton it is i told him you wasnt well but he said youd want to hear this gwilym danny struggled to a sitting position first time hed had a call from the feed dealer since hed given up livestock which gwilym saw as an act of treachery owre you boy half dead thats good looks like

said id pass the word on to gomer in other words keep your nose out greta greta said danny stared into the reddening woodstove responding to images frannie bliss of hereford cid called back on monday afternoon just as the light was fading not a career criminal merrily i can tell you that much didnt really think he would be merrily brought the cordless and a mug of tea to the kitchen table i just thought with mention of all the clubs drugs certainly not a recognized dealer and if he was dealing he doesnt sound bright enough that we wouldnt know doesnt sound like he could run very fast either if we were after him sorry she pulled over the ashtray fed up now shouldnt have asked you and wouldnt even have considered an approach to any other copper but by now she and the mersey exile bliss knew too many of each others flaws for him to sell her down the wye as for the ethics it went like this she was following through on something that might help dexter harris with his medical condition she had nothing to tell bliss that might get dexter nicked she hadnt even told him why she wanted to know if hereford division had ever heard of dexter and he hadnt asked her mind you he said ive known a few disabled villains over the years only difference is they tend to have less conscience feeling the world owes them a wheelchair ramp at the town hall is often considered insufficient recompense merrily found a grin its so reassuring to talk to a man for whom the pit of human depravity can have no floor ah youre following your nose youre a priest how can you know if a gut feeling isnt a tipoff from god thats very empathetic francis yeh well bliss was a catholic from what was probably still the most catholic city in england he knew all the questions priests asked themselves with little hope of a convincing answer so how are things merrily said kirsty were not out the woods yet but were having what you might call a trial reconciliation its a start the job im not on any shortlist for dci as yet but the word is that the main man in worcester who as you know does not love me like a brother may be on the topdetectives transfer list with an eye on thames valley so that could be goodish news im glad and hows the healing coming along bliss said sorry one of the dcs his wifes had persistent back trouble done the rounds of osteopaths and chiropractors getting nowhere with it he reckoned somebody had told his missus they ought to come and talk to the vicar of ledwardine she stared blankly out of the window at the black spidery apple trees this could not be happening might i have touched on a sore point by chance bliss said merrily sighed at length lit a cigarette then told him about the sunday nights annmarie and jeavons the whole submessianic mess about fifteen years ago bliss said when i was a young plod there was a noisenuisance complaint at this chapel up near formby i go in and theres one of these evangelical fellers clutching some poor bastards head in his hands and shaking it from side to side screaming to heaven for some action whole place in uproar well no disrespect intended merrily but that doesnt sound like your thing last night my usual congregation had doubled doubled frannie two wheelchairs in the aisle desperate people and the health service in perpetual crisis but me what am i what did you do she blew out smoke and coughed what usually happens on the sundaynight thing is we drag out some pews and arrange ourselves into a rough circle too many last night for that no spiritual calm no intimate atmosphere only this overpowering sense of need i just had to stand there in front of them all in my jeans feeling like a useless pillock doing my best to explain that the diocese was currently taking steps to create a proper healing network are they god knows we did some prayers but no wheelchairs were abandoned there was a general feeling like at the pictures once when i was a kid and the projector broke down before the cavalry arrived never felt so inadequate let down the church the womens ministry the people for whom this might have been a last hope afterwards this very nice little woman comes up says how mortified she is about all these outsiders invading our lovely quiet time what do you say bit of a shite situation merrily im really sorry however this dexter harris with the asthma his auntie cleans the church midweek id guess she feels responsible because other people dont find him terribly lovable what can i do i could just pray for him or i could try and do what jeavons does and look for an underlying something a hidden source let god in the back way forgive me this guy sounds like a nutter but what if hes right what if it works all right look bliss said what ill do is ill run dexter past an ancient custody sergeant called melvyn melvyns oldforce very very discreet and hes gorra brain like an antique computer feed him a name it goes clank clank clank for a few hours and if theres a connection with anything notably unlawful over the past many years hell deliver eventually like ticker tape his specialist subject is prostitution in hereford since nell gwynne thats a big one leave it with me bliss said after they cut the call merrily considered phoning sophie to see how soon they could arrange a meeting of all the hereford clergy whod declared an interest in the healing ministry not including those who wanted nothing to do with deliverance lew jeavons and women how many would that leave herself probably the phone went again jane out of breath behind her the patient rumbling of school buses mum look screwed up left vital books for eng lit at stanner so i figured i should get on clancys bus and pick them up that ok stanner in a matter of weeks the whole axis of janes life had shifted merrily frowned and youd get home how i called gomer hes with danny on a blockedsoakaway crisis at new radnor he could pick me up around seven which would be perfect so you do want to come home eventually merrily said that a serious question on saturday jane who didnt like killing a tree for christmas had collected some dead branches which they were going to spray silver and gold to arrange in the hall she supposed shed have to spray them herself now i dont really know she said a few minutes later rinsing her mug at the sink she heard a song of lols in her head the one hed written in shed always supposed a state of bitter despair about ever getting into her bed did you suffocate your feelings as you redefined your goals and vowed to undertake the cure of souls she wiped the mug and hung it from the shelf over the sink and thought about lol and told herself she was too old for onenight stands she needed emotional backup someone to hold at night when everything else was falling away jane growing up moving on and the cure of souls the job the calling wobbling on the rim of the irrational snowy dusk on the border but the moody pines rearing behind stanner hall were still black and green dark guardians the snow had stopped after a couple of hours last night but it had frozen by morning and stanner was locked into winter the witchshat towers shining like white lanterns under an icy halfformed moon such a lovely lovely shot jane leaned back shoulders braced against one of the gateposts both hands supporting the camcorder holding it tight but not too tight sure irene avoid handheld but if she wasted time rushing up to the hotel for the tripod the dusk would be over and this incredible image would be history jane triggered the shot trying to breathe evenly all day at school shed kept the equipment concealed in her bag to avoid attracting a crowd of sad boys with quentin tarantino fantasies at lunchtime in the school library shed studied her notes on eirions instructions and added to them remembering things hed said make sure your shots are long enough remember youre recording what might be a familiar scene to you for people whove never seen it before so hang in there no hardship lingering on this one pure baskerville hall was this what conan doyle had been picturing when he wrote about dull light through mullioned windows holes in the ivy ok there was less ivy here and it wasnt built of black granite if he hadnt altered some of the minor details hed have given it away she contained the urge to zoom in on one of the towers holding the shot instead until she became aware of clancy craven shivering kind of miserably which in that wildly expensive austrian skijacket clancy was definitely not entitled to do jane lowered the camera you can almost hear the distant howling clan she threw back her head and howled at the cautious moon the howl was unexpectedly resonant echoing back off the hall clancy said dont she had her shoulders hunched and her hands deep in the pockets of her blue jacket jane looked up to see if she was serious clan though younger was quite a bit taller than jane she was bony now but you could tell shed be like natalie in a year or two with a bonus of natural blonde hair clearly destined for serious beauty this was a girl who really ought to be happier than she was clancy shivered again although this one was probably faked you really like spooky things dont you jane doesnt everyone jane squeezed the camera back into her overnight bag poor irene hed have been gutted to the point of selfmutilation if shed told him that antony was bunging her a hundred a week for this money for jam i dont clancy said i never have all the kids are on about buffy the vampire slayer and angel i cant watch that stuff they had nothing in common did they jane shouldered the bag of course shed have to tell mum about the hundred a week at some stage maybe she could actually spend the money on say a new automatic washing machine to forestall the second great flood why do they have to try and invent things to scare us when theres so much clancy shook her head and began to trudge up the drive keeping out of the slippery tyre tracks in the snow and jane started giving her some attention because something was very much bothering this kid the fact that she was here at all tonight was unusual normally clancy would go straight home to jeremys farm on the bus just now shed told jane that natalie wanted her to come up to the hotel from now on so that they could go home together in the car jane wondered if there could be some problem with jeremy older men teenage girls in the house these things happened right your mums not scared of anything is she though jane probed catching up with her clancy stopped fingering the drawstrings at the waist of her costly skijacket most of clancys clothes were expensive only thing shes scared of is something happening to me theyre all scared of that erm ive never liked to ask jane zipped up her fleece it was very cold you didnt notice the conditions when you were working creatively what happened to your dad clancy started walking again i dont know oh he wasnt anybody special just some guy who got her pregnant you mean like at a party or something when everybody was pissed out of their heads something like that your dad was killed wasnt he car crash on the motorway with his assistant karen assistant and lover he was a lawyer having a thing on the side both killed jane was aware of the subject having been changed but she was casual enough about this now bit of a bastard my dad obviously i remember him as being really nice but i dont remember that much as the years pass i was still quite little when he died i suppose your mother hasnt been with many guys since being a vicar its what makes it hard getting this thing with lol beyond first base she doesnt know what youre supposed to do how youre supposed to play it women priests havent been around long enough to establish a precedent excuse me with her being so tall sometimes you forgot clancy was a couple of years less experienced and sat in classes with little children i meant there seem to be no rules on whether its ok for a female parish priest to be having a conspicuous relationship with a man if neither of thems married they could always get married lifetime commitment these are two very timid people clancy jane paused at the bend in the drive where the hall suddenly opened out in front of them panels of light from the groundfloor bay windows imprinted on the clean white lawns was this worth another shot nah face it none of this was going to get used anyway antony would deal with the arty stuff himself all he wanted from jane were snatches of what eirion called actuality short exchanges things happening around the place people in motion get amber in and natalie when you can antony had told her but be discreet about it theyre not performers like ben clancy said its the first time weve lived with a man its strange not like i imagined jane wanted to ask how why but they were getting too close to the hall to approach an issue this big the high pines were all around them now it was like a medieval castle the pines were the curtain wall and the lawns sloped up to the hall which was like the keep on its mound in the centre in the dark stanner looked much older than victorian there obviously had been more ivy on the walls than there was now you could see where it had been cut away for repairs so maybe when conan doyle was here something happened at the farm the other night clancy said something horrible jane stopped a hand on clancys arm you mean between nat and jeremy no clancy shook her off why do you always have to think of things like that she was at work anyway she was here it was saturday night and jeremy and me were watching a video and suddenly there was this blinding light through the window and all this shouting and these men were outside the farmhouse with guns and a big spotlight thing the shooters the ones bens been getting hassle from i dont know they were just it was like a raid clancy stood at the edge of the lawn looking over her shoulder they came out of the trees with their guns and they were like surrounding the old barn opposite the farmhouse they were going to shoot flag the dog they would have clancys voice was raw and strained in the razory air theyd have shot him it was like they owned the place and they could do what they wanted jeremy told me to stay inside but i couldnt i went out after flag and then jeremys mate danny was there and one of them hit him with his gun danny thomas long hair and a scraggy beard thats him they hit him on the head over an eye and made it bleed and then they shoved his car into the ditch jesus is he all right i think so but jane was appalled have you told the cops jeremy was funny about it he didnt want to talk about it afterwards but he told your mum thats why she wont let me walk down to the farm on my own any more i think she and jeremy think theyll come back does ben know about this dont say a word jane please you havent to say a word im not supposed to talk about it clancy started walking rapidly towards the house face splattered with light from the big windows jane thought of the men that she and ben and antony had encountered at hergest who claimed theyd been hired by a local farmer to get rid of foxes if one of his neighbours was involved this might explain why jeremy didnt want to cause any trouble clan did they have valleys accents what were they from south wales mightve been im not sure you should tell ben hell get something done without implicating jeremy ben doesnt no he doesnt care about treading on peoples toes he likes that please jane as they reached the hall clancy was nearly in tears i wouldntve told you if i thought you were gonna go telling tales i just suddenly everythings a mess it was ok in summer when we came but now everythings gone crap i dont like the people round here wish we could go back to shropshire where were you in shropshire craven arms its between shrewsbury and ludlow yeah i know clancy craven of craven arms huh clancy didnt react jane said look youve got to keep me informed of anything else that happens ok and clancy nodded looking relieved jane knew what it was like in these small border communities you wondered whether the normal rules of western civilization applied or if you were part of some tight taciturn little anglowelsh banana republic well shed be seeing gomer in a few hours and if he didnt know about this as dannys partner the very last of the daylight was soaking away into nightcloud and jane was glad shed stopped to do that moody glistening shot even if it never got used the fact that shed thought to capture it showed she was like responding to images despite the weather there were extra cars on the car park apart from jeremys old daihatsu used by nat and bens mg covered with old carpet where the softtop was jammed there were three of them shed never seen before guests on a monday theyre not staying clancy said theyre just here for a meeting mum has to run the bar she was moaning that they probably wouldnt be drinkers anyway people like that people like what jane could see some figures through the bay window of the lighted lounge they were standing around like they were making small talk ben was one of them and then jane saw a woman with pale hair and a small thrill rippled through her oh wow its them isnt it i dont want to know clancy said miserable again its the white company isnt it jane had like just known she had to be here tonight psychic or what people round here are sick clancy said this time frannie bliss was calling her from his home out near leominster she could hear his kids in the background squabbling over something that made technobleeps merrily just had a call from melvyn he was pretty sure about this but he likes to check his facts there is a story but its not quite what you thought and it goes way back the last time dexter harris saw the inside of an interview room was nearly twenty years ago when he was nine twelve actually and looked older melvyn says big lad even then which was how he wound up in the grownup felons interview room hang on a sec merrily i said no daddy will fix it later gerrout or ill nick the pair of yer for aggravated assault let me shut the door merrily bliss put the phone down and when he came back he said i had my way the age of criminal responsibilityd be reduced to four you might want to make notes merrily found a pen pulled over the sermon pad right bliss said ill give you the bottom line first dexter killed somebody detestable to the lord when she was about two maybe three someone had given jane this vintage nurseryrhyme book made out of thick cloth with serrated edges to the pages on the front was a watercolour picture of a little girl in an apron who had the saddest face jane had ever seen both the little girl and the book itself used to make her feel deeply upset and she remembered being convinced it had been owned by a child who had been so unhappy that shed just died of it this was one of her earliest memories and it faded up when she and clancy padded into stanner hall and saw amber foley standing at the top of the kitchen steps wearing a vinyl apron with a watercolourtype picture on it of a cottage on a hill amber hadnt heard them come in and she was staring across at the closed door of the residents lounge her hair was pulled back and her skin looked like thin white eggshell about to crack jane thought of lifethreatening misery and a voice on the phone she swallowed amber saw clan and jumped then blinked and smiled weak sun reflected in a stagnant pond oh clancy ive sorted out a table for you in the kitchen to do your homework your mum says becoming aware of jane amber looked bewildered like if this is jane it must be friday i left some things amber on saturday school books oh jane we couldve got natalie to send them with clan amber looked hard at her obviously aware that jane would have known this one of the walllamp bulbs had blown and unfamiliar shadows made the lobby look dull and brownish and semiderelict good location crap place to live how often had amber stood alone here wondering how shed ever got herself into this and realizing of course that she hadnt ben had amber flicked a glance at clancy who said id better get on with it ill see you tomorrow jane and meekly walked past amber and down the steps to the kitchen doesnt want to know jane thought if theres something bad or contentious going down she just doesnt want to know about it we have absolutely nothing in common when they could hear the kids footsteps on the kitchen flags jane nodded at the closed door of the residents lounge the white company right bens in there with them and natalie hed be better off married to nat dont you think no thats ridiculous you know what theyre doing dont you amber said well yeah i youve got a problem with it amber straightened up and flattened a bulge in her apron you knew they were coming didnt you thats why youre here well no actually you couldnt keep away no it oh hell no point in letting this fester ok if you want the absolute truth amber the real reason i came is because i happened to pick up the phone last night when you tried to call my mum there was the jittery sound of polite laughter from behind the lounge door and when you recognized my voice jane said you got off the line as quick as you could only im quite good with voices jane i so if its something about me id like to know ok because i havent told her anything about all this and it could get me in a lot of bother ambers dolls cheeks were colouring jane sighed i suppose ben told you what she did like apart from being just a vicar amber nodded losing what might have been a grateful smile inside a grimace only i didnt know you were religious jane said im not not really just neurotic jane gestured at the lounge door about that there was the sound of more merriment bens peal obvious none of this worries him in the slightest amber said he loves it for the drama he doesnt believe in it for one minute though obviously he wont tell them that hell be hamming it up in there for all hes worth its how guys like him and antony persuade people to do things on camera that are going to get them ridiculed in thousands of homes because they dont laugh at the time janes eyebrows went up theyre not doing it now are they trying for conan doyle i dont know i just think people like that are irresponsible and the point is its not their house is it its ours god help us amber moved away from the vicinity of the lounge towards the reception area look i know its money much needed i know its part of bens great scheme but getting cranks like that involved thats the pits you rang mum for like support did you get through to her in the end amber swallowed a breath when ben told me what your mother did it seemed a bit too coincidental like a sign we neurotics you know no i didnt try again not after you answered the phone well jane raised her gaze to the flaking frieze around the walls if youd wanted support youd have got it no problem why didnt you just ask me i couldve told you exactly what shed say like at some point shed drag out a slab of the old testament let no one be found among you who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire who practises divination or sorcery or witchcraft or pisses about with spells blah blah or who is a medium or spiritist or consults with the dead anyone who does these things is detestable to the lord that seems fairly unequivocal to me amber said of course im only a cook amber for heavens sake its old testament you can find bits of the ot that suggest blokes are entitled to strangle their wives for being unfaithful it was political anything paranormal the priests of jehovah had to keep it to themselves or bang goes the power base but trying to contact poor old arthur i mean come on i just amber folded her arms like i said im not particularly religious and god knows im certainly not psychic although i dont entirely doubt that other people can perceive things that are beyond me well i have pagan instincts jane said with relish and i believe theres masses in this area to be sensed by anyone with the balls to she let the sentence trail realizing how smug and insulting it must have sounded well an uncharacteristic anger glowed momentarily like filaments in ambers eyes for all your pagan instincts jane you couldnt get out of that room quick enough could you room the tower room i didnt particularly want to put you in that one because wed had a couple of people already who but ben said oh dont worry about young jane far too downtoearth janell be fine so you know about that shed had the impression that ben had not told amber who was negative enough about this place already and wish i didnt amber said ben laughs he says every hotel has a room like that and some people would even pay extra to sleep in it if you remember what you told us at the time was that you werent used to sleeping in a big room well i only i happened to recall you telling me when you first came how youd turned a huge attic at ledwardine vicarage into your apartment and painted some big coloured squares on the walls like some famous abstract artist mondrian oh god she couldnt even keep track of her own lies all right i had a bad night i felt not very well i mean i never know when its my imagination im sorry amber of course i didnt actually know at the time that it was hattie chancerys room amber said jane flung a glance into the well of the hall where the staircase twisted out of sight there were certain phrases you could feel like fingers up your spine what ben would call a frisson and this was one hattie chancerys room the possessive presenttense oh god the chancerys were the family who built this place right i think their name was originally chance but they altered it to sound more distinguished incomers from the black country industrial wealth delusions of grandeur most of the big victorian homes in this area seem to have been built by rich midlanders who wanted their own castles the names are usually a giveaway big houses around here tend to be called court from the welsh but they called this stanner hall to yeah right so hattie chancery was the one who killed her husband so you knew not then because ben only told me about this yesterday hed known for some time but ambers voice was brittle he thought the little woman might be frightened but it wasnt in that room was it not the murder that was in the grounds i think it isnt talked about much probably overshadowed by the war at the time and she was mentally ill apparently a madwoman no jane i think wed all prefer mentally ill so like what did people see in the room oh one man said he saw the shape of a woman against the window and smelt look im not going into this now all right but thats the reason youre unhappy about the white company right i just dont think this is a happy place but then im only a cook what did he smell this guy alcohol beer i think you thought maybe mum could do something about this jane look it was just a kneejerk thing i was angry all right shed just warn you not to let the white company in and youd go along with that but ben shhh amber was looking over janes shoulder jane turned and saw the lounge door opening and ben gliding out his hair sheened back his slim black edwardian jacket hanging loose his holmes kit hed worn part of the holmes kit to welcome the white company well he would wouldnt he amber wheres jane ben looked fit she thought and energized and showed no particular surprise that she was here on a monday only satisfaction that she was jane you wouldnt by any chance have brought along that little handycam largo gave you to humiliate me well actually in which case fetch it darling ben clapped his hands fetch it at once weve got alistair here the medium and were testing various rooms to work out which is the best place to try and contact ah and where are you proposing to go next amber said amber its a positive thing ben said casually oh no amber said amber understand this ben something passed swiftly like the shadow of a small bird across ambers white dolls face those people will not go into my fucking kitchen maybe i could just describe these events to you without any comment merrily said and then perhaps you could just tell me what you think her ear was aching from phone use so formal canon jeavons said ive been talking to a cop its all forms and recorded interviews with them now all about covering yourself and isnt the church going the same way oh happy day jeavons said all right go ahead merrilee lay it on me inside her head the chorus started up forgive me this guy sounds like a nutter my advice for what its worth is to avoid this man and all he stands for if anyones on the edge of a crisis jeavons has been known to tip them over there was no harm in listening to what he had to say the fact was if shed never met jeavons she wouldnt have dug into dexters history and she wouldnt have uncovered what might be the underlying cause of his condition its about three boys from the belmont area of hereford the brief bleak notes in the sermon book lay in the lamplight pooled next to the bible two of them are brothers darrin and roland hook aged thirteen and nine dexter harris is their cousin this is seventeen years ago and hes twelve seventeen years ago the year jane was born the year she quit university and married sean they said she could come back and get her degree but shed had a feeling at the time that this wouldnt happen law it had never felt right why on earth was she reading law parental pressure at the time and the influence of uncle ted family solicitor its a good degree to have merrily whatever you decide to do with your life it will always be there for you wasted years belmonts an expanding suburb south of the city close to open country less so now since they built the allnight tesco and the drivein mcdonalds and hundreds more houses and the barnfield trading estate but you get the idea you keep going and youre on the open road down to abergavenny she was seeing it as she talked this widened country lane above the golden valley which always seemed so aptly named on summer evenings with harvested fields aglow as if lit from underneath this had all happened on a warm evening in august approaching dusk the three kids were exploring a halffinished building site where some of the houses were already lived in darrin had a plan gorra wire coathanger down his pants bliss had told her so it wasnt an impulse thing and he chose well just like a pro new house with high fences people have gone out leaving their second car in the drive a gift darrin had learned the techniques from a boy at school how to force the window and then apply the coathanger to the popup locks then the hotwire bit the only drawback was that darrin didnt know how to drive which was where dexter came in taller than the others merrily told jeavons an unusually big boy for twelve so he could reach the pedals no problem dozens of drivers must have seen this fiesta weaving about but there werent many mobile phones in those days so it was a while before the police got on to them not that you could miss them by now because it was getting dark and dexter hadnt thought about lights already im sensing no happy ending jeavons said the police picked up the trail on the hill down to allensmore when they were picking up speed dexter subsequently told the police that hed been afraid to brake he was once on his bike and went over the handlebars and he had the idea that if he did it now he and darrin would go through the windscreen certainly a possibility as neither had a seat belt on by now the police are behind them siren going not too close volatile situation car full of kids dexters well hypedup now frannie bliss said the traffic lads blasting away behind them blue lights going hes gorra do something decides the best thing is to get off the big road dump the car and run like buggery sees this turning up ahead on the other side into this narrow little country lane bus shelter on the corner decides to go for it just like that no indication big lorry coming towards them but dexter reckons hes got plenty of time an experienced motorist now driven all of six miles on his own stupid little gobshite spins the wheel sends the fiesta whizzing across the road amazingly he doesnt turn it over but its well out of control as youd expect and naturally hes missing the turning heading straight for the hedge now even at this point if hed left well alone the car would justve gone through the hedge into the field where as long as it avoided trees itd just be a cutsandbruises job unfortunately dexter panics stands on the brakes and the fiesta stalls on the kerb directly in the path of the oncoming lorry haulage vehicle melvyn doesnt recall the exact tonnage which is rare for melvyn but the driver was a mr evans from newport carrying steel and afterwards mr evans gives up his job telling the coroner that hell never drive a lorry again as long as he lives the lorry had collided with the rear half of the fiesta merrily said flattening it into the bus shelter which collapsed both front doors sprang open so dexter and darrin both walked away darrin had a broken arm dexter was mildly concussed roland however think of the forgotten sardine in the tin bliss had said brutally after the tins been trodden on his parents were told it was instantaneous merrily said meaning he didnt suffer which as far as physical pain goes may be true but disregards the state of helpless terror hed have been in for several minutes before the crash yes jeavons said softly probably the last thing dexter wouldve heard before the impact was the final screams of his nineyearold cousin how much of the carnage he saw in the back of the car we dont know what happen to dexter not much first offence appeared in court as a juvenile and therefore wasnt named pleaded guilty to charges related to taking and driving away and causing death by dangerous driving no previous convictions said very little in court apart from to apologize and burst into tears the view of the court seems to have been that having to live with this for the rest of his life was a bigger punishment than anything the justice system could inflict not always a good decision jeavons said incarceration puts a time limit on it life goes on certainly split the family there was an awful scene at the funeral rolands mother screaming that dexter was a murderer who should be in jail maybe forgetting that darrin was the instigator the one whod learned how to break into cars but darrin couldnt drive so it was dexter who killed roland his grandma mention any of this his auntie alice not a word but it probably explains why dexters never been near a church since his parents apparently felt compelled to move to the other side of hereford and he went to a different school certainly explain why he freaks when you ask him what happens in his head when hes having an attack jeavons said he have any counselling at the time not as common then as it is now was it especially not for offenders and hes working in a garage now tyre depot but still working with cars yes hasnt committed any criminal offences since according to my friend as far as health goes he might always have been prone to respiratory problems but the serious asthma attacks seem to have started within a year of the incident so merrily closed the pad stared at the flat pastel mosaic of the paul klee print can i help him what do you think i think i know what you might suggest while the thought of it leaves me feeling exhausted already the logic of its almost too perfect yes jeavons said would you do it what say it the healing of the living and the healing of the dead a formal requiem eucharist to bring peace to the soul of a nineyearold boy who died seventeen years ago and to his cousin who has it all stored up inside him like some old video nasty that keeps replaying itself in his head until it constricts his lungs textbook jeavons said unless maybe they already had a requiem they didnt i tracked down the minister who conducted the funeral it was at hereford crematorium they werent practising christians and it didnt take long thats how i found out about the row during the service which didnt end there when dexters dad bought a new car it was vandalized tyres ripped bodywork scored their house was also broken into twice damage rather than theft they suspected darrin not without reason bliss had said darrin had burgled his way through half the houses in south hereford the family blamed dexter for darrin turning bad a few months ago according to my colleague darrins mother encountered dexters mother in the car park at safeway spat in her face the healing capabilities of time are often overrated jeavons said so theres a good deal more to heal here than a case of asthma you think she wanted you to find out about all this the aunt i dont know merrily lit a cigarette alice seems to be the eldest sister she and her husband opened a chip shop in ledwardine about twenty years ago he died a while back she must be well into her seventies now but still works there parttime and does most of the cleaning in the church and her niece in solihull recently went on an alpha course which seems to have inspired alice to come to one of our sunday evenings felt the holy spirit was in her heart like a big white bird and you could feel its wings fluttering as if this big bird was trying to escape from her breast and fill the whole world with love and healing you got yourself an enormously interesting case merrilee lew jeavons said why you trying to avoid it am i reach out embrace he laughed hugely the bastard the white company cool name but well come on what did you expect jane stood by the stairs with ben watching them bunched in the hall under the blown bulb and thinking that at least they blended with the decor of the three of them elizabeth pollen was the most animated there was a youngish guy with limp hair and harry potter glasses who had like anorak stamped across his shallow forehead and if he didnt have spots it was only because the clearasil was working this week which meant that alistair hardy the medium the main man had to be the heavyset sixtyish person with pewtery hair and an intermittent scowl and a briefcase a man clearly aware of his professional standing like a smalltown bank manager it was laughable right ben said if were all in agreement id like to record some of alistairs testing of the individual rooms antony largo would have been here himself but hes tied up on another project at the present and so and then what ben did he plucked the sony out of janes hands just blatantly lifted it ill have to shoot this myself moving away with the camcorder he tossed her a brief faintly rueful smile over his shoulder jane you might like to watch how i do this give you a few basic ideas son of a bitch jane was boiling with embarrassment she thought she could see the harry potter guy smirking she turned to look for amber but amber had gone maybe to barricade the kitchen natalie appeared in the lounge doorway met janes eyes and shrugged sympathetic but helpless shock of the proof in the dining room alistair hardy said he could see a spirit it was all quite repulsive jane thought like he was feigning a stroke hardy was wearing a dark grey suit and a black tie maybe to suggest respect for the dead and it was as though one side of him had gone numb an arm was sticking out from his body fingers curled as if he was holding another hand hed moved to the area where jane had stood with her tray while serving breakfast to ben and antony and absorbing their edgy banter the stained glass in the window with only the night behind it looked as dense as lead the concertina radiators were silent ben and amber had no heat to waste ben was into a crouch no more than a yard away from hardy aiming the camera upwards probably to make the guy look more majestic also close enough according to eirions rules to pick up usable sound through the builtin mike theres an elderly lady with a stick no its a walking oh what do you call it hardys metallic voice was pitched up like a priest in church if he was supposed to be from edinburgh why didnt he have a scottish accent sounded faintly west midlands to jane a zimmer frame an elderly lady with a zimmer frame jane standing over by the door with natalie murmured well that sounds suitably victorian it was freezing in here she zipped up her fleece she hadnt yet decided if hardy was a phoney or merely selfdeluded but the fact that the filming had been literally taken out of her hands allowed her to be as cynical and acidic as she liked i believe this place actually used to be an old peoples home alistair the harry potter guy said yes hardy said thank you matthew jane thought he must have known that anyway it was strange really she had this fairly liberal acceptance of the paranormal based on a couple of meaningful experiences of her own but spiritualism just didnt light her candle it was fusty and sad it was rooms full of lumbering furniture and old ladies smelling of camphor i would say the poor old dear had dementia hardy said she still doesnt seem to be fully aware of her own passing and so she walks this room around and around i expect i can probably help her get to where she should be when i have a little more time meanwhile well just leave her to hobble around for a few more weeks jane murmured this guy should be working for the nhs natalie shook her head a little smile on her perfect ironic lips what precisely did natalie believe in jane realized she had no idea and somewhere the incurious clancy was quietly getting on with her homework jane didnt understand that either ben said from behind the camera just the one ah spirit alistair his voice was conversational you could hear it on tv already the outofshot directors diffident prompt im fairly sure this room is not the one were looking for ben hardys arm relaxed his fingers uncurling not to worry you didnt get much in the lounge either no lets go back into the hall perhaps upstairs jane looked at ben ben said nothing she wondered how amber would react if he showed hardy the secret passageway under the stairs or if he took them up to hattie chancerys room she and nat let the four of them go through and waited ben had hurried ahead to get a shot of them vacating the dining room he wouldnt want the staff in the picture this is moderately naff jane murmured to natalie perhaps its not for us to say nat was demure tonight in a black woollen dress the kind mum might wear of course she was responsible for this setting it up because it would be good for the hotel but would it if stanner developed a reputation as the haunt of saddoes where was the future in that i mean do you believe that guy can see anything at all i dont know jane what do you think i think maybe he does or did have some psychic ability but if its not happening for him hell just make something up thats where it all goes wrong nobody gets it all the time but if youre a socalled professional medium with an audience expecting fireworks youre going to make sure they get what they want arent you like if you know this place was once an old peoples home you invent an old girl on a zimmer and what does your mother think you been talking to amber ben told me about her that guy is so discreet amber would like it if mum came in and scattered some holy water before the white company gets into it and would she do that probably but the point is that i would rather she didnt get involved because i like it here you know i like this job when they decided it was safe to leave the dining room they saw alistair hardy moving upstairs up the red carpet and oh hell amber was alone at the top of the kitchen steps her face was blank but you could sense the tension in the way she was standing both hands pressing on her apron with the design of a cottage on a hill there was a subdued tension everywhere the air drab with negative emotion and it was like the fabric of stanner hall was moulding itself around this like bad vibes were part of its heritage if ben was aware of this he was pretending he wasnt crouching at the bottom of the stairs shooting alistair hardy he loves it for the drama he doesnt believe in it for one minute hardy had got halfway to the first landing when he abruptly turned and came down again ben im being pulled the other way ben carried on recording digital video was dirtcheap according to eirion and went on for ever hardy came quietly down standing at the foot of the stairs with one arm out at an unnatural angle his eyes not quite shut so that you could see the whites like the light under a closed door maybe he was simply telepathic and had picked up what was threshing around in ambers head slowly like a soldier patrolling a boundary hardy walked away into the dimmer part of the hall where the blown bulb was he looked across at amber who looked away then he turned back beth pollen and the others watching him in silence mrs pollen had on a short grey cape like nurses used to wear over a long viridian skirt would have made better video jane thought if she was the medium youre not alone are you jane twisted round alistair hardy was standing next to her she could smell his aftershave it seemed wrong somehow for a medium to be wearing aftershave shouldnt they project a neutral ambience jane stiffened it was like the way cats always chose to rub up against the one person in the room who was allergic to cat hair she tried to move away and bumped into harry potter who didnt move hardy was looking at her as if he was noticing her for the first time she met his eyes flat and grey and somehow leaden like the stained glass in the dining room with no light behind it she glanced away found herself gazing directly into the dark lens of the camcorder ben on his knees on the worn rug in the centre of the hall poised and steady and relaxed she found they were all grouped around her now like a coven what jane spun looking for a way out of this the hall seemed suddenly full of people and shadows rather distinguished woman hardy said elderly but not at all like the poor dear in the dining room has your im sorry i dont know your name jane said nothing reluctant to give anything away to this creep shed been fitted up she wanted to kick the camera out of bens hands then again she wanted to go on working here possibly jane she said sullenly ah yes as if hed known that all along and was just making sure that she knew who she was jane have you a granny whos passed not to my knowledge hardy smiled his bank managers smile he had a gold filling shes definitely with you my dear and youre sure she hasnt got alzheimers he kept on smiling which was unnerving he was supposed to lose his temper with her spiritualists had no sense of humour everybody knew that property alistair hardy said she has a message for you relating to property his right hand seemed to be vibrating fingers clawed i dont deal much in property these days she says tell them not to give up on the house jane shrugged usual banal crap shes taller than you alistair hardy said as tall as me formidable i think would be the word she has rather sharp features strong would be a better word not someone to trifle with certainly and shes wearing a shawl quite a large thick shawl dont know anyone with a shawl well my mum has an old black one that she jane shut her mouth it was like with fortune tellers you never went along with it never fed them information they could build on she looked beyond alistair hardy into the sepia shadowstain around the bulb that had blown its not quite a shawl its help me here somebody what do you call one of those garments that became very popular for a while back in the seventies south american origins he lifted his good arm started to snap his fingers in the air somebody whats the word come on this is quite significant oh beth pollen said you mean the word had burst in janes brain before it was uttered she kept on staring into the blown bulb like her consciousness was being drawn into its fog and the broken filament inside the bulb was the size of a dead tree her hands going numb around it she felt insubstantial grey and vague barely feeling her legs give way you mean a poncho mrs pollen said over the clanking of the van gomer said it dont sound right to me boy sounds like he was handing you a barrowload of ole bullshit he was always full of it danny admitted bands of brigands roaming by night gomer and danny were both staring through the windscreen at the lightless fields beyond walton sloping up to radnor forest they were going to pick up young jane watkins at stanner before gomer dropped danny off at home else shed think gomer had forgotten about her thats what he said he dreckon its the only way the farmers gonner keep the fox population under control when the government bans huntin with hounds ah well gomer said i can understand sebbie comin out with that ole wallop when hes got the mp round his place for cocktails put the frighteners on the politicians kind of thing but not to the likes of we so what was them bloody welshies doin in jeremys yard then they had his barn all staked out gomer like theyd got the fox trapped up in there all it was was jeremys ole sheepdog theydve bloody shot that dog if the kiddie hadnt run in shot the dog out of sheer spite i reckon shouldve called in the law boy let them sort it out he wouldnt he wouldnt do it gomer then you oughter be asking why he wouldnt that was what sebbie said that we oughter be asking why jeremy didnt want the cops round and then the bastard was asking me if i was still doin dope like as if jeremy didnt want no cops round for the same reason i never did you ent still danny coughed bit of homegrown strickly for personal use and only a bit giving gomer a nervous glance on account of to gomers generation a twist of wacky baccy could put you on the downescalator into hell and blacken the name of gomer parry plant hire for ever pigs dont do you for that nmore see long as you ent dealin he was being a bit careful though since dacre had dropped the little phrase drug squad he might be full of bullshit but he did have contacts gomer drove on steadily said nothing good ole boy so this woman danny said miz natalie craven two ways of lookin at that gomer on the one hand blokes is like lucky devil whats he got we ent whereas womens sayin shes bewitched him the slag and sebbie dacre gomer wondered whats sebbie think about her sebbies had his share danny said zelda morgan ennit now zelda aye off the boil a bit what i yeard zelda mabbe figurin it wasnt worth the candle sebbies moods or mabbe sebbies thinkin he can do better than zelda gomer said mabbe lookin for a woman of means way he got fleeced by the missus in the divorce court have you danny hesitating as they rattled out onto the kington road you yeard anythin about sebbie goin strange gomer what way well the welsh shooters settin em on jeremy like hes got an obsession with jeremy now jeremys got hisself a serious woman anything really you reckon its to do with the woman dunno they drove on in silence for a while then danny said sometimes it feels like everythings filled up with someing and its only a matter of time fore it bursts i thought it was the snow you know that feeling you get when theres snow on the way but it ent just snow gomer looked at him well if you feel that way think what its like for jeremy berrows nat had taken jane down to the kitchen there was an old flowerypatterned sofa under one of the high windows and they sat there and jane drank hot sugary tea in the opposite corner clancys homework was spread over a card table when it was established that jane was ok clancy had gone back to it she was working quietly underlining things with a ruler its never happened to me before jane shuffled to the edge of the sofa glaring into her cup she felt furious now at having personally created one of those moments for alistair hardy could imagine the harry potter creep relaying the story to his anorak mates or worse keying it into some global spiritualist chatroom the story of the girl who was determined to slag everything off just keeling over with the shock of the proof it happens natalie said next to her it doesnt happen to me i never faint natalie said nothing she hadnt asked the obvious question nobody had not even alistair hardy where are they in the bar nat said hes still looking for what he calls a point of contact wheres amber i dont know ambers in a state wishing shed never seen this place something like that jane said quickly when we first moved to ledwardine i had a very good friend who ran a shop that was devoted to the history and folklore of the area and the poetry of thomas traherne look you dont have to tell me natalie said your past above all things is your own youre not obliged i want to its going to drive me insane otherwise and i cant tell mum for obvious reasons she was called lucy devenish and she was killed on the road knocked off her moped she was elderly and thin and she had a face like some old warrior and she the tears were like spikes behind janes eyes every time she went out nat she wore this bloody poncho nat said nothing there was silence in the vast kitchen except for a slow bubbling from the stove and the squeak of clancys fibretip clancy always pressed down too hard as if the words might fade otherwise jane clasped her hands together squeezing tightly do you think he took her out of my mind stole the memory you see i cant believe that even if she i cant believe lucy would talk to a tosser like that i feel hes been into my mind i feel like hes extracted her like some computer hacker can get into your hard disk and pull out some ancient buried file its like a kind of rape i doubt that jane nat said that he took it from my mind natalie didnt reply there were footsteps on the stone stairs and then alistair hardy was standing there with harry potter hardy had his jacket off he wore a pair of those archaic expanding armbands around his shirt sleeves he peered at jane his face shiny all right now are we my love were fine just i hadnt had anything to eat since breakfast i felt sick earlier thats all it was i feel fine now good hardy said mind if we come in natalie stood up well i think you ought to wont take a moment this is the kitchen is it he blinked or servants quarters once i suppose thats right harry potter said ive seen the victorian plans whered you get those jane stood up she was half afraid her legs would give way again but she was ok plans they had plans of the house did ben know about this wheres ben natalie said oh hes gone outside harry potter pulled a slick of hair from his concave forehead we were out near the entrance and there was some shooting going on in the grounds and he said it was coming through on the soundtrack and ruining everything he was really annoyed hes gone out to you know remonstrate with them hell the shooters oh christ natalie jumped up pushed between alistair hardy and potter almost colliding with someone moving slowly down the stone steps amber she stood at the foot of the steps for several seconds after nat had gone jane wanted to go after nat but amber those people will not go into my fucking kitchen jane saw alistair hardy walking in his measured deliberate way across the flags until the island unit the size of australia was between him and amber you mustnt be afraid mrs foley he said nancy boy amber said and it was almost a wail this is the kitchen this is the heart of the house yes precisely alistair hardy was leaning forward over the enormous island unit his hands splayed on the oiled hardwood the bank manager at his desk laying down the options but he and amber werent coming from the same direction at all jane knew that much amber meant that the kitchen was the heart of her own shrinking world this woman was probably all that was truly professional and worthwhile about the stanner hall hotel and this was her refuge where what remained of her confidence was located while the rest of the house faded and dripped and crumbled and rotted and soaked up money this was her place whereas hardy its on a lower level than the rest harry potter explained they had to build the foundations into the rock this part of the house is sunk into some of the oldest stone in the country over six hundred and fifty million years so what amber was arching from the hips in furious incomprehension i mean six hundred million four thousand million all rocks pretty bloody old compared with the human race i dont see the point of this she backed off a little maybe realizing that she was shouting at the people who would be paying for christmas mrs foley beth pollen was stepping down on to the flags oh golly what a mess all my fault i assumed you were au fait with everything if id known you were at all worried i live just a few miles away i could easily have you dont understand amber said for jane the vast kitchen had taken on a cavernlike feel the purplygreyness the uneven lighting the high windows like enlarged slits in the stone perhaps some of that very ancient stone was in these actual walls ambers kitchen sanctuary formed out of stanner rocks in the corner clancy sat watching from her card table the pen still in her right hand amber must have touched a switch somewhere because the small bank of halogen lights came on turning hardys face bright pink he didnt move mrs foley i knew as soon as i came down the steps this is where it happened i dont know what youre talking about amber said its in the records the harry potter guy matthew strolled into the centre of the room he seemed older now than jane had first figured probably even thirtyish not much younger than amber we know that the textile magnate walter chance who built this house had a vague interest in spiritualism as did a lot of people at the end of the nineteenth century it was fashionable state of the art except that to them of course it was very much a science with lots of gadgets the scientific advances and the technological developments during this comparatively short period were mindbogg we know all that jane said and was gratified when matthew looked at her irritated who is this girl kitchenmaid jane did a tight smile with attitude let him finish jane amber said lets get this over with walter retired here with his new young wife matthew looked at amber i expect you know all this it was clear to jane that amber didnt but had ben known were there aspects of this that hed hidden because if there were he was going to be in some deep trouble tonight mrs bella chance or chancery as they were known by then was from london matthew said and walter wanted to give her the kind of social life she was used to hed throw these big house parties no expense spared hence a kitchen this size loads of servants hed invite minor aristocracy and some of them even turned up but walter chancery was generally regarded as pretty crass and vulgar and they were never really accepted either by the local people or by the gentry jane thought she could hear raised voices from outside hoped to god after what clancy had told her about the bad attitude of the shooters at jeremys that ben wasnt chancing his arm with them especially while she wasnt there with her video camera christ what if he still had it with him what if it got broken nothing she could do couldnt walk out now besides this was becoming interesting stuff worth knowing for a student of the border if you could put up with the anorak drone so when walter discovered that conan doyle had friends and relatives nearby and sometimes stayed in the area you see we just dont have authors now as celebrated as conan doyle was then if the strand was publishing a new holmes story thered be endless queues for copies now doyle was told about the hound by his friend fletcher robinson who despite being a devonian was said to have come across the story in a welsh guidebook so we assume that doyle was making inquiries about it in the area and the chancerys when they learned that the great man was staying in the vicinity well you can imagine they just had to have him as their house guest im sorry amber came into the light i think this is conjecture bens been all over the place trying to find evidence mrs foley beth pollen came forward her cape folded over her arm looking reassuringly nice and motherly but you never really knew with these people the main reason your husband didnt find out about this was simply because nobody wanted him to the only remaining family in this area related to the chancerys are the dacres who certainly dont like to talk about it i dont know them it wouldnt help you if you did theres only one left sebastian dacre and hes a difficult man ironically the one place where your husband might have laid hands on useful documentation was in the very extensive records of the baker street league in london which is where i first happened upon them does this begin to make a certain kind of sense amber said and you have copies of this documentation mysteriously or perhaps not so mysteriously when i applied to the committee to draw out the relevant papers to allow me to make some photocopies they seemed to have disappeared i explained all this to your husband earlier youre saying this is something to do with dr kennedy dr kennedy now disputes that the material ever existed and dr kennedy is now in virtual control of the league furthermore he and most of the present committee very much deplore the white company and all it stands for theyd rather forget doyles obsession with spiritualism and im not sure theyd go out of their way to preserve an account handwritten by a participant in the stanner seances for a london magazine coxs quarterly which it appears paid for it in full but never in fact published it was in fact persuaded we think not to publish and youre saying this article proved conclusively that conan doyle based his novel on the legend of thomas vaughan and the hound of hergest ambers hands were pushing down the bulges in her apron again is that what youre saying what i read certainly suggested that after his evening here doyle was fully acquainted with the vaughan story weve since established that the man who wrote it who was quite elderly at the time died within a year of submitting it still waiting for his piece to appear and the magazine itself went to the wall a short time later we dont know how or when the article fell into the hands of the baker street league but i dont suppose thats important now interesting jane imagined ben and antony in london doorstepping neil kennedy for the programme so tell us dr kennedy why did you suppress documentary evidence that arthur conan doyles novel was based not in devon but on the welsh border she waited for amber to ask the other crucial question what happened here but amber didnt amber really didnt want to know sod that excuse me jane stood up you said the writer of this article was a participant like participant in what what did they actually do here in this room there was a silence she never got an answer in the midst of the hush she heard chair legs scraping the flags in clancys corner of the kitchen as beth pollen looked at hardy and matthew adjusted his glasses and said should i attempt to by then clancy was on her feet mum matthew was frozen into silence natalie had arrived at the bottom of the kitchen steps dark brown hair tumbled over one eye the sleeves of her black woollen dress pushed up over the elbows both men looking at her because that was what men did amber the calmness in nats voice was like this really thin membrane over panic do we have a firstaid kit the halogen lights were showing up around her wrists these wild wet swatches of what could only be jesus christ fresh blood ambers whole body jerked wheres ben jane sprang up and ran for the steps at the bottom of the car park there was a small wroughtiron gate to an old footpath that ben had cleared the path went down through the grounds curving through tangled woodland almost to the edge of the bypass facing stanner rocks this was where ben went jogging most mornings you could go along the side of the main road and then join up with the main drive back to the hotel now the gate was open footprints in the snow jane went through hesitantly carrying the rubbercovered torch that amber had given her there was no great need for it the moon was out and the ground was bright with virgin snow careful amber said the white canvas firstaid bag over her shoulder for gods sake we dont know its all right bens voice from some yards away bens voice like jane had never heard it before kind of thin and stringy its all right amber all right now just the other side of the gate was a small clearing jane stayed on the edge of it and shone the torch towards bens voice the beam unrolled a white carpet slicked by the marks of skidding footwear no sign of the shooters no voices other than the foleys stay there jane amber put down the firstaid bag and said to ben what have you done it was like shed asked him to stir the soup and hed let it boil over it was always easy to underestimate amber she worried about intangibles but only because she was a practical person controlled shed sent natalie to the ladies loo to get cleaned up and then stand by to call an ambulance im sorry ben let out a long hollow breath that was more than a halfsob im really sorry about this at the same time she saw ben jane heard these liquid snuffling noises knowing as he turned into the torchlight that he was not making them behind him was a fence post with no fence only shornoff twists of barbed wire nailed to it and a hump on the ground ben turned fully towards them rising and jane gasped his edwardian jacket hung open exposing his oncewhite shirt emblazoned now with a blotch like a red rose lost it ben said i lost it and then he giggled he was trembling hard he stumbled oh jesus hold the torch a bit steadier can you jane amber looked at ben it was like hed been fighting a duel and staggered back rapiered through the heart no really im all right dont bother about me im really all right we should see to he gestured vaguely at the hump on the ground jane had been afraid to look at the hump hoping it was a dead tree or something something that didnt snuffle im sorry about this ben said again the man was lying with his shoulders propped against the fence post he was wearing camouflage trousers an army jacket he was holding his head back against the post you couldnt see much of his face through all the blood but his mouth was hanging open and there was blood in there too and all around his lips and nose bubbling through a film of dirt and snot jane recoiled swallowing bile it was like hed been bobbing for apples in a barrel of blood called me a nancy boy you see ben moved away back so that amber could undo the firstaid bag nat tried to stop the bleeding not very successfully im afraid he needs to go to a hospital ambers voice was crisp as the snow youve broken his nose for a start is that really necess i mean cant you ben youve smashed his face i cant believe you could it was dark i couldnt see what i for gods sake amber they were destroying it all everything was going so and then these these bloody shots shaking all the glass in the windows these bast thats illegal thats the man on the ground squirmed as if he was trying to get up and then he slid back down the post like he was tied to it he tried to speak but his voice was like a thick soup he started to choke amber said jane leave me the torch and then go back to the house and tell nat we need an ambulance will you naw the man was prising himself up his back jammed against the fence post no abulath ben snatched the torch away from jane the way hed grabbed the video camera and held it up over his shoulder the way police held their torches gripping the lighted end so they could use the thick stem as a club whats he saying he said no ambulance jane retched amber said what are you going to do now ben beat all his teeth out you dont understand ben shone the torch briefly round the clearing theres two more of these bastards somewhere and a gun one of thems got a gun hes jane backed away hes right they were at jeremys they were going to shoot jeremys dog then tell natalie to phone the police as well amber said jane go yes jane turned away grateful for an excuse and ran blindly across the clearing towards the wooden gate couldnt believe what ben had done ok he was furious at the shooters invading his land and it had been building up for weeks and he was frustrated and desperate for something to work out but this was ben foley artistic funny slightly camp you thought you knew people you thought you knew she was pulling at the gate when the hands came down on her shoulders twenty not about foxes so how did you find out vicar alice meek said resignation there but no big surprise who told you merrily shook her head wouldnt be fair but it was more a question of finding out that there was something to find out you know you was guided alice put a mug of coffee in front of her see dexter he thought you was just gonner lay your hands on him he said he wouldnt mind that he come back afterwards he says thats it dont wanner go nmore i said dexter i said nothing comes easy in this life you want the holy spirit to pay you a visit in all his glory i said you gotter play your part boy alice had a bungalow in a new close off old barn lane not a hundred yards from her chip shop alices kitchen was bright and shiny and full of chrome like a chip shop in fact it occurred to merrily that of all the women who gave up their time to clean the church alice was probably the oldest the busiest and the richest and no kids dexter could be in for a sizeable bequest whatever alice wanted dexter would have to listen what i was going to suggest alice nervously merrily sipped the coffee it was as shed expected the kind you made if you needed to work all night i mean there might be something in this for more than dexter she hadnt wanted to waste any time to dwell too much on this before taking action shed walked straight down to old barn lane and gone into the chip shop just as it was opening for the evening alice wasnt working tonight but the woman there sharon had phoned alice at home and alice had told sharon to send the vicar round directly ent never had no kids vicar as you know used to babysit the others oldest sister no kids you spends half your nights babysitting they think theyre doing you a favour alice sat herself down in a chromeframed chair at the chromelegged table what im saying i knowed all of em vicar all them kids bettern their own mothers in some ways truth was known kids talks to the babysitter see when they wakes up in the night when theyre tryin to put you off sending em to bed they talks so dexter darrin roland babysitted all them boys for years never hardly had a saturday night at home roland he wasnt like the others upsets me still to think about that child he was like he didnt belong in that family theyre im saying this even though its my own family but theyre a rough bunch vicar ent got no social graces ent saying theres no goodness at the heart of em but you gotter dig deep sometimes cept with roland a true innocent that child he was that innocent it was like he didnt belong in this world which is a daft thing to say i know what you mean like he never growed a skin vicar sometimes i wakes up in the night years him clear as day sniffin his tears back daddy was drunk hed say daddyd come in drunk and he smelled bad saturdays see richie hed spend the whole afternoon in the pub come back trample on the kids toys and laugh hisself daft about it then theyd go out him and my sister lisa and id come round and babysit and clean up the mess and dry the tears and talk to roland darrin he was his dads son didnt wanner talk got bored easy roland he wasnt like neither of them you think about what happened to him and you think why why was he put on this earth for that short time for that to happen you learned something from him merrily said yes alices sharp little eyes filled up a rarity merrily guessed what about dexters family thats the middle sister kathleen her exhusband mike least he kept a job longern a week when they was together none of em was bright look no getupandgo you only gotter look at dexter i couldnt look at dexter for months mind after roland died i thought god help me why couldnt it be him instead or darrin darrins been in trouble i never knows whether hes in or out of prison vicar been in that many times beyond all redemption now that boy his dad he was always destructive but that was just clumsy and careless through drink mostly he never done nothing criminal most he ever got done for was urinatin in a public place doorway of the old house dead centre of the city all the shops still open you imagine anybody that stupid thick as a beamend richie but darrin when his ma blamed dexter for what happened to roland darrin went and did damage on them and kath and mike they wouldnt put the police on him cause they was ashamed of what dexter done merrily sighed problem with dexter look he ent got no charm do he vicar too fat ent too pretty to look at and not much of a way with him nothin about him is there most people they dont know what he did never did even at the time his name wasnt in no papers nor nothin cause of his age but he always reckons everybody knows and whatever he do they ent gonner think no better of him so he dont even make the effort but inside it all builds up until he cant breathe it all added up except perhaps for the requiem for roland seventeen years dead this was something she wouldnt even have thought of before meeting llewellyn jeavons it was unknown country embrace lew had said embrace the entire dysfunctional family was she big enough for this nobody got no time for the boy but me nmore alice said hes had girlfriends but they drifts away ent a good bet is he she looked at merrily what you got in mind then vicar you gonner have to spell it out for an ole woman the difficult part merrily looked up and saw her own face reflected warped and stretched and crushed in shiny things on shelves danny thomas said well take him to the hospital in the van no problem at all he turned to the man with the face like a bloodied waxwork nathan ennit as i recall the guy grunted something about his mates amber apparently oblivious to the cold and the carnage had cleaned his wounds the best she could and gone calmly back to the hotel it was all less disturbing now in the clearing with danny and gomer there looks like your mates didnt hang about boy gomer said if they got a mobile we can phone em from the hospital and theyll come and pick you up mabbe everything was turned around now the moment of panic when the hands had come down on janes shoulders and then the moment of wild relief when ben had shone the torch on the mans face and it had a beard and hair like grey seaweed around it and a puzzled expression yes but how ben sounded worried again hows he going to explain to the hospital what happened stick to the truth id say gomer said what happened he slipped on the ice and snow and come down on that ole broken post with his nose wed just parked the van comin to pick janey up and we years the poor bugger moaning dont reckon our friend yeres gonner wanner make nmore of it than that jane had to smile for a while after what happened to his depot and to nev it had looked like gomers effective years were over hed been erratic disconnected now he was back in gear and bringing danny into the business that had been inspired mavericks both of them if you got a toilet that ent too posh with a basin and an ole pair of jeans that might help too danny said to ben well stand outside make sure he dont get away all right nathan nathan might have nodded the blood had stopped flowing but he was still breathing through his mouth this is very good of you guys ben said i dont know what you saw not much gomer assured him not much at all what you wanner do now janey come with us to the hospital or i come and pick you up on the way back thatd be out of your way jane said id better come i suppose not exactly looking forward to sharing a back seat with the remains of nathan but what could she do she waited with gomer in the foyer while danny escorted nathan into the groundfloor gents and ben ran upstairs to replace his torn and saturated trousers there was no sign of the white company were they still in the kitchen was she missing alistair hardys first attempts to reach sir arthur conan doyle all that stuff seemed so unreal now as unreal as the idea of lucy devenish floating around her like some pagan angel what did you really see she asked gomer like i said not much at all janey gomer got out his tin to roll a ciggy starts off when were just about to turn up the drive and danny spots this green discovery in the layby across the road no lights had a runin with these boys the other night see clancy told me did she well dannys quite keen to discuss a little matter of severe damage to gretas runabout so he pulls in and we waits a while then we sees the three of em running up the drive with the gun then theres about three shots thats it for danny puts the lights on full beam the ole fog lamps too goes revving up the drive windows down bawling out armed police stay where you are seen em do it on the box cool bloody worked too ennit they wouldnt know that stage they muster took to the woods cause next thing we seen two of em back on the road behind us jump straight into the discovery and off this one nathan your mate foley likely had him cornered by then time we gets to the top we years foley shoutin at the feller miz craven trying to calm both of em down hes saying to the welshie just tell us what this is about all we wanner knows what its about someone payin you to make trouble kind of thing then miz craven her says someing and then this welshie he dont sound too scared not then we years him go so what you gonner do about it you and this nancy boy and thats when i reckon foley goes for him insult to injury jane recalled ben on the last night of the murder weekend they think im soft they think im effete some arty bastard from london then hed said where i come from we have real hard bastards scary so what if the hospital ask questions ah that boy he ent gonner say nothin wouldnt look too good where he comes from getting isself filled in by pardon me a london pansy what if the hospital tell the police gomer shrugged lighting his ciggy could always not bother goin all the way to the hospital kick the bugger out side o the road and for a few moments jane thought that was what they were going to do when danny thomas pulled into the bay fronting a closed and lightless garden centre on the hereford road and switched off the engine right then danny said he and nathan were in the front jane and gomer sitting on bags of sand and cement on the deck of the van nathan had his shaven head tilted over the back of his seat he was wearing the jeans that ben had brought for him they were too long and they were white a last desperate joke as ben had accepted from danny with a moue of distaste the bin liner containing nathans camouflage trousers nathan sat up in a hurry there was enough moonlight to show that he was very scared relax danny said what you gotter worry about all you done is wrecked my wifes car and nearly put my eye out with a rifle do i look like the sorter feller holds a grudge nathan made a lunge at the door slamming into it with his shoulder he cried out oh im sorry danny said oughterve told you that doors knackered he is only opens from the outside you gotter wind down the window see lean out and do it that way you wanner bit o help with that is it nathan slumped still breathing hard through his mouth like he had a very heavy headcold juss fuggig ged id over what beat the shit out of you mess those lovely dinky white jeans nathan we come to your aid man were your friends fuggoff and friends what does friends do but share a few confidences a lighted bus went past on the hereford road and you could see the scar on dannys forehead like an angry red slugtrail beside jane gomer took out his ciggy tin jane began to feel an edge of trepidation about what they were going to do to a man already in need of serious medical attention nathan said you lemme out now made well leave id at thad eh mate danny said mate i was a fucking longhaired twat if you recall the other night he leaned towards nathan do you recall the other night nathan said nothing well i recalls it in detail nathan i recalls leavin with a whole load o questions bobbing around in my head which also happened to hurt like hell so where you wanner start lets start with whos paying you lets start with mr sebbie dacre dacres nod payig us nothig danny pondered this nodding rhythmically like he was at a gig nathan one thing we dont do is we dont lie to our friends now we can have you all tucked up in casualty in ten minutes or at least in the bloody queue or we can sit yere a while longer admiring the moonlight over the wye valley im id fuggig agony you bassard the sweat on nathans face was making the dried blood glisten like jam and i feel for you nathan but we ent goin nowhere till after we has a meaningful conversation now dacre tells us go id heavy nathan said on foley uh nathan twisted his head beows what beddows jeremy berrows nathan nodding said he was a bad tenad he ent a bloody tenant didn pay nebber fixed fences loosed his sheep bullshit is whaddhe said nathan coughing phlegmy said go id hard beast on his ground he wont kill id beast seven grand nathan said what seven grand if we geds him nathan swearda god we brings him a body we geds seven cash on the back seat jane went rigid gomer carried on rolling his ciggy run that by me again nathan danny said fuggsake we brigs him a beast its seven thousad cash there was a long silence gomer wet the ciggy paper with the tip of his tongue jane looked at nathan he wasnt as old as shed thought might be no more than midtwenties and maybe not as hard as hed imagined he was you could start to feel sorry for nathan but she still didnt understand what he was on about seven thousand forgive me we ent talking bout foxes yere are we danny said nathan tried to breathe through his shattered nose and the breath got caught somewhere there was a clicky ratchety noise and nathan whimpered in pain whatever hed done jane just wished theyd get this over get him to hospital what then danny said dog jane breathed in hard clancy said danny raised a hand go on nathan killid sheep dacre said hed god five six sheep throas ripped out when dunno recent didn wad no fuss no panig see just wannid dealin wid for seven grand you really expect me to wadds id kept quiet he does dassa mai

jeremy berrowss sheepdog we wadder godder shoot no fuggig sheedog nathan gritted his teeth rocking his head bigger yeh down from the ridge big black bugger danny turned round to gomer he on about hold on boy gomer leaned over dannys seat and jane knew what mum meant about the light in his glasses you talking someing like for instance there was this socalled puma down west wales year or two back uh nathan nodding hard wincing at the pain we was on dat how dacre god onto us see a mystery beast thats what youre sayin dacre reckons hes got a mystery beast preying on his stock nathan closed his eyes still nodding sank down in the passenger seat jane felt this unearthly tingle comin out of jeremy berrowss ground uh danny said let me get this right boy sebbie dacre was offering you and your mates seven thousand pound if you brought him the body of a big black dog that been attacking his flocks usin you on account he didnt want no local boys involved nathan made some kind of grunt you could probably take as affirmation danny turned back to gomer i knew it see all that bullshit about demonstratin what its gonner be like if they bans huntin with hounds the hound jane said breathless the black gomer put a hand on her arm dont get too carried away janey we dont know the half of it yet berrowss ground danny whispered gwilym bufton said sebbie seen it on berrowss ground jane said danny i think she was looking at nathan struggling to sit up a gout of fresh bright blood flooded out over his lips jane stifled a scream oh hell danny said not too calmly he turned on the engine part three it was several years before we discovered there was anything ghostly about it id never believed in ghosts really not until we experienced it ourselves about three years ago walking up the stairs late in the evening i got to about here and there was a shadowy figure crossed straight across in front of me sort of a crouched person almost like a largish sort of dog just passed straight in front of me and into the inner hall and well i didnt see any more after that a prickly feeling went up my back john williams farmer hergest court cwn annwn turning over the apartment this wasnt something you did lightly the attic door opened easily no alarm went off though it wouldnt have come as a big surprise to find one had been secretly installed merrily stood on the threshold of janes domain remembering how important having her own apartment had been to the kids acceptance aged fifteen of a new life in ledwardine just a child then two years ago incredibly shed been just a child now she was a working woman with a provisional driving licence and in a relationship was this really the new going out with someone sometimes it felt that while jane and eirion were in a relationship she and lol were just going out even though they never did merrily felt her age like a grey blanket around her shoulders standing in the doorway looking up at the walls an enormous colour chart for emulsion paint even on a drab day the mondrian walls currently giant slabs of crimson cobalt blue and chrome yellow were startling enough to have the listed buildings department chasing an injunction if they ever found out merrily went in this visit was long overdue it wasnt that jane had been particularly secretive or moody or preoccupied or anything like that in fact after her longdarknightofthesoul period during the autumn shed been unusually bright and animated which had seemed to be down to the weekend job the sense of grownup independence it would be giving her and more merrily remembered working saturdays at sixteen in a small indy record shop putting on her black and purple goth makeup like a uniform getting paid to be cool then the record shop had closed down the way they did and shed found a backroom job in an oldfashioned department store where the merest smear of goth and you were out welcome to the world of work what she couldnt quite understand was what was so longterm cool about washing up and waiting tables in a cold rundown underfinanced countryhouse hotel run by a redundant tv executive with no catering experience and a young delia smith who should have known better naturally shed been over to stanner and met them both this being janes first weekend job it was important to check it out and amber and ben foley had seemed pleasant and wellintentioned and almost certainly doomed the bed was made and very neatly this was the bed to which jane had brought eirion last summer eirion blurting it out to merrily the very next day after shed accused him of being a nice guy no im not i slept with your daughter merrily smiled innocents really both of them this afternoon under an hour ago lol had rung from profs studio ominously hesitant the familiar leaden thud of a bag of anxiety landing on the doorstep lol had been hesitant as long as shed known him much less so with her now obviously no taboos between them any more all right one taboo just the single issue where hesitancy still came into it this is about jane isnt it merrily had said this is one of those situations where you have to decide where your loyalties lie and whats best lol said ultimately he paused she phoned when last night she said it was you know absolutely confidential i was to say nothing to anybody well i realize that anybody almost invariably means you but in this case merrily had sunk into the office chair jagged neon letters spelling out pregnancy and abortion in her head outside it was attempting to snow again like it had been all week shes not pregnant lol said as far as i know how did you its what you always think of first you know me that well anyway she wouldnt tell me a thing like that the things she tells me about are the things that might offend you professionally kids always taken a special kind of delight in offending me professionally youre not cooperating merrily you know you have to cooperate here or i cant go on all right yes ok there is no way shell ever learn you told me as god is my we take that as read lol said this is about lucys house oh well jane knows all about that the relief making her smile we keep our secrets to an absolute minimum these days grownups mates all that stuff jane says lucy doesnt want us to give up on the house well obviously we merrily paused staring out of the window to where the apple tree branches waved vaguely lucy says the late lucy devenish i see merrily said you do lucy has appeared to jane in a dream no through um a third party oh the smile dissolving merrily scrabbling for a cigarette she said shed thought about it for two or three days before deciding to ring in the end shed decided it would be remiss of her not to pass on the message lol what are we talking about here clairvoyant romany shaman she kept saying things like well obviously im in two minds about the whole thing and its probably bollocks anyway after what happened with layla riddock i think shed be quite cautious idve thought that too it seems to be a spiritualist medium lol said she went to a medium i dont think it was that formal but it was obvious she wasnt going to tell me the circumstances so im just i sat around and searched my conscience and i thought well we dont know who the medium is and there are mediums and mediums so i decided i ought to tell you thank you lol its appreciated dont get me wrong lol said lucy was a good friend to me so you rang the agents to see if the buyers had by chance given back word naturally and the people cant wait to move in although they have two children they find it delightfully bijou rather than small and cramped merrily wondered if hed still have told her about jane and the medium if it had turned out that the purchasers had suddenly backed out and lucys house was on the market again she decided he would have in the end but maybe not until contracts had been exchanged typical spirit message then merrily said sodall use danny wasnt sorry the job had been called off it was too cold the sky was tight as a snare drum grains of fine snow collecting on the bonnet of the van like battery acid and gomer was getting on in years and excavating a wildlife pond for this posh bloke from off these were not the best conditions for it so when the fellers new wife comes on the scene going no i think it should be over there dont you darling danny was relieved to hear gomer suggesting they should both think about it for a few days back in the van danny had asked gomer how much he was going to charge the people for a wasted trip and gomer had shaken his head and said that wasnt how you kept your clients fair enough danny had shrugged still an apprentice in the planthire business and gomer had dropped him off back at the farm snow was falling light and fine as dust motes when danny saw the car in front of the galvanized gate and wondered which of gretas mouthy friends hed have to endure before he got any lunch ah now talk of the devil greta giving it the full janis joplin from the living room soon as he let himself in look whos yere danny danny pulled off his wellies and padded in and came face to face with mary morson jeremys ex in the black business suit her wore as some kind of social services gofer at powys council ent you at work mary danny greta blasted flexitime mary morson said smug put on a bit of weight danny noticed pregnant unlikely accidents didnt happen to mary morson listen to this danny greta said just listen to this what did i say about that woman tell it him mary i just thought somebody should enlighten a mutual friend of ours mary looked serious light brown hair tucked behind her ears small disapproving lines either side of her mouth its none of my business really in which case danny go on then danny sighed and tried to get his bum within a yard or two of the woodstove but mary and greta both had chairs pulled up to the heat jerry springer or some such earache was on the telly with the sound thankfully down and he stood in front of that that bitch is cheatin on him already greta said big smile and danny turned briefly thinking her was on about some bint on jerry springer but it wasnt jerry springer on the box after all it was some little blonde homeimprovement tart natalie craven mary said grimly eh that blue camper van the one natalie craven sold to the survey people at stanner rocks i thought you and the naturalist feller was all washed up danny said i still have friends there mary said voice cold as outside they were using the van as a site office and they kept the folding bed as emergency overnight accommodation for volunteers but one day there was evidence that it had been used mabbe one of the volunteers fancied a liedown it can get weary watching little bloody plants grow at night this was mary said when there werent any volunteers on site the van was always kept locked and the keys in a locked drawer at the nature trust office in town anyway marys little nose twitched in distaste they found suggestions of sexual activity like what danny raised his eyes to the big central beam pair o pink knickers with no crot danny greta roared well this is bloody daft gret couple o randy naturalists nips in the ole van for a quick shag and its gotter be listen will you danny sniffed and scowled and mary said the door hadnt been forced it had obviously been unlocked and if anybody mightve had a spare key nobody could think of anybody more likely than the person who sold them the van in the first place so anyway one of the team he left some equipment on the site this night see and had to go back and what should he find parked up there on the edge of the forestry but jeremys fourbyfour and nobody in it but there was a bit of light coming from the camper van and when he looked in the window there she was with a man and it certainly wasnt jeremy it had all come out in a rush and mary morson slumped back in her chair lips tight for the first time in his life danny wanted to physically shake the smile off gretas face natalie no moren youd expect from a woman like that greta said a woman like what i need to spell it out so who was the man he didnt recognize the man mary said he couldnt see him very clearly because he mary looked away i expect she was on top of him but then he doesnt know many local people anyway in which case but he does know jeremy and he knows her danny shut his eyes shit somebody ought to tell him mary said quietly somebody who knows him well when danny said harshly when was this night before last mary morson stood up in front of him theres no mistake about this none at all danny it was her it was natalie craven and a bloke and they were all right were just telling you greta said because youre the nearest hes got to a best friend none of us wants to see him hurt hurt itll kill him you really expect me to go tell him like he dont got enough on his plate who else is going to you wanner wait till its all over kington you mean it ent already oh i forgot you ent been shopping yet did you thats unfair well danny turned away its bloody upset me it has its upset all of us mary morson said shameless merrily checked out the pine bookcase not many changes here the hedgewitch almanac green magic britains pagan places plus another fifty or so pastel spines confirming that jane was still a vague supporter of the old religion which as the kid now admitted was actually not very old at all the shelves were all full no room here for the bible which had failed to address the issue of the mystical british countryside but there was still a corner merrily noted for the thcentury herefordshire cleric thomas traherne whod chronicled its godgiven glories at length this was all about the need for direct experience a confirmation of otherness and of course there was an area of operation where christianity and new age paganism came close together it was spiritual healing it was several days now since shed been to see alice meek suggesting that if there was to be a service of healing it should initially be directed towards the soul of nineyearold roland hook telling alice it all came back to roland all the guilt and the grief and the pain of a young child who had died very afraid in the middle of a crime maybe the knowledge that rolands soul was at peace would bring some kind of harmony to the family right then alice had stood up stiffbacked fieryfaced you leave it with me vicar half of them wont understand what its about dull buggers but ill talk to my niece in solihull her as did the alpha course well make this happen somehow not a word since sophie meanwhile had been compiling a list of ministers in the diocese who had a serious practical interest in healing with a view to organizing a preliminary meeting but it needed someone else to organize it merrily wasnt good at admin she sat on janes bed turning over the apartment was beginning to look like a waste of time had she really expected to find a ouija board laid out next to the collected works of doris stokes shed looked briefly in the wardrobe flicked open dressingtable drawers glanced under the bed not even much dust under there amazing what changes a few weekends of chambermaiding could bring about through the window she could see wooded cole hill with scattered snow up there like grated cheese there hadnt been a serious fall this year maybe it wouldnt come this side of christmas after christmas lol would go on tour for the first time since well since he was hardly older than jane lol finally getting a life where would that leave them dont think about it the only book on the bedside table was a scuffed old favourite the folklore of herefordshire by ella mary leather dead for threequarters of a century and still unsurpassed for downhome authenticity there was an orange postit sticker in the book and merrily let it fall open cwn annwn or the dogs of hell parry hist kington gives an account of the superstitious beliefs of many aged persons then living in the parish it was the opinion of many persons then living in the outtownships that spirits in the shape of black dogs are heard in the air previous to the dissolution of a wicked person they were described as being jet black yet no one pretends to have seen them but many believed that the king of darkness say the gossips sent them to terrify mankind when the soul of a human being was about to quit its earthly tenement kington the final frontier the least known most hidden of herefordshires six towns in appearance more like the radnorshire towns of knighton and rhayader but with streets more cramped than either it was even on the welsh side of offas dyke it was entirely understandable that kington folk even in the nineteenth century should have felt under the dominion of welsh mythology and inevitable that jane working weekends in the area would be interested mrs leather added hergest court was or perhaps still is haunted by a demon dog said to have belonged to black vaughan and to have accompanied him during his life it is seen before a death in the vaughan family a native of kington writes in my young days i knew the people who lived at hergest court well and they used to tell me strange things of the animal how he inhabited a room at the top of the house which no one ever ventured to enter how he was heard there at night clanking his chain how at other times he was seen wandering about minus the chain his favourite haunt was a pond the watering place on the high road from kington the spot was much dreaded and if possible avoided by late travellers i knew many who said they had seen the black dog of hergest right this was the legend alleged to be the source of the hound of the baskervilles ben foley hosted murder weekends at stanner appearing as sherlock holmes on the basis unproven that arthur conan doyle used to stay there this would be jane helping out with background research of course despite being a doctor a man of science conan doyle had been very deeply into spiritualism and psychic matters in general merrily recalled reading how he was convinced that the escapologist harry houdini was using psychic powers to dematerialize which houdini denied to the end doyle had also championed the cottingley fairies photographs fakes hmm merrily shut the book and arranged it carefully on the bedside table the way shed found it she went back to the bookcase crouched down and reinspected the titles one by one this time definitely nothing here suggestive of a new interest in spiritualism when you thought about it the only place jane could realistically have encountered a medium the only place apart from school shed been to in weeks in fact was stanner hall was or perhaps still is haunted by a demon dog but that was hergest court not stanner stanner wasnt old enough to be haunted by a demon dog a demon dog anyway was probably no more than an imprint or a projection nothing demonic about dogs merrily checked out the little room which due to cash flow was still only halfway to becoming janes private bathroom found herself lifting the lid of the toilet cistern nothing but brownish water feeling stupid and treacherous merrily replaced the cistern lid as she left the apartment she looked around the upper landing full of shadows even in the early afternoon and a few trailing cobwebs she ought to get around to removing she cleared her throat were all right you know we can manage lol and me and you must have things to get on with lucy a woman like you she went downstairs shaking her head madness all priests were prey to madness and then on reaching the bottom she immediately turned and went back up and said a small prayer outside janes door paranoia that night it all came back like something shed eaten when the kid said would it be ok if i spent all next weekend at stanner friday till sunday merrily went still hands in the washing up bowl she didnt turn round weather doesnt look too promising flower well i can always cadge a lift with gomer in the truck if it looks bad the thing is they really need me theres a conference on an actual conference dont be like that theyre doing their best what kind of conference oh something called the white company its the title of an historical novel by conan doyle so i expect theyre into like the nonholmes side of it which sounds boring but ben thinks its great like anything at all to do with conan doyle hes up for it and the money naturally interesting man merrily said conan doyle er yeah progressive thinker although he lost a lot of credibility towards the end of his life through his support of spiritualism well he would wouldnt he would he it was all bollocks ben foleys not interested in that side of him then bens got his credibility to think about jane stood up tell you what just to make sure its ok for the weekend how about i walk down to gomers and ask him if hell be around kington with danny and the truck why dont you just give him a ring ive tried always leaves his answering machine on at night look if you light the fire ill be back in no time through the halfopen kitchen door merrily watched jane throwing on her fleece and slipping out the front way oh there was something whoop whoop comes a time gomer said when you gotter decide whether seven grands worth gettin your face stove in for naw they ent been back them welshies course they ent gomers kitchen was still like a monument to minnie who had died on him very clean and bright with shiny pots and cake tins lurid curtains with big red tulips on them and a tea cosy in the shape of a marmalade cat nothing added nothing taken away maybe a shrine or maybe gomer just wasnt interested in kitchens i did try to phone you a few times jane took off her fleece i rang danny last night but i got greta so i had to pretend it was a wrong number anything i can do while im here gomer gave her a sharp look i ent an ole pensioner yet girl i know that its just that when youre a weekend maid its the way you think she sat down at the kitchen table its a lot of money gomer oh hell aye even for sebbie three farms now lost a fair bit five year or so back wife divorced him had to do a bit o jugglin to hold on to all his ground whats he like sebbie standard ole border gentry certain kind seems to thrive yereabouts talk posh but rough as a sows hide underneath cant say i likes the feller but cant say i dislikes him as much as some of em ent figured it out mind why he brung in shooters from off because he didnt want local people gossiping but if hes got a beast at his flocks why ent he out there isself been around guns all his life why ent sebbie out there isself takin a pop tea janey no thanks i cant stay long well im gonner have one gomer went to put the kettle on jane looked at the crack of night between the drawn curtains for three nights shed lain in bed dwelling with no pleasurable frissons upon the beast the participants in the event in the kitchens at stanner and sometimes feeling lucy devenish watching her from the corner by the bookcase this solemn hawknosed figure in a poncho rebuking her for her lies deceit and despicable selfishness gomer she hesitated gomer plugged in the kettle and turned and looked at her the hound of hergest she said gomer came and sat down his smile was sceptical i wont say i ent never yeard of folk supposed tove seen him janey but the ole hound of hergest do he kill ewes this is the question i dont know yeres the situation dogs kills sheep sheepdogs kills sheep one o your big myths is that stock with their throats ripped out thats all down to mr fox truth is whole load of lambs gets savaged every year by sheepdogs thin line between snappin at sheep to round em up and picking one off point im makin janey if you got a mystery beast preyin on ewes chances are its a big sheepdog mabbe two thats got the taste for blood so whys this sebbie dacre so scared of going out there himself with a gun i say scared gomer squinted at her also at night shed thought of nathan what if hed died what if hed died there in dannys van leaving ben facing a manslaughter charge at the very least and gomer and danny and her as accessories what if hed died after theyd got him to the hospital what if he was dead now i wouldnt know why sebbies scared gomer said man like sebbie he dont confide to the likes of we dont confide to nobody that family he also dont scare that easy they were related to the chancerys of stanner werent they who you year that from janey woman whos booking a conference at stanner mrs pollen from pembridge gomer nodded me and nev put her a septic tank in once husband used to be county harchivist for powys so dacre is related to the chancerys small world girl terrible inbred sebbies ma was margery davies second daughter of robert and hattie davies hattie chancery as was after stanner was sold margie herited most of the ground on the welsh side and some money and her married richard dacre who was the son of a farmer on the english side so overnight like they become the biggest landowners yereabouts and they had just the one son and that was sebbie and a younger daughter so when richard died sebbie got the main farms and all the ground and a fair bit of cash and then he bought up emrys morgans farm across the valley when emrys died and so thats why they calls him sebbie three farms see so dacre is hattie chancerys grandson and greatgrandson of walter chance who built stanner hall correct hattie her had two daughters but paula the oldest got sent away and paula was left the stanner home farm the nant which was leased longterm to eddie berrows jeremys dad who was hatties farm managers son so jeremys farm was originally part of the stanner estate too not much wasnt now paula after what happened with hattie and robert her was brung up by roberts sister up in cheshire growed up and married a feller up there and just took the income from the lease but her died youngish see and richard dacre he kept trying to buy the nant off paulas husband but paula her had a soft spot for the berrows from when her was little and her husband knew the berrowses didnt want the dacres as their landlords cause the dacresd likely have em out on their arses first possible opportunity so he signs another lease with eddie berrows under richards nose so to speak and the dacres was blind bloody furious so that split the family good and proper plus it explains why sebbie dacre got no love for jeremy its not short of feuds is it this area you need an uptodate feudmap just to find your way around jane was imagining a largescale plan of the welsh border hills with arteries of hatred linking farms and estates pockets of old resentment dotted lines marking tunnels of lingering suspicion course quite a lot of folk dont think too highly of sebbie gomer said do he care do he f no he dont janey he dont care so what happened i mean i really think i ought to know this working at stanner what exactly happened with hattie chancery or is that something people dont talk about they dont talk about it gomer said on account there ent that many folk left round yere remembers it what about you i was just a boy then just a kiddie at the little school so youre saying you dont remember it either gomer dug into a pocket of his baggy jeans and slapped his ciggy tin on the kitchen table course i remembers it all everybody bloody jabbered about for weeks jane beamed at him maybe i will have a cup of tea after all if thats all right and she sat quietly and watched gomer making it could tell by the way he was nodding to himself lips moving that he was replaying his memories like a videotape and maybe editing them too while the tea was brewing gomer brought down minnies bonechina cups and saucers and it was touching to watch him laying them out with hands that looked like heavyduty gardening gloves jane waited if she was going to be of any use to antony largo she needed more background information this wasnt simply curiosity it was needtoknow last night from the apartment shed rung natalie to ask how things were going like with ben nat hadnt been all that forthcoming hes all right jane had pressed on anyway but is he that guy thought ben was going to kill him he was terrified he its like its a side of ben ive never seen hes a man nat had said offhand men cant be seen to back down i really dont think he meant to do that much damage nat was he it happened very quickly jane i didnt really see anything well obviously thats what youd tell the police police i mean if the police were involved if that guys injuries jane nats voice had gone low that really isnt going to happen so i think its best we all forget about this incident it was a oneoff and if it gets round you know what this areas like we dont want ben to get a reputation best if we dont talk about it any more all right nat had sounded nervy not herself at all and jane was still hearing thick barbaric yobs no subtlety where i come from we have real hard bastards time to investigate bens history this morning jane had got up early gone down to the scullery switched on the computer and fed ben foley into google hard to remember what life had been like without the net now everybody was a private eye the results had been disappointing all shed found were references to the various tv series ben had been involved with no personal stuff at all it had been mildly amusing to discover a web site for the missing casebook his series about what had really happened to sherlock holmes postreichenbach it had become a very small cult the web site set up by a hard core of fans furious that it hadnt run to a second series but the site didnt seem to have been updated for a while jane also looked up antony largo most of the references were to his documentary women of the midnight the words most often applied to antony were committed and tenacious to understand what drove women to kill without mercy without pity inverting their need to nurture he was said to have spent weeks in holloway prison and had corresponded with myra hindley the moors murderess after women of the midnight antony never seemed to have been out of work but he didnt seem to have done anything since that had been quite as massively acclaimed it was becoming clear that ben had known exactly what he was doing connecting with old triumphs when hed introduced antony to hattie chancery hattie chancery gomer said lighting up her was as big as a cow her could skin a rabbit with her teeth her could ride all day and drink strong men under the table really probly not but its what we was told as kids eat up your sprouts boy else hattie chanceryll come for you in the night and put you under her arm and take you away you woke up in the night bit of a creak itd be hattie chancery on the stairs this was while she was still alive sure tbe gomer nodded master of the middle marches see for years the hunt janey used to year em galloping up woolmers pitch of a saturday hounds yowlin away but the loudest of alld be hattie chancery like a whoop whoop in the air urgin on the fellers hattie chancery whoop whoop gomer leaned back in his chair into the smoke from his ciggy and the clouds of his childhood was that unusual jane asked him having a female hunt master in those days was round yere but hattie her was a dynamite horsewoman and had this authority about her big woman see weighed a fair bit in later years drank beer pints big thirst on her jane knew girls at school who drank pints but that was more about sexual politics than big thirst you still gets huntswomen like that now mind gomer said loud i remember folks used to jump in the ditch if they yeard hatties car comin round the bend from the pub at gladestry that was a fact into the bloody ditch no messin and theyd year her laughing like a maniac as her come beltin past well tankedup all the windows down no big drinkdriving thing in them days see least not for the likes of hattie chancery jane was surprised that gomer could remember so far back but she supposed you did when you got older it was just the more recent events that became a haze what about the husband robert kept well out of it janey never hunted couldnt ride for one thing they reckoned he had an injury from the great war but i also yeard it said he had a bit of a distaste for all that for blood bad time they reckoned in france and he come back a changed man quiet thoughtful never talked about what hed seen son of a doctor in kington robert was goodlookin feller caught hatties eye and that was that her was young eighteen or so when her married robert hatties ole man had died by then and so robert come to stanner hattie wouldnt never leave stanner brought robert back like a bride thats what they used to say like a bride jane sipped her tea forming this picture of robert as some kind of poetic wilfred owen type sickened by the horrors of the trenches maybe even a lol type serious mismatch gomer said went wrong early got worse you ever see him mostly he stayed round the house and the grounds but i seen him once or twice every now and seldom hed go for a walk on his own along hergest ridge with a knapsack and i was with my ole man this day id be about seven and we seen mr robert and he give me an apple and i remember my ole man watching him walk off head down into the wind and the ole man sayin poor bugger always remember that poor bugger so how long was that before oh mabbe a year or two course there was a lot o gossip fore that about hattie and her men she had other men oh hell aye any number you believed the stories any number goodlookin woman see goldenhaired and statuesque like there was tales gomer looked into his cup cleared his throat like youllve yeard how a new huntsman gets blooded from his first kill they reckoned the middle marches had its own test for a new boy see if he was up to it like what up to hattie her was said to be i suppose today youd have a name for it generous nympho gomer said appetites like a feller my mam used to say not to me like but i overyeard her and mrs probert from the cwm once well naturally after her done what her done they all had their theories more like a feller used to get in fights in the pub smash an ole pint glass shove it at you she glassed people all kinds of stories went round after her killed robert stories i wouldnt rush to repeat gomer sniffed stirring his tea ciggy in his lips not to a young woman oh gomer janey it was gossip we was kids young boys sides it was five or six years after her was dead i yeard this durin the war young lads talkin the way young lads talks at that age jane had an image of gomer in adolescence thin as a straw hair like a yardbrush gomer im like seventeen now you know gomer stirred the dregs of the tea in the pot and filled his cup with it tea like sump oil it was stanner rocks he said used to take em up stanner men funny place see scientists now they reckons its down to what they calls a standing wave meteological stuff gives it a rare climate up there like in italy and them places nowhere like it specially not on the edge of wales mediterranean jane nodded ben had gone on about it bemoaning the fact that the rocks with their odd climatic conditions and their rare plants didnt belong to the hotel a national nature reserve now so you had to have special permission to go up there which meant ben couldnt even build it up as a tourist attraction they dint know the scientific stuff then gomer said but everybody said it was a funny place what with the devils garden where nothing grew just thin soil more like but they always called it the devils garden soils that thin on them ole rocks that in a good summer youll have a drought up there as kills off half the trees and the bushes see what and she used to take men up there gomer sucked the ciggy to the end carefully extracted the remains boys talk no matter what the weather was like see youd always find a warm spot on top o stanner like for sex bloody hell janey cant get to it fast enough can you sorry gomer drank his tea herd make em go right to the edge right to the edge of the rocks the cliff edge hundredfoot drop or more onto stones and herd have em right on the edge more ways than one whoop whoop oh boys talk janey stories thats all so like did you know anybody who gomer stared into his teacup it was empty gomer pal o mine his older brother he was one and what happened men wasnt experienced back then janey not quite the same way they are now her gets him overwrought gomers face went dark red and then when he cant think proper hers got him hanging half over the edge thought he was gonner go over the top and he he dint care see dint care if he went over or not bloody hell gomer boys talk gomer said they used to say her liked em to be real scared this was the thing for hattie take the boys to the edge show em who was boss domination like she got off on it mabbe so it wasnt just boys talk at all was it jane said softly gomer coughed mabbe not all of it he started rolling another ciggy then stopped and shut the tin and looked past jane into a corner of the kitchen as if he thought minnie might be there watching him with disapproval afterwards herd make em bring a rock back for her a stone mabbe the size of half a brick what for kept the stones on the mantelpiece in a line i dont get it trophies gomer said every time her had a different feller up the top hed have to fetch a new rock back all laid out on the mantelpiece in the big drawing room all in a line where poor robert could see em watch the line of stones gettin longer he wasnt a well man by then chest spent a lot o time in the lounge in front of the fire under this line of stones gettin longer what a total bitch we had all the gossip from the servants see local people her used to scream at him that he was weak a malingerer he was ill was what it was but hattie dint wanner know bout that not her idea of what a countryman should be a countryman was healthy when her was out huntin hed go to bed try to build up his strength mabbe fall asleep and then herd come back and find him rip all the bedclothes off him leave him shiverin always made her angry the drink some folks gets merry some whats wrong janey she pulled the bedclothes off him jane moistened her lips in her head a memory of being in the doorway of her first bedroom at stanner looking in at all the duvet pulled off its cover gathered in a heap like a flaccid parachute if he was still up gomer said thered likely be a fight a real fight bruises split lips his lips that was talked about oh hell aye cant cover up a split lip can you cant pass it off as how you fell over the grate how could he stand it her house her money wheres he gonner go pitiful janey yes and that was how it come to the end night of the day of the hunt hattie real fired up as usual herd ride like the devil and if they ever come back without a kill not a happy woman you make her sound like ar doesnt matter go on this night round about now on the calendar night of the middle marches hunt ball see robert he wouldnt go to the hunt ball couldnt get on with these country sports types hattie goes alone comes back alone around two or three in the mornin but whether her was alone between leavin the ball and gettin back to stanner thats anybodys guess slag ar so hes still up when her gets in mabbe asleep in the chair then all this noise shoutin and screamin servants yeard it but they was used to it see it was only when it carried on out in the garden and then it all goes quiet that a couple of em comes out the servants found robert out in the garden down near this ole seat where he used to sit and stare out at the hills they reckoned hed tried to crawl up onto the seat but hed just fallen back down on the grass and hattie her was just standin there a few yards away like a marble statue arms down by her sides a rock in each hand from the mantelpiece jesus jane wondered how much of this ben had told amber how much ben himself knew if he knew anything when he was planning his cute little murdermystery weekend then hattie her drops the rocks and walks calmly past em up the path and into the house servants carries robert in lays him out on the long sofa one of em rings for the doctor though they knows its too late hatties movin around upstairs but nobodys brave enough to go up there and then one of em notices the desk drawers hangin open this is where robert kept his service revolver locked away oh hell gomer no sooner they seen the drawers open than its too late echoes through the whole house like oh oh g thunder took a while fore one of em was up to goin up them stairs ole leonard the butler it was had a bit of a job getting the bedroom door open on account of hattie was on the floor behind it big woman see like i say jane heard her own voice saying was she dead like from a distance like it was someone else speaking because she didnt think she could move her lips herd put the end of the ole revolver in her mouth janey she wanted to scream aloud she wanted to leap up and go screaming down the lane anything to take her out of her own head where an explosion had happened in the early hours not the nicest way to go gomer said but i spose its what youd expect kind of woman her was no nonsense you chews on the barrel ent nothing gonner go wrong hexpedient how much them kids saw nobody knows mabbe its what messed paula up in the head she doesn janes lips were rubbery doesnt seem like a woman who would kill herself whats the alternative janey even if her didnt get hanged herdve gone to jail for life go to jail leave stanner lose it all for a few moments of black madness naw her took the mans way out thats what they used to say and took stanner hall with her you inherited stanner would you wanner live there after that not like it was ancestral two generations never was a house again commercial premises from then on grounds all overgrown us kids tellin stories of hatties big ghost gliding through the tangled ole gardens with a rock in each hand gomer gathered the teacups and the pot on a tray and took them to the sink goin whoop whoop he said over his shoulder whoop whoop showdown time danny had awoken in the dark with this sense of something closing around him like a fist like during the foot and mouth filthy smoke from distant pyres of flesh and hide mostly unnecessary an uninvestigated crime perpetrated by the wankers of westminster and all you could do was turn away and weep in the end hed got up leaving greta rumbling warmly happy as an old rayburn halfpast three in the morning and hed gone downstairs and shoved a block into the stove putting on his cans and letting in the soaring fury of the queens of the stone age there were times when only heavy music could blank out the foundry of your thoughts even though hed resisted rolling a joint he awoke before seven with a mouth like the deck of a new age travellers bus and greta bending over him lifting off the cans closing his hands around a mug of tea you ent got to danny danny sat up spilling the tea like you said it ent really your business greta said but but nothing but you think i should tell him dont you you can tell me if you want to greta sat down next to him in her old pink towelling robe danny remembered a seventeenyearold rock chick in a kimono and how he used to picture her with him in a beach house overlooking the pacific ocean knowing totally bloody knowing that one day that was where theyd be him and gret and here they still were after thirty years and it was too cold for kimonos and always would be now tell you what the rest of it greta said theres more to it ent there mabbe years since herd spoken to him like this this quiet dunno what you mean look at me greta said he did always looked good with her hair down but it was only ever down in the mornings danny felt a sense of loss and sadness hes different is what it is gret you know that different from the rest of em different even from me but at least i can see it different how greta said holding his gaze with her big brown eyes you my browneyed girl the young van morrison how long ago god look he said im sorry what i said about you gossipin i was distraught you dont tell me things nmore danny think im gonner spread everything round kington market its like gomers your wife now dont be daft and yet he knew this was partly right there was things that gomer understood though you wouldnt think it to look at him with his ciggy jammed in and his glasses alight youd think gomer was a bit touched but mabbe that was it you needed to be a bit touched to understand some things greta and him folks used to say they was both touched back in the wild ole days you were right about one thing greta said mary morson was never the one for jeremy no sensitiveness there at all no jeremys mother used to say he had the sight even his mother did you never told me that before dint wanner set you off visions and stuff that was acid i wouldnt do that now wouldnt you danny smiled greta continued to sit there bugger danny thought its too early for this never loses a lamb do he greta said never loses a lamb to the fox its like hes come to an agreement with the foxes his mother used to say that too when he was real little hed creep out at night and theyd find him sitting with the sheep catch his death his mother used to say funny phrase that danny thought catch his death funny how a familiar saying could sound new and full of meaning if it caught you in the right mood aye if death was coming jeremy would see it mabbe have a chance to catch it in both hands his eyes wide open hes part of that farm danny told greta the land the stock jeremy a whole organism see and hes the part as thinks and he keeps it all balanced and in that way i always feel the boys good for this whole area balance dont ask me to explain it its the way he works goes quietly on if theyd leave him alone people he just ent good with people they dont get to know him easy and he dont know them hard to go quietly nowadays mary morson made all the running greta said herd have to he was a catch a good sound farm mary morsons a coldhearted little bloody golddigger and this natalie greta said wheres the difference there got it made now single parent in need of a home wheres the difference danny drained his mug there is a difference all i can tell you is the first time they met it was in the air like someing hed been waiting for all his life i cant explain it it didnt seem right but then it did later i dont know why shes beautiful danny how else would he be danny bowed his head this is gonner kill him gret itll kill him if he gets it from somebody else mary danny sighed aye maryll spread it only thinks of herself shit he stared at the light on the stereo a little red planet see the rest of it i cant figure it out but someings gone unstable sebbie dacre feels it im sure of that sebbie feels threatened big farmer big magistrate master of the fucking hunt and he feels threatened by jeremy hows that possible lived side by side with sebbie all his life no trouble no pallypally either but thats a class thing yet heres sebbie sending his welshie shooters to terrorize the boy why greta put a hand on dannys thigh you got a job today with gomer nope then you better go talk to him ent you you go this morning get it over aye danny put his mug on the floor and then he put his arms around her his eyes full of tears that he couldnt have fully explained around midmorning it finally started to snow real snow the kind you knew wouldnt stop flakes the size of twopound coins and it was already an inch deep on the vicarage drive when merrily opened the front door to gomer parry vicar the end of gomers ciggy was the only warmth out there he had his old cap on and his muffler when you looked up the snow was almost black against the sky you mustve heard the kettle ah gomer said thats what it was he sat down at the kitchen table with his cap his muffler and his ciggy tin in a little mound by his elbow and she made him tea and put out chocolate digestives for him to dunk when the phone rang she let the machine take it you talked to jane last night she switched on the lamp on the dresser difficult gomer said goes without saying dont wanner break no confidence youre not the first to say that in relation to jane merrily came and sat down opposite him vicars arent good for much these days but were good at keeping confidences take it all with us to the grave i know that vicar sides this probly ent confidential he glanced around hers at school merrily nodded last day of term tomorrow if it carries on snowing like this she may not even make it tomorrow so this this could be our last chance to talk about her behind her back yes see this gomer broke a chocolate digestive in half hers likely told you about it already but if her ent he stared up at the snowy window merrily said it isnt about spiritualism is it eh contacting the dead gomer blinked no its about this ben foley beating seven bells out of this feller the other night what gomer nodded slowly her never tole you bout that then danny turned the land rover around and parked him up against some holly trees on the edge of the farmyard at the nant by the time hed unbuckled and climbed down the windscreen was already thick with snow it had to come and he was glad it was like some of the tension had been released from the drumskin sky just from the sky though not from danny thomas jeremy was already at the gate like hed been watching out for something he had on one of those teacosy woollen hats badly drawn boy job just passin danny said reckoned you might need a bit o help gettin the ewes down from the hill he looked up at the teeming sky way all this come on sudden like had em down last night the snow was all over jeremy confusing the pattern on his blue and black workshirt well he would know this was on its way wouldnt he his friends the clouds and all that jeremy we danny stood and faced him over the gate pulling his denim jacket together over the baggy old soft machine sweatshirt he was wearing over his king crimson tshirt the layered look i reckon we gotter talk boy jeremy said we dont ave to he started waggling his hands embarrassed what i mean the way hes comin down you could easy get blocked in back at your place danny rested his arms in the soft snow on top of the wooden gate do i give a shit boy this particlar moment mabbe not he pointed at the farmhouse door inside eh what was strange was that nothing had changed from when jeremys mam was in charge the same dresser with some of the pots the old girl hadnt been able to take with her to the sheltered bungalow in kington the same flowery wallpaper between the beams the same dark green picture of jesus christ in the garden of gethsemane blocks of wood were turning into glowing orange husks on the open fire in the castiron range the kettle hissed on the hob flag the sheepdog lay on the same old brown and green rag rug that had been here likely thirtyfive years damn near as old as jeremy that rug all of which was odd when you knew thered been a new woman here for nigh on six months now a smart woman whod be expected to make big changes danny sank into the old rocking chair and told jeremy about the welshie nathan what ben foley had done to him and what hed told them on his way to hospital just in case miz natalie craven hadnt given him the full story no problem at the hospital in the end danny said gomer knowed the nurse from when his missus died sides even if theyd wanted to keep the boy in theydve had nowhere to put the poor bugger seen bigger bloody sheep sheds than that new hospital jeremy stood his wellies on the stone hearth at the foot of the range jesus christ looked miserably down from over the fireplace waiting to get betrayed by a bloke he reckoned was his mate danny looked up at jesus who seemed to be saying make this easy cant you see these fellers from off you never knows what baggage they brung with em danny said that feller foley big chip on his shoulder greta reckons had his nose pushed out down the bbc in london lot of anger built up inside him coulder killed that boy see goes at him like a bloody maniac and he was a boy no moren twentyfour or five thought he was hard thought foley was soft bad mistake danny leaned back and rocked the chair which creaked reason he was going into this episode apart from buying time to think was to find out exactly how much natalie craven was telling jeremy about daytoday and nighttonight life up at stanner and if this foley had some unknown degree of violence in his london past who knew what other secrets might be there specifically what were foleys relations with natalie if something was on the go it wouldnt be easy for foley and nat to get it together in the hotel not with mrs foley around and young jane at weekends but a nice camper van within easy jogging distance and foley did jog apparently well the question needed asking that was for sure not that danny would make the suggestion to jeremy bloody hell no not directly anyway so what do er natlie think about him nat jeremy scratched his head through his hat well her thinks thinks mabbe he was provoked not the first time the shooters been on his land had guests in at the time see hes worried they ent gonner make a go of it thats the top and bottom of it desperate situation least you wont see those boys again hard to say ennit jeremy had sat himself on a wooden stool away from the fire like he was determined not to get comfortable lulled into saying too much there was a sprig of holly on the mantelpiece but no mistletoe anywhere old border lore reckoned it was unlucky to bring in mistletoe before new year so we had a chat with this nathan before we took him to the hospital danny said not a chance to be missed and he was quite forthcoming that boy bout how sebbie dacre was gonner bung em seven grand when they proved they shot the beast jeremy didnt react to this so mabbe that was why they was gonner shoot flag yere paint him black all over with luminous bits and i know what youre sayin the hound of hergest jeremy sebbie hired the welshies to shoot someing bearing a close resemblance to the famous hound of hergest jeremy looked down at his light blue socks it make any sense to you boy danny said jeremy didnt look up cant shoot what ent there can you danny pondered this noting how clean the room was everything polished that needed polishing outside the window the snow fell real quiet and in some quantity the only sound was the dogs breathing by ent there danny said carefully do you mean ent there as in like imaginary or ent there as in ent there if you sees what i mean they were getting close to matters that jeremy didnt talk about not so much because he was suspicious or embarrassed but because they were hard to put into words he pulled off his badly drawn boy hat and pushed his fingers through his hair sebbie dacre he wont have it talked about well thats pretty obvious jeremy else hedve been down the gun club and wouldnt need to offer them welsh boys a penny jeremy said foley he was supposed to be goin round askin people if theyd ever seen it and dacre said if any of his employees or anybody workin for the hunt or their relations which i reckon covers most folks in this area if they said anythin to foley theyd have the sack tole you that ken the postman we was at school together so who are they these folks reckons they seen it just folks over the years like jeremy looked at danny then looked away into the red fire me i see danny felt his beard bristle when was this jeremy it ent what you think jeremys face creased up mabbe more with sorrow at dannys unease ent like in the films all redeyed ent nmoren a shadow most times might be there just before dark see bounding down off the ridge corner of your eye might be close up but real faint a cold patch against your leg but you knows the fire was pumping out heat but there was places it couldnt reach it is a dog kind of thing sebbie reckoned hed had ewes savaged what ent there cant savage ewes jeremy said the beast they was huntin round llangadog year or so back all over the papers police marksmen helicopters the lot it killed a dog a whippet tore his throat out folks swore they seen a big cat but when the police done dna tests on the dog it killed they figured it was another dog did it yet you still had folks swore blind theyd seen this big beast puma whatever nobody ever found a puma though dead or alive or a big dog whats your point things happens things as ent meant to be explained why try danny found jeremy meeting his stare now anybody else hed suspect a windup but all he could see in jeremys eyes was sadness and acceptance all right he held on to the chair so it wouldnt rock wouldnt creak what about sebbie three farms he believes jeremy said he just dont want nobody thinkin he believes so he makes a big noise bigger the noise scareder he is i reckon whys he scared cause most folk seen it it dont matter not to them you mean sebbie danny held on to the chair arms trying to anchor himself down you hung out with jeremy you lost hold of reality felt yourself slipping into jeremys fuzzy world it was like dropping acid again and same as hed told greta this morning danny didnt see himself going there no more personal jeremy said danny sagged back in the chair this was getting well out of his ballpark wouldnt be a bad idea mabbe to get gomer to go and have a quiet chat with his lady vicar over in ledwardine whose specialist subject appeared to be fellers like jeremy berrows we keep our secrets to a minimum now shed said to lol grownups mates so this was the kids idea of a minimum gomer like lol had clearly done a lot of agonizing before shopping jane see when you first told me her was working at stanner i dint make much of it cause things change places change it seemed that on the way back from taking a smashedup man to hereford hospital jane had suggested to gomer that it would be best not to talk about the incident not even to mum because ben was in a difficult enough position and if this got out merrily stood by the window watching the apple trees becoming stooped and shaggy with snow the probable truth was that the kid had concealed the incident not out of loyalty to her employer but because of what else she might have to disclose like for instance an alleged predatory beast carrying a bounty which made no sense not yet anyway the clock above the old aga said twothirty couple of hours before jane was due home and in this weather it would probably be longer merrily could hear traffic grinding up the hill to the village square the futile sound of tyres spinning if herefordshire councils foulweather rapidresponse was as rapid as usual they wouldnt see a snow plough or a gritter until around lunchtime tomorrow in the interim showdown time so thered been a domestic murder in the garden at stanner hall in the year before world war two well that was a long time ago but seeing what ben foley a man with no known history of violence had done to the intruder nathan in that same garden had brought the superstitious side of gomer parry squirming uncomfortably into the light superstition was never far below the surface along this border the most rural county in england lying back to back with the most rural county in wales just if i had a daughter vicar and her was working at stanner these is things id wanner know gomer had still seemed embarrassed hed refused a second cup of tea and gone shuffling back into the snow pulling on his old tweed cap and leaving her to examine all the features of countryhotel life that jane had been concealing that bloody kid did nothing ever change merrily leaned against the aga rail pondering the options if she couldnt reveal either gomer or lol as informants there was at least one person she could shop with impunity she would admit to jane that shed raided the apartment she would produce the copy of folklore of herefordshire with the relevant pages marked it wasnt much but it was a way in and in the course of the subsequent bitter quarrel the whole truth would with any luck come pooling out all over the unforgiving flagstones what was good about this weather was that the way things were looking jane would not be returning to stanner this weekend big fires cds of nick drake beth orton lol robinson even motherdaughter quality time all the same merrily watched the ceaseless snow with trepidation they made jokes about the council and the grit lorries but they were jokes best made over a mug of hot chocolate in front of a blazing fire this was a part of the county that had often been cut off lost its electricity and its phone lines reverting for whole days to a semimedieval way of life when the phone rang she grabbed the cordless from the wall mum they let you out erm they sent for the school buses early because of the snow otherwise about five hundred of us would have been spending all night fighting over the sofa bed in the medical suite understandable so youll be home early then and we dont have to come back tomorrow if its bad and then its the holidays right well thats very thoughtful of the education department ill go and light the fire yes jane said do that its just something wrong not exactly wrong its like the snows coming down so hard they reckon all the minor roads in the north of the county could be difficult by tonight so that would mean i probably wouldnt be able to get to stanner at all tomorrow maybe not even with gomer cant be helped flower no act of god never mind i expect the conference will have to be called off as well so like i thought the best thing to do would be to get on clancys bus what so like thats what i did kind of a spur of the moment thing merrily said tightly where are you im at stanner jane said and it really was for the best the snows much worse here necessary penance looking out from her room over like siberia jane phoned eirion on his mobile and was invited to leave voicemail we need to talk jane said menacingly she sat down on the bed cold even turned up full the radiator was like a cheap hotwater bottle the morning after stanner needed more money spending on it than ben and amber were ever likely to make this was clear it was also clear when shed walked in with clancy an hour or so ago shaking the snow off her parka that ben and amber had had words amber was tense ben fizzing with anger ben always turned anxiety into anger according to which equation desperation became rage nathan the shooter had found that out amber had frowned jane this is crazy you should not have come you need me jane had said but it had been ben whod needed her first waiting until amber had gone down to the kitchen before producing a folded sheet of a that had obviously been dried out you undoubtedly know more about the internet than me how do i find out where this stuff originates jane spread the paper out on the bed yuk havent the faintest idea shed told ben but my boyfriend might be able to find out ben had found it drawingpinned to the hotel sign at the bottom of the drive it didnt have to be at all relevant to ben or stanner the area had its share of weirdos but the stanner board wasnt exactly a convenient place to pin anything and if it was a joke it could have been funnier i was just a kid about when the case was on i remember seeing the picture of her in the mirror in her school uniform and it knocked me out i had it up in my bedroom but my mother made me take it down so i stuck it up inside my locker dore at school i have offen wondered what happened to her and what i would do if i met her does anybody know where she is now i have never been able to forget her chris might be rubbish but with a conference on this weekend if someones trying to tell us something id quite like to know what ben had said when jane had identified it as a printout from some kind of sad obsessive internet chat room or message board i gather brigid is very popular in germany i also read in a dutch magazine that she was living in the south of france she is grown up now and is said to be absolutely gorgeous drop dead gorgeous ha ha when she came out she spent some time in italy where she is supposed to have done two men but the police did not know who she was until she had left the country and there was no evidence so it looks like shes still doing it they cant stop its a physical need howard i think that is all rubbish about brigid going abroad put around to stop us looking for her i have it on good authority that shes here but may have had plastic surgery i think i would know her whatever shed had done to her i have been dreaming about her for about years she still makes me swet gavin at the bottom it said full explicit details sign in and see what brigid really did sick or what if anybody could track it down eirion could if he hadnt left for the piste jane went to the window you could see the forestry across the valley and hergest ridge mauve against the sky yes you could even see a sky of sorts did this offer some hope that the snow was actually thinning mum on the phone had said things like i see calmly conveying an acute sense of betrayal this morning over the breakfast jane had kept glancing at her thinking i ought to tell you everything i ought to do it now after what gomer had revealed it hadnt been her easiest nights sleep but if shed laid the hattie thing on her mum would have seen to it that she didnt get here tonight she might even on hearing about the explosion in the head have kept her off school which wouldnt have helped because what could mum have done about this anyway exorcists worked by invitation only clancy had gone to watch tv in ben and ambers private sitting room some bland earlyevening soap on the bus jane had said on the subject of the white company doesnt it interest you at all and clancy had been like whats the point of wasting your life imagining you go to some spooky place when you die huh they really didnt have much to say to one another her and clancy did they jane sat on the bed and scowled and then dialled the mobile number that antony had given her antony its jane im sorry to bother you i dont know what its like with you but its fairly bad here well not that bad i mean i managed to get in tonight on the bus and ben reckons enough of the key people from the white company are around for it to go ahead alistair hardys staying with beth pollen and shes going to meet some more of them at hereford station in a fourwheel drive tomorrow so like are you going to make it all right and if not what do you want me to do if you could like let me know ive got some really nice shots of stanner in the snowstorm so like bye she sat on the bed huddled inside her fleece the snow wasnt thinning at all was it most of the time you just lied to yourself because if you then repeated the lie to someone else it wouldnt seem like a lie why had she gone out of her way in the face of the weather and her mothers dismay to come back because she was a working woman and with a conference on amber needed all the help she could get because she was retained by antony largo on the promise of considerably more money as a cameraperson because if it turned out that the white company made some historic contact tonight and shed missed it yeah mainly that why had she not wanted to come why had she actively dreaded being here because on the other side of this unlikely but nonetheless compelling psychic odyssey there was the bloated ghost of hattie chancery her repellent life her sordid and hideous death she gave eirion another five minutes to call back then stood up and snapped on the light no good putting this off any longer she took off her fleece pulled her overnight bag from under the bed found her warmest sweater and put that on dragging the fleece over the top she felt a little better got out the sony and checked the charge then she put out the light and went out onto the top landing down the second flight of stairs and left at the fire doors had to do this had to dispense with it before she could move on before she could stop waking up in the morning waiting for the bloody bang this morning at the breakfast table at her most pathetic shed nearly cried out to mum to take it away to exorcise hattie chancery from her subconscious like mum could really do this with a sign of the cross and a pat on the head bonkers she had to do this walking down the passage with the sony held in front of her like an automatic weapon because it made the difference between being a woman and a child because shed never been in that room with any knowledge of whose room it had been and what shed done ie the knowledge that hattie chancery was the kind of woman basically who in life jane would have hated even more than she did as some sick possible presence and also the knowledge of the stains under the maroon flock wallpaper the blood dribbling down the windows she intended to walk into the room under the witchshat tower bring the sony to her shoulder demanding imprint yourself on that you brutal bitch this was a necessary penance couldnt do it danny had his head in his hands a bowl of tomato soup cooling on the table at his elbow in the end i couldnt tell him he looked up at greta pathetic eh could be its for the best greta said but he could see she didnt believe that not for one second suppose hes mad suppose hes ill suppose that what we reckoned all these years was perceptiveness knowingness suppose that was just signs of his mental dysfunction big words tonight danny i ent thick danny said mightve lost a few brain cells to acid and metal since the ole grammar school but it ent taken it all away have your soup danny swallowed some tomato soup through the kitchen window he could see the snow ghosting the farmyard that was foggygrey with old stone and dusk no stock out there no more nothing in the sheds except for his own tractor and delia gomers new jcb need to have the tractor up and ready tonight with the snowplough bolted on this could go on for days know what i was scared of back there suddenly gret that mabbe if i told him hed kill her like geoff james did when his missus danny this is jeremy cant just say that nmore danny put his spoon down people goes funny same disease isolation ec formfilling stocktagging signing all your beasts over to the bureaucrats no independence no pride no satisfaction no money you reads the bloody papers youd think all country folks worried about is what the governments doin to bloody huntin with hounds like its fundamental to us all in the sticks stead of just a rich mans expensive pleasure introduced by psychotic norman barons shit you got out greta reminded him that soothing tone again youre with gomer now you sidelined you ent part of it nmore jeremy ent never gonner get out though is he its part of him part of hims in the land uproot him hes dead why should he be uprooted hes got a good solid farm hes respected hes got a good woman ole days see there was farming marriages and they lasted now you got partners tempry all right in cities mabbe where its all tempry and you can move on swap around in the country you dont have continuity theres another big word see if you dont have continuity youre fucked jesus christ did i just say someing conservative look greta said he wont be out of his yard at all for days if it keeps on like this so unless somebody rings him and tells him about natalie he ent gonner find out nothin is he danny stared into his soup a pool of blood he was thinking about natalie craven and her mousy little partner and ben foley and his mousy little wife ben foley saviour of stanner incomer with attitude smooth londoner widely said to be driven by irrational obsessions man who showed up on your doorstep asking if you seen the hound of hergest sign of death greta gave him a hard look what is the hound of hergest lets not get silly about this greta said jeremys ma used to say he was always seeing things that wasnt there its the way he is his condition thats what its supposed to be though ennit the hound an omen of death if your names vaughan the vaughansve all gone nothing to worry about then greta said just be honest merrily said tell me what you think i need to do tell me im overreacting tell me its time to let go of the leash cut some slack sever the umbilical make some space chill out tell me lol you know i cant do clichés lol took the mobile out into the passage and went across to the stable door unbolting the top half and pushing against a crust of snow the section of door opened with a sound like splintering plywood somewhere out there was the frome valley as white and cold and barren as an old psychiatric ward he used to know tell me theres nothing to be afraid of merrily said into his ear serious now snow talk unexpectedly severe weather could do this to you you were no longer in control nobody was ill come over lol said no you cant really its just been on the radio go home and stay home stay off the roads unless its an emergency and even then its not bad here lol looked for his car couldnt see it it was nearly dark and the snow was like a wall ive got enough to worry about without the thought of you stuck all night in a snowdrift in an ancient astra with a heater that hasnt worked in years music started up in the studio behind lol a slow growling twelvebar blues from the album that prof levin was mixing for the guitar legend tom storey a relentless chugging momentum life going on its gomer thats all merrily said shed already told him about ben foley and the violence and the woman called hattie chancery gomers worried how often does that happen you could phone her shes got her mobile i could do that yes i could go on to her very carefully stepping on eggshells knowing that at any time she could lose her temper and cut the call and switch off the mobile and thats the link gone for the duration i could do that would you do that there was a gas mantle projecting from the wall just inside the fire doors during the murder weekend ben had propped the doors open so that you could see the mantle from the stairs and you were back in hattie chancerys young days enclosed in a hollow glow no mention of hattie chancery during the murder weekend there were murder games with the scent of mystery and there was real murder with its sadness and its stink the mantle unlit was utilitylooking without romance no doubt it would be working again when the white company were in residence the passage meanwhile was lit by electric wall lights dim vertical tubes under ambertinted glass the walls with their recessed doors were lined with woodchip paper the lights turned them yellow jane stood at the entrance to the passage legs apart and lingered on the shot ought to have brought the tripod really but she guessed that if shed gone downstairs to look for it she wouldnt have come back as it was she kept wanting to turn back but wouldnt permit herself to stop or even to hurry to get it over with oh dont worry about young jane far too downtoearth janell be fine he really didnt care did he as long as he came out a winner called me a nancy boy a winner against the odds whatever it took but was she really so different jane watkins research and second camera using eirion deceiving mum snatching every new experience to further her own ambitions hoovering up the dirt on hattie and the tragic robert while despising the white company as naff and sad capricious and contrary this jane watkins not a nice person still shooting jane walked on with sour determination along the passage where the sharp smell of recent painting failed to obscure the odour of damp and quite possibly rot she stopped in front of the last door on the right the image wobbling through the lens with the recording signal aglow it was both more exciting and less scary because it was less personal a professional thing the door was like all the other doors in the passage except that it didnt have a number on it when she opened it reaching out to the handle giving it a quick push and then stepping back with the camera still running she realized that it was too dark in there to shoot anything she put the camera on pause and lowered it recalling that there were a few steps to a second door that was oak and gothicpointed jane stopped briefly at the bottom of the steps she remembered a pot lampshade hanging from the ceiling there was a switch somewhere on an oldfashioned pewter box but when she handswept the walls on either side she couldnt find it perhaps it was at the top she located the first step with the toe of a trainer went up carefully one two three four was that it no she stumbled five jane remembered how it had seemed so cool at first having one of the tower rooms sleeping under the witchs hat with views across the border a shocking cinematic image flared unconjured in her mind the heavy old service revolver clunking on the floor as hatties head exploded blonde hair snaking with blood and wet brains and a splatting on the walls and what was it like to have killed to have done publicly without hope of concealment the one thing you could never reverse put right make recompense for one way or another your life was over wasnt it no more tallyho no more whoopwhoop she felt for the handle of the bedroom door catching an acrid waxy smell furniture polish the cold clawed through her chunky sweater as though it was cheesecloth and she thought of robert davies lying here in a fever hattie hauling the bedclothes from his sweating body what had hattie felt like as she carried the service revolver up here how had she known it was loaded unless shed loaded it herself so was this an outcome that had always been at the back of her mind because it really wasnt a womans way of suicide was it to blow all your beauty to fragments janes hand found the doorknob castiron and globular grasped it angrily turned it and went into the bedroom standing there panting out some kind of mixedup defiance into the darkness only it wasnt dark at all hattie chancerys room was delicately rinsed in ochre light janes senses swam she saw a mustardshaded oil lamp standing on a dressing table of polished oak in front of the central window with its floorlength purple velvet curtains the light lured a dull lustre from the gilt frames of pictures on the flock wallpaper the polishfumes seared her throat this was wrong everything was wrong many years wrong she reeled back against the door and it closed behind her with a heavy thunk and an efficient click the triple mirrors on the dressing table reflected a high clawfooted bed and a womans figure rising and jane just screamed high and piercing like she never had before at least not since she was very little as she saw in the middle mirror a broad face with thick fair hair piled up and twisted and eyes that were small and round and pale like silverskin onions shifting big furniture the white company was a band of english mercenaries formed by sir john hawkwood in the fourteenth century best known for its campaigns in italy it was also a firm supplying bathroomrelated fluffy goods through mail order and two fancydress historical recreation societies close to the bottom of the first page google finally identified the white company as sir arthur conan doyles classic historical novel and merrily clicked on it motley group of english mercenaries led by sir nigel loring assiduous attention to historical detail nothing however to suggest that the novel in any way reflected the central obsession of doyles last two decades in under an hour shed gathered a mass of background on this sir arthurs tireless tours of britain and america promoting his conviction that spiritualism would alter mankind for ever by making life after death a scientific fact his blind defence of obvious fakery his insistence that hed spoken at a seance with his son kingsley a victim of the great war and his brother innes his belief that his sister annette over thirty years dead had communed with jean arthurs wife through automatic writing eventually arthur had acquired his own highlevel spirit contact pheneas a scribe from the sumerian city of ur dead for over four thousand years a kindly decent deluded man in the snowpadded silence of the scullery the phone went off like a burglar alarm two phone lines had become a necessary extravagance merrily plucked it up wedging it under her chin while tapping on next for page two ledwardine vic vicar alice vicar will you be in if i comes round later on i yeah sure wear wellies though alice because i havent bothered clearing the drive with dexter alice said oh the digital clock on the desk said pm the snow had turned the apple trees outside the window into cartoon wraiths page two came up with its highlighted words white white white sorry ive been so long getting back to you alice said my sisters they said yes theyd like to have the eucharist dexter he ent so sure hes with you now does two nights a week in the chip shop in a steamy chip shop with asthma i ent letting him go back to hereford tonight what if he got stuck in the snow and he couldnt breathe how would they get him to the hospital will you talk to him vicar will you make him see some sense well you know ill i mean i can try and explain but i dont want to bout half an hour then alice said on the screen near the top of page two it said the white company established to further the mission of sir arthur conan doyle to prove that the spirit world is an incontestable fact oh ok merrily said fine replacing the phone with one hand she clicked the mouse with the other watching a bulky figure fading up sagging white moustache pinstripe suit watch chain watchful eyes encircling him like some tragic greek chorus other faces less defined misty faces blinking on and off like faulty street lamps in shades of white and grey and then the white company welcomes you walter was this fat and beaming old git with a moustache that curled his wife bella might have been his daughter turnedup nose big hair gathered on top of her head and the kid this flatfaced kid clutching her hand could have been walters granddaughter in fact this was hattie chancery apparently the earliest obtainable photograph of her it was on the wall next to the door one of four framed photos in here walter and his family in the garden walter formal in wing collar and his wife bella in some kind of flouncy crinoline also two scenes of what presumably was the middle marches hunt hounding some poor bloody fox into a badger set and over the bed so she might see herself reflected in the mirror when she awoke the adult hattie where did they get them janes voice was still unsteady shock it seemed could carry on pulsing through your body for whole minutes afterwards already she was despising herself but that didnt take it away on loan from the museum at kington natalie lay on her back on the clawfooted bed smoking a cigarette a deal ben found a really old washtub and stuff like that in one of the outhouses and donated it all the pictures can go back after this well get them all copied when the snow goes but ben thought the originals might give off the strongest vibrations for hardy i mean ben thinks its all shit really but if it makes the white company feel more inspired nat rolled over and off the bed stood up and stretched just the way she had when jane had first walked in rising up alongside the giltframed portrait hanging over the high mahogany headboard she wore tight jeans and a black shirt open to a silver pendant im shattered jane shifting big furniture takes it out of you jane went to the bottom of the bed and looked up at the woman in the sepia photoportrait the coils of glistening hair the broad face with unsmiling lips like segments of soft white pear and those pale pale eyes gazing over your shoulder as if hattie was disdainfully contemplating the mess left by her own blood on the wall between the windows how old was she here do you think i wouldnt know thirty and alistair hardy actually wants to sleep in here jane could no longer imagine doing that and the thought of waking up on a wintry morning to those silverskin eyes i dont think he knows about it yet its bens idea hes become obsessed with the chancery woman and this room stanners haunted room and hes thinking televisually so we have to recreate the room pretty much as shed remember it which i have to tell you has taken all day the dressing table we pinched from room seven i spent about an hour polishing the foul thing the bed we had to bring that down in sections from one of the attics this was her actual bed god knows it had enough dust on it it bloody scared me nat its just unhealthy your face when you first opened the door jane will live with me for a long time it was just a big shell when i was last here she looked around again rather hardy than me in fact hardy deserved all he got jane was still furious at him for using lucy devenish an affront lucys spirituality was well in advance of all this natalie walked past her and opened the bedroom door well if we find him dead of a heart attack in the morning its an occupational hazard i cant say i like him lets go and have some tea jane looked at her with something between shock and respect dead of a heart attack it was the sort of thing a kid would say oblivious of the rules of adult decency that obliged you to airbrush your thoughts before you exposed them nat was just so cool it certainly took some kind of cool or a complete absence of sensitivity to the numinous to lie there alone on that bed under that very eerie picture of stanners murderer nat huh does amber know about this refurbishing some of it shes been very quiet all week i mean the idea of them summoning spirits in her kitchen the only place she can really bear to spend time in nat glanced outside down the dark steps to the passage sometimes i think she might surprise us all and leave him to it leave ben leave stanner and give ben the big option could you blame her nat it would destroy him he thinks hes doing all this for amber yeah nat smiled with no humour arent men dangerously delusional sometimes and dangerously aggressive jane said nat eyed her a warning look it was a oneoff we dont want ben to get a reputation do we look jane glanced away from her determined to get this out ive been thinking about it a lot well dont it wont help anybody been finding out about hattie chancery jane glanced warily at hatties reflection in the dressingtable mirror i mean you do know what she did in here dont you natalie came back into the room bens still letting amber think she shot herself outside somewhere i mean christ they sleep just up the passage who told you gomer and he told me about hattie and all her men what she did with them on the top of stanner rocks all the aggression she had inside her and the booze if you believe all that i kind of do jane looked at her dont you youre asking me what i believe natalie supported her bum against the dressing table stretched her long legs out stared at hattie i believe you dont let anybody fuck you about thats it really jane her back to the door looked at the bed it had a faded old mauve coverlet on it with a fringe she said not looking at nat when i was here for that one night i came back and found the quilt and the sheets had been pulled off and thrown back against the headboard no really it happened and i didnt even know whose room it had been then nat made no comment ok jane turned to natalie maybe amber or somebody had been about to change the bedding and forgot and went away and left it there could be a whole bunch of rational explanations and i hope one of them was the truth but i also had a really bad dream in here i mean really bad and also nat said quietly um jane i mean if you consider what happened last weekend put that together with hattie goes up stanner rocks shags some guy comes back and smashes her sick husbands head in with a couple of the rocks she kept as like trophies and then you think of ben ok volatile but basically this artistic nonviolent bloke who just loses it completely on maybe the same spot it was a horrendous attack if you and amber hadnt been here lets face it he mightve killed that guy and you know thats true he might be on remand now for murder jane i dont think this is a particularly what got into him you have to ask because if that was the real ben jane then maybe it would be a good thing if amber did leave him maybe hes the wrong kind of person to be here you know jane blinked whats wrong natalie was looking over janes shoulder apologetically jane stiffened her shoulders hunching she shut her eyes for a moment opening them in anguish to a long unsmiling face in the lefthand mirror of the dressing table erm she turned slowly towards ben with her shoulders still up around her ears forcing what she guessed would be a sick and cringing smile holding out the camcorder like an offering like i just came to to get some like atmos shots inaugurated in on the fiftieth anniversary of the passing of sir arthur conan doyle the white company was originally called the windlesham society after sir arthurs last home in sussex the name was changed after the words white company were repeatedly received at spiritist meetings throughout britain both clairaudiently and through automatic writing finally sir arthur himself conveyed to the eminent channelist mr alistair hardy that he would consider it an honour to be patron of a society named after an especial favourite amongst his novels the society now comprises of both committed spiritists and sherlock holmes enthusiasts in the outline of a planned holmes story the adventure of the white shadow was channelled to mr hardy and later drafted in full by mr mason w mower of connecticut merrily wrinkled her nose the idea of a society combining committed spiritualists and sherlock holmes enthusiasts sounded slightly unlikely if you considered that holmes was the creation of conan doyles rational scientific side but then wasnt spiritualism considered to be rational and scientific wasnt that the whole point that they were proving the fact of life after death without the excess baggage meaning religion merrily fingered her small pectoral cross on its chain it was easy to say that the church was just jealous because these guys were offering direct experience there were many people no longer scared of death because their departed loved ones were saying were here for you and even if it was faked was that all bad the main spiritualist wave had come after the first world war all those grieving families who didnt know how their sons and husbands had died had no bodies to bury a means of bringing closure the doorbell rang merrily groaned the thought of an hour with dexter harris was not enticing she stood up pulling on one of janes old fleeces over her cowlneck sweater half her wardrobe these days consisted of the kids castoffs no fire in the sitting room so shed have to keep alice and dexter in the kitchen and it wasnt too warm in there either despite the aga she went through to the hall meeting the eyes of the jaded jesus hanging on to his lantern of hope in holman hunts light of the world uncle teds housewarming present to prove that the spirit world is an incontestable fact slipping the catch tugging the front door out of its frozen frame she thought what a disappointment it must be to conan doyle if he was still watching that the great spiritual revolution had crumbled so quickly into the ruins of crank city the front door shuddered and the white night came in from the open porch in tingling crystals of cold for a moment it was surreal the front garden of the vicarage was like some kind of fairytale bedchamber the lawn a lumpy white mattress bushes squashed into piles of pillows a night light glimmering from the village square through the bare trees very much a part of this tableau he unwound his scarf and a frieze of snow um i wondered if i might sing a carol god she laughed in delight looking down the drive towards the snowbound square how did you wheres your car how would you feel about ding dong m youre insane and there are medical records to prove it lol said white high lol sat barefooted on the rug in the scullery defrosting his toes by two bars of the electric fire the lights were out but the door to the kitchen was ajar a couple of inches his frayed blue jeans were somehow soaked despite his wellies and there were wet patches on the dark green sweatshirt with white stencilled lettering he sat there alone watching the snow widening the window ledge outside and he felt wildly happy the lettering on the sweatshirt said gomer parry plant hire commemorating the days hed spent as an unskilled labourer in the wake of gomers disastrous fire another small breakthrough if it makes you a little anxious do it a chance to shovel tons of earth with your bare hands before playing live on stage for the first time since your teens an impossible polar expedition in a clappedout sixteenyearold vauxhall astra to be with the person you love do it the old astra had slithered over snowblinded hills hugging a council gritlorry down to leominster tunnelling through the suffocated lanes lol had passed two abandoned cars snowbloated and gone chugging on impossibly until the old girl finally gave up rolling away into the cascading night but she only gave up there was a god on the hill that was already evolving into church street ledwardine vainly spinning her wheels before sinking back exhausted into the community hall car park lol had climbed out like he was emerging from a trance state and bent to kiss her cold grille thanks and goodnight before walking up to the vicarage on a white high on the deserted square a christmas tree stood in front of the squatpillared market hall the whole scene loaded with snow the fairy lights reduced to gauzy smudges of colour like ice lollies in a deepfreeze lol had looked back for a sign a for sale sign on lucys old house as if the sudden enchantment of the night might have tossed it back onto the market no sign there no lights maybe there was a forbidding blacklettered sign somewhere that said he didnt belong here but right now he didnt care he sat in the glow of two faintly zinging orange bars and halflistened to merrily in the kitchen dealing with some people who had arrived soon after him best they didnt see him it would have been all over the village by morning the way things had turned out even his car wasnt here snow was good at secrets from the kitchen he heard about arrangements for what seemed to be a memorial service there was an elderly woman with a croaky voice that he recognized at once salt and vinegar with that is it and a guy called dexter who managed to be both gruff and whiny sounded like routine parish stuff at first idly browsing the cwn annwn passages from mrs leather lol wasnt aware of what merrily was saying just the soft and muted colours of her voice luxuriating in the proximity of her recalling an old van morrison song from tupelo honey about a woman in the kitchen with the lights turned down low it was quite a while before raised voices began to suggest that there was unpleasantness here no whats shes saying alice from the chippy said is that we needs a proper funeral for the boy with the full rites merrily said well not thats fucking creepy dexter funeral for a kid thats already been in his grave for near twenty year its not youre telling me that ent creepy its not a funeral merrily said and i honestly dont think youd find it creepy however its only an idea a possibility you got no right should neverve gone round askin questions rakin it all up its in the past its in you alice shrieked dont you see that her voice steadied been like this all night he has vicar i dont know whats the matter with him merrily said dexter first of all we dont have to do this not if you dont want to and we dont even have to do it in a church then wheres the bloody point all im trying to say is that the eucharist communion is a very powerful way of tackling these things in which we believe that jesus himself is personally involved and it can sometimes draw a line under things create order and calm where theres been longterm unrest ill feeling distress conflict yes alice said this is what we want alice asked me if there was any way i could help and im sorry if it isnt what either of you were expecting if you dont think its the right thing you dont have to have anything to do with it but alice said with menace youll be letting your family down if you dont no an ache in dexters voice from the scullery lol could feel him wanting to beat his head on the table alice said ent no reason the rest of us cant go ahead without him is there vicar well we could but that wouldnt what about darrin dexter said he gonner be there it might also help darrin a lot merrily said it would be good if everyone was there from both sides of the family it can bring things out in my experience bring out the truth well it it can bring peace and what if everybody dont want the truth out merrily didnt reply alice shouted we all wants the truth well mabbe darrin dont mabbe the truth ent what darrin wants at all look nobody spoke for a while chairs creaked small movements of unrest then dexter started mumbling lol couldnt make out any of it then alice said rawvoiced whats this you never and dexter mumbled some more and alice said faintly no dear god dexters voice came in again no longer gruff raised up in panic hes like get your fuckin foot down you big useless dexter no merrily said go on please i was bigger than darrin but he was real nasty look stuck his knife in the back of my hand once had an airgun shot a robin in the garden things people thought were nice hed wanner destroy so like when we gets into the fiesta theres a kiddys picture book on the seat and he picks it up and rips it in half throws the bits out of the window roland he starts crying darrins leanin over him and pinchin him telling him were going to london we ent stopping till we gets to london and we ent never comin back never see his mam and dad again oh god in heaven vicar stop him werent no stoppin him alice more the kids screechin more hes gettin off on it excited gettin more excited the further we goes im like dont you wanner go back now how we gonner get back if we goes too far darrins goin keep your fuckin foot down you fat wanker were goin on the motorway were goin to london alice was moaning oh dear god no oh dear god lol sensing a rhythm as if she was rocking backwards and forwards doubled up in anguish so roland hes gettin real hysterical starts pulling at the door handle and darrins goin you get away from that door or ill give you a smacking so like roland waits till darrin turns round again and i can year him fiddling with the handle and then darrin whips round suddenlike and whangs him in the face bang cops is behind us by then look blue lights going and that and rolands sobbin away and thats when i decides im gonner go across the road and up this little turning then the copsll be able to get us and that thats how it was silence except for creaking chairs small sounds of unrest then alice started to weep routine parochial issue lol tugged his wet wellies onto his bare feet merrily said you didnt tell the police about any of this did you how could i but you see why darrin ent gonner want none of it out or your parents you tell your parents anything they know what darrins like alice knows another silence then a jagged wail oh my god that poor little child his own brother like alices voice was bleeding oh my god and then he died he my god i never knew none of this course you never knew dexter snapped darrin ent never gonner tell you was he gets worse gets worse all the time you made me alice i didnt wanner howm i gonner tell my sisters cant can you dexter said flatly no way a chair creaking someone standing up footsteps going nowhere on the kitchen flags then alice said we surely needs it now eh i cant live with this knowing that childs out there he ent out there alice hes f hes gone we needs it now more than ever the holy spirit the holy eucharist no way like a big white bird this is an end to it how do we organize it vicar how soon can we do it well you know thats up to no sound of a big fist smashing into the table lol leapt up i dont wannit dexter roared i dont wannit to happen you understand me why you gotter youre a fuckin ole meddler alice nobody assed you to start all this shit i only told you to fuckin stop you for fucks sake putting his right eye to the crack in the door lol saw a bulky guy with a petulant lower lip and a shaven head standing in the middle of the kitchen he looked marginally nearer to tears than to violence but his fists were bunched and he was breathing through his mouth he unclenched a fist and started feeling in a pocket of his leather coat lol put a hand on the door ready to wrench it open dexter brought his hand up to his mouth there was a vacuum gasp youre stressin me out leave it fuck it all right dexter walked out banging the kitchen door hard enough to make pans rattle on shelves alice merrily said from out of lols view let him walk it off in the cold air now she was hunched in the office chair hands limp between her knees she looked bloodless lols white high had evaporated it was a powerful reminder this episode of how vulnerable the clergy were feeling they had to be there for everybody whether it was wanted or not including the dead even the dead i dont even know how bad he is you see merrily said i dont know enough about asthma what if hes out there on the square and he cant get his breath does alice live far away three minutes walk not a problem then lets hope not she stood up and came and sank down beside him on the rug they sat there in front of the electric fire with their backs to the wall their shoulders not quite touching and she told him about the death of the kid called roland hook and seventeen years of corrosive bitterness inside a family i dont get it lol said in a way i can understand dexters problem with this is it normal to have some kind of belated funeral service in the hope that its going to make everything all right jeavons merrily said the loose canon its not just jeavons theres a movement inside healing and deliverance which argues that some illness particularly chronic illness can be the result of something unresolved in the familys past or the victim being in the grip of some aberrant ancestor your ancestors are haunting you and you dont know it it makes a certain kind of sense but thats the trouble isnt it were finding hauntings where there are no actual phenomena other than an illness or an emotional crisis we the church of england so by calming the spirit of this poor kid who died in a state of terror you can in theory i cant sorry forgot the protocol by organizing this requiem for the dead kid you can in theory open the way for god to cure not only dexters asthma but also to heal the rift in his wider family er yeah bloody hell lol said dismayed you go along with this you could be spending every day of the rest of your life doing complicated eucharistic services for people laying all their problems on their ancestors sure lets all blame the dead merrily shrugged the church of england authorizes this and healing merrily said when evening came many who were demonpossessed were brought to him and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick whats that matthews gospel linking healing and deliverance youre not jesus christ lol said healing could make you ill do i look ill you look tired im fine really she smiled at him im awfully glad youre here their shoulders touched lol took a long breath she laid her head wearily on his shoulder im all mixed up rumours just rumours of healing and im getting the size of congregation i always dreamed of and it makes me sweat a hint of miracle cures and suddenly youre on the way to becoming someone with a big voice and disciples scary yes it was it was the very place he would hate for her to go because of his parents the bornagain pentecostalists who used to attend bible belttype healing services conducted by some crazy pastor who shook people till the sickness dropped out of them but even the pastor as far as lol knew hadnt sought to heal the living through the dead merrily said i mean i really really want it to happen for people for the sick i just dont want it to be me whos seen as the significant channel its too early its somehow too early for the womens ministry certainly too early for me how selfish is that how cowardly is that lol felt the wetness on her cheeks and put an arm around her and held her as chastely as he could bear he tried to think of something he could say that didnt sound soothing or patronizing or argumentative on one level he simply empathized the idea of being a major artist still scared him and the thought that he would soon be too old to scale the lowest available peak was almost comforting but there was a big difference between a career and a calling where you had to keep asking not what you or the audience needed but how god wanted you to play it it was a lousy thankless job jane would sometimes tell lol how much she hoped that her mum would one day see the light and slamming the church door behind her start running merrily said lew jeavons said this was a very interesting case and hes distressingly right more right than he could know and its all valid even on a psychological level i mean some priests believe that if say your greatgrandfather was a satanist or a heretic or even a freemason a century ago it could be affecting your health today well yeah sure but this case even if the requiem is no more than symbolic it still might help i mean look at what its brought out tonight its certainly ruined any chance of alice getting to sleep reach out jeavons said embrace merrily sighed i really wouldnt like to think of you embracing darrin hook lol said five barrels jane followed ben down the redcarpeted stairs aware of dragging her feet ben was silent the whole way he wore a black fleece zipped all the way up and black jeans he was like his own shadow as they came into the lobby jane saw the buildup of snow on the window ledges and thought he can fire me but he cant send me home in this the office behind the reception desk was used mainly by natalie to monitor incomings and outgoings and to deal with wages for occasional cleaners and waitresses it had originally been some kind of cloak and boot room there were still a dozen coat hooks on walls that were cracked white and windowless the desk was ebonycoloured with goldleaf bits and had come from ben and ambers london flat ben sat behind the desk in a leather swivel chair and nodded at the typists chair opposite a strip light made his thin face white and taut jane sat too headmastersstudy situation look ben all i meant he waved her into silence above his head was a framed print of one of the etchings from the strand magazine it was almost entirely black except for a white spurt of flame from a pistol beneath the drawing it said holmes had emptied five barrels of his revolver into the creatures flank ben said this business of strange forces curses hauntings the mystical powers of the border the retentive power of ancient rocks its absolute rubbish isnt it he leaned back his hands clasped on his chest swivelling a little jane im a drama man always will be and thats about using real people and real places to create an illusion jane nodded when youre putting a tv production together ben said you have this great tangle of egos actors writers money men you have time limits locations weather conditions and you have to contain the lot inside a budget that never seems adequate to the task and then when its all over youre competing for just ninety minutes of someones attention which is fine it obliges me to ben unclasped his hands and brought them slowly together in the air condense make it controllable ben smiled but what are you im sorry what are you talking about exactly the documentary or the whole thing the big picture stanner the enterprise this place appealed to me as soon as i saw it because its pure artifice built to look like a gothic manor house on a lavish scale a production and then thanks to conan doyle it became baskerville hall another creation jane thought about this but if the hound of the baskervilles was based on an actual legend a real legend then there is a kind of reality here surely a real legend ben looked pained how real is a legend whats the socalled hound of hergest now but a halfforgotten local folk tale whos even heard about that outside this immediate area whereas the hound of the baskervilles the creation the artifice is worldfamous immortal a hugely powerful image thats the power im harnessing i mean stuff the hound of hergest its part was over as soon as doyles book was written typical janes mouth tightened what ben said come on spit it out well its you know its been seen what has the hound or something something thats killing sheep the shooters thats what they were after ben nodded slowly jane blinked at him you knew that about dacre and his pathetic bounty of course i knew known about it for a while and naturally i love the idea of something out there and i love the idea of people believing in it and i want to hear their stories as long as the bastard stays out there something unknown ben laughed over his head sherlock holmes pumped round after round into the flank of the poor hound its head and muzzle outlined in white lines of phosphorus only dacre who ive never met by the way and have no particular wish to rather shot himself in the foot when he heard i was making inquiries about sightings of the hound he instructed his tenants his employees at the farm and the hunt kennels anybody in fact he felt he had authority over to keep shtum ben smiled tongue prodding at the inside of a cheek fortunately in this day and age the feudal flame burns rather lower than it used to you actually knew the shooters were working for him well not at first id heard rumours of what they were after but i only started putting it together after you and i and antony encountered them in the lane at hergest court ended up meeting a very interesting old guy in kington no friend of dacres and more than willing to talk to me about a number of things as it happens yes of course i knew who they were working for so when you found that guy nathan when i lost it completely you mean jane when i risked facing a murder charge jane squirmed she looked away from bens taunting eyes inevitably up at the etching and then it was like holmess pistol had gone off in her head in a spurt of light something began shockingly to make sense ben looked up as natalies head came round the door ben alistair hardys just arrived with that guy matthew ive shown them up to the chancery room i have to take clancy to a neighbours for the night ok the drives totally blocked at the nant ill be back later nat do be careful we need you enormously this weekend yeah i know ill try not to get stuck natalie said and ben raised a hand for a moment as the door closed on natalie the instability of the border seemed to vibrate through the room making everything glow but with a cheap and garish light jane took a breath and came right out with it the truth is that the very last thing you wanted was for those guys to come out of the pines with a dead puma that wouldve blown it right blown it the mystique jane gripped the sides of her chair a whole centurys worth like you dont believe the story of the spectral hound but you dont want it disproved either you didnt want those guys coming up with anything real that theyd shot certainly not anywhere near stanner like oh weve shot the hound and it gets in all the papers you really didnt want that wouldve been a touch prosaic ben agreed and that was really that was why she heard him shouting at the shooters on the last night of the murder weekend i warned you not on my land this time youre fucking dog meat you thought you knew about people shed had this nice safe image of ben clever charming theatrical faintly camp ben shrugged jane almost cringed from him the snow was piled like mashed potato out by the entrance of dannys place and danny had his tractor out with the snowplough attachment and the spotlights if he got it cleared now and he was up again by five tomorrow likely he could keep on top of it he climbed down and stood by the gate looking out the queens of the stone age were giving it some welly from the stereo back in the cab singing as it happened about the sky falling if this went on thered be some contract work for him and gomer from the county highways sure to be plant hire like gomer kept saying never slept normally hed be excited snow was a challenge folk needed help but tonight he felt weary biggest problem was the lane outside passable now with fourwheel drive but tomorrow was another day danny was knackered now and the snow was oppressive back at the house he saw a tongue of yellow light the back door opening and greta shouted is it clear clear as i can get it without two tons of grit danny left the music on and trudged back up the path only jeremy rang see wanted to know if we could take the child tonight on account his tracks blocked solid danny kept on walking till he reached the back door gimme that again gret the child clancy that woman her mother is gonner bring her down from the hotel drop her off yere wants us to have her i said id make up the spare bed danny stood just short of the step trying to figure it this natalie and the kiddie here they were at a great big hotel full of empty bedrooms and they wanted the spare bed in the boxroom where he kept all his albums but even that wasnt the most unlikely aspect of it nothing strike you as funny gret danny breathed in stinging air through his teeth jeremys track when is jeremys track ever blocked you gonner come in or not fore we loses every bit of heat in the house greta backed away from the cold arms folded danny stepped inside if anybody knowed the big snow was on the way when i was up the nant earlier on hed got a trailerload of grit all ready had his ewes down last night all tucked up and now you tell me dannys brain froze well what you want me to say greta demanded i accuse him of lying say we ent having the girl whats wrong he dont want the kiddie there why dont he want the kiddie there her stared at him not getting it greta howd he sound what dhe sound like in hisself sounded like he always does to me halfbaked whats the when was this whend he ring half an hour ago mabbe you was busy out there i didnt wanner bother you with holy shit greta the jolt to dannys senses kicked him back outside he shut his eyes and he threw his head back feeling the fat snowflakes coming down on his upturned face and his beard and his gritted teeth he snapped back upright call him wiping his eyes hard with the heel of his hand if he dont answer call again and again what do i say to him talk about the weather talk about any damn thing danny stumbled away through the snow to his tractor but keep him talking jane ran upstairs and tossed the camcorder on her bed in fury picked up her phone and saw there was a message on the voicemail antonys number sod that she dropped the phone on the bed and sat quietly for a while with the light out watching the snow drifting past the window wishing shed caught the usual bus gone home to mum someone you could count on to behave like decently what was worst about this was that ben didnt even seem to see anything vaguely wrong in meeting violence with violence and all to sustain his hugely powerful image she felt sick she wanted out of here with no enthusiasm she picked up the phone keyed in the message jane listen hen i have a problem were talking white hell here those guys at the highways agency theyre never prepared for cruel and unusual weather and it looks like theyre about to close the severn bridge im doing ma best here but it may be tomorrow night or later before i can get over there looks like its down to you the big one dont worry about it you screw up its no the end of the world we can reconstruct just weld the wee thing to your hands and get what you can lots of ben lots of the weirdos keep in tight dont zoom and dont be put off they get used to the lens the punters and the victims both good luck sod off jane said sourly if they thought she wanted to be part of the artifice they could both sod off it seemed likely now that they were all in this the white company too was alistair hardy really going to tell the viewers that he couldnt actually get conan doyle on the line was he going to tell ben that conan doyle had confirmed to him that the hound was purely a devon myth not if he had any psychic sense of what ben was about ben who suddenly was no longer endearingly eccentric but more than a little unstable maybe it was simply midlife crisis hormonal ben well into his fifties now racing the clock ready to hurl the clock to the ground it seemed and hack at it with his heel in rage ready to damage anybody threatening the now drama reluctantly jane called antony back at least he was younger and therefore probably less desperate when he answered she could hear a car engine sorry i didnt know you were driving jane is that you trying to get myself home here through the white hell which has arrived in the soft south and the noveltys already wearing thin wait a sec let me pull into the verge ok sorry the cynical languor in his voice had a calming effect on jane she waited for the handbrakes ratchet antony can i talk to you confidentially aye ill switch off the recording machine huh joke go on im worried about things well about ben well i never this is serious youre his mate or i wouldnt tell you in fact i didnt tell you ok jane this conversation will dissipate in the ether and so in the face of his levity and because there was no one else she could tell she told antony the shocking truth about nathan and what ben had done to him told him in considerable detail and then she told him why ben had done it oh boy antony said she told him how ben on another occasion after screaming at the shooters had said that where he came from there were real hard bastards knightsbridge jesus christ antony ok joke bens from reading and not what youd call the most salubrious side as i understand it his old man was a builders labourer something like that well fine not then though ben came into television at a time when a good and educated background a nice accent was still very much an advantage and he gave them what they felt most comfortable with and now hes stuck with it so yeah i guess he knows how to handle himself however next time he tears someones face off it would be awfully nice to have it on camera is the wee sony in your other hand as we speak antony i dont jane dont worry about it hes no gonnae do anything to spoil the programme believe it i know this guy i promise you what did she expect common sense god were they all the same she said slightly desperately its just that its getting weirder its getting out of hand like hattie chancery who the daughter of the man who built stanner she killed her oh yeah he told me but whats she have to do with doyle and the hound of hergest she probably wasnt even born when doyle was here its just like oh shes spooky lets throw her into the pot i just think its getting out of hand so well that what was she supposed to say to this guy antony i want to believe i want to believe in the mystical borderland and if the hounds part of that i wanted to believe in the hound i need this i dont want it turned into artifice jane listen dont worry its gonnae be fine we can sort all this out later youre my number one girl out there and only one rule if its sexy shoot it cool jane said sadly after walton the forestry came up on both sides of the tractor this hostile army of giants in new white armour dannys face felt hot with anger and anxiety hed even switched off his music mabbe feel more like playing it on the way back instead of replaying over and over in his head what greta had said sounded like he always does halfbaked like he ent yere danny leaned on the wheel and the tractor battered on into england like hed figured no hereford gritters or ploughs had made it this far and by the time he reached the turning to the nant the road looked like it would soon be impassable for ordinary vehicles however on jeremys ground the snow was packed tight on either side and there was a wellcleared channel down the middle and the tractor rolled sweetly down this long grey alleyway to the edge of the farmyard dear god danny climbed down from the cab hissing as the night wrapped its frozen arms around him he looked around no lights in the farmhouse no security lights outside power off already snow brought the lines down danny hoped it was only the power that was off he stood there and looked at the nant for long seconds snow accumulating on the vinyl shoulders of his donkey jacket and already inches thick dense as christmascake icing on the farmhouse roof and then before hed realized it he was bawling out into the white night like greta doing the full janis jeremy jeremy where are you boy jeremy when he filled his lungs again the bitter air stung his throat and he started to cough doubled up by the gate he leaned on the gate tears in his eyes panting letting the silence reform around him as the snow fell all pretty and pitiless come out jeremy please but when he pictured jeremy the boy wasnt coming towards him but walking softly away through the cushiony fields off into the hollows of the deep forestry where there was peace danny raised his head and thought he saw a glow behind one of the windows in the farmhouse and it was then that it started up at first it was like it was coming up from the ground from some sunken prison cell down where there was no light and no hope it was coming up through the snow like tongues of cold fire it was as old as the hills as old as the ridge and bonecold the coldest sound in the world the jane police so much bigger than asthma now this was what alice said when merrily rang her as lol had known she would before the night was out alice was a force of nature if dexter thought that by finally coming out with the untold story he was going to make her drop it hed got her badly wrong shed discovered this powerfully mystical aspect of christianity shed never imagined existed and also as the oldest sister in a dysfunctional family she saw it as her responsibility to sort everything out even from across the scullery lol had heard everything coming out of the phone alices voice crackling like an old radio she and dexter had had a row and dexter had stomped off in a rage although he was supposed to come back to do the last two hours in the chip shop alice saying he wasnt having his own way this time asthma or no asthma nothing was going to stop the eucharist telling dexter shed find darrin herself make sure he was there at the eucharist shes fallen in love with the word merrily said sounds powerful and kind of technical prayers comforting but eucharist suggests big guns the computer was booting up this row of icons extending along the bottom of the screen lol realizing that he didnt know what any of them meant another religion he didnt understand so wheres darrin now well he was in prison one way or another alice will find him which is not what dexter wants but dexters clearly still scared of darrin whereas alice is scared of nobody a face with a heavy moustache was on the screen the expression solemn and dignified but the eyes bright with just the possibility of madness illuminating merrilys other problem if the white company are simply harmless misguided terribly british eccentrics she was standing next to the computer holding her pectoral cross between her fingers then why didnt jane tell me about them because she knows youd have to disapprove lol said and shed be embarrassed if she had to say im sorry i cant work this weekend because my mum doesnt want me exposed to evil forces you think im overreacting shes grown up quite a lot in the past year i mean have you actually had experience of a medium letting evil into the world or is this received wisdom in as much as its received from the same source we get all our merrily sank into the chair hair mussed its all received wisdom isnt it its why they call us the church and if shes grown up that much why did you feel you had to tell me about lucy he looked up at her from the rug because in the jane police im just a junior officer she laughed there was something that might have been a tear stain like a birthmark alongside her nose he wanted to go over and lick it off im trying not to get screwed up or sanctimonious about this merrily said there are even one or two deliverance ministers who actually work with mediums and dont seem to have come to any look you wont rest till you find out what theyre doing why dont you ask them what do i do send them a spirit message or even go back to the homepage and click on contacts oh she flipped back a page contact us to apply for membership or to obtain any of our leaflets contact matthew hawksley on othersideasccom merrily clicked on it an email option came up should i whats your own email address no reference to deliverance in it are you kidding jane uses it it just says watkins why dont you say youre a conan doyle enthusiast and youve heard theres a conference at stanner hall this weekend and is it still on despite the weather mention the cwn annwn thatll sound knowledgeable ok merrily began typing good evening mr hawksley word has reached me of your gathering at the stanner hall hotel near kington in herefordshire this weekend as a conan doyle enthusiast living not far away i should be most interested to learn more details in fact given the weather conditions will the conference still be taking place as my own researches into the links between sir arthur conan doyle the hound of hergest the cwn annwn etc have shown this is a fascinating area of inquiry if you could supply me with more details asap i would be most grateful yours sincerely m watkins perfect lol said what if they are at stanner and one of them shows this to jane theyre unlikely to make the connection lol said but if they do youll get a call from jane and shell have to tell you all about it in a lot of detail and there wont be a mystery any more and we can get out of this cell and go and light a fire and watch the snow build a big white wall between us and the world merrily put on a wry smile that didnt quite work jane was pacing the shabby lobby with the camera hanging from her shoulder like a school bag the camera and all it represented a burden now it had come to this time to talk seriously to nat soon as she got back when the porch door slammed it wasnt nat but matthew the harry potter clone carrying a laptop in a leather case just for the sake of it jane brought up the sony and shot him by the side of the christmas tree in front of the reception desk matthew half turned and stuck his tongue out behind him the white lights on the tree were unevenly spread and it looked spindly and skeletal like a frosted pylon ben had brought the tree in himself last weekend probably nicked it out of the forestry jane didnt approve of young trees hacked off above the roots and brought indoors to die slowly so that by twelfth night happy new year you had a stiffened corpse she lowered the camera nodding at the laptop you get emails from the other side on that matthew inspected her through his blackframed glasses i realize youre much too cool to be mixed up with spiritists and channellers and i suppose i was much the same at your age what changed to jane adulthood seemed an arid place tonight you dont want to know stick to your filming no i do jane said matthew stared into her eyes and she stared back and realized he could be as old as mum glasses with big frames sometimes made people look a lot younger like with beards and double chins for what its worth he said what changed me was losing a mate beths husband steve pollen who was my boss at powys council in the archive department steve died very unexpectedly oh im sorry only it didnt stop him coming into work youd find something interesting say some missing estate records and youd say automatically here look at this steve and then youd think hang on hes dead and then youd realize youd just caught a glimpse of him at the files people who die without some degree of foreknowledge often dont realize theyve passed two of the lights on the tree had gone out jane thought of ledwardine remembered the dead branches shed collected in the orchard and brought into the vicarage to be sprayed silver and gold for christmas she and mum planning to decorate them this weekend she felt a stab of loneliness actually i think i saw a woman once like when she was dead i didnt know she was dead until later so it wasnt scary i mean i was pretty sure i saw her but you know matthew nodded most of the spirits we see are complete strangers so we dont realize theyre not there its only when we spot someone in a situation where nobody could possibly be at a particular time like in a deserted theatre or a church thats been locked up that we think uhoh jane frowned this conversation was getting too pally dont get me wrong i still think spiritualisms naff its a big issue life after death but you see these mediums working an audience and all they ever get is like remember your dads blue suit in the wardrobe well its ok to send it to the oxfam shop matthew looked exasperated at last people who are bereaved dont want a lecture on metaphysics they just want some evidence of survival some small thing that sounds trivial and naff to an intellectual like you but is conclusive proof that someone they thought had gone for ever is still around so now she was just young and heartless does he still come into the office steve no hes gone on now we decided beth and i that we ought to try and help him which is how we got into the network you help them to accept their state they hang around people they used to know and get confused but if its explained to them theyll just turn around and see the light literally and theyll see people usually their relatives whove already passed waiting to welcome them which is wonderful and youve got that look again the guy was clearly sincere just seems too easy its not easy but its normal what was interesting in this case however on a more basic level was that when steve died he was putting together a file of newly discovered records relating to hergest and stanner and i was able to finish the work for him with beth which was how i learned about the windlesham group and the white company sometimes youre led to things jane said you found out about walter chancery and everything from these records it connected up the phone on reception started to ring so what did they do the night conan doyle came here hadnt you better get that matthew said look i know all about hattie chancery matthew smiled shaking his head and walked off jane snatched up the phone stanner hall wheres your mobile irene you wanna talk talk eirion said jane amber came round the corner from the kitchen steps oh sorry jane held up two fingers appealing for a couple of minutes and fished the brigid document from her jeans you do realize we leave in the morning eirion said when shed finished reading it out i kind of thought you were ringing to wish me bon voyage oh hell id forgotten thanks i didnt mean were leaving early because of the snow oh well never mind this then ill ill give it half an hour ok youre awfully obliging for a welshman make that fifteen minutes eirion said amber was nowhere in sight when jane came off the phone but matthew was halfway up the stairs in conversation with alistair hardy these guys it was all so cosy forcedcosy like a nursing home did death reduce the intellect to mush going to work wondering why nobody would talk to you till one day someone like hardy turned you round and there were all your dead relatives lined up like for some awful retirement party surprise surprise all your dead relatives in paper hats with vacant dead smiles and party poppers jane amber was standing by the eerie tree wearing her vinyl apron her voice was too light and thin for this place in stanner unless you projected your words were carried off like dust come and help me would you ok but as soon as they reached the kitchen steps it was jane did you tell your mother whats happening here well no i told you what shed say i said you wouldnt tell her amber said with resignation ben thought you would but then he ben ben knows you rang my mum it was actually bens idea jane this time ambers words resounded like a smoke alarm it was ben who suggested i rang her i dont understand youd better come down to the kitchen amber looked over her shoulder and then back at jane and down at the camera in her hands deceptions not my forte jane im just a cook the backporch door was unlocked normal enough danny went through with his lambing lamp switched on the usual stuff in here shovels rubber leggings on a peg hard hat and face guard for the chainsaw he banged on the back door jeremy the howling stopped danny rattled the handle it turned and the door opened not normal not at night danny shone the lamp into the kitchen oldfashioned greenpainted kitchenette exposed sink old brown rayburn jeremy the rayburn chunnered to itself a tap dripped no one here he went through into the living room where the lambing lamp found jesus half in shadow his face tinted by the olive light of the garden of gethsemane below the mantelpiece behind a fireguard little orange flames were curling quietly out of a tampeddown mix of woodblocks and coalslack in the range below that the dog sat on the brown and green rag rug the dog wasnt howling no more only panting slightly his flanks heaving his stare on danny but not moving from the rug that had been here all his life and all jeremys life this was a good dog border collie crossed with something else something that howled wheres the boss flag the dog didnt come to him didnt howl didnt growl didnt whimper just sat danny shone the light around over the pinkflowered wallpaper that jeremys mam had pasted up long long ago over the dresser was a picture plate of what might have been hereford cathedral with a crack through the tower on the top of the drawer section of the dresser was a small white envelope on the envelope it said mr danny thomas danny said oh god oh jesus christ the envelope wasnt sealed danny took out the single sheet of folded paper inside and held it under the lambing light danny ive never been one for formality you been a good friend to me always please take the dog he knows you please deal with the sale of my stock and see they go to the right kind of place or keep everything yourself for nothing natalie will danny let the paper fall something like a sob came out of him when he looked up the face of jesus had gone into full shadow he ran out through the kitchen through the porch and into the white yard opposite him the big barn door was shut the little door in the bottom righthand corner was not quite closed danny saw a glimmering of light in there he stopped outside the door very afraid behind him the dog was howling again making the coldest loneliest sound in all the bloody world the snow was coming down harder but he couldnt feel it it didnt feel cold no more its flakes might have been rose petals twist you forgot how isolating snow could be at the highest point of the village the church and the vicarage had become an island of ancient stones and crooked timbers rising out of an arctic sea into a falling sky merrily and lol made a brief exploratory foray into the upholstered softness no vehicles moving on the square the little market hall squatting like a whitecapped mushroom lighted windows in the black swan reduced to shining slits by high sills of snow the swan was a local pub again its car trade in retreat merrily and lol came back in and she shut the front door and stood eye to eye with the lampbearing christ lord of weary acceptance wouldnt even get to the main road would we she brushed down janes fleece kicked off her wellingtons sending shards of snow skating across the mat and the flagstones lol followed her through to the scullery where ethel the cat dozed in front of the electric fire he sat down in front of the computer snow melting into his hair there you go she leaned against him what thank you for your inquiry to be conversant with the stanner project it is clear you must have contacts in the psychic world although i have not heard of you accordingly i attach our fact sheet the involvement of sir arthur himself in the events of combined with the subsequent history makes this for us a onceinalifetime opportunity and we very much hope to go ahead this weekend however the state of the weather means that we may be fewer in number than was originally anticipated and so if you are a genuine person residing sufficiently close to stanner hall as to be able to journey here we would be interested to hear more from you we make no secret of our work but it is essential that only sympathetic and likeminded people are involved as i am sure you appreciate please email me again if you are interested i shall be communicating with several other individuals throughout the evening and therefore shall be available should you wish to know more all good wishes matthew lol looked up at her through his brassrimmed glasses confirmation merrily moved to the window looked out at the ghosts of apple trees it looks like theyre there already i im just well im not well disposed towards my daughter turning and throwing up her hands in frustration the stanner project project how longs that been going on we make no secret of our work how longs the bloody kid known about all this the electric fire put a blush on the white wall under the window a poor defence merrily thought against the winged spirits of the night the cwn annwn chasing souls while electricity had helped to kill off superstition everyone in the countryside knew it was most prone to failure when you most needed it might as well find out the rest lol clicked on the attachment the stanner project sir arthur conan doyle seemed in his later years to be in a permanent state of excitement and anticipation always believing that his field of study would eventually change everyones life removing all fear and uncertainty about the nature of death dispelling centuries of superstition and removing the residual control still exercised over the lesssophisticated by the church the white company has come to believe that acds own certainty stemmed in part from an experience that occurred at the end of the nineteenth century when he was already a successful author and a wealthy man at a time when he was reevaluating his life and searching for a new purpose a midlife crisis if you like we believe that his initial baptism a baptism of fire occurred at stanner hall on the border of herefordshire england and powys wales when he took part in what had originally been devised as little more than a party game for his amusement but which turned into something profoundly disturbing so disturbing in fact that acd with his at the time limited knowledge was only able to deal with it by fictionalizing it in a way that would eliminate all paranormal implications we suspect it was many years before he was able to understand the true psychic and psychological implications of the stanner experience if indeed he reached a full understanding prior to his passing in the stanner project involving mr alistair hardy and others will attempt to reexamine the experience in the light of more recent developments in psychical and psychological thinking and perhaps point the way to the breakthrough anticipated by acd the implications of this are quite awesome and any information particularly with regard to the anomaly which might further our inquiries even at this late stage would be gratefully received certainly explains why jane kept it to herself merrily gave the document to the printer something profoundly disturbing thats comforting isnt it ill be able to sleep now and the breakthrough would be what always the same one with these people final undeniable proof of life after death kept conan doyle in transatlantic lecture tours for over twenty years matthew implies that the real reason the church is opposed to spiritualism is not as you might say because people might let in something dangerous but because it would undermine your power base i mean dont you ever wonder she stood there with janes fleece hanging open and her pectoral cross swinging free of course she wondered lol said like if these people were suddenly out of the blue to happen upon absolute undeniable evidence of an afterlife the atheists and the physicists would still deny it what about the christians ah well even if we had to accept it as fact it would still only be the beginning for us however far it went it would be the beginning but look they wont will they they wont find it because apart from anything i dont believe truth is ever going to come out of terror portents of death the hounds of annwn bang bang bang front door ethel springing up on the desk merrily flinched if this turns out to be dexter and alice again i dont think i can face it lol stood up ill get it no best if she watched his face fall another test failed dammit they had to get over this stupid concealment of the obvious yes she said if you would the kitchen was empty every surface clean as if the house was being vacated for a while amber stood next to the stove which was something french and steely grey the smell of rich chocolate seemed inappropriate tonight the lights in here made amber look ill as soon as they found out what your mother actually did they thought it would be a good friction point the size and the emptiness of the kitchen made her voice sound forced and full of fissures like a student teacher on day one jane still wasnt getting it friction if the diocesan exorcist jumped in with some dire warning about the risks of messing with spirits they thought that would be a nice touch then theyd try and get her to express decent christian reservations on video and even if she wouldnt play it would still be a nice twist friction you see jane frictions sexy amber im not they ben and antony if its sexy shoot it they wanted to ben knew i wasnt happy about the spiritualism angle from the start he suggested i give your mother a ring and ask her advice pretend i was doing it behind his back and if she reacted badly and tried to stop you coming here as a result that would make another good twist twists are important conflict and friction and twists jane sagged theyd have used us as a twist jane love dont get this wrong they never think of it as any kind of betrayal its just television its feeding the monster tvs this awful voracious predator if you get too near you inevitably get eaten im not saying i totally didnt want to ring your mother it wouldve been nice to get some objective advice from someone with expertise and if she managed to step in and stop you coming well i suppose that was something else i didnt have to worry about bens going oh dont worry jane will have told her by now we can expect another visit but i didnt i wouldnt i work here i wouldnt i know i said you wouldnt jane unslung the camera very much mistrusting it now and placed it on the island unit backing away from it why are you telling me this why are you telling me now trying to stay calm work out the extent of bens duplicity but aware of breathing faster i was going to call you tonight amber said and warn you that all the roads would be blocked so dont even think of coming tomorrow but with your youthful enthusiasm and your obvious desire not to miss anything interesting you bloody well turned up tonight thats why im telling you but like why would you why would you not want me here im shooting the video and if antony doesnt make it he may very well not get through thats true amber agreed which would be leaving the lunatic in charge of the asylum ben im a drama man its about using real people and real places i dont know whether antony not being here will make him more sensible or even more irrational all i know is hes been busily shooting material all week interviewing hardy and mrs pollen and a man in kington who used to work hang on jane stiffened youre saying hes got a video camera ben amber sighed i dont understand jane you ambers face crumpled with this terrifyingly maternal kind of sympathy you didnt really think theyd leave it all to you did you jane stepped back and stared at the camcorder on the island unit like it was contaminated with anthrax well i she felt this acute burning behind her eyes im really sorry amber said i shouldve told you days ago jane swallowed hard no wonder matthew had been laughing at her they were all laughing at her all of them laughing up their sleeves at the smartarse schoolkid prancing round with her professional video camera all of them ben antony the white company ben antony dont worry its gonnae be fine its gonnae be riveting jane antony set me up youre my number one girl jane its he really wouldnt see it like that these little sonys are so comparatively cheap they can scatter them around like throwaway pens and if you thought you were the only person with a camera youd try all the harder to get good material youd start seeing your name in lights obviously hell use some of what youve done of course he will he set me up he also set ben up and ben set antony up and you and i between us were supposed to set your mother up television jane everybody at some time gets set up the end invariably justifying the means when its all over ben and antonyll watch the results together and get pissed and thatll be that television its despicable no jane amber did this brittle little laugh its art and what do we do now just go along with it jane snatched up the camera with no reverence amber said if you were thinking of hurling that thing to the flags in rage please dont theres been too much rage jane shook her head letting the camera dangle from her hands on its strap what should i do i think you should do what you were supposed to do in the first place tell your mother everything and whats she going to do amber said look im only a cook but christ amber if you say that again i mean im only a schoolkid and if i can see it see what that if conan doyle the john the baptist of spiritualism kept quiet about what happened here even if it was evidence of survival after death then there must have been something fairly unpleasant though obviously not unpleasant enough to prevent you grabbing the chance to film something similar if you got the chance jane put the camcorder back on the island unit im not a very nice person am i youre a young person thats all ok ill phone mum what then amber folded her arms staring at the flags realistically i think your mother ought to talk to the only one of them ive had much to do with mrs pollen when was that earlier today she came looking for me would hate to cause offence et cetera oldfashioned country woman womens institute cakes for the fête jolly dinner parties two golden labradors and shes the only one of them who got into this through personal loss and she was a churchgoer all the reward you get for suffering victorian hymns and dismal sermons jane said he pinches your husband before his time you must have stimulating discussions you and your mother amber said keeps her on her toes mrs pollen now thinks that she was somehow directed here by her husband amber shrugged looking uncommitted either way my feeling is that she believes that if they can get through shell be rewarded get some contact with him that really doesnt happen jane looked up at the high window through which by daylight you could see the top of stanner rocks thats so sad on the surface shes very breezy and sort of earthy about it but underneath shes mixed up in a way its rekindled her faith but shes aware that the church thinks its wrong and theres clearly some guilt about that anyway i think shed like to talk to your mother and that wouldnt do any of us any harm at this stage except possibly ben not my problem amber said and jane looked at her recalling what nat had said about her calling it quits moving out amber said they call it the stanner project ben calls it the hook the contemporary events from which they can hang a century of conjecture as far as hes concerned whatever kind of answer they get if any is entirely irrelevant whats important is that the question gets posed on television did the hound of the baskervilles begin here any extra spooky bits would be a nice bonus but the programme doesnt depend on that now he knows what happened when conan doyle was here he does for a moment jane almost forgot her own humiliation you mean someone finally traced the missing document oh ben did better than that ambers smile was twisted he traced someone who was working here well not then obviously not at the time but someone who worked here sixtyodd years ago and so talked to people who were here at the time wow who amber said the contact had come through the guy who played the major in the murder thing frank sampson when dacre was trying to stop people talking to ben it had worked in reverse in some cases and frank had phoned on tuesday to say an old man called leonard parsonage who used to be the butler here would be happy to talk to ben seems dacres father got him sacked years ago amber said you know what its like around here for old feuds leonard jane was remembering gomers account of the death of hattie chancery took a while fore one of em was up to going up them stairs ole leonard the butler it was my mam said he lives in a sheltered bungalow now in kington hes over ninety which still means he must have been in his twenties when he was here amber he was the person who found hatties body hes talked about all that better than that hes talked on videotape amber bent and opened a cupboard in the base of the island unit do you want to go and watch it you can tell your mother all about it youve got it here amber rose clutching a maxell vhs videotape in a light blue case with a gold stripe this is a copy that ben ran off for antony to look at i pinched it from his desk you can take it up to our bedroom theres a video machine in there have you seen it you know which our bedroom is dont you jane jane accepted the tape you sure you want me to see it jane youre gagging to see it lol came back into the scullery with gomer parry cap in his hands squeezing it like a sponge as he fought for breath ignoring the chair merrily was offering know you ent gonner mind vicar i got the truck out front had a call from danny thomas see you recalls danny thomas of kinnerton she stared at him puzzled assembling the image of a bearded man with grey hair over his shoulders a flat cap on top you mean the one whos also your partner now gomers glasses had clouded he snatched them off wiped them savagely on his sleeve gomer let me get you some tea no no thank you he rammed his glasses back on bloody stupid course you knows the boy he stared at her defiantly ent lost no marbles vicar i just i know you went dashing out into the cold and then back into the warm it gets to us all she took his cap gently unrolled it and hung it on the wastepaper bin near the electric fire hes ok isnt he danny hes all right juss called me up just he got this pal see gomer sat down at last bringing out his ciggy tin like it was part of the same cycle of movements ta take it slowly gomer bit of a loner thats all hell a lot of a loner gomer shook his head annoyed stared in disgust at his ciggy tin i ent thinkin straight at all you knows full well who im talkin about boys girlfriends daughter hers janes you know that kiddie clancy youre talking about jeremy berrows exacly jeremy berrows me and danny been talkin a lot about jeremy berrows the situation hes got isself into and a lot of other stuff and i been thinkin for a long time danny too we needs to ask the little vicar to take a look and you know how it is you lets things slide and then it all come down on you and now jeremy gomer took off his glasses pinched his nose whats he done gomer boys hanged isself gomer said the huntress where do you want me to start mr foley leonard parsonage asked he was a very thin old man all really old people tended to be thin jane thought making themselves less of a target for all the things that could take you down id just like to get the levels right before we start bens voice came through fainter from one side why dont you tell us what youve been doing since you left stanner have you been in kington ever since the old guy got as far as saying hed returned to kent where he was born to get married then come back to kington to buy an ironmongers business then ben must have cut the recording when it came back ben was saying on that same background level tell me what she was really like leonard tell me what hattie was like mrs davies mrs chancery leonard had a tiny black personal microphone clipped to the mustardcoloured tie jutting out from the neck of his vneck pullover the mike looked like a stag beetle climbing up it we hadnt to call her mrs davies mrs chancery it was or mrs hattie he stopped talking and looked directly into the lens no at me leonard lets start again ok and remember talk to me not the camera forget about the camera it looked to jane like this had been hard going but all bens questions and prompts could be edited out and he could overlay the edits with other pictures like the photos of hattie and stanner jane had learned all this from eirion for all the use it was now wrenching back her anger she looked around the foleys bedroom while leonard rearranged himself it was at the front of the house with a bay window overlooking the car park and it was very unfussy with a plain wardrobe and a double divan no dressing table no mirror very amber well it had to be mrs chancery leonard said because stanner was the house of the chancerys you see robert davies he was just the stallion brought to the mare thats what they used to say looked less of a stallion mind you when i first saw him than he had before the first war according to mrs betts she was the cook mrs betts said they all used to fancy mr robert although in later years they all felt very sorry for him naturally because of because of the way she would treat him leonard wore false teeth which clicked sometimes but he talked quite fluently in the way of a man who was used to dealing with people ben had positioned him in front of a picture window with a view across some kind of car park to kington market place with its redbrick clock tower what was she like leonard physically describe her what she looked like take your time she was oh my lord she was like a goddess to us diana the huntress somebody called her that i think it was the minister at the church diana the huntress yes because she was you see she used to go hunting every day of the week it seemed like in the season well not that many women did in those days oh dont get me wrong she was all woman all woman too much woman some mightve said leonard smiled in what struck jane as a surprisingly lascivious way and there was a shiny bit of drool in the corner of his mouth he had a thin white moustache kind of dandyish jane wondered just wondered ok tell me about the hunting ben said how did that start oh well old walter he encouraged her that was what i was told walter couldnt ride and he was too old to start but that was what you did in those days the gentry and so he had his daughter on a horse from a very early age and that was how she got in with the hunt if you rode you hunted pretty much the way it is today but i would say the hunting was always more important than the riding for mrs hattie anyway that was about when the middle marches hunt was first started and it was mainly young people back then this was before the first world war it wouldve been yes she was just a girl but quite large even then you could see that from the photos i expect yes the hunt i believe they kept that on through most of the war although some of the young men had gone off to fight afterwards after the war it went from strength to strength they had these hounds from france that were bred down in glamorgan nothing but the best for the middle marches the chancerys they supported the hunt in the early years financially that is when they had money to spare and they also founded a hunt supporters club to raise more money so it would always be buoyant but mrs hattie lived for it oh my lord yes if there was bad snow or disease or some reason the hunt had to be called off then she was in a very black mood indeed this is in your day leonard oh yes i came there in thirtyfour which was the year after the old fellow died i was soon mrs hatties righthand man that was what she used to say or my squire she talked about herself like a knight on horseback my squire yes i was her squire black moods eh you said shed be in a black mood when the hunting was off what was that like black moods black hound leonard bit down on his lower lip and stared into the distance he had pale blue eyes watery whats that mean ben said used to say she ran with the black hound one of her sayings shed come back and the groom would take her horse all covered with sweat and id be there and shed say bring me a bloody drink leonard the black hound was in the pack today what did she mean by that well it was one of her sayings but did she mean there was an actual it meant as far as i could fathom that shed been riding hard and fierce that day mr foley and if thered been no kill she wouldnt be in the best of moods a silence then that went on for a long time the television and video were in the corner of the bedroom near the window jane was sitting on a bedding box at the foot of the bed and old leonard seemed to be looking over her shoulder she glanced behind uncomfortable as if hattie might be there with her onion eyes the bed was unmade as though ben had just rolled out of it or as if someone had pulled all the and mr robert would soon know about it leonard said jane turned back to the tv in time to catch another silence ben said eventually what did she do to mr robert leonard he leonard licked his lips next day mr robert might have a black eye or a big lip or scratch marks down his cheek or all of them that was the wounds you could see she might have done damage you couldnt see leonard nodded very slightly sometimes hed be limping and this happened after she ran with the black hound ben said with a lot of emphasis leonard said nothing where did they go leonard did they hunt on the ridge oh everywhere for the local farmers it didnt do not to let the hunt cross your land the ben broke off struggling to form a question leonard when she said black hound did you have any reason to believe she might have been making some connection with the legend of the hound of hergest leonard smiled you do know of the legend course i do he looked stern again and all that damn silliness ben let the silence hang for twenty thirty seconds silliness leonard said again what do you mean exactly there was a bit of silliness when she when they died in what way oh leonard looked cross one of the maids said shed seen a shadow of a big black dog go across the lawn when hattie died ben keeping the excitement out of his voice robert oh before before any of it the night before around dusk before it was dark and the night before that too or so she said just silliness mr foley things get repeated and exaggerated specially in country places you dont want that on your programme do you and hattie she knew about the legends aaah leonards face twisted in exasperation shed no time for legends history now she was interested in history she always said this was her place and her roots were here even though they werent of course because stanner was still a new house then even if it looked old but shed never known anywhere else she was born at stanner so i suppose that was true in a way and she used to go to the church and look at the graves why i was never with her mr foley i was only the butler never been much of a churchgoer anyway lost my two older brothers in the first war and never saw much point to it after that got themselves killed before they were twentyone and heres me ninetythree its all a lottery mr foley no god in this im afraid or if there is you cant rely on him what about mrs chancery did she go to church well she went to the church not to the services much unless it was something to do with the hunt a funeral a wedding when a member of the hunt got married theyd all form an arch outside the church whichever church it was with their riding crops and theyd leonard why did she go to the church if not to services to look at the graves like i say the big ones inside the church i never go there but arent there some big ones inside silence ben said you mean the tombs ah sorry yes the tombs thomas vaughan him yes black vaughan and the woman ellen gethin the terrible the terrible yes mrs hattie she used to say thats my ancestor there in the church jane said shit youre saying she described ellen gethin as her ancestor this take your time leonard this is interesting she said that this ellen gethin the terrible was her ancestor i think she meant they were alike leonard said or she liked to think they were did this ellen hunt i suppose she wouldve done what else eh did they have anything else in common well i dont know leonard if i remind you that ellen gethin killed a man in cold blood did she you dont know about that leonard didnt look particularly interested well he said i expect i mustve heard about it once a long time ago perhaps but ive never bothered much with history you mean medieval history old history knights and things but more recent history walter chancerys time leonard smiled thats not history to me good ben said but first can we talk in some detail about the night when hattie killed robert id really rather not if you dont mind mr foley leonard said that wasnt what frank said you wanted to talk about it upset you it upsets me still mr foley no point in upsetting yourself any more when you get to my age its all over its all done it was a very tragic business and it didnt do me any good at all in the long run the children were too young and it turned out there were huge debts mr walter chancerys younger brother came to sort things out and i think he just wanted rid and my services were the first to be dispensed with thanks to someone i could mention but wont anyway mrs hattie she always valued my services oh my lord yes and i cried when i found her i was in tears i knew it was all over for all of us the water in leonards eyes had become pools and he turned his head away im sorry ben said switch that thing off would you the tape cut out and the tv screen went blue jane just sat there watching it relieved in a way because there was an awful lot to think about there was a link between hattie and the hound and the link was ellen gethin ellen in her long girdled gown the small cap on her head comely wench antony largo had said irreverently nice body and then ben had said me and thomas and ellen i feel in a strange sort of way that were kind of a team now the tv screen flickered and leonard was back it must have been some time later because his eyes were dry and calm now and it was a different camera angle leonards chair pushed closer into the window a shirtsleeved arm came into view with a mug of tea or coffee on the end there you are leonard vaguely familiar voice thank you frank leonards hands wrapped themselves around the mug you dont mind this do you mr foley frank sampson jane thought arrow valley amateur dramatics ben said something inaudible yes leonard said thats all right ill talk about that i wasnt there though you understand that im old but im not that old you dont look a day over sixty leonard ben said heartily and leonard giggled shrilly and ben started to ask him questions about walter chancery and his crass attempts to become a society host in his castle by the rocks leonard kept stopping to remind ben that this was only what hed heard from mrs betts the cook and a few others of the staff whod been there many years and ben kept saying dont worry about that just keep it coming leonard said it wasnt quite right about the chancerys building the house from scratch in fact theyd taken it over from a business associate of walters who was an architect and had done some industrial design for walter hed built the house for himself lovingly over many years and had been killed when some masonry collapsed here ben asked no no on a site over in the midlands but hed invited walter and bella to see his house and bella had fallen in love with it and after this chap died she urged walter to buy it theyd just found out bella was pregnant and of course this made walter more amenable to the idea of a new family home leonard then told a long story about how walter had had all these stags heads with huge antlers brought down from scotland and a suit of armour from a place in gloucestershire there was a duke came to stay once leonard said or it might have been an earl and sir arthur conan doyle ben said nonchalantly at one point didnt they say sir arthur was there leonard looked thoughtful then he smiled outside the window a woman with a black labrador walked across the car park to a silver ford focus oh my lord yes leonard said no doubt about that jane thought she heard bens sigh and if she hadnt heard it shed sensed it but leonards eyes narrowed and his hands came up a forefinger quivering but he never came back you know leonard said thats why its been forgotten he came here the once but he never came back and you can quite understand that when you know what they did noise and blood the hedgerows were swollen on both sides into vast white bales the lanes squeezed down to one vehicle width the snow was still falling but in a desultory way like a handful of pebbles after an avalanche the cab of gomers truck smelled of oil and sawdust and the suspension hung down on the left as if the truck had a hernia no she hasnt really talked much about the mother merrily said over the heaters phlegmy cough she had on janes duffel coat woollen gloves a white woolly hat from the wi christmas fair and lols scarf and she was still cold and chilled which was different we always knowed there was someing we dint know vicar gomer said thats the point first the boy was gonner marry mary morson then hers gone off with this naturalist feller from the rocks next thing this natlies turned up with her camper van and the kiddie and theyve moved into the nant inside the week and the ole van gone to stanner rocks burning her boats kind of thing they passed a barn in a field cloaked in snow one of the few isolated barns in this particular area not yet turned into luxury dwellings and therefore still available for farmersuicides it was nearly always the barn the engine room of the farm barns had fully exposed hanging beams and trusses and bales of hay you could build up steps to the gallows dozens of farmers in this area had gone out this way in the past twenty years something ritualistic about it a dying breed speeding up the inevitable love at first sight merrily thought of lol back at the vicarage go pushing her mobile phone into her hands this situation gets you over there with a good reason two birds one stone ill keep talking to matthew keep it switched on seemed that way gomer dipping his lights as they made it round a bend ahead of them a small dead tree poked out of a field like a stiffened hand from under a shroud merrily said but the truck started to skid gomer casually spun the wheels into it the truck rocked and steadied and shaved a few inches from the lefthand snow wall gomer bit down on his thin ciggy other day see what happens is danny comes home finds mary morson there says this natalies been seen in her ole camper van up on stanner with a feller gettin up to things oh well mary morson her figured they could get back together her and jeremy if it all broke up thats gretas view of it likely on marys terms herd wanner crush him first then pick up the bits ennit likeable girl then all heart so greta her says to danny hes your mate you better go tell him mary morson her ent gonner sit on this potato for too long well danny his renowned diplomat skills dont extend to tellin his mate his womans playin away difficult near impossible for a radnorshire farmer who was the man she was with gomer dunno danny didnt tell him about it but you think someone else did mary morson mabbe her rung to break the news to him as he wasnt the only fish in natalies stream gomer went silent for maybe eight swings of the wipers well see the thing is you didnt always have to tell jeremy things hed know wouldnt let on mabbe but hed know oh no big deal vicar well mabbe now it is but it dint used to be when farm life rolled along with no distractions no formfillin no ministry inspectors on your back youre saying boys what we used to call a natural farmer in the ole sense a quiet farmer goin quietly on gomer turned left and the manytiered lights of a transcontinental lorry came into view like a remote cocktail bar merrily pulled out her cigarettes and lighter my ole mam gomer said herd never leave part of an onion in the house use the lot else throw the rest away or put him on the fire first new moon in may my ole feller used to set about the nettles you done it then the ole nettlesd stay down and they wasnt that superstitious see just that most folk theyd have one or two things theyd stick by mmm i count magpies im afraid jeremys family they knowed the lot why you never watches a funeral through glass why it ent right for a woman to come in first on christmas day less her slept there the night before and definitely not if hers wearing new shoes boy growed up with all that all of it most youngsters it gets to the stage when they rebels against the ole ways only jeremys dad died when he was young and he took over the farm when he was nmoren a child took on the farm took on the traditions small world no distractions found he had a haptitude you followin me vicar go on remembering her herefordshire grandad his relationship with apple trees danny dreckon it was like it was all talkin to him the ground the trees the stock he sees stuff some of us mabbe dont notice and it tells him things sounds like ole wallop dont it a touch pagan maybe oh hell no big churchgoers all their lives the berrows thats why danny said could you come take care of things now i see he gomer hesitated he never was good with people see jeremy church services scared him but hed go on his own see when the church was empty take bits of stuff for harvest festival when nobody was about time of the footandmouth hed be there every morning and every night on his own not for long mind just slipping in quietly and the footandmouth stayed well away from the nant the berrows ground see always been in good heart never no chemicals gomer gave merrily a quick glance i ent specifically implying nothin by this vicar boy went quietly on that was all you said he knew things without having to be told again gomer didnt offer a direct answer danny was over there earlier boyd already brought his sheep down cleared his track so when he phones to ask if greta can take this kiddie clancy for the night danny knowed straight off someing was wrong the woman always took the kiddie back to the farm at night then her went back to stanner herself if her had to work late like doing the bar so shed stay the night but she wouldnt have her daughter stay there when merrily had asked jane if clancy worked at the hotel too at weekends jane had said natalie wouldnt allow it because the kid was so far behind at school natalie was very strict about homework and early nights odd really jane had said because she certainly wasnt the victorianparent type but gomer jeremy must have known that danny would be suspicious and go rushing up there and that danny would have the means to get through the snow likely the boy wanted to be sure it was danny found him ennit oh gomer switched off the wipers and merrily saw that the snow had almost stopped you could see low cloud now shifting like smoke the pale suggestion of a moon behind it they crested a hill and there was kington a snug medieval snowfantasy tucked under the white wings of the border hills with its brave twinkling of christmas lights the town looked small and cosy the hills didnt there were no visible lights in the welsh hills sometimes from outside wales loomed like a threat it all relaxed once you were across the border down in the pale quilted pastures of the radnor valley all the threat was in the space between its a strange kind of place isnt it this valley hergest stanner the erm hound they dont talk about it none of it you know that not the local people no not even whimsy for tourists she knew that much hergest court long since relinquished by whatever remained of the vaughan family was apparently tenanted most of the time but never promoted as a visitor attraction when you thought about it very little of anything here was for the tourists temptin fate see gomer said you asks people theyll give you ah load of ole wallop but they ent gonner tempt fate all the same but if the vaughan familys long gone temptin fate gomer mumbled almost angrily you dont do that gomer tell me one thing you see any basic connection between the legend of the hound of hergest and the stuff you were telling me about the other night whatevers been killing this guy dacres sheep gomer grunted has it has it what been killin sheep i ent yeard of any save for dacres and sebbie gomer paused chopping down to second gear sebbies losin it bigtime fact they came to the traffic island on the edge of town an iced cake uncut chances were nobody would get in or out of town tonight the truck creaked around the island and on to the bypass via a shallow gully down the middle losing it how needing a firmer handle on this before she went into the berrows farm on the booze givin out daft sentences on the bench makin a spectacle of isself in the pubs family thing i reckon mabbe it all comes down to wassername genetic only you feels its in the ground too weighing it down like clay two attitudes to the ground see vicar either you goes quietly on tendin and healin like jeremy berrows or you goes roarin over it like with the hunt whoop whoop domination makes you feel like youre in charge i spose i wouldnt know mabbe its just about noise and blood all i know is theres what feels like a terrible rage buried somewhere in this valley you take the tale of ole black vaughan mad as hell turnin over market carts the hound in the night the bull in the church blood and noise all around yeres sebbie dacre master of the middle marches blood and noise like his granny and in the middle of it all this little farmer goin quietly on little island of calm cant be easy mabbe jeremy mabbe he was yearin all the noise and blood poundin in his head gettin closer and closer until he couldnt take it nmore maybe someone shouldve sorry vicar rural stress came in many forms most of them unrecorded unrecognized by psychiatry doesnt matter merrily tightened lols long scarf are we nearly there with the lights of kington behind them theyd followed the bypass into a harder lightless landscape ranks of snowcaked conifers forming on the hazy edges of the headlight beams what have they been shooting at gomer do you know shed been here many times and she knew that when you turned the corner and cruised down into the radnor valley the landscape and your spirits usually lightened only tonight they wouldnt be turning the corner likely shadows gomer said shootin at shadows at first jane had thought like wow the enterprise the bravado the spectacle realizing in seconds that nothing else the chancerys might have done could have been more blatantly insane and in that situation today they would have known it between them they would have seen for heavens sake a dozen crazy horror movies with the same simplistic message dont meddle a pulp cliché now theyd been mature people people of wealth and status and theyd behaved like irresponsible kids but of course they were victorians at the decadent end verging on the edwardian jane had done her social history and at this particular period in the heat and smoke of technological revolution superstition belonged to the more primitive corners of the empire the chancerys would have felt some kind of immunity by virtue of being victorians jane sat down on the edge of her bed looking at the window a blackboard dusted with chalk and still seeing the illfitting dentures of leonard parsonage working their way around the word exshorshism the beetlelike personal mike distorting it too close to his mouth because of the way his tie bulged out of his pullover jane shuddered sitting there in the dark with three inches of snow on the window sill she finally called home not thinking too hard about what she was going to say fairly confident now that she could turn this around with mum because it was a fact that if she hadnt kept quiet stuck around picking up pertinent information here and there ear to the ground well no outsider would know the full extent of it and that knights frome sorry ledwardine vicarage jane stiffened for a moment not expecting this lol is that you jane what are you doing there mum and lol a secret lovetryst the things that went on when your back was turned not enough lol said he didnt sound happy are you snowed in kind of you and mum i wish lol said as soon as merrily walked into the living room at the nant her gaze connected with the eyes of jesus whose face wore a bleak smile of acceptance his halo dull with weariness kind of just get this over the picture wasnt as famous as the light of the world but it wasnt any more guaranteed to engender hope the halfmile track hadnt been blocked gomer had been able to drive up to the wall around the farmhouse where dannys tractor was wedged she stood near the livingroom doorway spotting the dog next a sheepdog more black than white the dogs head was pointing upwards between the knees of the man sitting on a wooden stool the man was looking down at the floor behind him a fire roared in the range gilding perhaps everything in the room except the picture of jesus gomer prodded her gently into the room and danny thomas stood up from somewhere mrs watkins good of you now she was here she didnt know what to say how to go about this it was like the strangeness of the whole area was concentrated in this square firelit room and when danny spoke that was also surreal initially i er i had this album once see in my folky days sorry fairport convention danny said his hair hung over his face like wet seaweed over a rock babbacombe lee period when dave swarbrick was writin the songs before your time i spect no merrily said i i remember it she stared at danny in his bottlegreen farmers overalls the dog began to whimper a log shifted on the fire oh god merrily whispered john babbacombe lee the man they couldnt danny thomas looked at her helplessly his eyes wide with anguish danny had been crying hang he said the man they couldnt hang he pointed at the man on the stool in front of the fire and that thats jeremy berrows the man couldnt hang hisself stupid little bastard party game but hes all right jane was sounding lost disconnected groping for certainties he wont die not if he stays away from rope lol said hanged a weighty word full of ancient resonance and with only one definition execution lol why why would he jeremy berrows a harmless benign little guy merrily had said when shed called to tell him it could be a long night there were things shed said that didnt add up things that even gomer couldnt put together was it like a cryforhelp thing or what i wouldnt think its what you do when youre hoping someones going to discover you in time lol said meanwhile keep this to yourself ok the lemonyellow sleep light on the front of the computer was swelling and fading swelling and fading here in the vicars study where madness collected like dust flaky fantasies in the phone lines images of the irrational only clicks away whys mum gone to the nant why did gomer want her to go i need to talk to her if you do it might be wisest to assume that she knows too much already for you to get away with concealing anything like what the white company oh my god whos been talking she knows about the documentary lol said nothing lol look all it was i swear it ben and this guy antony are shooting a tv thing about conan doyle and spiritualism and antony gave me a video camera he wanted me to shoot stuff when he wasnt there so like i wasnt going to blow it just because there were spiritualists involved i mean was i no you wouldnt do that only a lot of it was total bullshit i was very naive i was stitched up im an extremely gullible person and i wish id never come here all right id like to make some time to cry for you lol said but could you tell me about the stanner project first she was quiet for so long he was beginning to think theyd lost the signal oh god you really do know everything jane said merrily followed danny thomas back into the kitchen shut the door what about a doctor danny dropped a scornful hiss whats a doctor gonner do for his condition he went and halfsat on the edge of the kitchen table hair matted on his face when shed put on the electric light hed switched it off again as if there was something here that had to be contained in neardarkness to stop it spreading a tongue of flame wavered on the wick of a small hurricane lamp on the draining board this was the lamp that had been on a ledge in the barn when danny had crashed in when hed seen something that he said was like out of a black acidflashback thought i was too late all the beasts in there moaning and jeremy berrows in the meagre lamplight stoically dangling danny roaring in agony and rage jeremy seeing danny in the entrance there had started twitching and jerking halfspinning on the rope staring in terror at danny out of his bulging eyes trying for fucks sake to finish it sorry danny said meaning his language merrily waved it away and danny said he mustve gone temporarily insane hisself at that point fumbling out his claspknife clawing his way to the top of the scaffold of bales slashing like a mad bastard at the oily rope lucky that jeremy was oldfashioned about rope none of your nylon for this boy stretched under his weight see so his feets reaching the topmost bales and he dont even know it only wondering why its takin so long has he said anything danny shook his head hed caught jeremy as he fell laying him out on the hay the boy making this cawing noise like a stricken crow wearing the mark of the rope like a red collar bruises coming up under it long minutes passing before jeremy would let danny help him up and into the house can he even speak cant hardly move his head danny was intertwining his hands like he was washing them slowly under a tap i cant do nmore for him vicar he looked hard at her can i is there a medicine chest firstaid box ent that kind o first aid he needs would help if he was able to talk though has someone gone for natalie we dont know where she is ent at stanner danny stood up ah damn my idea we gets you yere now i dont know what to tell you i still dont know what brought him to this things about this boy we ent never fathomed gomer thought maybe hed just found out about she glanced at the door brought her voice down about natalie in the van couldnt tell him see vicar had the perfect opportunity couldnt do it cant hardly ask him now can i danny hung his head a slow smile shuffling into his beard you could though mabbe thanks and then ask him who she is natalie ask him who she is really danny said this is what we wanner know see sounding as if there was something here that he halfsuspected but didnt dare approach its hard to believe how crazy they were the chancerys jane said to lol you know about thomas vaughan black vaughan a bit according to the legend he was terrorizing kington after his death the full poltergeist thing the whole economy of the town under threat because people didnt want to go there this was when fifteenth sixteenth century if it happened at all folklore seems to work to its own calendar doesnt it so they call in the church you know about that twelve priests confine the spirit in a snuffbox which mightve been a metaphor a way of explaining it to humble countryfolk who knew sodall about states of consciousness but had a vague idea of what a snuffbox looked like did it work to an extent no more actual violence just vague manifestations like the hound like warnings that it was only dormant maybe hang on a mo im just putting the phone down lol heard jane moving about there was the sound of a door opening and then closing before she was back at her mobile thought there mightve been somebody around this place is suddenly full of totally unbalanced people where are you the jane he knew would relish being around totally unbalanced people in my room if the door had a lock id lock it jeremy i dont believe it you ok yeah im just not sure who i can trust lol if you talk to mum tell her we would appreciate some help but tell her to ring me first not just show up whos we amber and me everybody else seems to have a finger in the pie lol guessed he was about to hear things that jane would never have passed on if she hadnt been shafted over the video this is what ben finally got from old leonard walter chancery got hold of the vaughan story or rather his wife did bella who was well into this new fad for spiritcontact see what strikes me about all this is that it was probably the first time in recorded history when people werent terrified by the supernatural like the birth of new age convinced the mystery of death was being unveiled to them totally so when bella hears the tale of black vaughan shes like ok lets look at all this in the light of wooh modern science meaning spiritualism thered been some sightings locally mainly the dog but when was that dog not seen around so bella chancerys like hey lets do something for the community lady bountiful these crass incomers money coming out of their ears but what they wanted was status like in society and also locally they wanted to be lord and lady of the manor that was how leonard put it they had a celebrated medium there by the name of erasmus cookson who bella shipped up from london and because they were into spectacle and stuff they all dressed up they used the kitchen because it had stone walls and it looked like you were inside a castle the kitchens quite big and they arranged it like the great hall of a castle with candles everywhere why would they dress up for the exorcism they recreated the exorcism of black vaughan if you look in mrs leather youll see theres quite a lot to go on the dialogue between vaughan and the priests total pantomime but that wouldnt worry them where did they get twelve priests well they didnt obviously just got friends in house guests people down from london and dressed them up like monks or something and servants to make up the numbers and this erasmus cookson who was like some kind of showbiz spiritualist and who may have been a charlatan for all i know and arthur conan doyle and conan doyle absolutely doyle was in the area with relatives right in fact one theory is that it was nothing to do with helping the community they just this is the kind of people they were staged the whole thing for the benefit of this big celeb and what happened and they even had an actual snuffbox you imagine that they were probably going to tie a brick to it and toss it in the sodding pond hang on jane lol awoke the computer brought up matthews last message we believe that his initial baptism a baptism of fire occurred at stanner hall little more than a party game for his amusement turned into something profoundly disturbing so what happened that disturbed conan doyle enough to send him into complete denial and turn the hound into a detective story with a weak ending this is what bens asking he videoed leonard talking about it and leonards telling ben what ive just told you and bens like what happened in his calm interviewers voice like he really couldnt give a toss and leonards sitting there with this thin little smile on his lips and bens going leonard what happened you can feel him just longing to walk into shot and shake the old guy i wanted to and leonards just shaking his head sadly stupid stories mr foley to frighten the children im not going to pass on stupid stories and thats where the video ends with this shot of leonard sitting there shaking his head with a bit of dribble at the corner of his mouth so after ben showed you the video he didnt he doesnt know ive seen it amber gave it me to watch so you dont know if he found out any more after hed stopped recording if this guy told him the rest off the record no youre not going to do anything are you lol said because jane slighted was an unexploded device look if theyre planning to recreate the recreation of the exorcism of black vaughan yeah i know where do you get twelve priests in a snowstorm but whatever they have in mind its got to be spiritually offensive hasnt it so ive said id go along with amber who thinks its time to talk to mum you want her to raid the joint in the name of the church she could talk to people shes the diocesan exorcist that must count for lol he could almost feel the heat of her breath in his ear as if she was cupping her hands around the receiver you dont think they want that he saw where she was going jane lets not according to amber bens original idea was that mum would be part of the documentary like formally protesting on behalf of the church but suppose what he really wanted was that she should be involved as an exorcist if you were doing it now putting vaughan to bed who else would you use lol they jane janes voice was hoarse suppose they want her to take on vaughan thats crap its so not crap lol its the sort of thing foley would think of as soon as he found out what my mother was jane what dont do anything think of all the times youve been wrong and the damage its caused only maybe this time im not wrong jane said pocketing her phone holding the videotape inside her fleece she went out onto the upper landing and down the stairs that came out near the fire doors concealing the passage that led to hattie chancerys room she imagined alistair hardy lying in hatties bed in the dark silverskin eyes watching him from a corner of the room and then as he was close to sleep a hissing and something cold writhing all over him whoop whoop jane smirked hed probably enjoy it at least she now had an idea why ben wanted hardy in that room with hattie chancery identifying herself with ellen gethin and all that black hound in the pack stuff there could be quite a strong link here suppose lol was right and ben had managed to get more information out of leonard even if it wasnt on camera well she couldnt ask ben outright without causing a row over amber letting her watch the tape but but she could ask frank sampson whod been there holding leonards hand it was a bit late but if they were going to try and involve mum in this it was very much legit to give him a ring right then as she walked down the red staircarpet the videotape tumbled out of her fleece and went bumping down the final steps ahead of her she grabbed the box fumbled it back under her fleece firing glances around the reception area nobody about not even amber whom of course she could no longer trust either amber might be planning to walk out on ben but she was just as dependent on this crazy investment as he was she too had everything to lose and where was natalie why hadnt she come back did she know about jeremy this was a nightmare the phone started ringing behind the reception desk jane instinctively moving to answer it then stopping she stood by the desk in the shadowflecked light from the toosmall chandelier waiting to see if anyone else would respond nobody showed not even a demented old woman some years dead leaning on the ghost of a zimmer frame jane ignored the phone ran down the steps to the kitchen to put the tape back the snowglare from the high windows showed her where everything was she didnt bother to put on lights as she walked across the echoey stone flags to the island unit stretching away like a morticians slab something was on top of the unit the video camera that was supposed to be welded to her hands stuff you antony with your glasgow hardboy chic jane bent to the cupboard from which amber had pulled the videotape opened it up and slid the tape out from under her fleece stowing it on an empty shelf as she came to her feet she noticed that the light in the room was changing colour like someone had shone a torch in here she stood up backing away to the nearest wall the light didnt go out it swelled yellow and orange a reflection from somewhere igniting like a match in the lens of the camera on the island unit she looked up and saw that it was all concentrated in the nearest high window a billowing light around an intense core like a gas jet she didnt understand if this was the window facing stanner rocks then the rocks were on fire time nearly up merrily had her coat off no dog collar but the pectoral cross on display jeremy would it be all right if i were to pray with you wearing a white tshirt with holes in it he was hunched forward in the rocking chair what seemed like permanent tears hard as plastic bubbles on the edges of his eyes you dont wanner bother bout me his voice was high and gritty as if there was sharp sand in his throat he turned away and winced waste of space i am merrily put both her hands over his dont move your head if it hurts on her knees she shuffled out of his line of sight kneeling on the rag rug next to flag the sheepdog in the furnace light from the range danny and gomer had gone into the kitchen leaving her to it just her and the dog the heat was intense the dog was panting jeremys seared throat looked like roast ham in the firelight merrily closed her eyes oh god only you know why jeremy was driven to try to take his own life bring him from this suffocating place calm his emotions and his fears strengthen him give him the help he needs to couldnt go on this was trite and meaningless she was disgusted with herself and opened her eyes because she knew that he was looking at her his eyes were bluegrey and flecked with uncertainty like the skies in march jeremy she said why jane tracked ben out of the lobby into the porch shooting him as he bent to lace up his hiking boots jane what the hell are you doing she didnt reply but took care to stay well back so he couldnt snatch the sony from her again she didnt even know if the battery was still active it was the gesture that counted independent working woman with a video beth pollen came briskly through dragging on her sheepskin coat shaking out her headscarf anyone called the fire brigade now i think about it im sure i heard an explosion about twenty minutes ago its hard to tell in snow ben looked up ambers seeing to it though i cant imagine how they could get up there in these conditions i dont even understand how a fires even possible on snowcovered bare rocks i was involved with a nature trust survey some years ago beth pollen said awfully weird place the rocks retain heat apparently in thick snow strange times ben doesnt look like a threat to the hotel but you never know ill come with you if you like if you dont know the paths fairly well it can be jolly dangerous ben snapped for gods sake jane switch that thing off just obeying instructions jane didnt lower the camera there was a clear image of bens face twisted with annoyance antony says its supposed to be welded to my hands well im telling you to take the thing away and im the one whos paying you in case you jane ignored him pushing open the swing doors with her bum and backing out into the car park still recording she had on her boots and her nylon parka which was a pain because it was fairly new and still crackled when she walked doubtless getting onto the soundtrack but at least she was equipped for the conditions unlike alistair hardy and matthew who were hanging around the porch door now looking up at the smoking rocks like they were being deprived of some profound spiritual experience outside ankledeep in snow jane put the camera on pause while she took up a position about ten yards away shooting ben and beth pollen as they came out and then risking a pan up towards the sky ambered now and sparkflecked though the flames were low as if the gas jet had been turned down she had no idea what this was about but neither did ben and he was unnerved for once and that made her feel empowered jane ben was standing in the middle of the car park at the end of a channel of light from the porch he had on a black goretex jacket and a black baseball cap with a reflective yellow stripe youre staying here you understand you are not coming up there with us if i fall i promise i wont sue stanner hall if you want to keep your job and he wasnt smiling youll go back oh jane didnt move carried on shooting him it felt warmer as though the fire on the rocks had conditioned the ambient temperature speaking down the side of the camera right under the mike she said casually you sacking me ben not if you go back at once although it had stopped snowing now jane felt the night still swirling around her dark energy shifting destiny tell you what she said lets not complicate things i quit lol was leaning over ella mary leather under the anglepoise the cover of the big paperback had this warmcoloured merrie england watercolour streetscene with a drummer and a dancing woman in a white dress postit markers projected from the top edge of the book like little coloured flags part of the scene herefordshire the most rural county in england with the unknowable horrors of the great war still two years away an area still loosely held in a harness of medieval customs an eerie carnival always flickering on the periphery vaughan was a very wicked man so after his death he could not rest and came back stronger and stronger all the while he sometimes took the form of a fly in order to torment the horses finally he came into the church itself in the form of a bull it was decided that something must be done ethel strolled over the open book sat down on the lampbase and began to wash her paws ethel who used to be lols cat back when he was living in ledwardine who was now the official vicarage cat while lol was still just an occasional visitor trying to help out something must be done lol said to the cat so they got twelve parsons with twelve candles to wait in the church to try and read him down into a silver snuffbox for the old man who told me the story explained we have all got a sperrit something like a spark inside we and a sperrit can go large or small or down down quite small even into a snuffbox there were present to help lay the spirit a woman with a newborn baby whose innocence and purity were perhaps held powerful in exorcism well they read but it was no use read what something from the bible the full text of the roman catholic rite of exorcism they were all afraid and all their candles went out but one the parson as held that candle had a stout heart and he feared no man nor sperrit he called out vaughan why art thou so fierce i was fierce when i was a man but fiercer now for i am a devil was the answer but nothing could dismay the stouthearted parson though to tell the truth he was nearly blind and not a pertickler sober man the detail suggesting an actual local character but no names no dates he read and read and read and when vaughan felt himself going down and down and down till the snuffbox was nearly shut he asked vaughan where wilt thou be laid the spirit answered anywhere anywhere but not in the red sea so they shut the box and took him and buried him for a thousand years in the bottom of hergest pool in the wood with a big stone on top of him but the time is nearly up the time is nearly up lol leaned back how nearly is nearly ethel a thousand years would take the story back prenorman conquest and yet black vaughan was said to have been mortally wounded at the battle of banbury during the wars of the roses in and furthermore according to mrs leather he and his ancestors were brave and honourable men and history in no way corroborates the popular traditions concerning them still they were probably regarded with more awe and fear than love by the folk among whom they lived but a devil and when did the hound fade into the picture no suggestions of a big black dog accompanying black vaughans ghost preexorcism lol flipped to the second index sticker hergest court was or perhaps still is haunted by a demon dog said to have belonged to black vaughan said by whom lol went through to the kitchen overlaid with agathrob and into the passage to the narrow back stairs ducking his head for the low oak beam at the bottom although he was short enough just to walk underneath it he felt uncomfortable here without merrily he didnt belong and the vicarage knew it he switched on the upstairs lights and went up to the first landing crooked walls patched with old doors one of them to merrilys bedroom sleep there if im not back kissing him in front of gomer which had been reassuring but hed still come creeping up by the back stairs because he wasnt worthy and the vicarage knew only times nearly up jeremy berrows said his face was haloed by the fire like a monks face in an illuminated manuscript like a martyrs face time nearly up merrily wondered where shed heard that phrase recently jeremy let out a deep sigh as though a decision had been made for him farms on a lease see this farm i thought you owned it folk do jeremy fingered his throat me too when my dad was alive hed started to talk to her in a halfapologetic way as though ashamed at the ungraciousness of his early responses danny had rescued him from himself therefore danny was owed and danny had brought in this woman to help perhaps a concession was needed and so jeremy had conceded that the time was nearly up the lease was nearly up was his suicide attempt linked to a fear a fear hed felt unable to share even with his best friend that he was about to lose his beloved home farmers had hanged themselves for far less merrily glanced at the welsh dresser with its mugs and picture plates and a giltframed faded photo of two children a boy and a girl both fairhaired like brother and sister it looked as if little or nothing had altered in here in thirty or forty years what would jeremy do when goin quietly on was no longer an option i heard that mr dacre might have been putting it around that he has some rights to the nant jeremy shook his head just far enough for it to hurt no always reckoned it should be his on account of he owns the rest of the valley its said hes been behaving in a threatening way hiring men with guns gomer says hes scared whats he scared of hes scared of what they took on his family what was give to em the chancerys your family were tenants of the chancerys right he nodded and then evidently relieved that he could at least do this without pain that it didnt hurt to be positive he nodded again merrily wondered if gomer and danny were following this from the other side of the closed door what did the chancerys think had been given to them jeremy looked at her like do i have to go into this she thought she knew anyway a tradition roots gomer had told her how the chancerys had sought to buy into the welsh border heritage not the most stable foundation on which to build a new dynasty jeremy said dont suppose you seen natlie we came straight from ledwardine i havent been up to stanner yet her wont be there where will she be he didnt answer he looked down at his knees between which flag had wedged his head jeremy placed his hands either side of the sheepdogs head as if in benediction merrily let the silence hang for maybe half a minute before trying to catch his gaze and failing and then feeling her way back into the mystery of natalie craven people talk people like to gossip when somebody new turns up he didnt say anything theyre only curious they dont realize what damage it can cause when things get twisted around no jeremy lifted his hands and placed a palm either side of his face as if to stop his head from shaking and if your friends dont know the truth either they cant help you they cant put a stop to it no who exactly is she jeremy jeremy shifted to grip the dogs fur the silence from the other side of the door was like a balloon blown up to bursting point hers my landlord jeremy said the door handle rattled slightly as if somebody had just let go of it she owns the nant natalie he nodded her names not natlie dint use to be so that would make her paulas daughter brigid paula inherited the nant from her mother hattie jeremy nodded so is paula dead now aye long time so natalie came back to claim her inheritance and mabbe find out some things merrily thought of what gomer and jane had both said about jeremy and natalie such an illmatched couple perhaps they werent a couple at all was one of them a kind of lodger paula jeremy looked at merrily not many folks know this but paula was sick see her growed up sick in the head when hattie and robert died her was still young eight or nine and margery was only three things wasnt too good between the kids so hatties uncle who come down to sort things out he decided it was best if how do you mean things werent good oh well they reckoned paula was always jealous of margery and when they well there was a bit of an incident when i think paula tried to drown her in the bath one time they was only little god well see robert had a sister up north and they took her in they had to sell stanner on account of the debts so paula got the only house left which was the nant as was rented then to my ole man paula had the rent in trust but paula her wasnt right got took into homes early on they figured her wasnt safe set fire to the house once oh this did not sound good margery the dacres adopted her and she got left a couple hundred acres of land and some money and her growed up and married the dacre boy richard keepin it all in the family kind of thing these things happened and they had sebbie ten year before paula was even married even though paula was five years older met a feller in hospital male nurse paula was real goodlookin he fell in love i spose ventually he convinces the authorities to let her out short stretches at first and he looked after her and there was no problems then paula was discharged and they got wed herd be well into her thirties by then but her wasnt right see should neverve been let out they reckoned she had a baby then died brigid growed up with her dad theyd come yere on holiday on the quiet never wanted nobody to know about paula how shed turned out one stage see they offered to sell the nant to my ole man but he didnt have the money nowhere near so they negotiated another lease for twentyfive years so like both sides agreed it be better if they let it get round theyd sold us the farm keep richard and sebbie off dads back but now you think sebbie perhaps knows the truth jeremy looked at merrily at last its possible deal was done at the time through big weale the solicitor in kington and when he when he died sudden leavin his whole business in a big tangle this other firm come in to sort it all out course sebbies a magistrate knows all the lawyers for miles around things gets mislaid documents cant always trust lawyers can you and the lease lease is nearly up dacre thinks he has a chance of getting you out and buying the nant cant say what he thinks dacres in a funny state things he done lately ent been that rational this from a man whod just tried to hang himself but merrilys understanding of that was hardening up in the light of what she was learning about jeremys weakening grip on everything he held dear so the future she didnt know how to put it no jeremy shook his head so hard that merrily winced it ent about that the agony of it made his eyes water and come out like marbles ent about money nor ground i love the nant course i do every square inch of it only merrily looked up at him her knees were starting to ache when we was kids see twelve thirteen her come to stay with her dad they had a posh caravan me and her we like we got fond wrote to each other for years all them years im dreaming mabbe mabbe herll come back and praying i spose prayed a lot truth be told prayers shed come back and then she did come back twentyfive years later aye all that time things happened see in her life merrily reached out and took one of his hands squeezed it gently i seen the van parked where they used to put the caravan i was scared i seen clancy at first in the lower field in the early morning it was like seein brigid like herd come back near enough the same as when i last seen her i was scared couldnt go there i called up danny and he come down then we seen this woman and her hair was dark thought it wasnt her after all see and then tears rolled down jeremys face tears coming without any change of expression like a crying dolls merrily thought but she stayed she moved in with her daughter she put her daughter into a local school got a job at the hotel the house her family used to own there were big gaps in this story big issues that he wasnt telling her about she thought about the note that danny had shown her when she arrived jeremys prosaic farmers farewell please deal with the sale of my stock and see they go to the right kind of place or keep everything yourself for nothing natalie will understand he couldve took the farm jeremy said took the nant took the lot dacre merrily thought of what gomer had said mary morson mabbe her rung to break the news to him as he wasnt the only fish in natalies stream other fish worstcase scenario she looked over to the photo on the dresser two lighthaired children in tshirts and shorts screwing up their eyes against the sun standing side by side not touching the girl even then a bit taller than the boy she thought in dismay dacre dacre and his cousin in the back of a camper van on the top of stanner rocks couldve had the lot if hed left her jeremy looked away back into the fire the butchers counter jane stayed where she was no backing off now ben took an impulsive step towards her and then abruptly turned away and caught up with beth pollen at the little gate at the bottom of the car park he threw open the gate and followed mrs pollen into the darkness of the clearing beyond the place where hed pulped nathan the shooter bastard jane stood for a moment feeling the cold on her face like a contemptuous slap and then breathing hard she followed them i quit that simple perhaps part of her had known this was coming was unavoidable after what amber had told her about the good friction point the proposed use of mum as a twist twist hook contemporary dynamic she didnt have to listen to this bullshit any more and if he wanted some now drama he could have it she was almost at the gate when she became aware of him standing just on the other side by the fence post where nathan had lain he was alone beth pollen must have gone on a little way jane could see a torch beam bobbing she stopped keeping some space between her and ben clasping the camera to her chest maybe shed have to hit him with it jane if he was speaking quietly that was probably only because he didnt want beth pollen to hear jane whatever you just said lets pretend either you didnt say it or i didnt hear it and while i said i qu ben raised a hand while i realize you were the first one to spot the flames i have to stress that i know this track and how dangerous it can be also i think i can smell petrol so obviously someone started that fire all i want to do is make sure nobodys in any danger you think someones up there youre not going to be missing anything its irrelevant its probably kids so whys it ok for mrs pollen to go up shes not going up shes making sure i take the right path and waiting at the bottom of it with the mobile phone i wouldnt trust you to wait anywhere i think you know what this is about dont you jane said i think you know whats happening up there dont try to be clever jane why the rocks are on fire and dont she could almost see his patience snap like a frozen twig in the air above his head dont mess with me all right or what youll beat she almost felt him go rigid knew shed gone too far but it was too late to stop now and arent we in the perfect place for it where you worked nathan over where hattie chancery smashed her husbands head in with the trophy stones she heard the squeaking of his leather gloves as his fists tightened and she felt a tug of fear remembering the state of nathan she looked around for beth pollens torch no sign now she was backing up against the gate and feeling behind her for the fastener jiggling it urgently when ben moved she bit off a scream but all he did was turn without a word and walk off again only faster this time halfjogging his hiking boots going phwat phwat phwat in the tight fresh snow by the time jane was through the wicket gate hed disappeared into the pines she knew that she ought to get out of there go back to the hotel but it wasnt in her to back down not tonight she found his tracks and followed them the independent unemployed woman on the border the moment lol entered merrilys bedroom the phone beside the bed began to shrill and he felt momentarily guilty as though someone had discovered him prying snowlight greywashed the room he glanced quickly back at the door impelled to go rushing out of it and down the stairs to take the call in the office instead he switched on the bedside lamp the bed was turned down there was a nightdress case like a black and white cat curled up on one of the pillows a white towelling bathrobe hung behind the door a cross of dark wood was positioned in the centre of the wall opposite the bed the caller had a voice like a rich organic mulch im phoning for mrs watkins i do realize its late shes out lol sat on the edge of the bed im sorry guess id be sorry too i was in her house and she wasnt the caller chuckled well now you must be the musician who would like to spend more time with the lovely merrilee but the situation alas forbids it a concise name that rolls off the lon canon jeavons lol said but you should call me lew we just two guys with short names you think we shorten our names in the belief it gonna streamline our lives ah wait lol not lon its lol correct you know i sometimes wonder if i reverted to all three syllables of my own given name whether perhaps it would slow me down enough that i didnt give halfassed advice lol looked around merrilys bedroom its white walls were uneven bolted together with twisted ribs of ancient oak it had a pine wardrobe no dressing table no mirrors you mean like reach out he said embrace good canon jeavons said she talks to you yes i guess thats what i mean on reflection what i shouldve said was be reticent go careful that would be a slightly different approach wouldnt it that would be exactly the opposite approach lol said in between the wardrobe and the window the bedside light was reflected from polished wood and he spotted his oldest washburn guitar the one hed left here at the end of the summer when he was working on the final songs for the new album lol canon jeavons said you dont have to tell me where shes gone but you could reassure me its nowhere in connection with a small boy who died in a car wreck lol saw that the washburn was shining with new polish and had been stood reverently on a cushion the cushion was pale blue velvet he was touched no it isnt anything to do with that he said thank you jeavons said solemnly can i ask are you a religious man yourself lol no forget that intrusive only when i said on reflection i mean that this phone call came out of prayer which i concede the secular might define as a conversation with the inner self in the hope of inspiration in any event i sit down and we going over it all between us and the message comes to me better to tell her to take advice before proceeding any further in this matter she did take advice lol said she took advice from you a pause yes jeavons said heavily however let me get this right god suggested you might call back because he wasnt impressed with the advice you gave lol she told you about the brother the bad guy jeavons sighed yes the ah acts of violence carried out by the brother against the other half of the family that did not bode well six years in new york and i didnt pick up on that must be getting old as it happens lol said what we now know of him makes him seem even less of a teddy bear im sorry to hear that it jeavons hesitated must be hard for you lol it can get a bit perplexing i like a man who understates come on it blows your head off for instance where is she now on this terrible night lol watched the light shimmer from the guitar recalling the last song hed composed on it and its key lines the camera liesshe might vaporize well he said i hope shes having a quiet onetoone with a mildmannered farmer who tried to take his own life i hope she not standing in for twelve priests at the exorcism of a medieval devil and a hound of hell a stony place quilted with snow the path was here somewhere but jane couldnt find it shed gone blundering after ben into the white areas between the trees looking for his tracks until she wound up panting at the fork in the main drive this was where one track sloped down to the kington bypass while the other much narrower crawled to the top of stanner rocks shed been up there just once when the weather was still ok great views the track wasnt too steep and you could get a vehicle up when the ground was firm but it went very close to the edge where the old quarry had been and you wouldnt be happy doing it at night not even in the best of conditions not even with somebody like gomer parry at the wheel she saw the stems of the pines lighting up maybe fifty yards ahead of her like organ pipes ben switching on a torch only it seemed to be in the wrong place too low so easy to get disorientated in the white hell she headed for the beam anyway and aaah a thin branch whipped her cheek pulled the camera away and she stumbled and the camera fell into the snow not too clever she snatched up the sony and dusted it off moved on more slowly holding it in both hands now she could neither see nor hear ben or beth pollen and the torch beam had vanished and if it wasnt for the snow and a lemonwedge of moon she could be in trouble here jane stopped realizing in dismay that this actually wasnt being very adult being adult was about standing back and rethinking your position in the light of changing circumstances like circumstances were saying that ben foley didnt want her here basically she guessed because he didnt want any of this preserved on video taking on ben getting into his face was probably unwise but once you were launched on the path of being awkward it was a matter of basic pride that you didnt turn away it was like when you were a little kid running faster and faster giddy with it knowing that the fall was inevitable jane stubbed her toe on something very hard and stumbled and went down with her hands in the snow throwing up a fine flurry like a cloud of frozen midges as she pulled them out with a sucking sound looking up she saw in a moment of cold awe the whitespattered face of stanner rocks sheared off where the quarrying had been before the rocks were recognized as ancient and precious the wall was glowering over her like a decaying cathedral holes in its masonry pointed with snow no flames up there now no amber halo only the milky mixture of snowlight and thin moonlight and on the ground that wet sucking sound only the sucking was nothing to do with her the shock of this came at jane like a sudden wild gust from nowhere as she crouched exposed in the snow it came at her along with something else something close up loping something that came with a loose heavy panting with a pulsing of muscle and with a piercingly thin raw feral smell that ripped at your senses like barbed wire jane tightened up shrinking into a hedgehog ball somewhere far inside her beneath the parka and the fleece beneath the skin there was a rolling orb of cold that felt no bigger than a pea and no smaller than a planet coming to rest in her stomach and weighting her to the rock and although she couldnt seem to move she could still scream with no shame like an animal and cower biting down on a second scream also agonizingly on her tongue as the ground lit up around her for goodness sake a gloved hand came out of the light whats the matter with you oh god jane was shaking kept falling back down are you hurt beth pollen was bulked out by the sheepskin coat throwing off some wholesome matronly perfume her voice mature and strong and unafraid didnt you hear it i certainly heard you didnt you feel it i really dont know how your mother puts up with you beth pollen said crossly jane stood up careful to stay within the torch beam aware of holding on to mrs pollens tough sheepskin sleeve and not under any circumstances wanting to let go whereth the tip of her tongue swelling where shed bitten it wheres ben gone down to the main road to wait for the fire brigade in the end he didnt need to go all the way up the track to see what had happened it was pretty obvious what was it was that old camper van used by all kinds of people for all kinds of purposes some idiot had contrived to set it alight and the petrol tank blew up ben doesnt think anybody was in there but if they were come on we may as well go and join him theres nothing we can do here no jane its very cold and im you didnt hear it then beth pollen peered at her what are we talking about jane was holding on to mrs pollens arm with both hands just couldnt seem to let go the torch beam was dragged away over the uneven ground they were on the floor of what had been a quarry between the snowbound bypass and the sheerest face of stanner rocks going up maybe a hundred feet then some more in jagged stages before the summit sloped back into the forestry behind there was a distant warbling fire engines the real world jane sagged relieved for maybe the first time in her life to be slipping back into a place where the arrival of fire engines could make everything all right she let go of beth pollens arm it occurred to her that this was the first time she and this woman had been alone together onetoone on every other occasion others had been there ben or the white company of whom mrs pollen was the most normal you know my mother i know of your mother mrs pollen said only amber said you might want to talk to her did she before you whats that jane grabbed at mrs pollens arm again it sounds like the fire brigade at last thank god what is the matter with you no steering the torch towards the rocks that pointing to an area about ten yards away an area of white but a different kind of white the splodgy pinkspattered white of the butchers counter you really are a tiresome girl beth pollen said and then she said oh my god oh my god part four then as it would seem he became as one that hath a devil for rushing down the stairs into the dining hall he sprang upon the great table and he cried aloud before all the company that he would that very night render his body and soul to the powers of evil if he might but overtake the wench from the baskerville manuscript sir arthur conan doyle the hound of the baskervilles fresh blood she hardly recognized the place it was like some unfinished centre for asylum seekers cavernous and hollow echoing with alienation and confusion displaced people wandering around clusters of coppers in uniform and crimescene technos in coveralls like flimsy snowsuits merrily saw ben foley standing near the foot of the baronial stairs with a youngish guy in blackframed glasses and an older man in a suit foley had his hands behind his back hair swept back from his long face lips compressed he looked defiant which suggested that he was deeply worried amber foley came past with a tray of coffees her hair white under the chandelier lovely a policeman taking the tray amber didnt notice merrily amber was keeping busy but when the copper carried the tray away merrily spotted jane there was this lopsided christmas tree with wan white lights and the kid was standing next to it a video camera dangling from a strap around her neck as though this was all she possessed she looked like some stranded backpacker whose passport had been stolen on her first trip abroad merrily was about to go to her when ds mumford faded up like the house detective in some drab old film noir mrs watkins howre you bewildered andy if mumford was here it suggested bliss was running the event therefore care was needed remarkable how quick you made it considering the conditions gomers good at snow and im afraid you take risks when youre worried gomer eh he heard about it from danny thomas word travels fast in the radnor valley so i thought that with janes involvement id better no need at all to tell mumford that jane had managed to ring lol and lol had phoned her at the nant which would have meant explaining how she and gomer had come to be at the nant and like jeremy berrows didnt have enough problems there had been fire engines and police land rovers at the rocks when theyd got here warblers and blue beacons in the snow the son et lumière of violent death gomer had dropped her by the porch gone to park the truck andy i think id better have a word with jane well the boss has just sent for her mumford said he might be amenable to you going in seventeen now isnt that right the last legal umbilical slashed jane was old enough to be questioned by the police without a responsible adult in attendance merrily saw that the kids hair was pushed back behind her ears like it had lost the ribbon as usual in these extreme situations she looked about nine the door marked lounge opened now and a woman came out late fifties wellmanaged white hair sheepskin coat thank you mrs pollen frannie bliss was holding the door for her we may need you again sleeping here tonight ill be here inspector but i cant see any of us getting much sleep can you bliss looked almost sympathetic for a moment then he spied jane and then merrily about fifteen feet away his small teeth glittered through the freckles where most police put on a severe front in the face of serious crime bliss rarely attempted to disguise extreme glee little jane watkins and her mum valiantly battling through the snow in the old volvo gomers truck in fact merrily said clasping jane mum janes lips against her ear did lol gomer bliss grinned like a young dogfox casing a chicken run of course and me thinking god had parted the snowdrifts for you like the red sea a miracle in itself gomer parry plant hire hell do anything for you wont he merrily come through bliss stepped aside holding the lounge door wide its not the ritz but hey you can handle hardship the poor durexsuits are out playing in the snow they may be away some time as someone once said dr grace the home office pathologist is with them moaning pitifully what a night eh merrily followed jane into the lounge i do like this room bliss said dont you its like ive called you all together here in the drawing room whos that old bugger over the fireplace sir arthur conan doyle jane said tonelessly ben uses this room for his mystery weekends pretty much like you just said perceptive of me jane a single fat log smouldered on a bed of ash in the grate below the bluetinted blowup of the great mans face maybe it was the same picture as the one on the white companys web site doyle in middle age his eyes fixed on something the photographer couldnt see mr foley kindly agreed to us having this as our incident room for tonight anyway well see hes recompensed were very good about things like that its bloody cold mind bliss went to peer at the fire he was wearing an old blue fleece jacket over jeans the central heating will have gone off by now jane said they werent expecting so many late guests she nodded at the fire all bens logs are still green he doesnt know anything about woodburning its softwood nicked out of the forestry bliss glanced back at jane in curiosity the kids face was expressionlesstosullen the boss no longer a hero then bliss grabbed a poker battering the solitary log in search of heat under there and merrily took the opportunity to whisper in janes ear i came directly from home ok the kid nodded briefly maybe brightening a little possibly even grateful at being gathered into her mums confidence lol had briefly explained about the video camera the proposed documentary go easy on her eh what would you have done at that age you know merrily bliss stood with his hands on his hips i realize youre peripheral to all this that this is janes show but when youre present i always know that other angles i mightve found a trifle shall we say puzzling will be covered mrs elizabeth pollen for instance now what on earth would that be about mrs pollens a member of the white company jane said merrily said i dont know mrs pollen personally but the white company seems to be a spiritualist group set up to continue the efforts of arthur conan doyle to prove theres life after death thank you do we need proof merrily you and me bliss rubbed his hands together kindling energy and moved over to a mahogany writing table set up in the bay window it had an unlit reprovictorian oil lamp on it with a green shade there was a hard chair either side of the table no he said were mates lets go and sit by the fire statement later jane just a cosy chat for now you know me they sat down mother and daughter on a sofa and merrily who did know bliss too well became wary because bliss didnt do cosy all she knew was that thered been a fire up on the rocks and then a body found below found by jane this was the problem merrily felt a draught on her ankles she was still wearing janes duffel coat her fingers enfolded in the white woolly hat on her knees through the window she could see someone trudging across the sludgy car park towards the porch gomer back from learning what he could from some cop or a fireman there was always somebody around who gomer had known for years so bliss said what were you doing at the bottom of stanner rocks on a night like this jane jane shrugged we saw a fire on the rocks i saw a fire from the kitchen ben and mrs pollen went to check it out why you because jane sighed because i was helping them to shoot a video about stanner hall and stuff it looked kind of dramatic and i had the camera with me merrily watched jane the kid had the camera on her lap she was more subdued than merrily had ever seen her in the presence of bliss who on other occasions had brought out the worst in her merrily sensed a weight of suppressed evidence bliss put his head on one side and did you get some nice piccies jane not really the fire was more or less out by the time we got there because of the snow i suppose right then tell me how you found what you found well like i got kind of separated from ben and mrs pollen like you stop to get a good shot of the skyline and stuff and when youve finished theyve gone and then i saw a torch beam and that turned out to be mrs pollen well she found me i like i hadnt got a torch and i fell in the snow and i suppose she heard me and nobody else about er no not as far as i know how long were you separated only a few minutes and where was mr foley hed like mrs pollen said hed gone partway up the path towards the van and saw it was burning out and nobody seemed to be in there so he just went down to the road to wait for the fire brigade wouldve been easy for them to miss the turning especially with all the snow so just you and mrs pollen she mustve told you all this just you and mrs pollen you saw nobody else no ok bliss leaned back i realize this is distressing jane but what exactly did you see jane swallowed it was like halfburied in the snow there was a lot of blood and it was she looked up towards the cracked cornice around the ceiling bits seemed to have been torn away bits of jane shuddered face and like tissue strewn about merrily put a hand on janes arm how long had it been there frannie foxes bliss said we figured foxes had been at it or badgers doesnt take them long sometimes specially on a night like this if theres fresh blood do you know who it was yet bliss stretched his arms well as it happened i couldve identified him meself except even i wasnt entirely sure because as jane says it was all a bit messy he leaned forward hands on his knees looked at jane and then at merrily reason i knew him is id had to give evidence a couple of times when he was on the bench oh jesus bliss paused hed be wanting to see if either of them knew the name merrily said nothing jane blew it of course dacre sebbie three farms as hes known bliss said he leaned back again beaming at jane so where have you come across him not in court obviously gomer merrily said quickly gomer bliss beamed what a useful little feller he is however i dont suppose mr dacre was actually killed by foxes avenging all their relatives merrily said wanting a cigarette did he fall from the rocks or what he almost certainly did but whether it was accidental is open to debate would a local man aware of the dangers go for a stroll along stanner rocks in these conditions if he was contemplating suicide death would be far from a foregone conclusion its not all that high is it maybe he went up to see what the fire was jane said its a thought jane or did he start the fire or did he catch someone else starting the fire bliss stretched his arms luxuriously above his head yawning pleasurably its a complete mystery isnt it girls i do love a mystery except that he didnt there was nothing in merrilys experience that real detectives hated more than a complete mystery which meant that bliss knew what he was looking for and that it was only a matter of time on the village square the christmas tree lights had gone out and the security lamps outside the black swan were fogged and feeble like the hopeless eyes of someone bound up tight in white bandage standing by the landing window lol felt helpless he was stranded canon jeavons had been most disturbed to hear janes theory about merrily and the vaughan exorcism a dangerously unpredictable situation give him some time to investigate this think things out and hed be back in the meantime jane had called again the police are here now blue lights i can see the blue lights out of the window or maybe more firemen im up in my room ive been sick again i just ran straight up here to be sick in the toilet plus i didnt want to talk to any of them i dont trust any of them i want out of here when you talk to mum just tell her tell her i want to go home the phones went off in stereo from upstairs and downstairs bleeps and bells all over the vicarage like the phones were crying out to each other lol ran down the stairs through the hall plucking the cordless from the kitchen wall hope im in time son lew jeavons said you wanna make some notes hold on lol moved to the scullery door shouldered it open ill go in the office the scullery was lit solely by the orange bars of the electric fire he moved to the desk the lemon sleeplight on the computer was swelling like something medical he found a pen sat down sprang up again oh you ok lol yes i could i call you back sure right through the window lol could see the snowslumped apple trees and the flattened face of dexter harris his jugspout lower lip squashed up against the glass give me ten minutes first snow casualty when jane realized how close she was to losing it she backed away into the corner of the bedroom farthest from the window mum he couldnt hes gentle hes entirely harmless hes the only farmer round here doesnt even have a shotgun look i dont want it to be the truth either mum was sitting on the side of the bed her face as grey as death the two of them up here with the lights out exchanging information like spies jane thought inside an enemy fortress what shed learned had at first just blown her away the revelation that natalie was the daughter of hattie chancerys child natalie craven was hattie chancerys granddaughter that she was sebbie dacres cousin jeremys landlord and that she was in fact called brigid so it looks like shes still doing it they cant stop its a physical need howard i have been dreaming about her for about years she still makes me swet gavin the implications would connect at intervals in a disjointed kind of way and jane would hug herself the nylon parka crackling electrically we should go home we know too much meaning she didnt want to learn any more not tonight couldnt handle it but mum didnt want to go home you could sense it in the way she was sitting the duffel coat untoggled hands on her thighs resisting cigarettes only because it was such a small room and jane was in it too and this was no night for opening the window in some ways mum in the middle of something was no better than bliss avoiding the foleys jane had brought her up two flights of stairs along underlit passages to this poky fridge not imagining that things were going to get worse youre a priest you dont have to tell bliss anything its like the sanctity of the confessional they cant make you not even in a court of law i dont actually think that applies in this situation anyway thats not the point god its freezing in here jane has it always been like this they cant afford luxury accommodation for the servants theyd been talking about the camper van the one that nat and clancy had arrived in like gypsies the van in which according to mum nat was said to have been seen with a man at first jane had refused to believe it stood to reason that when someone as goodlooking as nat arrived in a place like this women would resent her on sight when she had the brass nerve to hook up with an unmarried local farmer the gossip machine would be whitehot and all gossip machines manufactured disinformation im sorry mum said irritably i wish i didnt even have to think about any of this hes been in love with her for most of his life even i could see that be nice to think love never had any negative side effects he wouldnt jane pressed herself into the corner in despair i dont know him well but i know he wouldnt he couldnt clancy says he wont even send stock to market because they have to suffer in pens so they go direct to the slaughterhouse hes an honourable farmer he actually cares about living things he tried to hang himself that doesnt prove anything it poses questions mum stood up and went to the window a row of whitecapped conifers stood like a primitive roodscreen between the hotel grounds and the long pale altar of hergest ridge and the other one is wheres your friend natalie jane said the last time i saw her she was telling ben she had to take clancy to a neighbours because the track to the nant was blocked which it obviously isnt so jane felt sick somebody was lying we know she took her to danny thomass but where did she go then all i know is she didnt come back here if she went to meet someone at the van dacre youre saying she was having sex with her cousin right im not saying anything flower except that jeremy and dacre are not exactly mates and if jeremy happened to catch dacre at the van with natalie then you dont know what might happen but she knows right and thats why shes keeping out of the way jane felt her brain flailing around a lot of people hated dacre so it seems ok listen suppose shes having a thing with ben dont look like that amber thinks it could be happening she was like she said to me the other night kind of throwaway that ben would that hed be better off married to natalie maybe seeing if she got a reaction seeing if i knew jane if ben and nat did have something on the go they couldnt very well do it in the hotel could they and ben was so anxious to be first on the scene of the fire without me there without video suppose hed started it why would if i hadnt been in the kitchen at the right time nobody wouldve spotted that fire so like no wonder he was mad at me no wonder he wanted to get up there to make sure it was fully destroyed because dna whoever was with nat theyd have left dna all over the van wouldnt they doesnt fire destroy dna like at gomers depot and ben killed dacre as well did he he nearly killed dacres shooter there was suddenly a hard sensation in the pit of janes stomach it felt like certainty mums fingers were squeezing her knees we should stop speculating how do we do that take sedatives like nat was even telling me she wouldnt be surprised if amber walked out on ben when earlier tonight she wanted amber to walk out didnt she its blindingly obvious and also when antony antony largo the tv guy was eyeing up nat ben was very quick to warn him off hes like keep your filthy paws off my housemanager shes in a relationship well yeah smoothie ben and foxy nat you gonna tell bliss or shall i i dont think either of us needs to tell bliss anything i think he knows something already hes too confident hes always like that in front of you maybe i think we should wait to see what happens before interfering mum sat for a while on the edge of the bed rocking backwards and forwards wouldnt mind another chat with jeremy though thats your way of not interfering he talked to me before he was still talking to me when lol rang gomer and i said wed come back and tell him what had happened she stood up at least youll be safe here with half of hereford cid on the premises just dont dont be alone with ben foley or anyone else for that matter am i stupid dont tempt me mum wrapped her scarf around her neck mum mmm youd better see this jane dug the brigid document from her jeans opened it out and tossed it on the bed they found gomer in his truck on the edge of the car park he jumped down a halfinch of glowing ciggy slotted into his front teeth like a red jewel he extracted it cops brought out the base of a paraffin lamp vicar likely the oil was used to start the fire somebody emptied it over some bedding whateverd burn easy made a pile of it set it alight buggered off somebody opened both doors of the hotel porch and yellow light splashed out into the slush nothing left merrily said a man in white leggings came out of the porch carrying a bulky leather holdall and got into a police range rover with orange traffic markings not much at all vicar only sebbie and he ent sayin a lot who did you get this from les thomas dannys cousin one o the parttime fire boys les also says gomer lowered his voice says the cops is runnin this big search for natalie craven on what basis merrily asked mrs watkins none of them had noticed sergeant mumford coming over he moved quietly for a fat slob boss can see you now mumford glanced at jane on your own lol had found deep footprints across the snowy lawn two sets of them one coming one going dexter harris had come in through the old gate from the orchard walked across to the lighted scullery window peered in and then returned the same way before lol could get round there maybe the sight of lol through the window had been a disappointment if hed seen merrily here alone would he have come to the door it was a disturbing thought and something even more disturbing occurred to lol when he was back behind the computer how sure was he that it had in fact been dexter hadnt got a very good look at him in the kitchen earlier suppose this had been the other one darrin the bad guy how alike the cousins were in appearance he had no idea but he knew they were about the same age the lower lip might have been exaggerated by being pressed against a wet window what must it be like here for merrily now that jane was away at weekends for a house right at the heart of the village it was surprising how isolated the vicarage seemed in conditions like these something must be done nothing however he could do tonight lol sat down and rang canon jeavons back the lounge door was halfopen and she could hear bliss on the phone he sounded irritated yes i will i already had ill ask her now when he brought merrily in they sat this time at the table near the window either side of the unlit victorian oil lamp the ice maidens been called in bliss said perfect night eh annie howe is she coming here god forbid no shes on another one this er this is something and nothing merrily but you might be able to help us i heard you were looking quite seriously for natalie craven merrily said and where did you hear that she works here frannie where else would i hear it and she seems to be missing yes she is and youre looking for her yes we are and her daughter would he know about clancy being at danny thomass her too bliss said and the van that was set on fire was originally natalies i believe yes it was you dont want to talk about this do you no i dont unless you can tell me where she is no i cant however i do get the feeling that you know a lot more about her than youre saying he leaned back oh like that her real names not natalie craven and what would her name be merrily brigid she could tell by the absence of reaction that bliss was very surprised you want to tell me about it she said you little bugger bliss said who else knows who else knows what right merrily bliss said well deal with this but first lets get the other matter out of the way before annie howe arose from her coffin id already heard from melvyn at headquarters the custody sergeant feller i consulted about your friend forgotten the buggers name now dexter harris dexter and his cousin darrin not harris hook darrin hook thats right dead bliss said what fullbeam headlights blasted the window an engine was revving on the car park first snow casualty of the night run over by a van where ah bliss said as mumford came in dr grace boss would like to see you send him in excuse me a minute would you merrily been waiting for this merrily was half out of her chair when mumford said on site boss bugger bliss stood up all right tell him ill be there in five mins he nodded at the lights outside the window for me when youre ready merrily put herself between bliss and the door what is this frannie what happened to darrin hook look merrily ive just gorra can you all right do you want to come with me we can talk on the way well ok she stepped back and pulling on her coat followed him out into the lobby where he was stopped by a lanky detective in red goretex this bloke berrows boss youve talked to him not happy about him at all let us go through the house no problem but hed got another guy there with him thomas old hippy type said he was on allnight snowclearing said hed been clearing berrowss track tractor outside fair enough but something didnt feel right wouldve liked to bring him in really not yet not while theres a chance she might come home you sure you checked all the buildings im satisfied shes not there boss but mal and ewan are watching the entrance in case as long as the bastards dont fall asleep they fall asleep in this boss theyll never wake up theyll certainly wish they hadnt bliss said come along merrily outside new snow was falling in a careless disdainful way like the contents of gods shredder the back door of a police range rover was hanging open after you bliss said she didnt move both boots in a cake of brown slush what happened to darrin hook all right he sighed whats more interesting is where it happened he was found on the a hereford to abergavenny road halfway down the hill towards allensmore he glanced at her yes im sorry the proximity of a bus shelter leads melvyn to think we may be looking at the exact spot where darrins little brother died you coming the schizoid border the lights flickered again the third time and there was a crackle on the phone in this area it was always the same with sudden heavy snow or any kind of extreme weather including heat the power lines and the phone lines were badly maintained compared with the cities and at some point they would go down and the centuries would drop away black shuck skriker barguest trash canon jeavons said it was like an incantation regional names for the phantom black dog lol guessed you dealing with archetypes heavy tribal stuff the twelve priests the snuffbox and of course the black dog the black dog is known all over these islands and hes linked strongly to the landscape hes out there the lights dipped again the reduced wattage reducing colours giving the scullery the appearance of an engraving static cackled in the phone lol looked across at the window convinced that he could still see the smeary impression of a mans face on the glass he was recalling nick drakes song blackeyed dog about the personalized depression at the door that had haunted him to death lets talk about the black dog jeavons said what is he the shadow of fate and why a dog because a dog follows you haw correct the black dog that follows a family through the generations and is always out there nick drake had sung of the blackeyed dog that knew his name only this ones described as demonic lol said a word open to many interpretations i would say they are representative of a layer of existence that it would be unwise to trust i believe these images exist i believe we should accept that but never attempt to relate to them for there can be no productive relationship unless youre interested in knowing about the imminence of death lol said bliss said to merrily you dont have to look sebbie dacres body was in a canvas shelter isolated on an island of white in a choppy sea of slush there was industrial noise industrial light and exhaust fumes coming from three sides nothing was silent except for sebbie dacre in his shelter and the ruched and fissured rock face behind it feathered and tufted with fresh snow and she did have to look because jane had because jane had been the first after the foxes and the badgers to discover this she had to know what jane had seen two arc lights lit the area powered by a small chattering generator bliss lifted the canvas flap dont throw up here the dead mans head sat on the corded collar of a withered old barbour his face upturned to the ceiling of the shelter was like the inside of a sliced tomato the canvas also covered an ugly archipelago of blotchy things in the snow enough she turned away bliss let the flap fall from the second ring of tape up to the hedge its all but useless one of the durex suits said obviously the fire brigade didnt help trampling all over the perimeter dragging bloody hoses that whole area up to the hedge thats a complete writeoff youll get there jacko bliss turned to merrily this is jacko the soco he just likes saying that jacko said francis ive sent the first set of stills and the video down to the hotel you have got a laptop over there hey up here he is a man with a beard came over scraping back the hood of his coverall francis you little turd had a glorious long weekend planned starting with me and my nursie tucked up by the fire with balloon glasses of remy and a dvd of the blair witch project its a letdown billy bliss said you were spared a lot of disappointment go on surprise me give me a time of death to within two weeks the pathologist unzipped his coverall and pulled out a mars bar blood sugar comes first this time of night matey merrily slid into the shadows it was how they handled it almost everything that didnt involve young children like wartime she supposed frannie bliss and dr grace lived in a permanent war zone littered with hard jokes and mars wrappers there would be a similar scene at allensmore if more subdued it was a big van carrying carpets bliss had said that ran over darrin hook the driver said he hadnt seen him which was understandable as darrin was already lying in the road amidst a lot of snow his head two feet from the central white lines in these conditions with all the warnings and diversions traffic was sparse even on a main road darrin had been sharing a rented flat with another bloke in a big former hotel near wormelow a few miles from where he was found dead he might have been walking home or attempting to hitchhike there had been a halfempty bottle of scotch in darrins jacket pocket and the body smelled strongly of alcohol merrily he was a scrote bliss had said in the range rover a toerag a hopeless case he got pissed and disorientated he fell into the road fellers like that it happens to them all too frequently at exactly the same spot his brother died life merrily is full of accidental irony he killed himself didnt he he drank a lot of whisky and then he lay down in the road and waited for a lorry at exactly the same spot as he doesnt seem to have left a note we may never know but hed been known to us for many years and appeared to have had connections with what we grandly refer to as the hereford drug trade so the ice maidens looking at this more closely and wondering if you might know of any reason why darrin might have been the victim of an intentional hitandrun on the basis that the carpetvan driver was not the first to squash his innards thats the trouble with melvyn on a long night in the custody suite hell talk to strange women shes ruling out suicide your theorys unlikely to have occurred to her perhaps you should talk to her sorry about that on the edge of the disused quarry merrily turned her face up to the spattering sky darrin hook was dead and the location of his death linked it firmly to another death seventeen years ago and the chances were that darrin whatever kind of human detritus hed been would still be alive if some meddling priest had not suggested digging the whole thing up again by holding a requiem eucharist for roland hook in a get this an attempt to cure his cousin dexters asthma healing and deliverance a creeping neomedieval madness inside the collapsing ruins of the church of england she was feeling almost sick with selfdisgust she wondered if alice knew yet give me that again bliss said to the pathologist im not saying its a fact dr grace told him im saying its worth looking at wont know a thing for certain till i get this chap back to the slab but its probable right its possible grace looked up at the face of stanner rocks its a substantial drop but its not exactly beachy head is it and he did fall into thickish snow now and i believe one of your more athletic people has some of this on video from the top of the rocks there were signs of disturbance as if our friend tried desperately to clutch at outcrops and projections on his way down which would have slowed his descent considerably therefore bottom line broken bones likely death far from inevitable could be he was awfully unlucky and his bonce bounced off a sharp rock at the bottom youll have a better idea of that when we move him and they can have a good sift around but it very well may not be extensive facial injuries even allowing for scavengers thats as far im prepared to go the alternative being that he was clobbered before he fell thats what youre saying im not saying but bear it in mind oh i will i will bliss was already heading for the range rover lifting a hand to the pathologist nightynight billy do a good one merrily was ringing alice meek on her mobile and not getting an answer it seemed to be some kind of guilt trip jeavons seemed to think that having given merrily some hasty and unreliable advice on the harrishook issue he had ground to make up hed been researching intensively in his library and on the internet like it had become his responsibility to dispense wisdom on the stanner case details of which hed gathered greedily from lol family history tribal traditions race memories curses jeavonss primary area of operation now he was retired he said it gave him a buzz to work all night does the black dog ever kill sheep lol asked conan doyle had his hound ripping a mans throat out seems unlikely doesnt it if the black dog is just a walking portent and yet livestock are often known to have been attacked in areas supposed to be haunted by them we may wonder if living canines from foxes to domestic dogs might in some way be influenced by the proximity of such entities animals becoming possessed another difficult word perhaps in a way i like you lol you dont make light of such things nor give the impression that you consider me to be mad and dangerous oh youre dangerous lol said but then so are psychiatrists and psychotherapists jeavons did his haw haw laugh and we share jargon with these professions no coincidence they are the new shamans the smokeandmirror profession the necklace of skulls under the suits and the white coats the twelve priests and the snuffbox lol said whats your take on that archetypes too though less common than the black dog the twelve priests represent the twelve apostles and occasionally there may be mention of a thirteenth the man himself this is widespread in folklore and in fact the vaughan exorcism itself is replicated further up the welsh border at hyssington near montgomery we have a wicked squire who terrorized the area after his death like vaughan he appears in the local church as a bull in this same church the ubiquitous posse of parsons is waiting with lighted candles like vaughan the squire gets reduced to something that can be accommodated in a snuffbox so whats that saying about the welsh border borders are psychic pipelines jeavons said what you have here is a river into which streams of belief flow from both england and wales this is a particularly interesting part because of the way wales and england seem to intermingle the original boundary was the dark age earthwork offas dyke so how come we have an english town kington which according to my map is on the welsh side and a few miles away a welsh town presteigne on the english side schizophrenic lol said you have it the schizoid border hey we cookin here son consider the symptoms of the condition delusion hallucination loss of identity the withdrawal into a fantasy world the landscape of the mind is more important than the outside world and it becomes impossible to distinguish between them lol thought about isolated communities caught between two cultures emotionally politically and linguistically never sure where they stood in big national conflicts like the wars of the roses in which thomas vaughan was involved on both sides at different times the schizoid border its all bollocks of course lol said you can make anything fit into psychology its why i packed it in and went back to writing little songs but jeavons wasnt letting go lets take this a little further localization of archetypes ok the appearance of the spectral bull up at hyssington is immediately put into a local context oh it must be the ghost of old soandso he was a badtempered guy he must have turned into a bull when he died but hold on here as recently as the s a ghostly bull is seen in kington church by a woman visiting the area whose name happens to be vaughan an indication that such phenomena can actually become personalized yeah but thomas vaughan doesnt seem to have been evil or tyrannical so whats the evil that needs to be dealt with by this apostolic assembly of priests cant tell you the obvious target might be paganism which i would guess survived in this area well beyond medieval times the christian church lures the spirit of paganism into a holy place and relentlessly reads the scriptures at it until it becomes exhausted and shrivels into insignificance it may simply be the spirit of paganism or something more sinister tonight you could get the feeling of something more sinister lol told jeavons about the discovery of a mans body at the foot of stanner rocks torn about by some creature who is this man jeavons said unlikely to be a vaughan the family died out in that area the lights dimmed again with a clicking from somewhere in the hollows of the house and there was another draggedout crackling in the phone big white bird i do jeremy danny said i remember they had mugs of tea another fat ash log on the fire danny was sweating inside and out yes he remembered that summer because it was the oldfield summer the summer after hergest ridge the album came out and the ridge was worldfamous as the tourists arrived to see where the celebrated composer had flown his model gliders only by then mike oldfield was either leaving kington or had already left bittersweet memories danny never did get to hang out with mike in his studio however that same year he had managed to persuade the gorgeous greta morris to go out with him he sat now in front of the range watching jeremy berrows fizzing into some kind of paranoid life in the wake of that visit from the police the bloody hugeness of this it was gonner light up this valley like sas flares sebbie dacre sebbie dacre dead killed danny had taken the call when the bloke rang for the vicar to say that her daughter had found a body at the rocks the idea of it being sebbie had never even occurred to him and danny thought about him and jeremy trying to look normal when the police had told them cops hadnt been fooled he could tell and yet theyd gone theyd looked around the nant and theyd gone they were looking for natalie craven and the child he couldve told them where the child was but hed held off didnt want to tell nobody nothing right now had it occurred to the cops that jeremy might have killed sebbie and natalie too had they thought of that because danny sure bloody had the lie about the track being blocked so the kid couldnt come home the hurried note the hanging for gods sake danny hung on to his mug letting solid old riffs plash and bang in his head to hold him halfway steady let him talk let it come out we was only little kids that first holiday jeremy said i remember little blonde girl playing around the farm walking down to kington for ice lollies we never had a fridge back then the seventies danny looked over at the dresser thats you and her ennit in that photo dont recall seein it before always kept it in my bedroom kept it in a dark corner so i couldnt hardly see it proper most of the time but i didnt want it to fade see danny rubbed his beard jeremy i just never imagined mabbe because she was real blonde then and now hers dark blonde as ever was underneath nobody expects a blonde to dye her hair dark do they funny greta dont know bout that bloody hairdressers thats the intelligence centre of the whole valley does it herself it was the second time see the second holiday they had yere that was when it really happened jeremy was fondling the dogs ears remembering there was almost a smile on his face over the ravages of the rope brigids ole man he was a nice enough feller quiet sorter bloke but friendly wanting to know all about the farm what this did what that did tried to help with the shearing made a bugger of it but we told him he was doing well for a firsttimer never talked about paula brigid jeremy had to stop tears in his eyes like broken glass danny remembered this time well a damp forlorn period heralding the soulless eighties mike oldfield had left the area for ever and the world had already forgotten about hergest ridge we was only about twelve too young for too young to do much about it anyway although jeremy flicked a sideways look at danny like what am i doing talking like this to a bloke we was in the ole barn this day sheltering from the rain brigid was you know how they get sometimes girls women moody ent nothin in the world thats right no pleasin em no talkin em out of it so i suppose we kind of quarrelled the way kids do you quarrel with somebody quarrel was with herself me as got hit mind where in the old barn no you fool oh in the eye what did you do nothing what could i do what would i want to do danny nodded please god dont let him have done this next thing her arms is round me and hers sobbin away up against me all soft and then we kissed real gentle first kiss danny jeremy looked up flushed her fell asleep in my arms and then i suppose eventually i fell asleep too woke up with a black eye and in love you know danny smiled puppy love my mam said be over it in no time at all they dont know do they when she left i didnt wanner live for a good while you know how that is danny nodded course he knew couldnt sleep much not for months used to creep out and spend whole nights till dawn out in the meadow with the ewes then stagger off to school and fall asleep over the desk used to go up the church times when there wasnt nobody else there and id pray to god to send her back pray to god danny had a special prayer id wrote down figured if i kept repeating it every day real sincere hed bring her back god listen not till last summer bloody hell jeremy poor ole mary morson never had a hope with you did she nice girl mind mary morson they all got their ways bugger me danny said faintly i wrote to brigid regular she wrote back every week more or less the next summer i was thinking theyll be back lookin out for the caravan you know jeremy shivered over the fire i remember tried to phone her once got through to her dad he said i couldnt talk to her her sounded different harsh woundup said never to ring again and so you didnt howd you know that danny sighed jeremy sank down in his chair all the breath whispering out of him the dog whimpered someing yere i ent getting danny said why couldnt you talk to her danny jeremy turned to him full face and danny wasnt sure which caused the boy the most agony the twisting of his neck or the thought of what he was saying someing happened danny had the feeling he ought to know but he didnt she was brigid parsons jeremy said thats what happened back at stanner the cold air dropping around them like a shroud bliss said so how well do you know natalie craven when merrily had tried to raise the issue in the range rover hed nodded towards the driver and shaken his head so shed gone back to thinking about alice wondering if she ought to ring lol see if alice had phoned however darrin hook had died it was going to damage alice she followed bliss into the porch dont know her at all janes at school with her daughter which is how jane got the job here clancy invited her over one weekend and the foleys were looking for cheap saturday labour but you know who she is bliss said i know who she is and i know she cleared her throat swallowed this is one of the things i was going to tell you in the range rover we think jane and i think that natalie craven may have taken the girl to danny thomass house for the night because they thought the track to the nant could be difficult dannys the guy who was with jeremy berrows hes gomers partner what im sorry frannie there was no reason to think where its a farm back off the kinnerton road from walton not sure what its called i bliss had surged into the lobby leaving the door swinging back on her hell when she went in the tall detective whod been to the nant to talk to jeremy padded across the worn carpet mrs watkins could you phone the chief please in hereford annie howe not a happy bunny tonight the chief has she ever been a happy bunny he grinned use my mobile he keyed in the number for her and she sat down in a chintzy chair near the reception desk annie howe answered on the second ring ms watkins the fourth emergency service howe was an atheist younger than bliss seriously educated promoted over his head and on course for the stratosphere she wore crisp white shirts and pencil skirts and rimless glasses and smelled jane would insist of dettol no you wanted to erm talk about darrin hook merrily recalled the last time she and howe had been together in a derelict hopyard in the frome valley last summer in circumstances that howe was likely to have erased like a virus from the hard disk of her consciousness oh yes she said id like you to tell me everything you know about the late darrin hook well i i only found out about him in a roundabout way through his aunt who lives in the village no harm in going into this whatever you thought about annie howe she didnt gossip she was worried about a rift in the family stemming from the incident you obviously know about seventeen years ago when darrin hooks young brother was killed the other person in the stolen car the cousin dexter has suffered health problems ever since their aunt wanted me to pray for him pray for him i dont expect you to identify with this annie but its what we do after youve made a few inquiries to make sure that god has all the relevant background information necessary to deliberate the possibility of intercession even though as i understand it omniscience is one of his yeah all right you think my whole career has been founded on a tissue of myths fine strangely i can live with that it is strange howe said but then the most unexpected people can fall prey to superstition like hook himself im not following darrin hook was released from brompton heath prison just under three weeks ago having served less than half his latest eighteenmonth sentence for burglary the decision was made on the recommendation of among others the prison chaplain oh because hook appeared to have undergone a conversion to your faith darrin hook became a christian you didnt know that somehow id expected that was how you came to be acquainted with him im not acquainted with him ive never met him and i certainly didnt know hed been when you say a conversion what do you mean the usual absurd fanaticism bibles appearing in his cell sent down from heaven brought in by a prison visitor a relative hook began to attend the sunday services throwing up his arms and yelling that hed been saved and praise the lord and all this tosh i think even the prison chaplain became bored with him after a while perhaps why he recommended an early release merrily was shaking her head this is all news to me the implications were startling for a start if this was true alice would have no reason to worry about darrins reaction to the idea of a requiem eucharist for his brother you got this from the prison we havent been in touch with the prison the information came from a woman called dionne grindle a cousin of hooks living in solihull we found her phone number in his wallet she turned out to be the relative instrumental in his seeing the light my niece the one in solihull she did one of them alpha courses at her church did i tell you reckoned it dcreep up on you somehow felt the holy spirit was in her heart like a big white bird she obviously didnt tell the rest of the family merrily said apparently hook specifically asked her to say nothing to the hereford side of the family he said that he wanted to tell them in his own time and in his own way he also according to ms grindle had plans to and this is what interests us of course make an entirely new beginning by setting the record straight on a number of dark areas in his past now i assumed that by this he meant coming clean about previous offences for which he was never caught and wed have been naturally delighted to help him with the paperwork wouldnt you have had to charge him depends how serious they were we can be fairly discreet especially if it leads us to other offenders and this of course is the point if hook had talked about his conversion and its implications it might have been viewed as a rather worrying development by some of his former associates in this citys criminal underclass especially if he was indicating to all and sundry that he might be ready to put the record straight on certain matters come clean as it were you think hed be a marked man it does rather sound as if he was bent on martyrdom have you talked to his other relatives only his mother who lives in the city and knew nothing of any conversion she thought the most likely person for him to tell would be the aunt who so you did know about alice howe didnt reply have you talked to her no answer when we rang shes probably asleep by now and we havent been out there simply because most of the roads in that area are now closed anyway i thought id talk to you first somehow imagining youd be able to tell me rather more than you have he really was killed he was certainly killed but if youre asking if he was murdered let me put it this way there are some notterriblysubtle textural differences between snow which has fallen naturally on to a body lying in the road and snow which has been kicked over it in order to conceal it from approaching vehicles somebody dumped him in a main road to be run over whether he was already dead or unconscious when he was placed in the road only a pm can establish so we wont know until tomorrow merrily discovered that she was pacing the lobby loose shadows meshing in her path of course the macabre aspect to this annie howe said as one of our officers pointed out is that hook was placed in the road at the spot or somewhere very close to the spot where his brother died hook lived in a flat at wormelow a neighbour who was walking to the tump inn saw him leaving the building sometime around midevening on foot he may have been going to meet his killer and unless this was a remarkable coincidence we could assume the killer was someone who not only knew about the accident but also precisely where it took place i merrily went back to the chintzcovered chair and sat down again his cousin dexter was driving which you know of course was harris still close to his cousin apparently not theres been a rift in the family since the accident we i suggested the situation might be improved by holding a service a requiem eucharist for roland who was killed dexter said that darrin would be dead against it he suggested several times that darrin was unstable violent he said more or less that hed been scared of darrin when they were kids that darrin liked to hurt people cause trouble had a cruel streak i assumed because darrin had a prison record and dexter didnt that this was at least close to the truth there was a silence the door of the lounge opened and bliss looked out saw that merrily was still on the phone scowled and went back in ill tell you about darrin hook shall i annie howe said because i arrested him once you see a number of years ago hed got into a factory on the holmer estate with some mates lifting some computers that they didnt of course know how to get rid of these particular models being part of a network system so when they tried to flog them to a nice chap who assembles pcs in his garage we had the whole bunch in no time hook it turned out was the one who had got them into the factory past quite an efficient security system hes not bright but hes remarkably good with his hands and he does what hes told you might say i want to get into a chemists shop or i want a bmw series and darrin will do the technical bits you could call him an instinctive thief a natural he was the one who broke into the car that night when he was about twelve its what he does what he did it made him popular with certain people won him acceptance dexter indicated he was you know hard mrs watkins all his convictions relate to basic thieving never involving violence not on his part anyway it doesnt surprise me at all that he was converted in a very short time to your religion if he was exposed to someone with sufficient evangelical fervour in a situation where he couldnt get away hed be a pushover especially if he had something on his conscience i dont doubt that you people are quite good at targeting someones weak points you havent talked to dexter then he wasnt at home and we havent tried to find him it sounds as though hes either easily scared or hes been deliberately giving people the wrong impression about his cousin he was doing the late shift at alices fish and chip shop in ledwardine but i expect itll be closed by now long ago i should think does he stay in the village i think he goes back to hereford whether he could get through tonight though well talk to him first thing in the morning one way or another hes not going to know were looking for him well thank you ms watkins we got somewhere in the end didnt we im not sure where we got if he hadnt told alice about his conversion im pretty sure he wouldnt have told dexter well see howe said good night merrily gave the dc his phone back and went out through the porch to avoid bliss for a while the implications here were horrific tugging up the hood of janes duffel she walked out onto the forecourt where the snow was falling hard again like inside one of those glass things you shook i was bigger than darrin but he was real nasty look stuck his knife in the back of my hand once had an airgun shot a robin in the garden things people thought were nice hed wanner destroy it didnt fit and yet these things must have actually happened because dexter harris wasnt imaginative it was just that darrin hadnt done them and if darrin hadnt done them then youre a fuckin ole meddler alice nobody assed you to start all this shit what if everybody dont want the truth out dexter didnt want it out she pushed back her hood lifting up her face to the cascading sky feeling the cold stinging truth on her skin far from rejecting the idea of a requiem eucharist a bornagain christian of the charismatic persuasion throwing up his arms and yelling that hed been saved and praise the lord would see it as a sign a response from god to his need to be cleansed of his sins suppose dexter was still in contact with darrin suppose he knew about darrins conversion guessed that in darrins erratic mental state it would all come flooding out what had really happened that day the things that darrin had never talked about never talked about because he was afraid of dexter dexter the good boy not the most pleasant person to talk to but he worked hard and he was a martyr to his asthma and all he did that night after all was drive the car merrily walked with determination back into stanner hall pulling out her own mobile ringing alice again letting it ring for over two minutes before giving up and ringing lol what brigid did all the time she was talking lol kept looking at the window there ought to be curtains maybe merrily couldnt afford curtains on a starvation stipend the snow was coming down vertically out of a windless sky as if it had been directed to obliterate the village and unless it had been an apparition of the newly dead that definitely hadnt been darrin hook at the window so not a word from alice no he said nothing and its not likely shes going to call now is it you do know whats implied here merrily said fifteen miles away and safe thank god you do realize what it suggests about dexter it suggests that dexter might not be your problem any more lol said carefully merrily said if he is responsible for then you couldnt have known you had no reason even to suspect it you didnt know darrin and if what howe says is right about his conversion neither did alice it was my decision my solution to their problem jeavonss solution lol thought he ought to tell her about jeavons but he didnt think shed take it in you gave them an option he said the kind of option that someone like alice was never going to refuse when you think about it dont think about it theres nothing you can do about it its a police matter out of your hands your only problem now is going to be alice and if you start blaming yourself that isnt going to help hows jane confused lol why wasnt alice answering her phone probably because she hasnt got one in her bedroom ill go round and see if shes ok if you like no dont do that if she hasnt been round and she hasnt rung i suppose that means she doesnt know if shes asleep let her sleep ill call her in the morning when shes better able to handle it before the police can make a move on her damn bliss is making signals whats it like there now he looked away from the window dont try and get back tonight you wont make it not even in gomers truck is there somewhere you can sleep its a hotel but nobodys sleeping call me back when you can theres a couple of things are you ok im fine i love you merrily said so dont eirion rang too hes worried about jane and he im going to have to go lol sat staring at the hypnotic sleeplight on the monitor hed promised to call jeavons back after hed spoken to merrily but all that had been superseded now he glanced at the window he couldnt have told merrily about dexter looking in he couldnt have done that because it meant that dexter had still been here an hour ago here in the vicarage garden out there looking in the fish and chip shop must have been long shut but the chances of dexter being able to get a vehicle out of ledwardine had for a long time been remote therefore the chances were that dexter was still here at alices obviously where else could he have gone lol picked up the phone maybe he should ring annie howe himself let her know about this tell her that dexter harris whom she would presumably like to question in relation to the possible murder of his cousin was here in ledwardine but then it wasnt certain nothing about this was certain ethel the black cat sat on the sermon book and watched lol as though sensing his indecision ethel had a red collar with a small round bell the first time hed been in this ancient house was when hed arrived with ethel kicked and injured and merrily watkins one of my uncles used to be a vet in cheltenham had wrapped her in an old quilted bodywarmer and laid her on the kitchen table examining her for internal injuries removing bits of broken tooth lol often wondered if hed fallen in love that night when merrily had said something like god these lights are crap explaining her belief that oaths were ok because they kept the holy names in circulation without this cat youre right lol stood up and went to find his wellies bliss led merrily back into the lounge his incident room where a brassstemmed standard lamp lit the scratched wood panels with a light that was thin rather than soft over the fireplace sir arthurs bluetinted face gazed into places where bliss wouldnt want to go bliss sat down in the easy chair near the flaking fire one leg hooked over the arm and motioned her to the sofa opposite none of this goes out of this room all right and if it subsequently proves irrelevant to this case it doesnt get spoken of again even andy doesnt have clearance yet merrily sat down and closed her eyes you could learn too much in one night shed shown him the chatroom printout that jane had given her told him where it had been found she wondered where jane was but at least gomer had been with her best take off that sad old coat and have a coffee bliss said this could take a while jane looked up from making cheese toasties for the cops watching amber adding the herbs to her chocolate couldnt believe either of them was doing this keeping busy knowing it was all coming to an end shadows lengthening ghosts emerging moss and mildew reclaiming the walls of stanner like being in the band on the titanic how can you just go on its what i do im a cook yeah better than a conference jane amber said bitterly and without any dirty bedclothes well even get paid after a while amber said she seemed such a godsend a woman with all the management skills and diplomas and years of experience a personable woman who was happy to work for a pittance and never minded scrubbing floors jane stopped grating cheese do you know where she is no do you think how could she ask what she wanted to ask do you think dacre was killed because of her amber stopped stirring because of her jeremy wouldnt come back and sit down he walked into the little kitchen with the dog at his heels flinging open the back door staring out across the yard as if there was likely to be some personal message for him scored out in the snow when he turned round back into the room danny saw pain passing across his face fast as a train over a level crossing you thought it was me had him dint you jeremy till them cops come i didnt even know it was sebbie dead danny pushed his fingers into his hair it still wouldnt penetrate his brain that natalie craven was the brigid parsons one of those names that nobody whod read a paper or seen the tv news over the last twentyfive years would ever totally forget how come we never knowed how come nobody round yere knowed paulas daughter was brigid parsons tell me that nobody knew bout paula neither they kept it quiet jeremy came away from the door and went and stood by the paraffin lamp looking down at the glass paula killed herself when not long after giving birth it was pretty bloody horrible danny nobody talks about it natlie never learned about it till her dad was dyin poor bugger blamed hisself but it werent his fault it was in her so her mother killed herself grandmother killed herself and it dont bear thinkin about jeremy none of it brigid growed up thinkin her mother died in childbirth which is true in a way her dad norman he had things to find out too thought paula was an orphan which was true like but it was only when they come down yere he found out the truth about hattie and robert the nant was his now see but he felt it oughter be held on to for brigid thatd been me id have wanted to get rid fast specially after hed signed the lease by then but you knew about brigid and what she done i mean you muster knowed when it was all in the papers you and sebbie we never said nothin the two sisters never met the dacres knew what nearly happened when they was little swore herd never get another chance and were they gonner spread it round they got two killers in the family now danny didnt even like to think how jeremy would have taken it the girl he loved the girl hed prayed to god to send back jeremy in love with the memory of the monster who lured a boy of fourteen into an old railway shed with the promise of sex and stabbed him and cut him and tore him to pieces with a little kitchen devil and her own nails and the next night while the police and the neighbours were still looking for the missing boy did the same thing to his mate teen fiend the mirror said when brigid was convicted this was the girl jeremy had prayed to god to send back to him and it didnt bear thinking about none of it i wrote to her jeremy said i wrote to her five six times never had no reply figured mabbe herd been moved and they never forwarded the letters turned out her dad wasnt passing them on poor little sod was some folk born unlucky or what wasnt until he was dyin end of last year that norman sends for brigid tells her the truth about who she was and where she come from tells her about hattie and what good did that do good in the lamplight jeremy for once looked his age and then some his face full of dips and hollows mustve seemed good for you danny said and then he thought about it bugger me no wonder you rung me to come over when they turned up in that camper van you was scared to death you knew who it was gonner be all along you just dint know if her was gonner have two heads and bloody claws he turned and walked back into the living room where the fire was burning low tossing uncertain shadows on to the walls danny saw a dark and tragic tapestry forming how long before sebbie found out who the new woman was dunno danny he ever ask never asked me just sent his welsh shooters round to cause trouble put the wind up you let you know he was on the case cause a reaction was that it mabbe he seen the hound danny snorted turning to face the boy who was standing in the doorway now his face mottled by the fire what he seen jeremy was the curse of chancerys comin back to the stanner valley jeremy cried out so sharp and sudden that the dog whimpered and cowered away from him whyd you take a rope into the barn danny said and couldnt bear to hear the answer he went and sat down by the fire wishing to god he was at home with the cans on and the queens of the stone age a satisfyingly numbing wooden mallet in his head i begged her to go jeremy said like from a long way away i begged her to leave i prayed for her to leave same as id prayed for her to come back now im praying for her to get out before it i could feel it coming what the shadow hound death bollocks danny roared and yet remembered when he seen the two of them in the eagle thinking how soon romance died and you seen the signs danny signs even you couldnt miss and yet you did danny let his hands fall from his ears what the night this nathan got beat up jeremy came to kneel down side of dannys chair like a dog you was there just before it happened right think back danny what was they saying i dont bloody know yes you do you tole me they was like foley said afterwards nathan called him a wimp then splat splat no words what did he actually say what did nathan say jeremy for whatd he say foleys telling him to get the hell off his land or else and nat brigid hers like better do what he says and then nathan goes what you gonna do about it you and that fuckin little danny stopped the words booming in his head louder than the queens of the stone age and the foo fighters live on stage together and a big part of the black tapestry got itself blocked in that fuckin little english wimp the words shrank in dannys mouth quarrel was with herself jeremy had said earlier me as got hit mind jesus christ jeremy he dint mean foley was a fuckin little english wimp he meant he meant you he stood up looked down at jeremy by the chair the boys eyes full of a knowledge that he wished he didnt have foley never lifted a finger against nathan did he danny said extreme on the square the christmas tree lights had gone off at midnight and now the tree was shapeless with snow and joined at the hip to the market hall the falling snow was so dense that it was like passing through lace curtains the few lights still burning in ledwardine peering out at lol like suspicious muffled eyes crossing into church street where the roadway and the pavements had become one he passed the timberframed terrace that included lucys house its windows black snow piled up on the step like a whole month of mail it was as if he was alone in the village everywhere this white and quilted silence like a chapel of rest a short way down the hill the turning into old barn lane was just another snowflow now but with hunched and crooked buildings either side it was more sheltered here the snow shallower and lol was able to hurry as much as anyone could moving like a wader in a congealing river in the months before hed first met merrily when he was living in this village with alison kinnersley he would sometimes walk down here for chips alice had lived over the shop then and he vaguely remembered her moving out into the first new home to be finished in old barn close alice it seemed had always wanted a bungalow the shop was near the bottom of the lane before it fell away into fields blinds were down no light shining through the gaps and no street lamps to identify the entrance to the close about fifty yards further on hed been holding the vicarages black maglite torch out in front of him as if it was pulling him along now passing the chip shop its fatty miasma still in the air he finally switched the torch on the close was a socalled executive development of nine or ten houses and bungalows architectdesigned and well spaced between existing trees alices home was at the end backing onto the old orchard chain that curved around most of the village ending up back at the church ok then if there was a meaningful light on in the bungalow he was going to knock on the door if dexter harris answered it hed say he was sorry to show up so late but he was bringing a message for alice from the vicar who was stuck over in kington had tried to phone and couldnt get a reply it wasnt brilliant but it wouldnt sound too suspicious on a night like this if dexter said that alice was in bed he wouldnt argue hed just go back to the vicarage and try to get through to annie howe if alice was there however hed have to play it by ear his conversations with her in the old days had never got much beyond salt and vinegar but he thought shed remember him and he guessed that like probably everyone else in this village shed know about him and the vicar whether he told alice about darrin if she didnt already know he was dead would depend not least on whether dexter was here or likely to return lol stopped at the entrance to the close getting his breath back brushing the snow from his glasses and the arms of his old armysurplus parka why was he really here why was he doing this because hed been unnerved by the face at the window even more by what merrily had told him because he couldnt just sit there doing nothing until he fell asleep in some chair because he would otherwise have felt useless no face it it was essentially because he knew that this was what merrily would be doing if she was here merrily and he didnt like to contemplate this too deeply would be afraid of what little fieryfaced alice might have said or done and where it might have led because of the relentless snow he didnt see the light in the end bungalow until he was halfway along the close all the others were either in darkness or had outside lamps as a deterrent to burglars at alices the light was in either the kitchen or the living room or both hard to say curtains were drawn cheerful red roses against a yellow trellis both gates were open a sign on one said orchards end there was a white truck in the drive with big tyres and a couple of inches of snow on the bonnet dexter lol switched off the torch there was also a light on over a side door next to the truck he went up and rang the bell noticing that the snow had been roughly cleared from around the door that footprints leading around the back were already half whitedout he heard the bell ringing inside an oldfashioned continuous ringing strident he stopped and waited no response he tried again keeping his finger on the bell push for about ten seconds inside the bungalow the ringing died away the lights stayed on the snow kept on falling in its windless silence there was a slim glass panel in the door when lol leaned on the door to peer through it the door swung open and he wasnt expecting that at all merrily lit a cigarette from the stub of the last she never did this it was chainsmoking a sin she hardly noticed until it was done and the smoke was curling up past the waistcoat of arthur conan doyle like grey ectoplasm how long have you known about her me personally couple of months bliss said maybe longer its a routine thing notifying the local bobbies when someone of her status moves into your patch social workers and the probation service watching their backs how long did she serve eight nine years the last year in an open prison they come out for lengthening periods to get work experience and she was taken on at a big guest house and she did very well got on with people which is how she got the taste for it like being on a permanent holiday and most of the folk you met were on holiday too or transient workers temporary passing through i suppose after being in one place for so long its hard to settle down she wasnt she was in about six places all over the country different young offenders institutions for the first years and then two adult womens prisons i dont think they knew what to do with her from the start smart outgoing quite good with people long way from your usual moody psychos but one of those young offenders joints borstals as was she was in there with boys and that could get inflammatory at times she was a walking challenge for the hard lads physically very mature for her age and there were a number of incidents and then she absconded and got caught quick and moved on i think everybody was happy when she was old enough for styall partly because it was near where she lived but mainly because it was all women merrily said did the temporary employers know who she was she was thinking did jeremy know what brigid did but how could he not know this was a national hate figure whose name when it appeared in tabloid headlines was almost invariably preceded by the word evil evil brigid should never get out says victims mother and then evil brigid pregnant evil brigid freed in secret and the media hunt where is evil brigid here not necessarily bliss said some employers prefer not to know and when she came out she had a new name and new documents driving licence p all that this is her second change of name the first one the press rumbled her at some hotel in cornwall that was when she dyed her hair there was a rumour shed had plastic surgery but i dont think so the probation service are presumably still involved oh yeh theyve always been there in the background and also in this case the officer who nicked her ellie maylord who was my boss for a while when i was a youngster later she became the first female operational dci on merseyside ended up as superintendent but she was just a little dc when she brought brigid parsons in and shes always kept in touch with her well i think she was fascinated the way most people are even coppers by someone this extreme inevitably merrily fingered her pectoral cross so it was ellie who contacted me on the quiet in october my boss already knew it turned out but i was well off the needtoknow list ellie was worried about why after managing quite a big hotel in shropshire brigid had wanted to come here to this bliss looked around not terribly prosperous establishment i said id make a few discreet inquiries keep an eye on her but as you know ive been a bit busy with one thing or another these last two months so it got overlooked do you know why she came here merrily tipped her cigarette into a big metal ashtray pushing it away bliss didnt know then that brigid parsons was hattie chancerys granddaughter dacres cousin all he knew was that dacre had been found dead and a convicted murderer was missing how come hattie chancery had failed to become part of the legend of brigid parsons merrily retreated behind smoke shed need to think about this before enlightening him she became pregnant in prison didnt she i remember reading a long piece in the observer magazine some years ago about a year after she came out recalling a photo of a womans silhouette shot from a distance in a wide empty field at sunset a little girl running ahead of her the little girl who was now janes unlikely best friend janes friend the daughter of brigid parsons no wonder she was quiet embarrassing bliss said it had to be either one of the male staff or someone she encountered on working days but she never told and she insisted on having the child toted the kid around with her all over the place admirable really all the highpressure jobs she managed to hold down and bring up a young baby something to prove i suppose i see it all made sense now what jane had told her about them moving from place to place usually holiday resorts lost in the anonymous army of migrant seasonal staff finally travelling like gypsies what about her parents the mother died when she was born dad supported brigid but then he got married again had a new family didnt see much of her until he was dying himself not too long ago after her father died that was when she came down here the head teacher at moorfield robert morrell would he know who clancys mother was might im not sure hed love it wouldnt he the old nambypamby liberal im just surprised he let her go near jane oh i think we all tend to misjudge jane bliss said she can be a pain in the bum but shes from a nice home morrell might think clancy could have worse friends youre being worryingly laidback about this francis personally im shattered thats because i know where im going im accumulating background data for when we bring her in he smiled tightly which we will weve got officers at the thomas place youre making a few assumptions im looking at the evidence a woman goes missing from work at a hotel just a few hundred yards from the spot where a man is found dead in suspicious circumstances i mean even if this wasnt brigid parsons surely they wouldnt let her out without extensive psychiatric screening i mean how old was she when she killed those two boys thirteen killed one boy bliss said mark andrew goodison stuart petit survived just she thought shed killed him almost certainly intended to but he survived to finger her if he hadnt i doubt shed everve been even questioned the extreme savagery of it nobody was looking for a girl he lost an eye stuart did you know id forgotten most people just remember what happened to mark the bits of it the press felt able to print at the time but whatever the shrinks say i think theres a good chance that the child who did that hasnt exactly gone away dont you ive never met her stick around bliss said they took the tractor danny and jeremy danny realizing how much worse the conditions had got since hed left home but not being able to get back there that was not an option danny thomas versus the worst winter for many a damn year danny thomas versus god no contest tonight when he got the engine going and the music started up and this time it really was bad moon rising he got rid of it so fast he nearly broke the damn switch and when jeremy berrows hunched up in the other side of the cab said its gonner be all right i swear itll be all right danny couldnt find it in him to make any kind of reply ahead of him he saw the lights up on stanner rocks national nature reserve and crime scene he saw the heads in the rocks like some primitive pagan mount rushmore in miniature rimed with snow and secrecy and he wanted to blow the whole enigma into the endless night danny i know what it looks like to you and that was why why you never said a word danny lurched in his seat grinding the tractor onto the snowbound bypass scraping his hair from over his eyes i cant believe you never told me none of this boy i cannot believe it i cant believe you let that woman leave that kid with greta danny it i cant believe youd do this danny ive known her for over twentyfive years i know all her problems i know why she done what she done and i know the things she wont do youve known she was a bloody murderer for twentyodd years and you still wanted her you brought her into the valley and you never said a word you knowed what she done to nathan and still said nothin you know it ent bloody changed boy that woman kills and you let my greta get involved in it and you never said a word and i thought you was my friend and whatever happens i ent never gonner forgive that in the clean shiny chromium kitchen lol saw things that bothered him like a single cup on the kitchen table half full of cold tea like a tin of assorted biscuits with the top off these things bothered him because everything else in here was immaculately tidy he didnt like to go further than the kitchen he stood just inside the doorway called out tentatively mrs meek on the wall by the door was a calendar of peter manders scraperboard etchings of herefordshire scenes above it two framed photographs one of four grinning blokes including dexter harris hefting between them what looked like a tractor wheel the other was a formula studio portrait of a small boy with closecropped hair roland roland and dexter only darrin missing the bad boy the black sheep in fact the weak boy the easily led boy who could have used some support from a strong selfsufficient auntie if shed ever been told the truth a door across from lol was open to the dimness of perhaps a hallway but through another door opposite he saw a stuttering light alice a wide hall ending in an arched front door from here it was clear that the flickering was from a tv set in a lounge or living room lol went in alice in case shed fallen asleep in front of the tv leaving the back door unlocked well after midnight on the widescreen tv a black and white movie of gaslight vintage was showing with the sound down a woman in a doorway holding a lantern high this was a long room with a picture window overlooking the orchard spectacularly snowclad the only light apart from the tv came from perfect red and yellow designer flames curling almost realistically from real coals on a gas fire in the bottom wall the carpet was cream the fourpiece suite huge and expensive and vacant lol went back into the hall doors on both sides three of them slightly open bathroom empty utility room with washing machine and dryer empty toilet and shower room empty he put an ear to the closed doors before slowly opening each of them two were bedrooms with that roomfreshener smell that told you they werent in everyday use there was no sound either from the third bedroom lol went in switching on the light he saw a white dressing table a builtin wardrobe the bed was turned down and the room felt warm there was a small en suite bathroom and toilet alices room nobody here the final room had evidently been intended for a study it had builtin shelves and cupboards there were cardboard boxes on the floor on the wall opposite the door by the window was a framed local newspaper cutting showing a middleaged man in an apron holding out two bags of chips a younger alice looking on the headline read frying start sizzling new venture for farmer jim alice and jim had been struggling for years on a small farm not much more than a smallholding lol remembered someone saying that by the time jim died the fish and chip shop in old barn lane the first chippie in an expanding ledwardine had proved to be the most lucrative business in this village by a big margin and that included the black swan a very worthwhile inheritance for somebody when lol got back to the kitchen dexter harris was sitting at the table nibbling a chocolate biscuit he barely looked up the huge solid greyness of him was reflected out of a chromium freezer door a kettle a dualit toaster whatever you took boy dexter said friendly enough lets have it on this table yere else mabbe ill make a start by breakin your arm see where we goes from there living on the edge of a chasm neither jane nor amber noticed beth pollen until she was almost at the bottom of the kitchen steps would this be a convenient time to talk amber picked up the earthenware jug for the chocolate defensive jane or me i think both mrs pollen looked tired a bit frazzled she said to jane and i do want to talk to your mother shes around jane was embarrassed now about the way shed clung to beth pollen at the rocks when the fox or the badger had run past but i want to clear the air on some things first everything in fact jane put down the cheesegrater and stared at mrs pollen still in her sheepskin coat open over a pale blue jumper and jeans as she came down the final step into the kitchen to begin with mrs pollen turned to amber when the baker street league cancelled their conference that was entirely my doing neil kennedy was actually quite amused at first by the idea of your husband trying to build a business around the dubious legend of conan doyle and the hound of hergest and they were quite gratified with the terms he was offering and the idea if i may say so of a weekend of your renowned cooking amber put the earthenware jug back on the french stove what are you saying i had a long discussion with neil kennedy during the murdermystery weekend i told him ben foley believed he had conclusive proof that doyle had been here which he believed would finally discredit the cabell legend in devon as the source of the hound i said i understood mr foley as a former television producer hoped to use the baker street league to help him front a largescale media campaign particularly in america and i told him other things dr kennedy was not terribly amused as im sure you found out amber turned down the heat under the chocolate youd better sit down thank you beth pollen took a wooden stool next to the island unit and amber dragged over two more and put on the halogen lights jane stared into mrs pollens weathered guileless face you deliberately screwed it up for ben yes amber said i dont understand both kennedy and you already knew there was proof that doyle had been at stanner the document you mentioned in the files of the baker street league that doesnt exist mrs foley i invented it no article was written as far as i know for coxs quarterly or any other defunct magazine there is no proof to my knowledge that conan doyle ever stayed at stanner or came to this area he may have all the indications are there the coincidence of names but well probably never know and if you remember i said the other night that if anyone asked kennedy about a handwritten document he would deny all knowledge of it quite legitimately as it happens jane felt like her head was filling up with a grey fog she let amber ask the question why why did you want to do this to us beth pollen sighed because if stanner had become as mr foley had planned a regular conference venue for the baker street league the white company would never have been allowed to set foot in the building what i didnt lie about was the enmity between the two organizations which as a member of both ive been able to observe over the years in all its incredible peevishness i realize the league is far more prestigious prosperous and influential and im sorry but i wanted us in here i wanted alistair hardy here he has a remarkable ability we dont understand jane said mrs pollen sighed her face coloured mauve by the halogen lights we had to mislead the white company as well doubt id have been able to persuade them if i hadnt been able to show there was evidence that conan doyle had been here at the critical moment alistair hardys fees are sizeable hes doing this for nothing because of the tv coverage jane felt herself exploding get me out of here everybody who sets foot in this place just lies amber said mrs pollen you said we yes beth pollen said the other person the other person the phrase seemed to bounce off the stones in the wall natalie it all added up didnt it when ben had lost the baker street league conference it was nat who came up with an instant replacement and rescued the whole situation ok just a bunch of loony spiritualists but better than nothing the way beth pollen had turned up at the church at just the right moment to impress antony largo a setup i was going to get round to that mrs pollen said brigid jane said so you do know mrs pollen said dexter had taken off his expensive bikers jacket uncovering a grey denim shirt with epaulettes and a badge on the breast pocket with twin exhaust pipes on it he stood in the middle of the floor his hands halfcurled like ringspanners so you ent took nothin it was likely hed recognized lol now as the guy hed seen through the scullery window but he wouldnt know whether lol had seen him so he wasnt letting on hence the catchingaburglar routine it gave lol some leeway he told dexter his story about the vicar getting worried when alice had twice failed to answer the phone lol walking over here to see if everything was all right finding all the lights on in the empty bungalow with the back door unlocked no more than the truth sorry i came in like this but anything couldve happened like what dexter said i mean where is she how should i know i come back from closin up the chip shop hour or so ago she ent yere telly on and everything no alice i been out lookin for her no sign dunno where she gone neighbours mabbe they all seem to be in bed dexter shrugged you called the police not yet herd go through the bloody roof sides which hows the police gonner get through with all the bloody roads blocked for miles around nah hers likely wandered off herll be back lol considered hed been honest so far no call to deviate from that shes had a shock the vicar told me discovering that he was playing the christian aide the clergy groupie the little guy in glasses who fluttered vaguely around the vicarage a moth lured by the incandescence of its incumbent tole you what about your cousin yeah tough you werent that close dexter shook his head waste of fuckin space you want the truth never kept a job always in trouble with the law brought the whole family into disrepute he leaned towards lol a bubble of moisture like an ornamental stud in the cleft of his lower lip so whats with you and the vicar friends im staying the weekend with her she was called out to talk to someone who attempted suicide local kington ent gonner get back from there in a hurry so ive got to ring her back about alice shes worried dexter stared at him blankly like what do you want me to do about it he went to the chromefronted fridgefreezer you wanner lager no its yeah ok thanks dexter got out two cans of stella artois tossed one to lol wanner help me take a look around is it thats a good idea right then dexter put on a grim knowing smile snapping the ringpull on his beer can a smugness there lol thought a satisfaction which way do you think she mightve gone put it this way if you gets to leominster turn back dexter had a swig of lager took his leather jacket from the back of a chair pulling a pair of black driving gloves out of one of the pockets never mind boy be a cold bed for you tonight anyway look sorry dont gimme that friends shite dexter clapped lol on the back it was as if he was on a roll and nothing could go wrong for him tonight yes jane had heard of her although of course it had all happened long before she was born she knew about her in the way she knew of say lizzie borden a halfmythical figure with a rhythmical nurseryrhyme name and an underlying pulse of horror brigid parsons killed some boys there were others there was mary bell whose name you knew because it was such a nice short wholesome name and the killers of little jamie bulger whose names you could never remember but this was less horrific surely because only one of the boys died and he was older than brigid parsons so the element of cruelty was missing or if it was there it was different different with brigid parsons different with natalie craven youre asking me what i believe i believe you dont let anybody fuck you about thats it really this was unreal and it wasnt less horrific at all jane had an idea of how bad it actually was shed once read a coloursupplement feature where is brigid parsons something like that brigid parsons could never call herself that again in the same way that mary bell had had to lose her fresh clean name although apparently she was a nice woman now not the same person as the child whod killed two little boys and given herself away by asking to see them in their coffins who were you kidding in some ways brigid was worse for cruelty substitute plain savagery the magazine had revealed details that could not be published in the papers at the time as those were days when family papers didnt go into details about mutilation jane sat on her stool looking down at her fingers empurpled in the lights then up at beth pollen who had revealed the unbelievable and then at amber who hadnt been able to speak for whole minutes it seemed like and when she did it was just to say faintly does ben know jane looked back down at her fingers the thing was that natalie was just so cool amber stood up and went and did a very amber thing she stirred the chocolate although it was probably ruined by now then she came and sat on the stool with her hands in her lap does ben know i wouldnt think so beth pollen said though i suppose everyone will know in a short while when they either find her or the media find out theyre looking jane looked up at the high window almost obscured now by layers of snow that from down here looked grey like concrete christ she thought christ this explained everything about clancy why she was so quiet the tall gawky kid behind the pile of books why shed been to so many different schools why shed leapt up from her homework in horror when nat had walked down these steps with blood all over her arms the great revelation over beth pollen talked about her and natalie in the drab aftermath of his death beth had taken up her husbands final research project the previously unchronicled history of a great victorian house on the very border of wales and england shed thought it might make a small book locally published with his name on its cover a fitting memorial sometimes she could sense him at her elbow as she typed suggesting a better word rebuking her for attempting to include some picturesque but uncorroborated anecdote although the text would be tinted by her growing interest in spiritualism the very sense of stephen had made beth more assiduous in her research and that was how shed met natalie craven who also was awfully interested in the history of stanner hall i suppose i needed a friend no thats wrong i suppose i needed a different sort of friend she could almost have been my daughter but thats not how it was either she had this mature awareness of how things worked how one might turn situations around i suppose it was years of surviving in the prison system that made her like that but of course i didnt know that at the time she simply fired me gave me back my energy she can make things happen jane said i think its because she doesnt care whether they happen or not and i was intrigued by her relationship with jeremy berrows absolutely nothing about him or so you thought at first only slowly becoming aware of a kind of native spirituality the kind that you expect to find in farmers whose families have lived close to the land for centuries but seldom do these days oh i was very curious about jeremy and how those two came to be together especially after all those years apart jane said well the first ten she could do nothing about and then when you realize approaching middle age that perhaps youve never been able to connect with anybody as fully as the farm boy you met when you were twelve that maybe you really were two halves of something what do you do about it nothing you dont really believe the validity of a memory that old do you its like a myth two halves jane thought about jeremy berrows walking into his barn with a rope she said nothing beth pollen said we discussed it after shed revealed her real her former identity she glanced at jane and if youre wondering how that came about it was when we were researching hattie copying old photographs and there was one of her as a girl with her family and i said unthinking oh she looks rather like clancy could have bitten my tongue off when i saw natalies face but thats how it came out i think ive seen that picture its in her room now hatties room so the next day we were due to go to kington church together she didnt turn up but the following day early in the morning there she was awfully pensive and just told me quite simply who she was and what shed done no attempt to justify or explain it and she didnt swear me to secrecy i hope she knew she didnt have to i certainly havent said a word to anyone until now didnt knowing about that you know alter things threaten the friendship why should it in some ways it deepened it because i felt this overwhelming need to understand her i felt that no one except perhaps jeremy ever had and i felt that stephen had brought her to me but she was a murderer amber said and shed been punished for it and she was that womans granddaughter id be jolly stupid if i said that didnt frighten me i remember that when i recognized the awful parallel between hattie and the bloodweary robert and natalie and jeremy i was so scared for jeremy but in the end i realized that this in some strange way had only intensified the relationship they were living on the edge of a chasm i think when she met him again with the knowledge of what had gone before she knew that if she didnt take that risk seize it then shed just be giving in to the past and thats not how she is jane said lets get this out you think that whatever made hattie chancery do what she did was also present in brigid parsons its what she needs to know and its why she came back she realizes theres a negative energy inside her that she cant always control her mother beth pollen took a breath natalie doesnt think doesnt want to think its a mental illness you and she think theres a psychic connection with hattie this is why i wanted alistair here people like you might demean spiritualism but i think there is something to be discovered here and its nothing that were going to find written down im sorry jane said i cant believe an intelligent woman like you really thinks that someone like hardy can deal with something this enormous i mean he hes a phoney jane heard mens voices and footsteps at the top of the stone stairs two men were coming down the steps jane was expecting cops or maybe hardy and matthews she really didnt care if hardy had heard her talking about him he isnt a phoney believe me beth pollen said but i didnt say that i thought he could deal with it a medium is simply what the word says its about communication rather than solutions amber turned to jane i think she means thats something for your mother oh it was ben foley who sprang from the bottom step amber im sorry if im interrupting anything but well need another room the man with ben bestowed on jane a gracious smile jesus i wouldnae like to do that journey again thank you hen youve got a hell of a nose for a developing situation nothing was ever simple nothing ever painless danny had been aware of diamondbright bluewhite vehicle lights behind them on the bypass sticking with them after they turned off at walton using their tracks but with snow fuzzed all over his wing mirror he couldnt be sure what it was and by the time they pulled up at his place the lights had vanished it was when jeremy got down to open the farm gate for him that the little black daihatsu appeared coming the other way down from kinnerton danny had the idea it had been waiting in the layby about a hundred yards back to see who was in the tractor now it stopped hugging the hedge wedges of snow collapsing onto its roof as someone got out a woman in a blue waterproof then jeremy was springing back from the gates and he was locked together with the woman in the tractors headlight beams and danny was down from the cab real fast and in through the farm gate greta had the door open before he reached it standing there in a wash of yellow and just for a moment it was like the first time hed ever seen her in a long floaty frock with little golden stars like a dusty sunbeam you all right danny almost sobbing in relief gret said i couldnt do nothing danny had to let them in wasnt nothing i could what and then danny heard another engine up on the road and turned and saw the bluewhite lights hard behind the tractor at the gate heard the jolt of vehicle doors opening when they told me greta said about sebbie dacre and then behind her inside the house a girls voice was screaming out in real distress no mum go away dont come in and there were sounds of pulling and scuffling and this long rending wail of despair greta said you better a copper came past her then out of the front door and danny recognized his grey moustache cliff morgan sergeant dont get involved danny eh cliff said but danny ran back with the coppers to the open gate where meshing headlights had turned the snow magnolia and jeremy and natalie craven were boxed in between the tractor and jeremys old black daihatsu in the centre of all these beams of hard light snow coming down on them cops gathering in a wider circle blocking the lane but they were separated from it world of their own jeremy with his scarf wound around his neck so she wouldnt see what hed done to hisself holding her hand real tight where you been he kept saying where you been natalie craven pulled his head into the crease of her shoulder its all over natalie said long hands in his fluffy hair all done now alleluia he didnt expect them to find her that was clear dexter wasnt subtle and he didnt expect them to find alice they went up to the top of old barn lane back into church street and down to the ox with its frosted front windows a dim yellow glow visible from somewhere back in the pub they used to drink yere when jim was alive dexter said as if they might see alice peering in thinking it was still dexter was going through the motions lol wiped snow from his glasses with a forefinger how did she find out about your cousin eh you said you thought it was the shock that mightve made her wander off i said that dexter sniffed and slumped off round the corner where an alley led to public lavatories lol followed him a tinhatted lamp on a wroughtiron bracket turned snowflakes into falling sparks check out the womens you reckon dexter said its all locked up lol could see an iron gate a chunky padlock pity dexter finished off his lager tossed the can to the end of the alley he came over leaned down into lols face his arms folded you really poking that little vicar not right now lol said her go like alleluia when her comes dexter burst out laughing just thought o that must remember to tell her lol said alleluia when her comes dexter laughed up at the sky what do you reckon happened to him lol followed dexter round to the front of the pub where they stood under its open porch just seems odd a bloke falling in the road pissed most likely dexter said he hadnt given it up then uh turning christian christian dexter coughed and spat into the snow he never he just said what he wanted em to think alice and fuckin daft dionne ill tell you he was a weak bastard always gonner go wrong too weak to hold a job down not like me alice knew that i was all she got look me as looked out for her sisters got their own lives and their families up in hereford laughing their tits off at alice all this ole church stuff i was all she got daft ole bitch couldnt have no kids look how long you been helping at the chip shop helping cheeky cunt when im in there im running that place look reorganizin all these idle assistants all this chitchat we dont need that get em served and on to the next one dont give em

job it is actually all right what well do well go round the bowling green but well come out by the swan thats what well do somebody who expected never to be contradicted or refused due to being asthmatic and not looking for stress lol remembered how when he was working with dick lydon the hereford psychotherapist dick had this disabled client with the same attitude you had to humour them to begin with dick used to say and then after a while make it obvious that you were humouring them so theyd see a reflection of themselves that could take all night with dexter it could take all night and it still wouldnt work whatever dexter had done tonight he was proud of himself he kicked a lump of snow hands punching out the pockets of his leather jacket killing time looking for someone he knew they wouldnt find what you waitin for im just thinking lol said where is alice likely to have gone coulder gone back home by now for all i knows wed have seen her unless she we havent checked out the orchards at the back of the bungalow have we theres a path through the orchards where people walk their dogs alice didnt have no dog never went for no walks past tense always past tense no lol said but i said her never went for no fuckin walks lol tightened up inside dexter didnt want him checking out that footpath its er also a short cut to the church isnt it and she was a church cleaner the head cleaner be the quickest way for her to go not at bloody night as head cleaner shed probably have keys if she was very cut up about what happened she mightve got it into her head to go and offer up a prayer at night like you said they do strange things old people dont they the squeak of fists clenching in leather gloves lol turned into the tracks theyd made back up towards the square tell you what if you go and check round the old bowling green like you said and ill have a walk up to the church then ill follow the footpath back the other way you wont need the torch will you he wiped the new snow off his glasses and walked off after a few seconds he was aware of dexter following him not altogether a pleasant sensation mrs watkins merrily had been looking for jane and hed come down the main stairs a man with a laptop and blackframed glasses matthew hawksley i suspect we may have exchanged emails yes i believe we did sorry about that i just wanted to know what my daughter was getting into she isnt getting into anything we try not to involve anybody under the age of twentyone well thats good anyway were glad to have you with us matthew said now that sounds ominous this place is ominous matthew said whats been happening tonight only underlines it a murder can make a childrens playground seem ominous oh he said do they know its murder its a lot of manpower for a suicide matthew yes he smiled look i know how the clergy in general feel about spiritism so i wont bend your ear on that but have you got a couple of minutes maybe hours i dont think im going to get home tonight youre probably right poor you look id hate to say this in front of ben foley but my feeling is that this place this house this hotel should never have been built no best not to say that in front of ben not built here is what i mean not as if it was erected on the site of a former dwelling there never was a house here on stanner rocks id probably argue that this site has a degree of psychic instability jane would say pagan magic and shed put it down to the border would that be in line with your thinking matthew grimaced what you had was an obscenely rich family moving to a generally poor area perhaps they were warned perhaps not they were after all bringing wealth and employment and modern science to an area riddled with primitive superstition spiritism matthew smiled ruefully i wish we had a better word for it id be the first to agree that very few of the claims made by people like conan doyle have been substantiated in fact were no further forward now than we were then except that were less susceptible to frauds wouldnt say that necessarily all right he put up his hands lets not go down that road lets get back to geophysics i mean look around even on a simple structural level it doesnt feel right damp coming through everywhere woodwork rotting i suspect the heating will never be adequate standing here now its almost as if were standing on the bare rock am i telling you things you already know you mean people didnt live here until we had an urban industrialized society that believed man was destined to have full dominion over the natural world ie the victorians bottom line is conan doyle notwithstanding foleys going to go bankrupt here in no time at all and he knows it when i first heard that somebody had taken a dive off stanner rocks i half thought it was going to be him hello merrily turned to follow his gaze ds mumford had come in from the car park and was standing just inside the entrance bulky as a lagged cistern in one of those long dark overcoats on which snow appeared to evaporate bliss appeared in the doorway of his incident room mumford nodded matthew said i dont know much about your side of things but beth pollen tells me theres something you can do called an exorcism of place cleanses a place of bad vibes the residue of unfortunate acts makes it a more amenable place to live and work its not feng shui matthew i didnt has anyone asked you to mention this im just sounding you out reverend but i think my colleagues beth anyway are getting a little nervous the tv producers arrived and he and foley are intent on filming something tonight as originally planned with all this with the police action as background sexy telly two uniformed police were opening up both swing doors to the porch and the tall detective whod connected merrily with annie howe moved to a vantage point near the unlit christmas tree are they bringing something in matthew asked someone id guess she heard doors opening behind her sensed more people standing there the electric current passing through the lobby could have relit the tree and doubled the candlepower of the chandelier everyone tensed for that first glimpse of brigid parsons even presumably the people who already knew her as natalie craven given whats happening beth now feels apprehensive about what wed originally planned matthew said i think shed be happier if there was a spiritual dimension to it making it even sexier telly right headlamps speared through the porch and then veered away a vehicle stopping directly outside the doors the two policemen moved to either side of the entrance mumford and a stocky policewoman in a dark blue jersey waited by the reception desk presently five people came in through the porch two uniforms two detectives one woman we appreciate you cant just exorcise a place willynilly youd need a focus matthew said for just a moment from about ten feet away the gaze of the killer brigid parsons met merrilys the eyes were brown and candid what had she expected cold bleak washed clean of humanity brigid was wearing a fleecelined lightblue waterproof jacket hanging open over a dark shirt and jeans her head was held high the dense dark brown hair falling back as if she was finally ready to shed the years of dyes and deception matthew said we were thinking that the late hattie chancery might fit the agenda tough ole bat merrily found gomer in his truck parked on the edge of the forecourt where the snow was churned up like cold custard shed climbed in next to him just as he finished talking to danny on his old carphone hows jeremy taking it gomer got out his ciggy tin squinted at it then put it back in a pocket of his scarred old bomber jacket when things is bad jeremy just closes down like hes been unplugged where are they now gomer back at the nant through the windscreen merrily watched a policeman come out of the porch and look up at the flaking sky the snow had become sporadic again as if the weather was playing with them one of the witchshat towers was wreathed in a pinkish vapour and clancy still at gretas with a woman cop cliff morgan he reckoned theyd likely bring her yere tomorrow give em some time together fore her mams taken to hereford dont look like thats gonner happen till it gets light and they clears the roads any chance herll walk away from this vicar light sentence if her had good reason not a nice feller sebbie merrily shivered inside janes worn duffel coat tightened her scarf clearly gomer didnt yet know that this was brigid parsons and the chances of her getting out of prison ever this time were remote cops know hers hatties granddaughter vicar i think theyd regard that as a closed case the curtains in the hotel lounge had been drawn now for the interrogation of the prime suspect a shadow rose against them bliss throwing up his arms in probable frustration but it looked like he was dancing nothin happens round yeres ever closed you knows that gomer said the churchs main door was locked and there was nothing in the stone porch apart from the side benches the parish noticeboard and a rack of leaflets satisfied dexter said lol couldnt see dexter but the density of him made the stone porch feel claustrophobic he bounced the torch beam around one last time youre a funny bugger lol whats she to you alice less it gets you brownie points with the vicar gets you into her whatsit cassock that must be it then lol said tightly he wanted to smash the torch into dexters face instead he switched it off so that dexter couldnt see him thinking when dexter had appeared at the scullery window hed come across the lawn from the orchard and then gone back the same way which would have brought him into the churchyard dexter had been this way before lol looked out down the churchyard path and found that he couldnt see the lychgate normally it would be outlined in gold from the lantern on the perimeter wall the lantern had gone out lol bent and peered through where the gate would be usually you would see the lamps on the square and the partly floodlit profile of the black swan powers gone big surprise dexter said he was right it was bound to happen sometimes it only lasted a couple of minutes but more often three or four hours and occasionally in weather like this two or three days lol switched on the torch just hope the phone lines still up you want to check that footpath through the orchard or call the police now ent your problem you might as well go home ill call em from the bungalow look ok lol would call them as soon as he got back to the vicarage well i hope shes all right tough ole bat dexter said hey sorry give the vicar one for me dexter sniggered night dexter lol walked back into the churchyard the snow had slowed again or maybe the loss of light just made it seem that way hold on wrong way boy ill go through the orchard into the vicarage garden dont wanner do that this time o night bloody dangerous look all this done it loads of times and i can check the other door side of the church on the way you never know do you and now he did he moved as quickly as he could through the untrodden snow listening for the sound of dexter crunching after him like before but it didnt come he adjusted the head of the torch to issue a wide beam and the graves appeared out of the snow like the stumps of a shorn forest all the unsightly bits the borders and the gravel beds the pots of longdead flowers submerged the path too had vanished and he had to guess his way through the wider gaps between graves and tombs overhung by the snowbent branches of elderly apple trees he stopped when he heard the breathing coming from somewhere in front of him and it was very loud theatrically loud and eerie vampire breathing something alive among the graves dexter dexter had done a circuit of the church and was waiting for him and letting him know hed lied to dexter been this way no more than once or twice in high summer he turned and his foot stabbed into a squat gravestone mostly buried he pulled back in pain shining the torch directly ahead of him the beam hitting a wall of white an impassable snowbank swinging the torch to the right he found one of the old toppled tombs its cracks and cavities compacted with snow and what looked like a collapsed eroded stone angel breathing antony largo was in his denims and he looked invigorated and younger than jane remembered him and more cheerful pacing the kitchen sizing things up the stubble on his face was almost a beard now and made his grin seem bigger and whiter and how were you received matt matthew hawksley considered she was polite courteous but im not holding my breath she wont go near it jane said even a minor exorcism takes a lot of preparation days sometimes they dont go into it without long discussions with like everybody in this case shed need the green light from the bishop ah well antony said philosophically if its meant to be itll happen but jane knew that he wouldnt give up after all the trouble hed taken to get here after talking to her on the phone hed called up a guy who ran a filmunit resources business called him up at home in the middle of the night and pestered him for something heavy and allterrain within the hour whatever kind of money antony had been waving around had brought him this monster shogun and then hed done the journey the hard way blasting up from london through gloucester and down to ross whitehellraiser extremely nasty in places but i just plugged on miles tae go before i sleep hed grinned sleep when i fetched up here it was like i was already there very dreamlike damn cops wouldnae even let me in at first they thought you were a journalist ben had said glancing at amber who was back at the stove making soup and resenting all these people in her kitchen i think well have to play all this by ear seeing natalie brought in for questioning had unnerved ben jane and amber had agreed not to discuss what theyd learned from beth pollen if only because antony was back ok women of the midnight was tv history now but if he found out natalies real identity nothing would stand in his way like nothing the contemporary dynamic the now drama i dont know about the rest of you ben said but im just hoping this is some awful awful mistake well antony said whoever the hell this sebastian dacre was hes given us a buzz we cannot ignore antony everybodys knackered everybodys fractious everybodys upset wrong antony said everybodys electrified in semidarkness the dining room was like a derelict chapel a dead fireplace at one end at the other this lofty stainedglass window fogged with night and snow if youre getting feelings of déjà vu bliss said it doesnt hold any nice memories for me either as you know he meant the time in october although to merrily it still felt as raw as last week when hed asked her to talk to a particular man facing a murder charge and shed been dreading it and relieved when it hadnt come off and then the situation had turned into a freerolling tragedy and the guilt and remorse had kicked in which was why there was no way she could say no to this one or even think no the door to the hall was open and they were standing in a narrow alley of diffused light bliss had been waiting when she and gomer came back into the hotel well be outside at both ends merrily tell me again give me all the details there are no details we never got that far then give me the outline again she admits killing dacre thats it she keeps saying i killed him what else do you want i say i want to know why she says you wouldnt understand and then after a bit she goes if you do a couple of things for me ill think of a full explanation for what happened ill write it all down and i wont go back on it i wont ask for a lawyer and ill plead guilty and im saying but brigid it wont be the truth will it and shes saying whenever did the truth matter to a copper words to that effect people dont have much of an opinion of the police any more do they not even convicted murderers after i tell her i dont think shes actually in the best position to start demanding deals we sit there in complete silence like normally i can sit quietly for as long as you like if ive got an excuse to keep staring at a lovely woman but this one was somehow in control probably a status thing the nationally famous killer and the obscure provincial detective after about two minutes im going all right what is it what are you after mumfords shape in the doorway reduced the light to a corona around him sorry to disturb you boss its as we feared no chance of getting her into headquarters in the next four five hours until daylight in fact apparently seventeen roadsve been closed mostly this end of the county shucks we cant even get the body away where is he in the van on the car park you better tell all that to howe then bliss didnt sound too unhappy he turned to merrily the ice maidens finally discovered who natalie is and consequently has decided the interrogation requires a womans touch looks like youll have to do shed hate that wouldnt she frannie remind me to compliment the esteemed leader of hereford council on putting all our money into new shopping centres instead of winter maintenance we have the lady to ourselves lets dance the night away what did she say when you asked her what she was after she said id like to see my daughter alone as soon as you can arrange it and id also like at some point to talk to a church of england minister called the reverend merrily watkins naturally i ask her why and naturally she declines to tell me and when i write down this vicars name i ask her to spell it because naturally were unacquainted why do i still get the feeling you engineered this its what she said merrily i swear to god she didnt mention jane no thankfully she didnt mention jane it sounds as if she doesnt know im here then lets surprise her bliss said for some reason that escapes me despite all my training experience and natural flair some people seem to prefer to unburden themselves to you im not proud it could save time and if she tells me things in strict confidence then you can tell her what a basically nice understanding person i am and how much better shed feel sharing it all with me as distinct from the coldhearted friggin bitch awaiting her over in hereford should she decide to hold out merrily looked at the connecting door to the lounge can i make a call before i go in i need to make sure things are ok at home we have all the time in the world bliss said the sound of the breathing was like a recording amplified as though the tomb was an echo chamber and something had reanimated the ancient corpse in there most of her upper body was fused to the broken side of the tomb her legs were buried and a weight of snow had collected in her lap like ice cream heaped in a bowl only an inscripted slab of stone long ago dislodged had protected her face from the snow and in the torchlight it was as florid as lol remembered her tongue was out and there was a spittle ring around her mouth a dab of froth in one corner of her lips bubbling when the breath came through alive though tough ole bat lol knelt down in the snow brushing and pulling it away with both hands uncovering a pink quilted coat done up on the wrong buttons whispering alice all she did by way of reply was to go on breathing through her mouth the air siphoned out in the gap alongside her protruding tongue even her breath seemed cold shed had a stroke hed seen this before in one of the day rooms at the psychiatric hospital a woman with schizophrenia having a stroke in an armchair in front of the tv and her breathing filling the room he remembered another patient going to turn up the telly he peered into her face lopsided like half of it had collapsed her eyes closed the colours of alices face when you thought about it had always suggested high blood pressure hers likely wandered off what they do her age minds start goin lol began furiously to shovel the snow out of alices lap with cupped hands then began digging out her lower legs cold as marble the woman in the armchair the whitecoats had been very careful how they moved her that was in a centrally heated day room how long had alice been here an hour she should be dead he bent and put an arm under her shoulders prising them from the tomb he unzipped his parka pulled it off and put it around her shoulders digging with his other hand to find the crook of her knees until she came up in his arms shedding her shroud of snow knowing all the time that dexter harris had to be watching him from somewhere close sanctuary the easy chair and the sofa had been placed at right angles under the brassstemmed victorian standard lamp an intimate enclosure at the fireplace end of the long lounge there was a coffee table with two coffees on it served by the thickset policewoman whom bliss had called alma i thought i could wait just inside the door alma said to merrily its a big room im not going to hear anything you dont want me to i can sit there and read the paper merrily took off her coat and folded it over an arm of the sofa wouldnt it be possible for you to leave us completely alone i still might have to keep looking in on you got my instructions oh for gods sake brigid parsons said from the armchair what am i gonna do hold her hostage strangle her with her dog collar not wearing one merrily said youd have to garrotte me with the chain of my cross alma didnt smile someone had thrown a fresh green log on the fire making smoke and hiss and spiteful yellow flames blimey brigid parsons stretched out her long legs to the fireplace you really are janes mother arent you if you want anything alma said dont come out call me and ill come in she glanced over her shoulder before she went out of the lounge door the fire cracked and let go a fusillade of sparks brigid parsons stood up quickly and stamped on a firefly speck on the carpet ben foley tightarsed in all the wrong directions i mean come on whats a bag of coal cost she sat down again she wore tight jeans and a longsleeved black shirt with two or three buttons open displaying a silver pendant in the form of what looked like an owl a grey cardigan hung around her shoulders she pushed back a strand of dark brown hair from over an eye jane finally got you in indirectly which is the way it is with jane she doesnt actively work against you shes just indirect shes a good kid i like jane shes got a lively mind unlike poor little clancy but whose fault is that merrily sat down at the end of the sofa near her coat does she know clancy about me yeah yeah she does i wasnt going to tell her yet i was gonna wait till she left school i mean id always found it surprisingly easy not telling her you walk out of prison into singleparent accommodation and a new identity and that was kind of hard to get used to so i used to practise on her telling her all about the new me before she was even old enough to understand what on earth i was on about by the time she was two the old me was history sorted why were you going to wait till she left school oh because well for a start because clancy isnt like jane whod see it as a big challenge but also if i waited till she was eighteen shed have the option to walk away from you if she wanted to why did you tell her merrily drank some coffee it was good amber foley stanner halls only asset did somebody get on to you the press nah nothing like that i mean there was some of that quite a few years ago media trouble when clancy was little and i had to change the name again to craven when we ended up in craven arms it was like a bad joke it was a problem for me getting used to another surname less so for her i think she thought it was something everybody had to do every few years excuse me but are those cigs sticking out of your coat pocket want one merrily pulled out her silk cut and the zippo thanks its a big thing when you first get out not having to let one of the screws feel you up just to get yourself a fresh packet she took a cigarette and merrily lit it for her im sorry im being flip i dont feel flip i feel like shit naturally i can imagine brigid inhaled a lot of smoke and let it out slowly reason i told clancy about brigid and the reason basically that we came here was that a kid at school a boy was taking the piss out of clan because she was quite a bit behind the others wed moved around a lot with my jobs and wed just come up from cornwall and shed got behind and this kid was like oh youre backward youre esn taunting her i think he fancied her actually you know the oblique way they approach things at that age how was he to know what a raw spot this was so anyway she stuck a biro in his eye oh i mean like really stuck it in this wasnt one of your classroom semiaccidents some of the kids from school would go down the chip shop at lunchtime and she walked up to him in the street while he was eating his chips and she just stuck the flaming pen in his eye i mean hard hard enough that he needed surgery to save his sight in that eye the police were involved for a while but there was no charge but word gets out obviously and i had a call from my old minder ellie who was actually the detective whod arrested me and ellies like what you gonna do about this and she didnt know the half of it she didnt know about hattie but she saw a dangerous parallel im assuming you know what i mean i think so he lost an eye stuart did you know so we sat down one night last spring clan and me and i told her we sat there just like this drinking coffee only it was a bloody sight warmer of course it was after dawn before we went to bed together like sisters and she never went back to that school and that was when we came down here to live with jeremy brigid parsons sat up and looked around vaguely then leaned forward and tipped half an inch of ash into the grate merrily realized that shed hardly stopped talking since the policewoman had left them alone that was a bit of an icebreaker wasnt it brigid said merrily felt very odd it had been like two old mates catching up the socalled woman of god and the woman who as a teenager had lured a boy into some derelict industrial building and inflicted upon him was it fortyseven stab wounds they havent actually arrested me brigid said or do i mean charged someone like me they dont know how to play it its like asking the queen if she needs the toilet the redhaired scouser said weve brought you in to ask you some questions thats all i just said i did it hes like what and you could tell hed rather id said piss off copper you got nothing on me like he presumably gets from everybody else he looks at me like he cant wait to get my clothes off and into a plastic bag you told bliss you killed dacre absolutely and did you unless it turns out he had a heart attack on his way down yeah why it doesnt matter why hes dead i killed him end of story im not looking for absolution harold shipmans banged up for killing about three hundred of his patients but nobody knows why he did it thats because he hasnt even admitted doing it hes a doctor those bastards never admit killing anybody even by accident was this an accident merrily asked hey listen ive already been more cooperative than dr shipman and i was also more selective and i didnt want to talk about this to you i wanted to talk about clancy can i have another of those help yourself ta brigid picked up the zippo from the coffee table and lit her own cigarette this time leaning back with it merrily thats a very oldfashioned vicar sort of name isnt it most women clergy seem to have these monosyllabic dykenames im not i know youre not youre with this songwriter guy who was mentally ill and isnt sure where he stands he wasnt mentally ill he got sucked into the system would it have mattered if id been gay dont look at me like that i was inside for ten years hormones squirting out everywhere yeah maybe a little shes had enough situations to adjust to sorry clancy how much time do we have i dont know i think the head of hereford cid wants you taken over there for questioning she may get impatient she may send a snowplough she she wouldnt want you talking to me i think this is the only chance well get female authority figures like i need another one ok merrily brigid gazed steadily through the smoke heres the situation i dont belong to any church and im not sure what i believe ive never seen the ghost of my appalling grandmother and ive never felt her looking over my shoulder not i should say for want of trying id love it if we could meet earlier tonight janell tell you i mean earlier tonight there i was lying up in her room surrounded by creepy old photos of the bitch the biggest one i had to clean the glass and i did that by spitting in her face over and over again and then i lay there under her smeary picture looking at both of us in the dressingtable mirror anything happen did it hell no lights no images no sudden drops in temperature bitch why did you want to see her brigid ignored the question last week youve probably had this from jane ben and i got into a confrontation with one of the shooters sebastian hired and he made some contemptuous remark about jeremy blue light she looked at merrily for a reaction you attacked him ben was very gallant he said at least people might stop calling him a poof now he said he could understand it after the guy nearly shot clancy at the nant yeah i the guy wasnt expecting it of course and i think the first blow mustve smashed his nose what i didnt realize until ben was pulling me away was that i had a rock in my hand a jagged piece of what had been dressed stone about the size of half a brick i dont remember picking it up i suppose it must have been a reflex thing when ben and i first saw him coming towards us and we didnt know if he was armed and you still dont seem surprised what do you want me to say feel free to be shocked it still shocks me when i allow myself to think about it which isnt too often because i have to be at least halfway normal for clancy naturally im not unaware that this happened in roughly the place where my grandmother smashed the skull of my grandfather but i stress that i did not feel anything i didnt feel her with me you know does this sort of thing happen often i mean is it something you have to control i dont think control comes into it im not even an aggressive person i mean truly im not when i was inside nine times out of ten no hell more than that if someone had a go at me id deal with it and not in any extreme way you know only on a couple of occasions in nearly ten years was there anything and thats being bangedup and being bangedup can be trying what about the thing that got you in there merrily recoiled it was like two little steel shutters had come down over brigids eyes id heard you didnt talk about it whats the point you want some whingeing psychobabble psychiatrists and therapists every so often one would have a go at me sod that i dont make excuses i dont feel selfpity and i dont permit myself to feel pity for them i did my time i deserved it thats it it sounded like a litany one shed intoned many times and im not mentally ill like my mother and im not a drunk like my gran your mother was my mother at the age of seven tried to kill her sister she was rescued from a psychiatric hospital by my father not long after i was born she slashed her wrists in the bath lets not talk about it im not mad what youre probably too sane merrily said its whats scary one of a number of things actually you came here as owner of the nant done some homework then ive got a dossier on you too no a lawyer and an accountant see to all that i came because something had already happened well two things one like i said because clancy stuck a biro in a kids eye two because my dad was dead but before he died he told me what he shouldve told me years before told me about hattie and what happened at the big house we used to look at through the pines jeremy and me when i was a kid on holiday did your mother know about hattie shed cancelled hattie from her history at an early age but hattie came through or something did my mother was diagnosed as schizophrenic my dad was a male nurse who thought he could handle that and you really didnt know until my dad didnt know until he brought me up here to look at the nant and eddie berrows told him merrily said clancy the pen was that the only time i hope so look i said the shrinks never got anywhere with me and thats true but there was one guy he was the chaplain at my last place the open prison he was exarmy and he went back into the army as a chaplain a year or so later he was very posh but a bit of a rough diamond and we got on you know mates kind of the last year id go out for weekends and stay at his place with his wife and kids it was a laugh he wasnt holierthanthou and he had his problems and hed keep saying to me you need a better priest than me what did he mean by smoke from under the green log belched into the room like dragons breath and made merrily cough what he meant was a deliverance priest and he tried to explain what that meant but i was like sod off chas what am i demonic he we still stayed in touch after i came out and he mustve been in contact with ellie maylord because he rang me a couple of nights after she did about the biro incident id spoken to my dad by then and i told chas about hattie and i said even though i hadnt really made a decision at that stage that i was thinking about coming back here to suss all that out and he went a bit quiet well what did he think i was gonna be like my mother run away pretend it never happened even she finally realized that was futile the next night hes on the phone again im going to give you the name of someone who can help you i was still managing this hotel in shropshire and he faxed me some stuff over and it said the rev merrily watkins ledwardine he said he knew you and hed have a word with you if i wanted i said forget it no way stay the hell out of it whats his name chas charles headland the reverend you remember him merrily sank back into the sofa an image coming up of an unforgiving grey nonconformist chapel below the point of penyfan in the brecon beacons overlooking the valley of the shadow of death an illassorted bunch of anglican priests most of them nervous a couple overconfident trying to see across the valley i was on a course with him the course the deliverance course where we were trained to investigate the paranormal and told where to sprinkle the holy water i knew hed been in the army but he never said anything about being chaplain of a womens prison where is he now hes out of it hes not even a vicar any more he had a breakdown i didnt know it happened it happened to deliverance ministers in particular he faxed me a load of guff where you lived your phone number the fact that you had a daughter about clancys age who went to moorfield high school which was the only bit that was any use initially i didnt want clancy to go to the school at kington in case well i dont trust people i didnt want any risk of it getting out so i got clancy into moorfield which was a safeish distance away and i did ask her to look out for a girl called jane watkins if only for chass sake not realizing clancy was going to be practically stalking the poor kid merrily sat up brigid smiled ruefully shes quite good at not seeming to be doing it she has a talent for appearing forlorn and vulnerable merrily remembered jane telling her halfexasperated about the new girl who hung around looking all needy and alienated who was a year behind where she ought to be and therefore had to go into classes with little kids how they had absolutely nothing in common but she felt sorry for her and merrily began to feel uneasy it was me who got the foleys to offer jane a job brigid said i dont know why i did it really except that i supposed it would guarantee jane not becoming too fed up with clancy and i thought jane was probably good for her and amber kept offering to pay clancy to help out around the place and frankly i didnt want her around this place too much i suppose that while i wanted to find hattie chancery i didnt want hattie to find clancy if that makes any sense merrily nodded lighting another cigarette i got to know a woman called beth pollen whose husband had died and the suddenness of it had thrown her into spiritualism she was interested in stanner because hed been doing a paper on it and she was ok somebody i could trust amazingly so i did beth became the first person outside the system id ever just told who i was and what id done and she said that if there was an ancestral problem here a curse however seriously you want to take that as a description then we should address it from a position of knowledge between us we uncovered a lot of stuff about the chancerys and hattie and what she was like we went right back into it right back to ellen gethin who was the wife of black vaughan and killed this guy in cold blood after he killed her younger brother who the lounge door opened a crack and brigid turned and waved and the policewoman alma came in everything ok thanks merrily said alma went out and the door closed i still didnt want to involve you brigid said i didnt want us to have a halfarsed bloody exorcism not after we found out about the crazy thing the chancerys did when the guy over the fireplace may or may not have been in attendance i didnt want to resort to superstition if there was any way i dont know what i wanted jeremy did you want jeremy the question had kept pushing itself into merrilys head and she kept pushing it back she was aware that brigid had mentioned jeremy only in passing only in relation to some other point she was making the log on the fire was giving up there were no more flames brigid shivered and pushed her arms into her cardigan her mouth was wide and generous her eyes were warm with deep wry lines in the corners and she talked like she was already back behind bars i gather youve got quite a big vicarage in ledwardine seven bedrooms something like that just you and jane mmm i wont dress this up would you have room for clancy what thats my bottomline question when i go away again can clancy come and live with you i janes told clancy all about you and your situation janes done a lot of rabbiting because clan doesnt have much to say except to me brigid was talking rapidly now janes told her about the big vicarage and lol and how inhibited you are about that not wanting anybody to know not wanting to be seen as living in sin and yet youre big on the concept of the church offering sanctuary and you feel guilty about all those bedrooms doing nothing and look im sorry to hang it on you like this merrily but what other chance am i going to have brigid its natalie its natalie for the moment its natalie its a big step it could be the biggest thing you ever did i mean its too late for me right and yeah i feel very bad about putting this kind of responsibility on anybody but what happens if clancy goes into the system what happens if she goes into the system and somebody gets hurt or somebody dies go on tell me im being ridiculously superstitious tell me from your vast experience as a deliverance minister that im entirely irrational no youre not doesnt have to be a fulltime thing i realize that if jane thinks clancys a pain in the arse now that isnt going to improve i thought maybe danny and greta they got no kids i thought they could have her some of the time to take the pressure off thats why you sent her to greta tonight it was an opportunity i didnt realize obviously how tonight would turn out this wasnt a setup merrily it wasnt coldblooded listen the other thing is that money wont be a problem i know how pitifully little the clergy earn and i can pay you ten grand a year maybe a good bit more until shes twentyone its all arranged it isnt about what its about is spiritual security and i know its a huge thing to ask and i promise that if it goes wrong for her i will never never hold you in any way responsible natalie how long have you been planning this is that important and what about jeremy berrows the door opened again and blisss head appeared ladies five minutes frannie merrily said please before the door had closed she was leaning forward what about jeremy ive damaged him enough brigid said its best if he doesnt see me again best if he truly forgets me this time and thats all i want to say about it her face had become flushed and against the faded brocade of the chair she looked radiantly beautiful lit up by this powerfully incandescent raging sorrow merrily said tell me something did you ever love him at all or was he just the only man you could be around for any length of time without wanting to take him apart thats not fair natalie we dont have time for fair what do you brigid parsons dug her shoulders into the back of her chair pulling her cardigan tightly across the opening of her shirt as if it was a gash what do you know about jeremy anyway im just trying to work out from the bits youve let slip whether you came back here for jeremy or sebbie dacre you cant i mean to kill him kill dacre and i dont really know where that came from all i do know is how perilously close you came to killing them both what do you mean erm earlier tonight jeremy brigid parsons stood up so suddenly that she knocked over the coffee table and both cups whats he done bliss and alma exploded into the room followed by two male uniforms fatalist it had stopped snowing again but this only made the air seem colder and the sky darker alice was breathing up at it a damp soughing sound like the wind through rotting leaves alice was birdlike but she was soaked and felt like dead weight as lol waded through the orchard under the snowlagged limbs of apple trees that he never saw until it was too late because hed had to leave the maglite behind on the tomb along with alices shoes buried in the snow it seemed strange that when some snowfuzzed twig scraped her cheek she didnt wake up struggling and flapping cawing at him outraged he wondered if she would ever wake up again and what state shed be in if she did how much of her would be functioning salt and vinegar on that is it lovey or would the chip shop be under new management get em served and on to the next one dont give em too many chips neither lol stopped at the edge of the churchs own orchard the rhythm of alices breathing had fractured the indrawn breath suspended like a rollercoaster car pausing on a peak before clattering into the long valley and he thought christ shes gone he didnt know any more about strokes than what the condition looked like he didnt know whether the schizophrenic woman in the psychiatric hospital had lived or died only that they hadnt seen her again oh god alices breath shuddered back into the night lol quivering with relief the vicarage formed in front of them lightless just a different texture of night beyond it you ought to have been able to see sporadic lights in the hills but there was nothing there nothing to convey space or distance lols hands and alice connected with the wicket gate into the vicarage garden he had trouble with the latch had to put alice down in the snow felt her sinking but what else could he do he was so soaked and freezing in his gomer parry sweatshirt that he could hardly pick her up again he carried alice through the gate across the lawn to the path that circuited the house and then round to the front door which without a key hed left unlocked he backed into it completely black in here too risky to try and get her upstairs with no lights lol carried her into the kitchen where the old aga snored but where there was no sofa not even a big chair he was feeling for heat with the backs of his hands holding alice up he knew there was a rug on the floor to the side of the stove before you reached the window he found it with his feet and lowered her and roughly rolled up his parka and pushed it between her head and the wall stood up and felt his way to the refectory table where there were chairs with cushions you could pull out collected four and took them back to where alice lay a small pile of clothes with a noisy pump inside he began feeding two cushions behind her head against the wall alice moaned and he thought her hands moved alice he felt her falling forward keep her head up dont let her swallow her tongue alice said whosat alice lol said if you can hear this its she wouldnt know him im getting a doctor ok youre safe wangohome youre safe but she was still as crispycold as a sack of peas out of the deepfreeze pummedown dexer pummedown alice im going to ring for some help just dowannago a hand clawing at him unexpectedly strong pummedown dexer hes not here alice its ok dexters not here but almost as he spoke he knew by the drifting odour of sweat and something else that he couldnt define a gross swelling in the air that he was wrong left alone again brigid and merrily gathered up the crockery from the burnscarred carpet in front of ben foleys sour hissing fire of green softwood merrily got out her cigarettes there were only two left in the packet she placed it on the arm of brigids chair brigids face was candlewhite why didnt i think dannys with him merrily said you know danny hell stay there all night cant stay for the rest of his life and would you have given the chance brigid said i thought we were meant right from the beginning the one thing i could never forgive my dad for was intercepting jeremys letters and even worse he found some way of stopping my letters to jeremy getting out i still dont know who he persuaded or how he did it because you did what you did soon after coming here and he found out about hattie he didnt believe anything and yet he obviously convinced someone that any correspondence from the area of stanner would not be healthy they sat for a while in a pool of quiet brigid didnt touch the cigarettes the bulb in the standard lamp went dim and then stammered back to life if the power goes theyll probably handcuff me to the banisters at the bottom of the stairs brigid found a crumpled tissue in her jeans and roughly stabbed at her eyes with it she stared into the dismal fire and merrily thought of the everlasting furnace in jeremys livingroom range and was startled when brigid said i never changed a thing you know he kept on at me to move things around have brighter colours impose me on the nant but i never touched a single ornament did you want to every day but better it looked as though youd never been there at all if you werent permitted to stay merrily took a breath why did he do it its not for me to brigid dug her fingers into her forehead he thought he was doing it for me thats all i want to say people couldnt get their heads around it you and jeremy people are crass and stupid and superficial educated townies with weekend cottages tend to venerate country folk touching isnt it always venerating the wrong ones never people like danny thomas and that little guy gomer certainly never jeremy berrows always the loud bastards who know everything and nothing sebbie dacre and the old mistress of the hunt brigid looked up i can feel her can you over there where that bookcase is thats where the shelves were where she kept the trophy stones for robert davies to look up at and eat his heart out how do i know i dont actually but when i picture that scene this is the room when the light faded a minute ago i thought thats her merrily said i ive been asked to help see her off the premises how do you feel about that i have to keep explaining to people merrily looked at the cigarette packet then put it out of her mind you can exorcize evil in an abstract or spiritual form with possiblyevil people we run into problems you hate the whole idea of hattie chancery you want someone to come along and point a crucifix and send her screaming into oblivion and you cant neither can i put her in a snuffbox under a stone at the bottom of hergest pool you picked up on all that i dont know how relevant it is it seems faintly daft sitting here with you in your situation discussing fairy tales maybe you should talk to beth pollen brigid said frannie bliss took merrily into an office behind reception steered her into the swivel chair at the desk on the edge of which he sat so that he was looking down at her she felt for her cigarettes realized shed left them in the lounge you want to know why she killed dacre call me a completist merrily but that would be nice this seemed to be ben foleys personal desk it had gold inlaid bits and a small framed photograph of amber smiling through the steam rising from two cooking pots ok she knew that what she was about to tell him would at some stage take a slow turn away from the truth whatever the truth was we did a deal she wanted two things i agreed to both bliss looked curious but didnt ask she told him how brigid parsons had inherited the nant although everyone thought that jeremy berrows owned it how the dacres had been trying to buy it for years how it had become a focus for sebbie and at some stage quite recently he appears finally to have discovered the true identity of the woman with jeremy berrows finally hed probably had his suspicions for a long time the printout pinned to the sign couldve been him letting her know that he knew merrily said and putting the name brigid into circulation at stanner hall causing unease perhaps demonstrating how precarious things were for her it must have gone up yesterday at the earliest so so were looking at blackmail merrily shrugged it would do lets get this right bliss said dacre threatens to expose her explode her new identity have the press down here in busloads unless she sells him the nant he sat down opposite merrily of course the sensible thing wouldve been to flog him the farm for as much as she could get and then bugger off with the proceeds and change her identity again youre forgetting about jeremy welded body and soul to the nant and theyre really an item those two think romeo and juliet twenty years on in minor key they could always have gone off together maybe half of him would go maybe not the half shed want jeez what is it with this area scrubby land lousy winters merrily said youve heard about the shooters going on to jeremys land coming on heavy those guys from off right therefore less inhibited i cant help wondering if that was less to do with terrorizing jeremy than indicating to brigid what life might be like for him if she didnt cooperate clumsy but very sebbie by all accounts no youre right he wouldnt get the local shooting club to do some of that would he what about the final act less forthcoming there im afraid yeh well to my knowledge shes never said a word about mark and stuart in all these years the guardian once ran a story based on an interview with one of their former schoolmates who reckoned mark tried to rape her inference was stuart too but stuarts still alive and hes gorra lawyer nice opening for brigid to make a statement but not a word its as if merrily hesitated tapping ben foleys blue blotter as if the acts of violence are committed by a different person and she isnt qualified to comment on them youve heard all about hattie chancery i suppose at length from mrs pollen im not allowed to be remotely interested no merrily slowly shook her head she felt very tired frannie what can i say i know what she did and i liked her merrily i fancied her what difference does that make none at all i suppose to you he had a case to build the law was a pile of rough stones all right what do you think happened up there bliss said well we can assume she met dacre at the van to which she still had a spare key to discuss the final arrangements in a place where both of them knew they wouldnt be seen together especially on a night like this and he went knowing who she was and what shed done in the past distant past plus youre talking about a man whos not known for being afraid of much certainly not the weather or a woman was this convincing she wasnt sure it would be especially if it subsequently came out that dacre knew who had damaged nathan the shooter and gets pushed over when hes not expecting it bliss wrinkled his nose personally given the conditions merrily said i wouldnt have ruled out it being to some extent accidental did you ask her wouldnt go into it what about the van i dont know we gather she was entertaining a man in there was that sebbie might she have wanted to destroy any evidence of that itd make it worse for berrows if he found that out shes dacres first cousin merrily if it wasnt for first cousins there wouldnt be any population to speak of between here and aberystwyth anything else not really if you ask her questions aimed vaguely towards those answers thats what you should end up with so why if you dont mind me asking did she want to see you when you came out of there she looked bloody awful she looked for the very first time in fact like somebody whos about to be charged with murder mmm merrily looked down at the desk photo of amber through the cooking steam there had been only one hard and binding agreement between her and brigid and that was a mutual silence about jeremy berrowss attempted suicide had jeremy known about the blackmail and decided because he was afraid of what brigid might otherwise do to remove himself from an unsolvable equation to make it so that she would no longer have any reason or wish to hold on to the nant she still didnt know and maybe the answer didnt matter merrily saw jeremy growing old and silent alone at the nant while brigid spent the rest of her life hardening a new prison skin it was desperately sad she wanted to put her head on the desk and weep and then sleep come on what did she want from you bliss said it wont go out of this office she wanted me to adopt her daughter more or less merrily youre kidding doesnt want her in care and she doesnt have any suitable relatives and she doesnt want to burden jeremy berrows or put him in a difficult position bloody hell i mean you cant blame her for trying but cheeky cow he looked at her suspiciously as she pulled out her mobile you didnt tell me you really didnt she wouldnt look at him im supposed to be a christian what was i supposed to say bliss let out a lot of breath in a thin whistle for gods sake merrily he didnt ask what else shed agreed to as soon as merrily was out of that office she rang lol again no answer this was starting to get worrying she rang hereford police and asked for annie howe they put her on hold and then came back and said they couldnt find howe would she like to call back merrily found a local phone book prosser would that be a business number or private would it come under the name of the shop she peered at the small print she needed reading glasses this had been obvious for a while but you tried to resist it problem vicar gomer sorry i was looking for jim prossers number at the eight till late i need to talk to lol thats all and the phones not working i need somebody to go round i thought maybe big jim as he gets up early to see to the papers and as he was big four two one three double six vicar gomer said but he ent usually up till five and i knows for a fact they has their machine on all night oh she shut the book hard trouble back home its possible like to help vicar but its been comin down like a bugger out there i know gomer i wasnt suggesting anything means wed have to use dannys tractor stead of the truck take a while with the ole plough on mind merrily blinked is that feasible ten minutes to get down to the nant pick up the tractor less o course danny comes straight yere but then theres jeremy cant really leave the boy you could always bring him here if hed come merrily looked over at the two police on the door of the lounge where brigid parsons waited earlier the wpc alma had escorted her to the lavatory and back gomer are you sure about this its not been this bad in years and all them bad years i was in it waistdeep gomer beamed there seemed to be more light in his glasses than in any of the bulbs around the walls ok merrily beckoned him towards the porch i may be worrying unnecessarily but you need to know what this is about merrily stood for a moment watching the tail lights of gomers truck disappear when she turned round jane was behind her in the porch i saw you go in is she ok not really shes confessed to killing dacre the kids face was threatening to crumble like biscuit shes covering for somebody i dont think she is i really dont but like how could she think she could possibly get away with it im not sure she even wanted to shes a fatalist but whod want to go back to grey walls and bitterness and bitchiness and gay sex and dope smuggled in to take you out of it what a terrible totally heartbreaking waste of two lives merrily said i didnt really believe in them at first but you said go back i heard something from mrs pollen who told you bliss its unbelievable isnt it bloody devastating who else knows flower amber thats it i hope wheres clancy still with dannys wife and a policewoman im glad shes not here i know it sounds terrible and i know what shes been through and what she must be going through now but clancy yeah i know hard going the squares of glass all around them in the porch were glistening and opaque like frosted icetrays i also talked to matthew hawksley i know id already told them that you couldnt be expected to take that on without weeks of preparation and backup they walked back into the lobby it was quiet now and gloomy merrily noticed that three of the bulbs in the chandelier had gone out and it hung there gleaming faintly like one of the roastchicken carcasses an old neighbour of her mothers used to string up for the birds to peck at what do we do now jane said merrily fingered her pectoral cross nodded at the steps to the kitchen tell them ill need another hour at least jane backed off you cant i can try i told them you wouldnt i told them youd need i told them youd even have to talk to the bishop i probably should but i dont see there being time jane backed away staring at her you look knackered im fine mum its because merrily took one of janes hands squeezed it because brigid asked me to do two things for her and this was maybe the easiest mum i dont think she even believes in god she believes in love thats got to be nearly as embarrassing what was the other thing we can talk about that later merrily said can i borrow your room to prepare you do not know what youre taking on janes face was creased up with tiredness and concern you dont know how far back this goes do you all the time you go on at me about putting myself at risk and youre putting yourself in the path of something unknowable jane because you dont want to look uncaring and wimpish the reason youre not waking up the bishop is you know what hed say give me a break ok merrily tried to pull the kid closer but jane dragged her hand away what could you say she was probably right is that erm frank jane packed herself into a corner near the porch with the mobile i dont know im still half asleep look its its jane from stanner we met at the murdermystery weekend i brought the chocolate i see this is your revenge for being dragged out of bed to find a body sorry oh right yeah no listen im really sorry to wake you but this is pretty urgent ill be dead straight and upfront about this my mothers the diocesan exorcist for hereford and shes been asked to do something tonight to deal with the presence of hattie chancery and ive seen the tape that ben recorded with old leonard and you were there and all i want to know is what leonard said after ben finished recording what makes you think he said anything frank sampsons voice acquiring focus just a feeling and the way bens behaving so ask ben well hes hes been a bit funny lately honestly frank i wouldnt bother you in a million years if i didnt think this was like crucial you know are you crying of course im not i just im not quite sure what youre asking well im not either if i just if i just tell what im worried about i mean without going into the ins and outs of exorcism if hattie chancery was in some way haunting this place he chuckled i think something is dont you nobodys had any luck there well right but if she was a presence there what would be the significance of that and how would it tie in with the really old stuff black vaughan and everything and the exorcism leonard was talking about what happened at that exorcism but was it what was it an exorcism it was supposed to be a restaging of the exorcism of black vaughan wasnt it but they had a medium didnt they erasmus cookson why would they need a medium at an exorcism perhaps they didnt want to exorcize black vaughan at all but to communicate with him or someone who jane i dont feel too happy about discussing this on the phone i think you need to talk to do you know mrs pollen the living dark heart in the kitchen lol was standing over alice blinking focusing hard on anything that seemed paler than black and dexters voice was curling out of the hall what you gonner do now mister lol alices breathing was much louder in here like an old steam train might have sounded in a station give us a song is it how about you go and find the doctor dexter i dont think so boy id better call then you dont listen do you mister lol dexters voice had a glasspaper rasp lol was sure that alice could hear all this he laid a hand on her shoulder it was supposed to be reassuring it was trembling look lol said its like this shes had a stroke and shes wet through and suffering from exposure if we piss about for too long shes going to die he gently squeezed her shoulder trying to convey that he was only trying to scare dexter and moved away from her easing off his wellingtons flexing his toes on the flags putting his hands out to feel for the familiar and finding the edge of the refectory table how quick dexter said lol stopped how quick you reckon she gonner die i said shed die if we didnt get a doctor half an hour kent asprey thats his name isnt it the local gp fuck off lol went quiet of course alice had tried to tell him alice had told him she hadnt wandered into the churchyard in search of solace and then collapsed shed had the stroke at home and dexter had come back from the chip shop and found her comatose and had dragged on her coat and outdoor shoes and carried her along the orchard path into the churchyard and left her to die there of exposure confident that nobody would go there until well after daybreak by which time she would be long gone frozen to the stones go on try and think of something more rational than that the banality of evil smalltime squalid local evil as huge and coldly bloated as the night sky wheres the torch boy left it in the churchyard couldnt manage the torch and alice you knob whereabouts you keep your candles wheres the matches dont know if there are any naw that little bitch smokes like a chimney where are they lol didnt live here he didnt know where the candles were or the matches get a doctor dexter lol saw a slice of grey possibly one of the kitchen windows he saw a tiny green glow in the air smoke alarm reverted to the battery when the power went off dexter said hers goin back boy hers goin back in that graveyard oh no no going back now you cant put us both in the graveyard dexter landfill site for you boy theyll find alice natural causes no problem theyll never find you youre missin i got a mate in landfill no problem back o the truck easypeasy got no choice look because you killed darrin silence lol didnt move i never dexter said yeah i know it was a van right like it was a lorry killed roland alice whimpered there was a movement like a great claw descending then another dexter shifting handfuls of air to find him he could smell dexter now a blend of beer sweat and petrol lol moved behind the table what did roland do to you come on what tell alice you owe it to alice little fuck dexter moving slowly around the table towards him the squeak of his leather jacket he was gonna tell someone about the cars lol moving round the table on the other side all the cars you were nicking you and darrin i never nicked no cars no ok darrin nicked them because you wanted to drive them darrin was older but he was smaller and weedier lol sliding between the table and sink darrin did everything his big cousin told him because he was shitscared thinking magnetic knife rack on this wall row of kitchen knives in ascending sizes butter knife to bread knife to carving knife edging round the end of the table thinking how could he use a knife for heavens sake bit of luck dexter that crash at allensmore or what then dexter went fuuuuuu jarring sound of wood scraping stone jolting pain in both lols thighs as the table was slammed into him jamming him into the sink who needs luck dexter said a wrenching now the table dragged aside and where in gods name was asthma when you needed it lol felt the breeze of dexters massive fist sailing past his head he swayed the wrong direction and the next blind jab was into his left cheek a knuckle stabbing up into his eye dislodging his glasses he slammed his fist into where he thought dexters gut was hit leather a metal zip crap at this a fleshy hand around his chin tossing his head back into the wall with a crack and a wild white shooting pain his glasses gone the black air bursting torn from the wall slammed down into the flags kicked in the chest in the stomach the pain explosive lol retched curling into a ball rolling and squirming until he came up against a leg of the table his gut spasming christ it didnt take long did it best thing look dexters boot coming in again is if you just lie still and think of fucking the vicar or whatever you want cause i ent gonner stop look i ent got no choice you knows that and i ent got no time with alice to take back to her grave so you just fuckin lie there quiet and peaceful and you takes it till its over all right mister lol uhhh boot ripping across his face lol lay still pain fear indignity hopelessness coalescing in the air he could hear alices hollow breathing then a singing in the air dexters boot going for his head again missing he tried to haul himself across the floor sensed the foot drawn back for the big one pushed his head back into the flags licked stone an indrawn breath then a jarring crunch just above his ear and dexter grunting hed kicked the table leg sounded like lol heard him backing off boots scraping on the flags and lol rolled away scrambling to his feet bringing on pulses of pain like being knifed all over fear overcoming agony thinking fast thinking dexter would expect him to go for the main door into the hall so going the other way flattening himself into the far wall looking hard into nothing across the room the hall door slammed dexter cutting off the main exit silence now except for alice and the aga and lol had the sense of dexter moving very quietly around the room eyes unseeing hands poised figured if he could get into the scullery he could open the window slide out into the strip of garden bordering the orchard into the fresh cold air and the kiss of snowflakes dexter stumbled and hissed lols fingers found the scullery door shut no the sound of him bending the handle down would bring dexter back here faster than he could open the door and then it would all be over very quickly because he didnt think he could even stand upright worst thing of all even without his glasses he could see dexters shape now blundering towards the aga like a prowling troll outlined in the greenish sheen of the smoke alarm light a little glow around it and he knew that the alarm bulb the size of the smallest pea in the tin would soon be as good as lighting the whole room and dexter would have him again last time ent nowhere to go boy as if dexter had seen his thoughts neonlit in the blackness lol edged very slowly one foot at a time along the wall to the second door this one opened into the passage leading to the rear door of the vicarage and the back stairs the rear door was always locked and the key kept where couldnt remember jane had a key because this had once been her private front door the way up to her apartment until using it got to be too much of a drag the second door was not quite shut and lol rested his shoulder against it knowing that it nearly always creaked he could get through all right but the noise would tell dexter where hed gone if he could get upstairs into merrilys bedroom with its phone if dexter would just make some kind of covering noise when i gets you gonner make it all hurt real bad i promise it was enough lol leaned back against the door to the back stairs and with a creak even he barely heard he was through he went directly for the narrow stairs no point in even trying for the back door tripping over the first step and going down on his hands and then up the stairs that way his hands finding the next steps his bruised stomach screaming at him to stop he collapsed on the top step and just just breathed taking in real air letting it come out in a rush lying on his back hands out on either side feeling the rough plaster covering the old wattle and daub when he tried to get up he nearly passed out with the pain started to slide back down the stairs come on boy sod it lol said wearily youre stuffed you know that theyll find your dna all over her but mainly yours boy and youll have gone youll have buggered off they ent gonner find you lol looked back down the steep and malformed back staircase in search of light this was the throat down which you dropped into the belly of the house he saw a vague smear of grey perhaps the small window alongside the back door he sensed that the door at the end of the passage at the bottom of the stairs was still open to the kitchen and dexter somewhere very close he tried to stand up a foot skidded off the edge of a stair and he shuffled down three of them thats it boy alice is dyin to see you alice we needs it now more than ever the holy spirit the holy eucharist clear challenge there to the remorseless evil represented in dexter harris they were going to drag him into a public place so that the bornagain darrin could publicly denounce him before god something in dexter had sent him out in search of an answer to that why the churchyard dexter lol croaked why did you take the trouble to bring alice all the way to the church couldve left her in the orchard might have been days before she was found why the churchyard ritual behaviour dexter wouldnt understand why hed done it whyd you take darrin back to the scene of the crash dexter one small greasy cog in the huge and complex machinery of evil poor darrin lol said he couldve had everything the repentant sinner takes all including the chip shop the voice roared up like out of a windtunnel that cunt pretend you changed your ways sorry for what you done thats how you gets out of jail quicker he never found no fuckin religion he i think he did dexter but if he was dead whod know one way or the other come on boy you cant get out for the snow anyway i can get out dexter was back on his high everything going his way couldnt lose hey guess what i found nice set o knives on the wall you gonner come and have a look how about i gives alice a little prod see if hers gone yet real nasty look stuck his knife in the back of my hand once had an airgun shot a robin in the garden no im coming down good boy bloody hell dexter lol said where are you from youre a walking curse youre the living dark heart of your own family youre a big walking disease lol took the crooked swollen steps steadily a hand on each wall and his aching head way above everything the attic the snowcovered stone tiles up in the teeming night sky the last time it was like this he was on stage in the courtyard in hereford finding out that people still wanted to hear his songs after all these years he was glad hed done that by the time he was close to the bottom of the stairs he could hear dexter in the kitchen doorway panting it was rage of course dexter had a limited emotional range it was an encouraging sound but it wasnt hey lol said that wouldnt be a touch of the old asthma coming on would it can you manage to find your inhaler in this light or will you have to suck your own he reached the bottom before he was expecting it and stumbled and twisted and the agony from somewhere in his abdomen brought him to his knees you what are you dexter lol whispered what are you he climbed back onto the third step and sat down remembering the white high of just a few hours ago sitting barefooted on the rug in the scullery in the orange glow of the electric fire thinking about the woman in the kitchen with the lights turned down low warm love he closed his eyes heard dexter coming at him all meat and malevolence in the total night and saw lucy devenish alongside him with her poncho spread like bat wings you have to learn to open up lucy said let the world flow into you again losers on the first landing merrily encountered a portly greyhaired man in a wellcut threepiece suit very neat and compact and selfassured the kind of man who sauntered he was leaning on the banisters gazing down the curve of the stairs and turned as she came up mrs watkins have we met he pointed at the pectoral cross cant be too many of those around here tonight another eleven and wed be ready to take on black vaughan he laughed alistair hardy i guessed my daughters just been telling me how you were in communication with an old friend of ours he tilted his head in a poncho ah he said personally i didnt think it was lucys style but there you go youre sceptical about the spirit world hell no im just sceptical about spiritualists she came to lean on the banisters next to him the lighting down there was too dim the walls cried out for huge portraits in ornate gold frames sorry im not usually this rude i think it must be past my bedtime mine too hardy said they even went to the trouble of fitting out a magnificent chamber for me the one where mrs davies shot herself whose idea was that i wish i knew have you been in there no well ill tell you something mrs watkins im not a timid man as you can imagine but i have to tell you i could no more sleep in that room than on a bed of nails she looked at him fleshy well fed comparatively unlined it was disturbing how untroubled some of these people appeared coasting through life the greatest fear of all having been removed its funny she said i never think of spiritualists acknowledging the idea of evil its always seemed a bit tame not quite right but yeah you never seem to accept the possibility of risk hardys eyes narrowed hmm he smiled and nodded and walked away in the centre of the great island unit there was this small earthenware crucible in which incense was burning fat candles sat in glass bowls placed at the cardinal points on the worktop and all the electric lights in the kitchen had been switched off so that the ambience of the room was one of like shivery motion jane thought of the fire on the rocks how elemental that had looked how basic it had turned out to be antony largo had two cameras set up on tripods both bigger and more technicallooking than the sony hed given her and which he now gave her again youre joking jane said look dont give me a hard time huh hen just the two of them down here largo cocked his head peering into her face i never had you down as a prima donna you never had me look a crucial set piece like this id usually have three experienced people at the very least tonight well obviously bens gonna be in the movie unless we get ourselves a spectral manifestation hes gonna be the star so hes no help therefore im gonna leave this wee implement with you its fully charged you can choose to shoot stuff or not but therell only be the two of us maybe youll see things i miss i cant be in two places at once jane felt her hands closing around the sony like they were betraying all her finer principles she turned away as the first footsteps sounded on the stone stairs not yet antony strode out hands aloft ill tell you when jane held her watch to a candle it was nearly four am antony waved her away into the shadows and moved over to the farthest tripod bending over the camera ok he said in five when they came in even jane could tell that most of them were rigidly selfconscious didnt know where to look you might have expected some small element of anticipation but they were kind of shuffling like some ragbag band of medieval lepers in search only of relief beth pollen first her white hair pulled back and secured with one of those leather things with a stick through it beth pollen who lost her husband and fell among spiritualists but who had been a good friend to natalie then ben in his edwardian jacket over a white shirt not as dangerous as hed seemed only hours ago just badly wasted the old sense of suave long gone amber well amber was as normal her gaze wandering to the big french stove making sure that nobody had glued candles to her big steel hotplate matthew hawksley was looking crumpled his white jacket well creased alistair hardy was in his conmans business suit with his hands behind his back looking like hed come to value the place losers jane thought as they took their places on high wooden stools around the island unit their faces shimmering in the candlelight hardy was at the top of the table missing was natalie craven over whom a pile of circumstantial evidence towered like stanner rocks nobody spoke it looked like the setup for virtually every phoney seance scene that jane had seen on television but maybe this was what largo wanted this wasnt a serious documentary this was cheap naff reality tv coming from the same kind of factory as all that airport crap and the bollocks set in hairdressing salons true to his word though antony didnt make them all go out and come in again more realistically he wasnt invisible but he was moving around unobtrusively enough with another little handheld sony jane was aware of the tiny red light glowing on the second tripod camera long shots from two angles then with meaningful closeups by antony largo he slid back to the tripod at the top of the room refocused then he lifted a finger and brought it down pointing at ben ben cleared his throat well good morning and i think its a morning when none of us will be altogether sorry to see daylight murmurs and smiles jane thinking buggered if im shooting any of this because of the weather there are fewer of us than anticipated but i think the essential people are here most of them to be honest i think weve all been shattered by whats happened tonight and as we really dont know how its going to turn out ben looked directly into antonys camera im sorry antony i really dont know how safe i am i dont know how much of this is going to be sub judice do i ok antony stepped out for anyone in doubt heres the situation the police tell me that someone is likely to be charged with murder sometime today the whole thing then becomes noscreen until after the trial if im any judge of anything i would see this going out at the earliest possible opportunity after sentencing in other words you can all say what the hell you like beth pollen said and how do the police feel about us doing this now antony grinned kind of piratical in the candlelight if i may quote the senior investigating officer anything that keeps these weirdo bastards out of my hair for a couple of hours is perfectly fine by me nobody laughed as long we understand where we are ben said i um was also given the impression that mrs watkins would be joining us is that im here mr foley mum was sitting on the steps like some sort of elf jane hadnt even noticed her instinctively she switched on her camera super matthew hawksley stood up pulling out another stool its ok mum said im not staying i mean very pretty and everything but im sorry i really wouldnt feel too happy about conducting a religious ceremony in erm she waved a hand at the candles titanias boudoir im sorry too beth pollen said but we were very firmly given the impression im not backing out mum said im just not doing it down here jane noticed alistair hardy straightening up on his stool looking disturbed mum smiled nor in hattie chancerys room i erm i thought we might use the dining room if thats ok its a bit cold but mrs watkins antony abandoned his camera not only is it as you so perceptively noted a bit too cold but it has absolutely no bloody atmosphere either its got a stainedglass window which like all stainedglass windows doesnae function as intended at night mum stood up shrugging im sorry that thats really not my problem antony largo looked furious deep in the shadows and in spite of natalie and jeremy and the whole depressing situation jane momentarily grinned carry on here by all means mum said but if you want to join me say twenty minutes had this been an authentic castle or even a manor house there would have been a chapel the dining room with its secular stained glass was no substitute the stainedglass window was thick as a boarded barn door and the air felt milky and astringent worst of all when merrily knelt on the thin carpet and prayed it was like tossing stones down a bottomless well but at least it was empty and it was dark she said the lords prayer and st patricks breastplate she prayed for lol having tried the number again and found it continuously engaged and then when it started ringing again had no answer another bottomless well blank minutes passed she stood up halfrelieved when the door opened and jane slid in and waited there in silhouette hands behind her back ten years old again you offended antony i suppose thats going to screw us for getting diy sos into the vicarage merrily said wearily this is channel four i know and i dont think i want to be on tv again you could say a flat no to antony i dont think wed have time for the row that would cause time the time is nearly up what do you want me to do jane asked to be honest flower i dont really want you here at all but if youve got to stay sure carry on with the camerawork i mean do you want me to do anything well you could see if you could find me a jar preferably one that hasnt had alcohol in it and fill it with water youre going to bless it uhhuh but first if you could give me a hand with these tables they put on the lights and pushed two of the dining tables together under the stainedglass window with the ceiling lights on the glass was the colour of dried mud why here jane asked why this room oh well its kind of neutral isnt it its a big open space no crannies no cupboards unlike the kitchen also the kitchens too close to stanner rocks i havent seen it in daylight but i get the feeling the kitchens dominated by the rocks isnt that the point erm mum whats the matter huh listen i rang this guy who knows something about the history of this place at this time in the morning i apologized basically he told me that what the chancerys did when they invited conan doyle might not have been a simple reenactment of the vaughan exorcism they well obviously they had this medium there so they might have been trying to communicate with vaughan in the spirit of the new you know secular science of spiritualism like after all there was nothing to suggest thomas vaughan was a bad guy i mean did he even need exorcising in the first place but why do it here this is not hergest court is it vaughan was never here he said ask beth pollen merrily thought of brigid everybody says that frannie bliss slipped in through the connecting door from the lounge he stood there taking in the rearrangement the two candlesticks on the dining table the holy water in a new decanter catholics allowed how do catholics feel about spiritualism frannie bliss waggled a hand conveying this way that way you believe in it not when im on duty merrily i accept that this is a private establishment thats been good enough to accommodate the police and were in no position to question whatever else might be taking place here as long as its legal but your selection of this particular room too close frankly i wondered if the proximity of our guest might in some way have conditioned your choice of venue if you can find a room in this place that looks more like a church all right just were not talking about an actual exorcism are we its a word that functions on several levels aw shit merrily you know what im asking looking at it from the angle that the law will not to brigids advantage i should emphasize allow me to look at it we have a number of close parallels here with the grandmother of the suspect now if during the course of your activities here my prisoners eyes happen to turn blood red if only we had annie howe in charge merrily said annie howe simply would not believe that could happen so what is going to happen merrily perched on the edge of one of the dining tables now pushed back against the walls while the chairs had been arranged in a semicircle around the makeshift altar a little like sunday nights in ledwardine church well the original plan by the white company and ben foley appeared to be to try and contact whatever remains of conan doyle to find out if he really did get the inspiration for the hound of the baskervilles from the welsh border rather than from dartmoor i wouldnt mind starting with that youre attending a seance itll be an experience i dont like this spiritually youve always been conservative lack of confidence frannie as a teenager i used to wear goth frocks and black lipstick youre worried about something youre nervous when youre flip youre nervous ive noticed it before detectives merrily said always got to throw it in your face when she walked back into the lobby jeremy berrows was sitting in the chair by reception with his scarf around his neck staring at the lounge door like a dog outside his masters wake was anyone better placed to hold up a small candle into the heart of the darkness when merrily had talked to him at the nant jeremy had obviously been guarded fearing the worst but now the worst had happened nothing to lose cheap phrase never more true the thing is jeremy were all from off shed pulled up a chair next to his its none of our business really and yet all the problems seem to have been caused by incomers who couldnt leave anything alone incomers moved out wouldnt be nobody left at all jeremy said except you jeremy smiled probably the bleakest smile that merrily had ever seen on anyone living it was as if his suicide had been in essence a success she had a stark image of him one day years hence being found dead by the postman or the feed dealer halfmummified beside the ashes of his fire a shell a husk it looked as if the process had already begun the image arrived so suddenly that it was as if hed passed it to her she was suddenly desperate to help him to pull at least one person from the mire of myth and madness jeremy they want me to try and deal with whatever came through hattie chancery to paula to brigid he looked at her they knows not all of them do you believe it came from hattie chancery come through her mabbe so where does it come from how far back does it go wheres all evil come from for instance have you ever seen the hound he glanced back at the lounge door just a shadow a few folk seen him time to time it dont mean nothin no death no disaster but if you were a vaughan in the old days so they reckoned what about now is there someone it still means something to who if they saw it would feel there was reason to be afraid jeremy swallowed dacre the chancerys it came to mean the same to the chancerys the dacres as it did to the vaughans jeremy loosened his scarf a little sebbie dacres ole lady margery her once come over to our place hell of a state my mam told me this i was nmoren a babby at the time margery reckoned her seen it twice next thing paulas died margery connected that with the hound sure to her said better all round if the child died too she was scared of something being passed on jeremy nodded swallowed but it didnt affect margery did it her never hurt nobody fars i know but paula was the oldest see but margery believed shed seen the hound and sebbie rumours zelda morgan one of his lady friends reckoned he seen someing made him real upset and then he hires these boys from down wales he didnt really think theyd bring him the hound dead like in the novel dont reckon he seen hisself partin with seven grand thats what you means but he kept sending the shooters up to stanner and across your land and down to the nant of course because of thems the two places natlie was he connected the hound with her he knew who she was i dont reckon he knowed for sure but what was a woman that lovely doing with the likes of me he wasnt daft he was mad but he wasnt daft and i reckon he knowed the time was nearly up the lease sure tbe and he wanted the ground the idea of someone else occupying a farm right in the middle of his this offended him so possibly this was some kind of crude threat maybe aimed at brigid though youd have thought it would have made him the very last person shed want to sell to well a sheen of sweat on jeremys forehead now i think he reckoned it was coming off the nant see paulas land the hound whether he was really seein someing out there or he seen someing that wasnt outside of his mind either way part of him would believe a death was coming likely his own jeremy looked down at the table or hers it was him or her i reckon what thing is see jeremy said he always figured he was out on the edge anyway so hed go around creatin situations trouble and hed get away with it magistrate country landowners all this countryside alliance protest stuff war in the fields and the woods and the ole gentry right there in the middle of it defendin whats theirs if there was anybody exacly like hattie chancery my mam used to say it was sebbie the huntin the booze he dint care never got nicked for drinkdrivin cops liked him their kind of magistrate no mercy no sobstories send em down put em away robber baron danny calls him but when brigid when big weale the lawyer died and sebbie found out who really owned the nant that was when he got real paranoid and the time was nearly up he knowed that but he couldnt say he knowed what hed do way he was hed cause trouble set up dangerous situations just to see what come out of it like them welshies troublemakers off their patch offer of big money explosive situation mabbe he figured somebody was gonner get killed then thered have been a death i dunno he werent right in the bloody head bad bad blood jeremys head went down into his hands so when natalie came back when her come back he looked up through his fingers really sweating now half of mes the happiest man there ever could be in kington other halfs saying make her go away itll all end bad paula tried to kill margery when they was little now paulas daughters back did you know that he was blackmailing her merrily put a hand on his arm and was that why you decided to take yourself out of the situation take away the only reason brigid had for staying you were prepared to sacrifice yourself in the hope that shed come through jeremy looked to either side back at the lounge door anywhere but at merrily she was profoundly unnerved it was terrifying how deep all this went rural isolation paranoia and a curse like a virus in the blood and thinking that she coughed her voice so hoarse that it had nearly gone thinking you would be the death ent no way he started shaking his head talking at the same time ent no way out o this why cause it goes too far back its built up how far to the vaughans jeremy said theyre all vaughans apocryphal danny parked the tractor on the square not that you could see where the road ended and the square began it had been a close thing whether theyd have enough diesel to make it the way theyd run the ole tractor getting here powers off everywhere gomer said like it needed saying it had been weird danny thought the way ledwardine had suddenly just appeared in the headlights no warning black and white buildings in a black and white night that why the vicar couldnt get through on the phone you reckon makes no difference to the phones do it danny and gomer stepped down from the tractor into the thick snow it had stopped falling now like the sky had worn itself out behind there gomer pointed to a hedge like a white wall just down from the church you ever have anything to do with this dexter harris gomer big feller in the chip shop some nights but he never got much to say and words gone round hes tight with his chips so if hes there i goes home and makes a sandwich instead makes sense danny looked up at the windows of the vicarage all dark except for a small glow far back in one of the upstairs rooms we putting this off without lights what you could see of the rest of the village looked like a photo negative dont feel right do it gomer switched on the lambing lamp dr bell leaned away from the lamplight his head pitched at an angle as if he was listening to something that no one else could hear aye he nodded his smile wry he does urge me to point out that although he and i at various times both sought release and relaxation on the grouse moors of arran in later life he developed something of a conscience about such pursuits and came to deplore in particular foxhunting at the other side of the table matthew hawksley half turned to acknowledge the factual truth of this for the rest of them and then faced the doctor again joe did he ever shoot in this area on the radnorshire moors for instance dr bell took in two long and reedy breaths his fingers steepled he thinks not his voice was high and precise and scalpelsharp posh scots jane thought was like posh welsh explicit in its enunciation and full of this clipped authority it was clear that matthew must have worked with him a few times before to get away with calling him joe jane blinked what am i thinking gripping the sony real and modern hitech digital thirdmillennial bringing it up and shooting the scene just to do something avoid getting drawn in the way she had been at the climax of bens murdermystery weekend in the lounge next door this was a similar set piece played out in the waxy ambience of an oil lamp with a frosted globular shade the same one that lit the scene when sherlock holmes confronted the major and here as matthew had explained in his introduction was the real holmes the prototype the famous tutor at the university of edinburgh school of medicine who had initiated the student arthur conan doyle into the basic techniques that holmes would employ dr joseph bell born consultant surgeon at edinburgh royal infirmary lifelong advocate of the employment of forensic observation in the diagnosis of disease jane glanced over at mum possibly her first experience of trancemediumship it was more than acting but sometimes it looked as if alistair hardy had lost weight or at least as if his body weight had been rearranged but it could be explained if he seemed taller that was because he was sitting up so straight in his hardbacked chair if his eyes seemed brighter and shrewder almost piercing that was because hed become fired up by what he was doing or thought he was doing and if his features looked sharper his nose more like the beak of a bird of prey that was well merrily was willing to bet it wouldnt come over on the video transfiguration it was popular in victorian times but you didnt get much of it now when people were no longer easily fooled by clever lighting and special effects she was half and half on this half of her thought he was sincere in the belief that something was happening half of her thought it was a total con she wondered how convinced matthew hawksley really was matthew said as you probably realize joe were trying to solve a mystery in which case dr bells lips tweaked in amusement i cannot think why you would come to me matthew smiled apart from this intimate tableau the room was in shadow one of largos two static cameras was positioned in front of the altar the other behind the semicircle of chairs largo himself was crouching just a few feet from the table alistair hardy had declined to be filmed going into trance maybe he didnt like the way his left side seemed to drop into spasm his arm projecting from his body his fingers curling could be some kind of nervous condition would it be possible for you to ask sir arthur if he ever came here matthew said here bell snapped where is here be more specific man stanner hall in the county of herefordshire on the welsh border home of the chancerys not known to me was it perhaps known to sir arthur would it be possible to ask him dr bell went still alistair hardys breathing had altered its rhythm was going faster and he was blinking rapidly like rem during a dream merrily saw bliss sitting in the corner nearest the connecting door to the lounge jeremy hunched like a hedgehog nearby she imagined brigid parsons in there perhaps asleep in a chair watched over by the police aye dr bell said after a while im informed that it was did he have relatives here members of his family there was a longer silence this time a blurring of hardys face as matthew pushed his luck maybe suspecting that he didnt have much time left was he aware of the legend of black vaughan and the hound of hergest dr bell breathed gassily in and out through his mouth yes yes he said as if talking to someone else aye indeed he turned to matthew you touch on a most vexed issue my friend in what way i will not be dr bell sprang up these people forefinger pointing accusatory around the room these people are a disgrrrrace a plastic bottle of water labelled highland spring was sent spinning from the table merrily held her cross the child dr bells voice had deepened it might if you gave any credence to this be considered a different voice the infant to involve an infant inexcusable you might now want to believe that this was the voice of sir arthur conan doyle hardy had his hands behind his back there was a tremor under his breath he looked up at the ceiling and down at the audience he didnt seem to see anyone until his gaze collided with merrilys and it was a collision she almost felt the jolt she held the cross and didnt blink they tarnish us then hardy looked away and sat down they tarnish us matthew hawksley retrieved the bottle of highland spring from under a chair and poured out half a glass as alistair hardy coughed himself out of trance merrily stood up she didnt feel very priestly tonight in her black cowlneck jumper and jeans erm did that suggest anything to anyone oh yes beth pollen said i think so merrily rather liked what shed seen of beth pollen a decent woman in search of some kind of spiritual truth to what extent she was open to deception however was anybodys guess merrily opened a hand please mrs pollen stood up the chancerys tried to build themselves into the fabric of the area this area has always been overshadowed by the vaughan legends which have inspired pretty genuine fear over the years the chancerys were unlikely previously to have encountered the level of acceptance of hauntings omens and curses they found here on the welsh border even among fairly educated people so they were saying look were the heralds of a new age of enlightenment we can deal with this by recreating the circumstances of the exorcism well summon the spirit of black vaughan and then well talk to him rationally through a medium and well find out what his problem is but it seems to have been a fairly cobbledtogether affair merrily said and they certainly didnt have twelve priests but as sir arthur correctly remembers they did have a baby twenty years younger than gomer but a lot more cautious hed always known that danny went up the drive first with the lambing light switched off he did not like the sound of dexter harris he stopped halfway to the vicarage front door where the bushes on either side had been turned into great white domes there was enough reflected light to reveal deep footmarks all over the path as well as scuffmarks dragmarks hell you got a weight of snow there wasnt nothing couldnt happen in these villages used to be police stations everywhere now the dull bastards at the home office never been west of woking figured cops could reach anywhere in minutes but all it took was one big snowfall danny switched on the light it told him that the front door was ajar somebody been in danny whispered well dont bloody well hang around gomer grabbed the lamp off danny planting his boot on the door banging it open lol lol boy you in there chrissake danny muttered gomer blundering past him into the vicarage gomer bugger gomer said dryvoiced oh bugger what better take a look danny stepped up into the hall could just make out a door on his left then a staircase a passage in front of him and gomer standing in a doorway to the right over gomers shoulder in the lamp beam he could see a big kitchen with a rayburn or something of that order and a long table dragged to one side and all down one leg of the table long smears of red unlikely to be ketchup blood in yere danny take it careful gomer i mean it there was a door slightly ajar at the bottom of the kitchen lol gomer shouted you there boy this ent lookin good gomer dont touch nothin bugger that gomer marched across the kitchen to the bottom door hooked his boot around the side and dragged it open some kind of short passage with an oak beam across a door and a small window on one side a narrow stairway on the other on the floor a body merrily froze there were present to help lay the spirit a woman with a newborn baby whose innocence and purity were perhaps held powerful in exorcism today of course it wouldnt even be contemplated the rule book said plainly see that all children and animals are removed from the premises but that was then and it was only a story the assumption is she said to mrs pollen that the baby in the story would have been newly baptized otherwise it wouldnt be seen as a symbol of purity in the medieval church baptism itself was considered a primary exorcism a baby would be christened as soon as possible because it was considered to be prey to satanic invasion or even to actual possession by the devil until baptism thats how i understood it too mrs watkins a child who died before baptism would not be admitted into heaven as well as having the sign of the cross marked on its forehead in holy water its head was wrapped in a white cloth in which it would be buried if it died as so many did in infancy the babys immortal soul was then considered to have been formally saved merrily nodded this woman had done her research well then mrs pollen said i dont know which account of the vaughan exorcism you read but the one in mrs leathers book does not say that the baby had been baptized no merrily conceded i suppose it doesnt however and im certain hattie chancery hadnt been either when her mother brought her in oh merrily sank down into her chair shed missed the obvious for heavens sake ben foleys chair legs screeched as he swung round youre saying the baby was hattie how reliable is this beth well its not actually documented anywhere as far as i know mrs pollen said its what the original servants said we tracked down about four children or grandchildren of stanner hall staff whod been involved in the ceremony three of them had heard the story and two of them actually said their parents had been pretty jolly horrified when bella chancery proudly walked in with her new baby daughter and the baby was unbaptized merrily said do we know that what we do know from records is that hattie chancerys baptism was delayed because she became ill although we dont have an exact date for the socalled exorcism we know it took place in the winter of and the baptism is on record as having taken place in march i also know from oral accounts that bella chancery during her spiritualist phase was very dismissive of church mumbojumbo and probably wouldnt have had hattie baptized at all if walter much older more set in his ways hadnt insisted for gods sake ben said why on earth have you been sitting on this because of the family but didnt natalie know clancy didnt know beth pollen said i also felt that talking about it i dont know what i felt apart from a dreadful foreboding but just assuming were all taking this on board ben said giving credence to i mean what are we saying i cant even put this into words ok merrily moved out towards the table where matthew and hardy were sitting into the light when i was training for the deliverance ministry the key word was caution you start with a prayer build up as necessary ive never done an actual exorcism of a person and most diocesan exorcists will never do one its sledgehammers and nuts if you overreact you can open the way for something far worse create a situation where there isnt one mrs pollen was nodding fiercely so merrily said someone staging a phoney exorcism based on a real exorcism ok that may be apocryphal but the techniques ring true someone recreating that scenario risks inviting something in inviting madness if you want to look at it psychologically or evil if were allowed to be spiritual and evil loves a short cut evil takes the easy option the easy option being the unbaptized baby mrs pollen said requiem except it wasnt intended to be an exorcism was it merrily said why dont you tell us about the original owner of stanner hall beth pollen hesitated as the connecting door to the lounge opened and almas bulky figure squeezed through bliss stood up alma whispered something to him can i interrupt bliss said mr foley do you have any more of these nice oil lamps or even dare i suggest it a generator ben stood up oh no im afraid so sir it was only a matter of time wasnt it word is that all of kingtons off no ben said im afraid we dont have a generator there are a couple more of these lamps and a lot of candles and i could probably get the gas mantles going anything you can do sir would be very much appreciated damn now well id hate to be a nuisance all right ben walked across to the door to the hall oh antony has lights of course and batteries not very much left im afraid antony largo said best conserved eh jane laughed cynically a power cut was going to cause problems inevitably merrily sat and waited for the hall door to close behind bliss and ben foley at least it had given her some time to work a few things out align what shed just heard with what jeremy had told her surprisingly voluble once hed got going sorry mrs pollen she said i think we were talking about the original builder i mean i gather youd know more about this than anybody from your husbands preliminary work as i understand it the architect who designed stanner hall for his own use had done quite a lot of work for walter chancery yes beth pollen sat just in shadow looking down at her hands in her lap and his name was rhys vaughan however i know much of this is rumour but we ought to hear it dont you think beth pollen sighed i mean as far as i can make out nobody knows for certain whether he was a direct descendant of the vaughans of hergest but he certainly thought so merrily said well he was a welshspeaking welshman and the vaughans were a very important family descended from the princes of brecknock supporters of a great welsh cultural tradition i mean in the middle ages the whole of kington was actually welshspeaking it must have been important to rhys that when he built the house it should be on a significant site as close to hergest as possible he did originally try to buy hergest court and when he failed he was determined to build something as impressive as hergest had been in its great days and where better than the famous stanner rocks they werent very famous then mrs watkins the rare plants were only discovered quite recently but yes it was an impressive site and he was able to buy a good deal of land land wasnt terribly expensive in those days it all took a long time because hed keep running out of money and have to go back to the midlands and design industrial buildings for people like walter chancery this would be what interested your husband who worked for powys council the great welsh mansion that never was yes rhys was a very romantic figure a great patriot he obviously loved the idea of dominating the border as he believed his ancestors had and working for walter merrily said meant he had quite a lot to do with the much younger mrs erm chancery oh dear mrs pollen said this is all rumour steve absolutely abhorred this kind of gossipy anecdotal it was a bit more than that at the time though wasnt it according to my information hattie chancery bore very little resemblance to walter and the only person who couldnt see it was walter himself bloody hell jane said the word is that this was more than just a passing dalliance bella was seriously in love with rhys and when he died she was in a terrible state which i suppose poor old walter put down to her being pregnant mum where the hell did you get this merrily raised an eyebrow at jane and hoped that she could make it out in the lamplight theyre all vaughans jeremy had said hattie and paula and margery and sebbie and brigid all vaughans with all the vaughan baggage so bella in her grief carrying rhyss child desperate for her lovers vision to become reality put the arm on walter to put in a bid for the unfinished folly it was almost finished beth pollen said all that bella had to do was bring one of her interiordesigner friends up from london cost walter so much money in the end that i think he had to sell one of his companies to meet the final bills which i suppose was the beginning of the end for the chancery fortune seems to be what this place does merrily looked at amber foley who sat as still as a mannequin her face a mask of dismay the darkness beyond the lampglow seemed more real now that everyone knew it was a darkness shrouding the whole midborder which brings us to the seance merrily said im calling it a seance because i think the black vaughan exorcism thing was probably a cover story possibly for walters benefit would that be close its all conjecture isnt it beth pollen said is it ok if i go on beth pollen spread her hands of course this was the part she would have identified with as a woman whod lost a muchloved husband a soulmate if we assume that bella read the vaughan legend what would have stood out the baby jane whispered and she now had one of her own a little vaughan a genuine heir to all this the whole huge tradition a tiny descendant of the princes of brecknock and she could never admit it i dont know anything about walter chancery but taking over the house built by your tame architect is one thing living in your wifes lovers mansion with his child very different this is totally mindboggling jane said and may not be true beth pollen said rather desperately now but she was a serious follower of the big new fashion for spiritualism merrily took a long breath wishing it carried nicotine i think when she read about the baby she conceived the idea of somehow and we cant know the details of somehow presenting the child hattie to her heritage and more specifically to her father the medium wouldnt the medium have given it away mrs watkins if her father had spoken through erasmus cookson no jane was on her feet because cookson was from london bella had him brought in he just had to have been a mate someone she could trust not to pass on anything indiscreet until afterwards but the priests window dressing i suspect merrily said this is a woman who was secretly bereaved desperate for psychic contact with her lover suppose shed planned at some stage to leave walter for rhys vaughan perhaps hed told her that when the house was finished i dont know we cant know she glanced at alistair hardy and where conan doyle comes in ive no idea at all beth pollen sighed we might as well try and finish the story my researches suggest that it was walter who invited conan doyle i think i think it was probably true that doyle a man with a strong sense of what was right and wrong would have been appalled to find a baby brought into something like this and i suppose that being the man he was he wouldnt be able to rest until hed found out what was behind it perhaps bella begged him to keep quiet and so that was why he switched the hound to devon jane said impossible to say isnt it it could have been something fairly shocking that happened at the seance the baby starts croaking in welsh jane smiled malevolently i suppose we were all hoping something might be confirmed this weekend beth said alistair hardy was sitting upright like dr bell with his arms folded you didnt tell me any of this beth no beth said almost distantly and merrily guessed that this had been a test for him that beths commitment to spiritualism was less unquestioning than her colleagues in the white company had supposed that alistair hardy had perhaps conveyed messages from her husband that she wanted to believe and yet poor woman if hardy as dr bell conan doyle or even himself had been able to reflect any aspect of a story which was unsupported by anything in print his stature would have been confirmed at least in beth pollens estimation as it was he remained iffy thats all i know merrily said beth pollen said perhaps its best if we leave it there is that what you want no we cant can we theres a woman behind that door over there whos either a totally evil human being or a human being to whom evil was bequeathed we cant alter what happens to her but we can try to stop it here merrily nodded hattie was unbaptized beth said im sure theres a psychiatrist or a geneticist somewhere who can put it into terminology that wouldnt cause anyone any embarrassment but it seems likely that that night she acquired what we poor country folk can only describe as the curse of the vaughans merrily looked across the room at jeremy berrows who knew why dont we see what arthur conan doyle had to say go back to the baskerville curse who invited evil into baskerville hall hugo jane said a wild profane and godless man in the seventeenth century at the time of the civil war hugo promises to render his body and soul to the powers of evil if he can catch up with the wench no real parallel there beth oh ive tried jolly hard to come up with one the nearest i can get is ellen gethin i often wonder if ellen didnt offer herself to the powers of evil if she was granted the opportunity and the physical strength to avenge her brother but did she merrily wondered i mean did she thats a very familiar story i bet youll find slightly different versions all over the country well yes and ellen does seem generally to have been a good and faithful woman who mourned for her husband buried his headless body never married again nonetheless what were looking at surely is a curse a genetic disposition what you will following a female line hattie killed her husband paula killed herself and natalie natalie may also have been involved in the death of her cousin merrily said we can speculate for ever about where it came from but three generations that we know of so what do we do mrs watkins the big question alice we needs it now more than ever the big white bird ancestral healing the healing of the dead dexter should neverve gone round askin questions rakin it all up jeavons its how we develop within ourselves by suffering through our failure and trying again and suffering some more we suffer merrilee the globe of the table lamp was shining like a full moon merrily walked over to it we can only apply actual exorcism to something demonic and believed to be not of human origin perhaps thats why in the old story vaughan describes himself as a devil makes it legit hattie chancery however i mean she might not have been a terribly nice person for part of her life but the tv producer antony largo egalitarian denims wide and sceptical smile said from behind his camera this sounds like what my old man wouldve described as nambypamby liberalism no basic christianity oh right however i dont want to underplay it what i had in mind was to wait until first light and then hold a requiem eucharist for hattie chancery for anyone who isnt conversant with this its basically a funeral service with holy communion and the aim essentially is to bring peace to hattie and bring jesus christ into this place antony largo smiled at amber story of your life here never get the ones who pay for the rooms merrily sighed just a guess mr largo youre not a christian right astute of you to notice mrs watkins and honest of you to admit it oh im actually quite proud of it because it kind of rules you out im sorry largo frowned rules me out and in fact anyone else who isnt a christian we cant afford to take this lightly its not like the chancerys exorcism with fake priests has to be the real thing or its not worth doing the real thing normally with a history like this i wouldnt even attempt it without backup maybe two other priests there at least has to be what you might call a solid front no weak links in the room anybody else unhappy about commitment mrs foley well amber looked uncertain ben and i had our marriage blessed in church i was christened i was even confirmed at fourteen fine as the owners of this place it would be good to have you both here but you do need to think about where you stand whether you have faith that this is going to make a difference id agree with that antony largo said id say you need to think very hard indeed about where you stand for my part after driving all this way through the white hell im no being fucked about any further by the only organization with ratings falling faster than anything on the box either im in the whole way or im outta here thats up to you antony amber said quietly well merrily went back to her chair weve got an hour or two to think about it i was thinking maybe sixthirty for seven am so that by the time we finish the suns up whether we can see it or not free coward there was a white linen cloth over his face he lay as if hed fallen backwards down the stairs very narrow and secretlooking these stairs danny thought specially by lamplight like the steps was creeping quietly up into the bones of the building there was this fat black oak beam across like a great wedge holding the walls apart this was likely where a small door had once hung to conceal the stairs keep the cold out very old house see ledwardine vicarage and this part didnt look to have changed much since little tudor fellers size of gomer parry was busying up and down the steps mustve had its share of dead bodies over the centuries and mabbe this was the way they was brought out not like this mind god almighty but danny felt sick this one it was like hed been flung back by a sudden angry blast of wind his head near enough back in the kitchen his arms thrown out his hands reaching the walls on either side with scabs of dried blood on the fingers of the left one there was blood too underneath the linen towel over his face blood and other moisture that had sucked the thin cloth around his head so that you could see the rough form of his features like the mould for a death mask danny thought holding the lambing lamp with both hands realizing that he was doing this because he was shaking dear god you could only take so much of this in one night he was already backing off into the kitchen when he saw gomer bending down to peel away the cloth from the dead mans face no danny jerking the lamp away in horror him and the bloke in the darkness of the kitchen shouting out together gomer straightened up shrugging his shoulders police ent gonner want you to touch nothin see danny felt like he was chewing cardboard and you dont want to see that anyway lol robinson said take my word for it gomer gomer sloped back into the kitchen feeling for his ciggy tin can we shut that door now lol robinson said when they were both in the kitchen he closed the door firmly on the back stairs and the body and then he led them into another room where the first things danny saw were the amber eyes of a black cat lying on a desk washing itself by candlelight ill make some tea soon as the kettle boils on the stove lol robinson said thatd be good danny had a proper look at him for the first time taking in the glasses with one lens missing the thin track of blood from the edge of an eye to the point of the chin thinking this robinson was five or six inches shorter than the late dexter harris mabbe three four stone lighter thinking how how when theyd walked in lol robinson had been shut away in here on the phone to the doc checking how this poor woman was this alice seemed no ambulance could get through on the roads and the air ambulance wasnt allowed to land at night snow or no snow so the doc and the community nurse had taken this alice to the little clinic at the surgery the police hadnt got through yet but they was on their way them ole beams gomer said thoughtful harder than steel girders older the oak harder it gets walked into one once just walking mind normal pace next thing im flat out dint know what day it was he looked at lol robinson that be it he came in like a mad bull lol said roaring pitch black in there of course when it happened not a sound im ever going to forget you know oh hell danny winced of course jesus bugger me he said muster near took his head off something like that lol was holding himself real funny like there was some physical injury you couldnt see he was comin for you gomer said lol nodding and but for this power cut danny thought hell this was the only feller he ever met with reason to be grateful to the power company supplying herefordshire right listen now boy gomer lit a ciggy piece of advice yere i reckon what happened you was runnin away from this feller well that no listen any suggestion of you deliberately goin this way in the dark on account of you knowin bout the beam while he ent been this way before know what im sayin lol smiled faintly shaking his head ah now dont you bloody look at me like that boy you gets some clever buggers in the cops nowadays university degrees new labour feller breaks into your house nowadays you gotter make him a pot o tea order him a minicab bottom line better to be a free coward than a hero behind bars specially as you was wearin a gomer parry sweatshirt when you done it danny said then he noticed the way that lols hand was shaking on the edge of the candlelight as he tried to stroke the cat bastard of a situation to be in mind danny said real bastard havin to wait here for the cops with him in the next room reckon idve covered his face up too gomer admitted must have a dent in his head you could prop your bike in lol robinson laughed a lot at that leaning back against the desk wasnt normal laughter though even accounting for the physical pain and danny didnt reckon somehow that the dent in the head was the reason lol had covered up the fellers face it was the right thing the primary rule always hammered home with a couple of tragic case histories by huw owen in the brecon beacons was this never leave without doing something this was more than something after half an hour the lamp was sputtering its oil level running low the colour of even the nearest walls changing from magnolia to a dingy nicotine yellow and the confirmed congregation for hatties requiem stood at beth pollen jeremy berrows jane pagan jane for heavens sake amber and ben foley and possibly francis bliss she needed one more maybe two specific communicants to make this work bliss was initially helpful he agreed to put a range rover and driver at the disposal of beth pollen whod offered to go down to st marys church to borrow the sacrament just when you needed another priest the vicar of kington it seemed was away to obtain the sacrament theyd need to disturb the verger but there was a limit to blisss cooperation merrily are you like totally three sheets no im serious its important god knows ive stuck me neck out a lorra times for you and god knows id do it again and youve been good to me but there are places i will not go not with the legendary atheism of the ice maiden and that bastard around with his little handycam he wont be there frannie neither will annie howe and if the lure of money wins out and ben foley shows us the door im ready to hold this service in a clearing in the woods so i can tie her to a tree bloody hell frannie i think shed even be allowed out of prison to attend her grannys funeral dont you merrily bliss stood in front of the door to the lounge as if she might suddenly charge it no this was when mumford came in to say there was a call for her at the reception desk it was coming up to fivefifteen am when jane found mum sitting by candlelight in bens office under the etching of sherlock holmess most despicable moment she looked face it shattered the crowsfeet seriously in evidence her fingers dancing unevenly on the desktop mum why dont you like go upstairs and get some rest its ok i need to meditate its not going to be easy even i can see that she still thinks she owns this place she isnt going to want to leave sorry who jeez hattie chancery oh mum smiled strangely fatigue halfway out of it who was the call lol hes waited up for you you dont realize the kind of guy youve got there do you the pictures forming flower what did he want is he all right in a manner of speaking youre not going to tell me about this are you not now but i will tell you i will tell you everything bear with me flower jane felt excluded apprehensive insecure theres nothing wrong between you and lol is there absolutely not mum said can you give me a few minutes to sort something out jane wandered away and came back quietly a couple of minutes later and didnt go in just stood outside the door expecting to overhear a phone call instead listening in utter dismay to the sobbing and unable to work out whether this was relief or total despair the phone at reception called her away jane irene havent you gone im not going i was on the net for a couple of hours anyway i decided not to go to switzerland its no problem it means lowri can take her mate from school and i can have pizzas instead of bloody turkey irene this is shut up jane you know who this brigid is dont you i its bloody brigid parsons that stuffs from a nasty little site called veryverybadgirlscom on which sick bastards all over the englishspeaking world discuss their masochistic obsession with women who like to damage men or boys or kill them in most cases you know who brigid parsons is dont you er yeah and thats not all eirion said thats really not all i do not like this jane of the midnight merrily had never felt more grateful at being permitted to cry let out this great vomit of emotion because there really was no way you could sit down and reason it all out analyse your own reactions from the initial blinding love and relief through the horror and the pity all the way down to the guilt and remorse and the residual dread that settled in your stomach like sour wine after attempting to repair her face with wipes from her shoulder bag shed come out of bens office to find jane waiting with a candle on a tin tray and the laptop shed borrowed from matthew hawksley jane had been on the phone to eirion whom merrily kind of thought had gone away for christmas and what was he doing up at this hour anyway nothing was normal jane placed the laptop on the counter at reception and plugged it into the phone socket merrily stood and watched the savage colours rise on the flat screen wwwveryverybadgirlscom this isnt the important one jane said but you need to see it first ben foley looked as if hed been holding his head under a cold tap to revive himself we shouldve talked his sweptback hair was damp and lank his long thin face still glowing with towel friction in the haze of the tilley lamp we shouldve talked ages ago now you think im some kind of conman and jane hates me my emotions change with the wind jane said they went into bens office he shut the door before you say anything ambers told me about brigid parsons you really didnt know before merrily said i swear to you i didnt and ill tell you something else if i had known id still have offered her the job of course you would probably for the same reasons shed have turned it down if she thought there was any chance you knew what im more interested in however how long have you known antony largo ha he pulled out a chair youd better sit down jane opened the laptop on the desk brought up the first downloaded file wwwveryverybadgirls he looked at it with distaste is there a name for men like this im sure we can think of one merrily said a name or a man like this both jane brought up the second site ok merrily said this as it happens was a crossreference or whatever they call it from veryverybadgirls which was how janes boyfriend found it although i think it was the other way round hed already checked out antony largo when he found out jane was working with him finding this the official women of the midnight website ah ben said with no great surprise youve seen it before no im not much of an internet person but id have been surprised if there hadnt been one seems to have become quite a cult doesnt it video editions with extra footage all the unpleasant details you werent given in the original never liked that sort of thing myself directors cuts when a productions finished its finished i think were looking at prurient rather than artistic interest what emerges from this and from the badgirls site is this particular producers would obsession be too strong a word with bad girls generally and brigid parsons in particular ben foley sighed yes i knew about that antonys ah had a thing about her for quite a long time since he was a junior researcher at the bbc panorama or some such around the time we first met as it happened they were going to make a film about brigid when she was not long out of prison with a young baby idea was theyd follow her progress back into the world all back views and silhouettes of course antony was part of the team very minor role so there was no way shed remember him but he fell for her in a big way fell for her or what he thought she was i mean when you say he had a thing about her shes a rather beautiful woman a beautiful dangerous woman id like to think he was a little more sophisticated about it than the poor pervs on that web site i dont remember the panorama programme because it never happened she pulled out in the end probably realized there was absolutely no way they could do it without identifying locations at least current affairs were furious these were the early birt years when the pennies had to be accounted for ben shuddered antony never forgot her however which i never found entirely healthy or indeed his apparent obsession with women whod killed men and boys when he was making women of the midnight he did his damnedest to get brigid she wouldnt meet him or any of his team and she made sure they never found out where she was so all they could do in midnight in the end was tell the story as they had to do with myra hindley without an interview with the subject still made compulsive viewing though so when you invited him here ive told you i had no idea natalie was anything other than another woman on the run from a bad relationship i thought my secret weapon in persuading antony was going to be the story of hattie chancery antony saw natalie looked at her the way he looked at all attractive women and i warned him off he mustve recognized her at once didnt say a word to me but then he wouldnt from that moment on he was evidently following his own agenda does he know you know now no and im going to choose my my moment the little bastard ben struck the desk with his fist the laptop vibrated the minute amber told me the truth of everything blew up in my face that shit he did it so well continuing to resist my arguments letting me woo him finally relenting oh so reluctantly and now hes going to shaft me and walk away i want to kill him merrily when amber told me how he treated you like dirt in there he wants to be thrown out he doesnt need me or stanner any more hes got what he wants has he im sorry ben stood for a few moments staring at a picture of the young mary bell on the laptop youd better have a look at this he said he pulled a dust cover away from a tv monitor with a nineinch screen hope theres enough juice in this battery from a cupboard under the desk he produced a video camera like the one jane had been using he connected it to the tv switched on turning the sound down low video channel cool blue screen i was rather surprised when antony turned up tonight having apparently driven from london after talking to jane on the phone i did a check with the aa the route he was claiming to have taken was blocked in several places even to a mitsubishi shogun jane looked up you mean he was here all the time not here but somewhere close for at least a couple of days when he came in tonight he had his usual bag of cameras but no room to go to took out what he needed asked me in view as he put it of all the thieving police around if id put the bag in the safe naturally when i found out what i found out i had a poke around in his case found this brigid parsons was on the screen in closeup unsmiling no makeup hair untidy she seemed to be in a vehicle there was a metalframed window behind her she was talking about her father when he married again i was fine with that yeah i mean the poor guy deserved some kind of life with my mother he was husband nurse minder i think he did love her at first or maybe not maybe it was just infatuation and some kind of need she was undoubtedly a beauty and she needed him and it was his job what he did i suppose there was a buzz in that being needed for a while when she was pregnant it was undoubtedly hed tell me this time and time again the happiest time of his marriage to paula so full of the happy hormones but after i was born whether it was like with her sister i dont know whether she was jealous but i do think that if she hadnt killed herself shed have killed me ben snapped off the sound brigid mouthed silently on the screen her hands weaving about her face contorted those lush lips writhing in distaste actual tears in her eyes she wiped a hand across her eyes and there was a streak of what looked like drying blood on one wrist and livid open lacerations merrily turned away to ben hes been here recording with brigid duplicitous little bastard ben switched off the set how did he persuade her i dont know but hes got an interview there maybe fifty minutes long nearly all of it usable and worth a small bloody fortune while my piffling conan doyle doco well that will never be made will it now you know why i want to kill him amber said restrain yourself think things out and thats what ive done so far have you told the police he looked puzzled why should i hasnt broken the law has he i must say it did occur to me that if the police were building a case against poor natalie this was something they might like to impound which would screw his exclusive let the whole thing out of the bag but that seemed rather unsubtle ive told you because you raised the issue with me and i want to be honest with you but id be glad if youd keep it to yourself for the moment i am i regret to say unashamedly looking for a way to shaft him back id like to ask brigid about it so would i if i had the chance ben said but i dont see it do you i dont see any of us having a chance to talk to her again for about twentyfive years he put the dust cover back over the tv monitor look this vaughan thing i dont know what to think is that woman i dont know ben we dont even know if any of its true do we it makes a lot of sense though inherited evil most of what i do i cant prove merrily suddenly felt so tired that she had to stand up to stop her head falling forward on to the desk anything when she went alone in search of bliss mumford pointed her to a door that she hadnt noticed before near the foot of the stairs mumford put a finger to his lips as she went quietly in to find a small room furnished as a study with bookshelves and bliss slumped over a desk with his head laid on an arm he sprang up instantly its allowed frannie merrily said must be getting old used to be able to do all night and all the next day on black coffee and cheeseandonion crisps the adrenalin of crazed ambition listen when danny thomas gets back im hoping to get clancy brought over you could at least give me brigid for half an hour you were trying to nobble me before i was properly awake werent you listen ive been to me share of requiem masses i know the kind of emotion all that can generate blood on the altar i do not want blood on the altar gwent police have been talking to nathan bowker bowdler anyway the cowboy with the big gun and the small brain who was savaged by ms parsons for the crime of trespassing with intent oh im assuming this is news to you naturally but hes only just back on his feet and the first thing he did when he was able to talk without pain was to telephone mr sebastian dacre with a view to obtaining compensation for his injuries in return for his silence the way you do when was this last night shortly before seven nathan said that when they were first let loose sebbie had talked about the woman living with berrows nathan was a little coy on this according to gwent but they had the feeling that it had been suggested that nathan and his mates neednt be overly polite to her no suggestion from sebbie of course that she might retaliate so the lad was gobsmacked in every sense of the word and you think this was what sent dacre up stanner rocks in a snowstorm confirmation that this was brigid parsons and she hadnt changed well be looking at sebbies mobile to see who he rang last night who he mightve made an appointment with unfortunately the thing was smashed on the rocks so itll have to go to the boffins but yeh youre right i reckon puts paid to any doubts he mightve had that the lovely natalie was indeed his little cousin brigid and it gives him more leverage being arrested for gbh if you happen to be brigid parsons its not gonna be a smack on the wrist is it also think of the publicity sebbie gives her an ultimatum re sale of farm she sends him on his last journey frannie would anybody in his right mind attempt to blackmail somebody known to be violent while standing with his back to a cliff edge who says he was in his right mind have you spoken to anybody thinks he was in his right mind he was probably in an alcoholic haze besides it didnt end there just pushing the feller off the cliff see that wasnt very brigid a bit perfunctory bliss rubbed his eyes i shouldnt be telling you this i dont know why im go on zelda morgan matrimonial ambitions i remember zelda was at her mothers seventieth birthday party in kington didnt get back to sebbies till just before we talked to her last night checked the answering machine but she didnt get round to checking the voicemail on her mobile till an hour or so ago when she woke up in the armchair bit of a shock out comes sebbies voice being very sebbie get your excuse me reverend get your fat arse over here get the police fucking madwomans pushed me off the fucking rocks and i cant move what the voice of an injured man possibly but certainly not the voice of a dying man billy grace was right the facial injuries were not entirely consistent with a fall she followed him down and beat him to a pulp shes not a pussycat merrily can i talk to her again and would you like to tell me why i dont know why about this vaughan connection yeh whats that mean to you frannie this could take a while never mind bliss said at sixthirty am merrily went up to hattie chancerys room with a gideon bible and the decanter of holy water pictures of hattie in the mustardy light what struck her was how pale the woman had been skin like white fishflesh anaemic there was a picture of her with the middle marches hunt which presumably provided regular infusions of blood merrily shivered hardy was right the entire room was a cold spot the atmosphere thick with something she could only interpret as loathing it could be hattie it could also be brigid i was lying up in her room surrounded by creepy old photos of the bitch the biggest one i had to clean the glass and i did that by spitting in her face over and over again merrily loosened the stopper on the decanter when she came down bliss was in the lobby putting down the phone there was concern in his eyes when he saw her she must have looked something like she felt youve gorra tell me merrily what oh come on it was up to ben to tell him about the video so what she told him in the end was about lol and dexter what dexter had done to darrin and to alice what hed tried to do to lol how it had ended and what lay on the floor of the inner hall of ledwardine vicarage stuck out here in the snowy wastes bliss hadnt caught up with the hook inquiry by the time merrily finished expressions were shifting around his face like jigsaw pieces in search of a picture he walked away across the lobby and then back again he stood in front of merrily chewing his lip and then he turned his head and nodded at the lounge door yeah ok go in tell alma i said you could have her well thanks it was time then no excuse as the c of e deliverance manual kept underlining when you conducted a requiem eucharist in an exorcism context it was advisable to have at least one other priest there and preferably several this was for a normal service with full preparation taking place over several days this was with a congregation of carefully vetted christians with no backup and a congregation including two spiritualists a trancemedium a roman catholic a teenage pagan kind of and a murderer you just tossed the book over your shoulder and prayed for survival these things happened it was better in here now clouded with damp mist and shadows but the candles were glowing brightly on the makeshift altar unexpected stars in a murky sky and the murmured amens were rising to join hers this soft miasma of voices a fuller response than shed expected it was as if the ritual itself was controlling the conditions making rough but perfectly symmetrical interweaving shapes in the void the living and the dead and the holy one small circle of light or maybe she was delusional through lack of sleep and this was autopilot before the others had even come up from the kitchen shed done some sprinkling of newly sanctified water the routine blessing of the room hauntedhouse procedure then a short prayer once they were all inside and then a repeated blessing after the dr bell episode and the vaughan revelations all this probably helping her as much as anyone calming her nerves setting up a receptive state of mind careful devotional preparation before the service is recommended for every communicant and also for the priest naturally oh sure there was a white cloth on the altar a small chalice for the wine a saucer for the wafers beth pollen had assisted here merrily glimpsed beth sitting next to jane staring straight ahead with focus and determination there seemed to be twelve of them now including brigid and bliss and alma antony largo wherever he was had made no attempt to come in and his cameras were gone the one she knew least was clancy school skirt white school blouse dark golden hair overhanging her eyes her mouth sullen eerily like the young brigid whose same picture from a school photo had been appearing in the papers for years and years twelve of them twelve and hattie more holy water sprinkled in hatties room before leaving lord god our heavenly father you neither slumber nor sleep bless this bedroom merrily connected now with that it was the beginning she stepped out with her bible and her service printout i am the resurrection and the life the lord says those who believe in me even though they die will live and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die we have all got a sperrit something like a spark inside we said the old man to mrs leather the brown mud in the stainedglass window began to clear in the early dawn suggestions of colour rising like oil in a puddle so this is a service with holy communion to bring peace to hattie davies hattie chancery who died by her own hand before the second world war but id also like us to remember in our prayers hatties daughter paula who was also a suicide and paulas daughter brigid who is with us with the aid of a car battery provided by ben shed managed to print out the order of service from common worship on the c of e web site close to the top of the service and lest anyone forget what this was about shed brought in a serious confession that she made them repeat after her line by line we acknowledge and bewail our manifold sins and wickedness which we from time to time most grievously have committed there were candles on tables amongst the congregation establishing that they were part of it not an audience brigid parsons sat next to one with jeremy and clancy brigids hair was freshly brushed and some of its longago colour was shining through in strands of fine gold as if in acknowledgement that shed soon be able to wash it all away because anonymity wouldnt matter any more where she was going her face was dark and strained the wide mouth turned down with lines either side that looked as if theyd just been pencilled in we do earnestly repent and are heartily sorry for these our misdoings the burden of them is intolerable merrily had tried to talk to brigid in the lounge but brigid who had slept for a couple of hours on the sofa had been unresponsive to everything except the idea and purpose of the requiem please just take the bitch away this is not about revenge she focused on brigid now in the nearwhite candlelight its not about hitting back its not about laying a ghost its about forgiveness were looking at hattie and what she did and sure there were a lot of evil elements there but that does not make hattie evil in herself we have to search in this service for a depth of forgiveness that we perhaps wouldnt be able to reach in everyday life were always saying i can forgive anybody anything but that today we have to say and mean it i can forgive anything including that in her own mind she saw the woman in the picture over the bed a woman with fair hair twisted and coiled like a nest of pale snakes and eyes like white marbles she could hear wild laughter the smack of stone on flesh and bone whoop whoop it wasnt easy was it fortunately she said we can count on some help she opened the new testament john chapter twelve at a later stage shed have to say let us commend hattie to the mercy of god it was clear that nobody was ready yet to consider mercy not even jeremy berrows the natural farmer the quiet farmer innocent face under hair like dandelion clocks giving brigid an occasional sideways glance their shoulders touching jeremy berrows who firmly believed the evil that arose in brigid had been bequeathed to her by hattie and maybe it had maybe bella chancery led here by a twisted path of deception had opened the door to something that jeremy was now being asked to forgive now within probably an hour of losing for ever his main reason to go quietly on john verse now my soul is in turmoil and what am i to say father save me from this hour no it was for this that i came to this hour canon jeavonss point entirely its how we develop within ourselves by suffering through our failure and trying again and suffering some more we suffer merrilee if merrily could take on jeremys suffering shed do it she felt a lowlevel tingle in her spine behind jeremy was alistair hardy rotund and bland and a phrase you didnt hear much these days but it suited him cleanshaven the psychic she didnt doubt it but there was a lot to doubt the lucy devenish thing for a start also dr bells revelation about the use of a newborn baby in that dubious ceremony because beth pollen had almost certainly known of the suggestion that the baby was hattie had almost certainly told hardy smoke and mirrors the crowd standing by said it was thunder while others said an angel has spoken to him jesus replied this voice spoke for your sake not mine now is the hour of judgement for this world now shall the prince of this world be driven out driving out evil it was hard not to personalize it brigid parsons paula parsons hattie chancery black vaughan and ellen gethin to what extent could this possibly be said to go all the way back to black vaughan who seemed to have been only a fall guy anyway a story to blacken vaughan and his tradition the welsh tradition in an area becoming rapidly anglicized she looked at ben foley his sleek head bowed the original destructive haunting was said to have threatened the whole economy of kington ben had been hoping it would revive his she wondered if she ought to have included sebbie dacre in this a vaughan thing had dacre been told that he was a vaughan did that explain his robberbaron mentality his need to reclaim what was his to dominate the valley but the threat dacre perceived was a threat from within his own family the worst kind look at dexter harris merrily looked around the cold room with its tiny spearpoint flames looked around flickering face to flickering face where are you hattie of all the things she hadnt intended to ask dying you destroyed our death rising you restored our life hes here christ he should be here here now everything is all right the tingling in the spine but she felt so utterly tired that the candles blurred and the faces fused she shook herself very lightly not everyone took communion beth pollen was first looking up at the rising cold blue in the stainedglass window then jane with a wry and slightly apprehensive smile every time we eat this bread and drink this cup we proclaim the lords death until he comes brigid when her turn came had her eyes closed the bread of heaven in jesus christ if shed done this before it had not been for a long time her hands came up reaching for the chalice the cuffs of her black shirt unbuttoned falling back over her wrists so that merrily could see deep fresh scratches the blood barely dry god she was so knocked back by the significance of this that she barely noticed brigid moving away afterwards and clancy taking her place had ben noticed it had jane had she imagined it was it an hallucination in the context of the eucharist these things happened immediately she began to pray for guidance for backup over clancys dull gold hair becoming aware at that moment of jeremy berrows sitting back in the front row jeremys eyes wide lit from two sides by candles jeremys eyes widening gazing beyond merrily upwards back at merrily the cup of life in jesus christ mum jane said faintly merrily turned and saw maybe what jeremy saw its outline might have been conjured from the snowbanks joining the rising hills and the jagged pinetops shadows against the first light but yes oh god she saw it crouching there inside the leaded glass with its black haunches in the blue and its shadowy snout uplifted into the red where the first light was bleeding through she saw it and it was poised to bound no a coarse sucking sound sent her spinning back to the altar and the thick dark blonde hair and the cup of life in jesus christ clancys hands around the chalice clancys lips she just stood and watched her mind whirling as clancy trembled hard as if in orgasm and threw back her head and drank all the wine and smiled horribly up at merrily with her blackcherry glistening lips and eyes like small mirrors a little candleflame a spark a sperrit in each of them in the very cold silence clancy burped and the wine spouted out of her whoop no smoke no mirrors it was like one of those victorian clockworktableau automatons that you wound up and things started happening everything interconnected brigid parsons pulsing to her feet and alma long practised in restraint preventing her from moving from the spot as jeremy and jane and bliss converged and one of the altar candles selfsnuffed merrily was putting herself between all of them and clancy and shouting baptized shouting out to brigid has she been baptized becoming aware that she hadnt actually shouted it just mouthed it and brigid was shaking her head thats ok merrily said calmly thats not a problem well see to it now she smiled at clancy and clancy smiled faintly and vacantly back clancy you up for this keeping it casual playing down what was going to be something very big and crucial because if this kid got spooked and took off clancy didnt respond but she didnt move away just stood there like shed been summoned to the head teachers office stood there in getthisover mode not sullen or antagonistic just tunedout which was dangerous of course merrily lifted up her hands and felt a rush of adrenalin endorphins the electricity crackling dont get carried away concentrate shush she said softly bringing her palms down trying to lower the energy level in here because it was becoming negative too many warring agendas it was only a hotel dining room it wasnt a church nothing to amplify emotions but no weight of worship to soothe them either a playground for hattie chancery and whatever moved her but the kitchen would have been worse people were back in their chairs the clockwork winding down some hadnt reacted like alistair hardy watching her with his head on one side one arm apart from his body the hand twitching fingers flexing did she need him out of here no let it go he wasnt interfering she had the sense of a spectator no agenda merrily turned to the altar and gathered up the decanter this was about the essentials no fuss stripped down clean and simple the basics it mustnt be rushed however keep it casual but get it right because this well this was a medieval baptism this was the exorcism she was looking into clancys face now the kid avoiding her stare which wasnt hard she was a good bit taller than merrily but this was what clancy did she avoided retreated did not get involved the inherited curse of negative celebrity in the name of the father the son the when clancy finally knelt it was like hands were pushing her to her knees merrily was aware of brigid parsons drawing in a thin ribbon of breath and the placid unmoving eyes of jeremy berrows when she closed her eyes momentarily she could see a ring of candles tiny snailshells of light she held on to the sense of assurance rising from her abdomen her solar plexus as she approached clancy and the halfperceived form of the woman standing close behind her who was in dark nondescript clothing perhaps a twopiece suit bust like a mantelpiece closecurled hair eyes like white marbles taking the stopper from the bottle time passing if there was a preamble merrily wasnt aware of it do you reject the devil and all rebellion against god nothing say i reject them say it for gods clancy looked confused her face was damp and florid in the crimson glare suffusing the room clancy say i reject them say it if if you want to clancy rocked losing her balance the words tumbling out do you renounce the deceit and corruption of evil say i i renounce them the cold sun hung in the red portion of the stainedglass window like a bloodblister when merrily finally drew the cross on clancys skin she almost expected the water to boil and sizzle it didnt anticlimax no smoke no mirrors it was always best clearing away the remains of the eucharist after the baptism and the commendation merrilys hands were weak but there was still a dipping and rising in her spine something finding its normal level jane came to help her at some point good heavens she actually squeezed merrilys hand hey not bad erm thanks only it wasnt yeah i know it wasnt down to you all the same you could easilyve blown it mum jane began to fold up the white tablecloth with the wine stains is this i mean you know is this it no chance ill probably be back three or four times could you leave the cloth there flower call this superstition oh right clancy was at the bottom of the room with brigid and jeremy bliss and alma a few yards away giving them some space merrily shook her head as the old concertina radiator began gonging dolefully behind her squeezing a little heat back into stanner hall what happened to your wrist merrily said as they filed out into the lobby she and brigid side by side with bliss in front alma close behind brigid said nothing happened on the rocks didnt it last night brigid shrugged and it turned into a shiver brigid was very pale now pale enough to faint they moved towards the reception desk mumford standing there his face grey with stubble and no sleep in the halflight the lobby looked as dismal as an old hospital waiting room brigid merrily said tell me all right it happened on the rocks brigid turned to her still walking look i just want to say you know thanks i dont know what you did but maybe maybe something happened even i think that and im not impressionable not for a long time something probably did happen merrily said and i wanted to say if you could maybe stay in touch with jeremy because he i know it could have happened for us we were so close to it i believe you were on the reception desk the phone was ringing mumford picked up i wish id known earlier merrily said i wish somebody had felt able to say something she looked at jeremy who must have said more in the past few hours than in his entire adult life and clancy brigid said dont worry im not going to cry brigid said its not what killers do mumford said to bliss its the dci boss tell her weve had word that the snowploughsve been through and were on our way boss tell her weve gone merrily said that was annie howe the head of hereford cid if you dont make a full statement shes going to give you a very hard time thatll be something to look forward to merrily said you see the point is that wrist injury i saw it on largos video brigid stopped alma said keep moving please brigid directly to the porch then clancy craven was there dragging on almas arm face all twisted up youre not taking her youre not you cant take her away clancy started to scream merrily saw jane behind her looking upset unsure how to respond jeremy watching her too with an expression that if you didnt know him you might interpret as anger jeremy turned and walked away towards the entrance as brigid pushed in front of alma hugging clancy clan itll be ok it everythings taken care of over clancys shoulder she said to merrily where did you see that video ben has it ben thinks it was shot a couple of days ago bliss was listening now but the fresh blood shows it had to have been between whatever happened on the rocks and you being brought in right merrily said did you get it when you beat sebbie to death at the foot of the r merrily bliss snarled brigid said what for fucks sake bliss spun round ran to the door to bens office behind reception flung it open in in there now reichenbach when bliss said clancy would you and jane like to fetch us all some of mrs foleys incredible coffee clancy looked at her mother like this was some cheap trick and when she returned with the coffee all the police cars would have gone from the forecourt i promise you clancy bliss said we wont leave the premises without you get another chance to see your mum yeh clancy wouldnt look at him but she went off with jane she hadnt looked at merrily either since the water had dried on her forehead this could take months years of aftercare it wasnt magic merrily put a new cigarette packet open on the desk with the zippo on the front of the packet it said smokers die young alma brought in a third chair and an ashtray and merrily sat facing brigid watching her smoke with a cautious relish as if she was already bangedup right bliss sat next to merrily wheres this video you dont need to see it now francis its existence is enough men just bloody lie to you all the time brigid said meaning largo some of us on the other hand bliss said though we may seem like crass twats only looking for a result have a profoundly spiritual core some of us might even be deeply shocked to think that a woman whos just left a feller horribly unfaced should allow herself to be whisked away to be interviewed about it for the box something doesnt ring true in other words brigid could i talk to merrily on her own no but you can talk to dci howe who is also a woman so ive been told can we cut the crap i sometimes feel that a service like the one weve just attended can blow away the need for an awful lot of unnecessary evasion which goes for you too reverend in fact you can start us off ok merrily took a cigarette and make it quick while i can still breathe in here well essentially antony largo has been after brigid in at least one sense maybe more since he was a young researcher with the bbc antony largo likes sorry brigid vicious women he made a wellknown documentary called women of the midnight which bliss leaned into the smoke he made that while still in his twenties apparently and never looked back as i recall merrily that programme caused a flap by being a bit well it looked closely at the sexual side of things didnt it we heard from past lovers in considerable detail and you can apparently get the rest of the detail on video through the internet as long as you claim to be over twentyone well well bliss said so you knew mr largo then brigid no i didnt actually i didnt even remember his name only anoraks know the names of tv producers didnt recognize him either when ben brought him in though id apparently met him at ellie maylords when these guys were after me for panorama as he reminded me the other week in what circumstances did he remind you after he was here with ben that first time he didnt go back to london he booked into the green dragon at hereford and he phoned me mustve been a shock brigid yeah it was he said could i meet him he said as soon as he saw me he was thinking like what if ben finds out youd appreciate talking to someone who really cared you wouldnt believe some of the men ive met who really cared brigid said i may even have arrested a couple so you met mr largo i met him in the camper van aha was a refuge for me that van i thought youd sold it to the nature lads lent it said i might need it back at some stage oh in my situation the kind of refuge you can drive away is sometimes useful its also better if you dont keep it at home that way visiting reporters or other people you dont want to get involved with dont get to see it in advance i have bad memories of driving out of looe at the head of a cavalcade so you entertained mr largo in your camper van even though in this case because i didnt dare meet him anywhere public and i wasnt having him anywhere near the nant and i didnt entertain him thank you you cant blame people for embroidering man and a woman in a camper van on a remote clifftop and with what we know of his tastes that was on his second visit i assume the first time he suggested i might like to cooperate in a sensitively made documentary the second time it was to offer me a percentage which he said could run to well over a hundred grand including us rights bliss leaned back eyebrows going up tempting not to me this might be difficult for you to get your head around but money doesnt mean that much to me or jeremy as long as were in a position to earn enough to keep going money means a certain amount to everybody brigid ask merrily what means more peace of mind merrily said in a very particular sense did you like mr largo bliss asked i didnt feel very happy being alone with him if thats what you mean in what way buy the video frannie merrily said brigid smiled and extracted another cigarette you turned him down bliss asked i put him off you see the danger here is that this was one of a very small number of people who would actually have been close enough to me as an adult to recognize me only things had changed a lot in the last couple of months id found a man i wanted to spend the rest of my life with and he was living in a place he needed to spend the rest of his life in having you around could be pressure for a serious introvert merrily said its a big secret to keep i think wedve started to tell local people in time the ones who could handle it guys like danny thomas and greta you get a group who know and you have this level of protection that you wouldnt get in a more populated area true they like to know all about you but once they do they can be very loyal and very good at secrets of course sometimes too good at secrets brigid lit her cigarette ill buy you another packet of these before they take me away merrily smiled she was getting that feeling in the spine again you led him on bliss said i said id need an absolute assurance that my appearance would be disguised and also my location and i didnt think he was going to be able to promise that i also said that if i did it i wouldnt want any money but i would want right of veto or whatever you see ive never seen women of the midnight its not the kind of thing i watch strangely enough he said a solid sensitive programme like he was planning would take the heat off and also allow me to have my say well i didnt want my say but i didnt want him shopping me either not yet did you never think of going to court for special protection merrily asked make it so the media werent allowed to identify you for clancys sake i didnt want special protection i didnt deserve special protection clancy maybe bliss said can we talk about sebbie dacre ill only go so far he was blackmailing you right brigid laughed whats so funny he wouldnt have the i dunno what word im looking for but he wouldnt have it im sorry i didnt want him to die you killed him brigid i wanted brigid blew out a lot of smoke turning away whats the bloody point the smoke drifted up and mingled with the smoke around the muzzle flash from sherlock holmess pistol in the picture please merrily said dont stop now look he was out of it he really was hell theres enough insanity in my family for that to surprise nobody somebody told him about this web site where all these saddos were drooling over what women had done to men and he printed stuff off pinned one to the sign at the bottom of the drive so id know that he knew he was dangerous he was a risk sure at some stage he was going to tell somebody whod take him seriously but he still didnt know for certain you think he was genuinely mentally ill merrily said i think it was the booze mainly the toxic combination of booze and being a chancery brigid flicked her cigarette towards bliss whats that sound like i dont know why im bothering this guy isnt going to believe the half of it try him hes a catholic but i just want to make it clear again that ive never i am never gonna blame whatever ive done on being a victim my mothers daughter hatties granddaughter i will live with being a bad and vicious person a monster and getting punished for it rather than take one miserable step down sebastians road ill be an old lag with a filthy mouth ill be an evil monster for sun readers to wish dead and sick kids to wank over and thats it and yet you came here to find out about it you cooperated with beth pollen and the white company it was about closing doors merrily and it was about clancy ive explained all that it wasnt about me you know merrily said i dont think im buying that you understand no listen you understand too much about sebbies problems and he denied it too didnt he i mean people who talked to him if you talked to him youd think he didnt give a toss load of old drivel ive listened to him in the pub spouting off maybe for my benefit just in case i was who he suspected i might be just so id know he wasnt scared of anything particularly me and the past why scared of you merrily said not for me to say ask jeremy because your mother tried to kill his mother when they were little because ellen gethin why did he come to the van last night bliss said and why were you there merrily said not quite knowing where the question came from you were trying to help him werent you where did you get that idea i dont know i was brigid ground out her cigarette in the metal ashtray he wasnt blackmailing me ok he was saying to me ive been expecting you and youre trouble something like that i was a threat jeremy said hed been seeing the hound of hergest like other drunks see pink elephants he never said that to me he said he wanted brigid parsons to sell him the nant and hed give a fair price for it and that would be the end of a long bad period he thought i could take jeremy with me and buy him another farm a bloody long way away he didnt actually try to blackmail me not then but i didnt want to go you see and jeremy nothing was going to get jeremy out of the nant so i said why didnt we meet usual venue bliss said look i honestly didnt think how naive was that for someone like me see the thing is we were never going to like each other but he wasnt going anywhere he owned everything in a big circle around the nant and he could make things very difficult if he wanted to i mean he gave us a taste of that with the hired guns like this wild west situation i still thought there had to be a way we could coexist what were you gonna offer him brigid not the nant and not sex peace of mind a way of making peace with the past on one level that seemed very naive but yeah it was worth a try good god merrily sat up you were going to invite him to the white company gig i did i told him there were some people whod like to help him with his paranoia i said we should attack it as a family unit bite back merrily nodded you and him and the white company and you maybe deal with it for clancys sake and by then id also been made aware that i needed help on a personal level if i was going to survive here nathan that was a shock it happened quicker than i could think bliss leaned back arms folded what exactly happened with sebbie brigid in sebbies view of things merrily said there would be only one reason for a direct female descendant of hattie chancery to invite a man to stanner rocks i thought wed got way beyond all that brigid said twentyfirstcentury chancerys i didnt realize even then how far he was sunk into it jeremy said sebbie was resigned to there being a death in the wind and he thought it was going to be either him or you i dont believe these hicks bliss said we use words like superstition in a loose disparaging way merrily said but when superstition meets mental instability it can get way out of hand and thats why neither you nor howe is going to get a motive that makes complete sense that is of course unless what bliss said sebbie was drunk when he arrived right brigid nodded did he attack you not in any i dont know it got stupid all right it was never really civilized from the start but it got when i said to him that there were these people who were trying to follow the whole curse thing back to vaughan and wanted to deal with it once and for all he just exploded went totally berserk this is in the van right how dare these fucking outsiders think they can come in and meddle take over other peoples lives other peoples pasts and its snowing heavily now im standing in the door of the van trying to stay upright and im going you stupid drunken pig we are the outsiders who came in and meddled and took over its our fault brigid closed her eyes the chancerys merrily said yeah do you think he saw what you were proposing as an attempt to destroy his whole power base if you like the vaughan in him brigid nodded all the baggage that history and folklore had inflicted on the vaughans including an exorcism a snuffbox and a big black ghostly dog he disowned it all and he loved it all it was everything it was who he was mr sebastian dacre jp master of the hunt sebbie three farms he needed it like hattie did if there is a curse they gave in to it they clutched it all to their bosoms whoop fucking whoop its like hunting they know some of its vile but its part of their yeah their power base but it took a lot of booze to live with a curse yeah what happened on the rocks brigid bliss said quietly well he started by breaking up my humble power base as he saw it he threw the oil lamp at the wall and it went on the bed he was set on a course by then he made sure it all caught fire after that i dont even i dont even remember how we got there at the edge of the rocks he was pretty drunk i was thinking what if he goes up with the petrol tank selfishly i assure you because id get the blame what happened brigid bliss said again what happened brigid started to laugh and then choked on the smoke the last of the chancerys the last of the vaughans out on the edge like holmes and moriarty at the reichenbach falls thats what happened and the snows coming down heavily you couldnt even see where the edge was and hes going im having you out of here hes going ill have the whole of the fucking press here by the morning if not before you cant go anywhere you cant get out in this weather but theyll get in when they know theyll hire helicopters this kind of madness then he just starts backing away towards the edge and hes shouting what you gonna do now gonna push me over like our esteemed granny and im like are you crazy cause the snows built up this kind of ledge that projects beyond the edge so you think it goes back further than it actually does and he was crazy merrily said oh yeah but i mean me too i pushed the bastard over you pushed him or he slipped merrily said i pushed him im brigid parsons granddaughter of hattie c what do you think im going to try and save him yes merrily said bliss said merrily he grabbed at your hands your wrists and you tried to hold on and his nails tore your wrist i dont remember you dont want to remember merrily this is not what we do bliss said this is not the interview room i can do what i like the heat was in merrilys spine again all the way up this is brigid taking responsibility again shes putting her hands up and shes saying yes its me i take full responsibility its me the flawed human being its not the other thing merrily bliss said gently youre forgetting the rest no im not brigid did you go down that slippery treacherous path to the bottom of the quarry in the blinding snow and beat sebbie dacres head in with a rock did you do that brigid rocked back in the chair eyes tight shut i dont remember she doesnt remember merrily said to bliss you need to get ben foley in here skys come down on the tv monitor watched by bliss and ben foley brigid was talking about life in a detention centre for young offenders where her peers regarded her with a kind of awe i was pretty much heartbroken for months couldnt talk to anybody for fear of breaking down that was seen as me being aloof and cool and dangerous nothings ever how it looks is it merrily crouching next to brigid at the desk murmured mark and stuart did they try to rape you get off my back merrily why would i give the parents any reason to like evil brigid any small amount better while thinking less of their sons youre not evil brigid natalie brigid said brigid bliss was sitting on the edge of the desk do you say anything about dacre on this video brigid shook her head he didnt want any of the spooky stuff merrily saw ben foley wince i meant his death bliss said the death that occurred not long before you recorded this no of course not all right ive seen enough for now thank you mr foley hang on to it though can you make a copy i did that before the power went ben was looking nervous merrily thought his skin pale and porous tell me how exactly you encountered mr largo last night brigid bliss said well i knew he was supposed to be coming back to shoot the white company experiment antony said hed wanted to see me again before it all got going he said he was on his way to stanner hall for the white company brigid looked apologetically at ben actually i dont think that was his intention i dont think hed have come back here at all last night if the snow hadnt made it impossible for him to get out of the valley youre probably right ben said he was just going through the motions i misunderstood his glee he said he saw me in the daihatsu taking the track up to stanner brigid said but then he saw this range rover coming up a bit later when he saw that it was heading the same way he decided to wait at the bottom near the quarry so whoever it was wouldnt see us together after what happ brigids face tightened after i pushed my cousin off the rocks when i was stumbling down antony mustve seen me from his shogun and he came out to meet me with a torch he said he thought hed seen somebody falling next thing we both saw sebastian lying in the snow and it was you know it was pretty obvious he was dead what did mr largo say he said christ brigid whatve you done and i was stunned i suppose it was a bad dream to find id done it again killed somebody happening just like that so fast so unstoppable youre looking round to see if the worlds the same place you were in a few minutes ago its like the whole skys come down on you like all the sides of everything are coming in on you you cant believe it happened you want to turn time back you can hardly breathe shes talking about the first time merrilys fingers were clasped around the pectoral cross i really didnt hate him i pitied him and there he was killed so quick here one minute and ranting and then just a piece of bloody meat and you think how can it and and then you turn around and all your futures gone as well bliss said softly and mr largo said what he said oh my brigid youre in the shit here he didnt ask you what happened he just said that and then he said best not to go too near he said i was obviously in shock we moved the daihatsu back to near the roadside and he took me back to the shogun and drove me off up towards presteigne or somewhere we went into this fairly big pub id never been in before where there were quite a few people and he found us a table by the fire and he bought us brandies and he was trying to explain how it was going to be if they got me for this like if they got me i knew it was as good as all over and i was hardly listening just sitting there in front of that fire thinking about jeremy back at the nant and his fire that lovely fire thinking wed never sit in front of that again together thinking about clan what was going to happen to her now thinking how when the social services got hold of her thered be nobody who could remotely understand what she was carrying around and clan she doesnt help herself you know he was right though bliss said you were in a mess he said look i want to help im not going to tell you theres nothing in it for me that its any kind of selfless act but im willing to up the percentage considerably and im like whats the use of that you cant have a murderer taking a cut theres some law against it and he said no the money would go to clancy in trust or whatever however i wanted to do it and now the money you didnt care about suddenly that was meaningful it was meaningful because i havent really got any money ive got a farm and a man who belongs to it so i havent got a farm to sell and to keep clan out of the system that would take big money to pay for somebody bliss glanced down at merrily then back at brigid so you agreed he said he had a contract already made up and hed make some quick changes and put his signature to them and that would legally oblige him to pay a third of the action to clancy he took the contract out of his pocket and he put it on the table in the pub it looked legit but how would i know what was i going to do here what would you do brigid did a swift sweep of faces her hair swinging any of you so you recorded the interview he said if we didnt do it now itd be down the pan which was pretty obvious so we drove into new radnor and we parked off the bypass which was still pretty clear and he set up a camera with a light inside the shogun he had two cameras going one he held the other on a short tripod in the back of the car shooting like a profile of my face he had loads of batteries and stuff and he clipped a personal microphone to my coat and we we just recorded it in one go like it was being done at gunpoint merrily thought i just babbled on i wasnt really thinking about what i was saying he asked questions and i just said the first things that came into my head except when he asked about mark and stuart and i just said i hadnt got anything to say about that we mustve gone on for nearly an hour and a half with a couple of breaks so he could move the car a bit to stop us getting blocked in by the snow and you were sworn to secrecy about when it was done bliss said he said it had to be kept under wraps or we wouldnt make a fraction of the money he said hed be compromised if it came out he was a witness to the murder interesting bliss said what would this be worth mr foley a lot even now brigid parsons is still big box office brigid parsons back in the headlines with im sorry another conviction for a similar crime would be huge mega even an interview knocked off in a car makes no difference these days you can get perfect quality anywhere gives it more of a sense of authenticity by the time hes dressed it up with other interviews old news footage comments from a shrink youve got to have a shrink these days and most of them will say whatever you want yeah hes looking at big bucks enormous bucks merrily said so how important would it be for brigid to have done another murder like i said mega court case of the year questions asked in parliament about the monitoring of murderers whove been let back into society ben looked at brigid as if he still couldnt absorb the idea of her as a serious killer as anybody other than natalie his manager but most importantly shes out of the picture this is the only interview anybody will ever get bliss said i know where youre coming from merrily but merrily looked up at ben saw his eyes go wide and still with sudden comprehension bliss chewed his lip then he said how successful is mr largo at present mr foley he seemed to be on top but then in this business nobody ever goes around telling people their careers are on the slide i dont really know where he is in the pecking order ive been out of it for too long been out of it so long i trusted him thought he was a mate but even if he was still successful merrily said something like this that would still be the summit of his career god yes ben said most independent producers would k he swiped back his hair with both hands figure of speech merrily wondered if largo had heard sebbie on the phone to zelda morgan from the bottom of the rocks where hed fallen probably not had he even thought of the risk that sebbies fall could be ruled out as the cause of death and if he had might sebbie still be alive or would he have taken a chance anyway she was a notorious convicted killer who was going to believe her denials she waited for bliss to ask something but bliss was staring up at the window chewing his lower lip again what would largos state of mind be she asked ben foley hes waiting in his car say at the entrance to the quarry hes seen brigid going up there hes seen a range rover taking the same route perhaps hes in the car with the headlights on or perhaps hes out there with the torch but suddenly he sees a body tumbling down from the rocks through the snow whats he feeling shock incredulity what do i say bens attempt at a smile was loose and nerveless shock and incredulity arent in antonys repertoire what then seeing what looks like a murder happen before his eyes a murder on a plate a murder committed by a highprofile killer hes been lusting after for reasons most of us wouldnt like to contemplate since he was a graduate trainee in your own words then sir bliss said i would say barely controllable very dark sexual excitement i see of course the man has used me lied to me cut the ground from under my feet and left me humiliated so i may be a tad prejudiced brigid bliss said when you came down from the rocks what did mr dacre say to you he didnt say anything merrily was aware of brigid drawing in a thin thread of a breath he was dead all right frannie bliss stood up i cant let you go anywhere yet brigid you realize that but i wont send you to hereford ill say weve had new snow ill say something he turned to ben where is he mr foley hes gone i think cant have been too many minutes ago back to london he said hed phone me when sometime actually it may be sooner than sometime after i copied his video discs to vhs i ah put blank ones back in his case naughty whatve you done with the originals theyre here i may put them under a stone at the bottom of hergest pool for a thousand years sorry sir local joke ben foley said bliss thought for a moment sod it lets get the bugger stopped on the road and brought back i want his clothes they went out for air merrily and brigid they stood at the highest point of the forecourt the view was immense and blinding under a surprising glaze of gaseous early sun no snow had come down since dawn is it safe brigid was staring at one of the small farms lying under hergest ridge like a trinket fallen from a shelf and merrily realized that this must be the nant tilted into the hillside half submerged in snow is it safe to tell clancy is it safe to tell jeremy you could see something crawling slowly towards it like a beetle perhaps the loyal danny thomas going in his tractor to see to jeremys animals i think jeremy already knows merrily gazed over the snowy forestry to hergest ridge thick white icing on an old fruit cake rich and spicy dark and bitter and soaked in alcohol where was the hound out there somewhere or existing only in the collective consciousness of midborder people a shadow on the retina of the minds eye can i stay here brigid said if it can you its a challenge isnt it everywheres a challenge she was thinking about something gomer had said about jeremys island of calm in a sea of noise and blood she wondered what would happen now to sebbie dacres three farms whether some other robber baron would come riding over the horizon in his range rover unable to spot the symptoms of history until the disease had set in it was important to guard the island behind them a shout went up that frannie bliss said is outrageous they think theyre a bloody law unto themselves these bastards its a remote area mumford said always been selfsufficient half of them have got their own snowploughs merrily stood at the bottom of the steps below the hotel porch as bliss followed mumford down who we looking at here andy ill give you three names boss berrows thomas parry damage the van with dacres body in it had a headlamp smashed thats the only police property however merrily hurried over whats happened your little friends bliss said decided for reasons of their own to reverse all the sterling work done to clear tons of snow from the bottom of the drive thus allowing us all to return to comparative civilization they put the snow back they put it back merrily even better than nature had done it in the first place blisss voice acquired some heat energy they seem to have created an impacted wall of snow harder than the sides of the fucking cresta run so that the first vehicles thinking the road was clear just piled into it i think it was berrows started it mumford said he was in a bit of an emotional state especially after the girl came down then thomas and parry arrived in the tractor with a plough and it escalated they can go a bit mental sometimes border people nick them bliss said grimly and the other blokes talking about legal action mumford said sorry andy the scottish bloke scottish bloke in the shogun i see in the silence a little smile landed like an insect at the corner of blisss mouth the impact seems to have dislocated his shoulder mumford said did you tell him how sorry we were no i thought youd like to do that yourself boss as the sio yes bliss said that would be correct procedure ill come now christmas eve killing for a chip shop killing for what jane had described as a contemporary dynamic small doorways for big evil most motives for murder seem ridiculous merrily said in front of the parlour fire as the daylight slipped away but all that tells you is that the reasons the motives are usually irrelevant for most of us they wouldnt be motives we hope you hoped you hoped you had an immune system a natural defence christianity whatever against all the evil in the air around you you hoped there was no such thing as an evil person only someone with a weakened immune system shed been to see alice this afternoon alice had come out of hospital alice was at her sisters house in belmont darrins family rolands family a whole male generation wiped out alice couldnt move her left side much but she could communicate just about verbal soup dribbling from the right side of her mouth you could get the sense of it mostly for instance the familys discovery that no doctor had actually treated dexter harris for asthma in over ten years since the family gp had become part of history such things didnt come out how long had dexter been feigning attacks to get himself out of various situations and responsibilities dont give me no stress mostly alice had just wept a fiery little woman doused by life there would be a lot of weeping in that house this christmas it was what christmas would become for them for the foreseeable future shed promised alice and the family some healing from the sundayevening service the erm healing service well what could you do a forum to discuss setting up a spiritual healing group in the diocese had been arranged for midjanuary at the cathedral the bishop himself would chair the meeting the idea of having lew jeavons as guest speaker had been ruled out i need to ring him she said to lol do i mention the twelve priests or do i wait for him to bring it up he may not want to explain lol was sitting on the rug with his back against the sofa his head against merrilys thigh some things just evolve just before she and jane had left stanner alistair hardy had taken merrily aside im uncomfortable about this mrs watkins knowing how you feel about people like me but after what you said when we met on the stairs about the twelve priests and black vaughan hed counted them he said this was just after the incident with the girl during the eucharist before merrily had initiated the baptism hed counted all twelve and what were they wearing merrily had asked legitimately sceptical kind of monks robes all carrying candles yes hardy said they did have a candle each but none of them wore monks robes and two of them were black and one was a woman just thought she might like to know lol had told her that jeavons had felt bad about the way the dexter thing was turning out asking lol to ring him as soon as he could find out what time the stanner eucharist had been arranged for he hadnt said a word to lol about his international database of over three hundred healing and deliverance priests after being given the approximate time hed asked for the location and a map reference hardy said hed noticed that merrilys aura had appeared brighter and more vivid as the dark essence of hattie chancery hazed into something palely grey probably still there though hardy said theres probably more to do youd know about that aftercare required before lunch bliss had rung dna tests on antony largos clothing had proved inconclusive maybe hed managed to dump some this was not bliss said going to be easy antony largo was not in custody and he had the worst kind of lawyer the crown prosecution service as usual was demonstrating symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome however strathclyde police had been helpful largo had formerly been known as anthony mckinnon born in the fairly sedate seaside resort of wait for it largs north of glasgow mckinnon aged sixteen had been one of several juveniles questioned in connection with the alleged gang rape of a prostitute who had eventually decided that she didnt want to appear in court it wasnt much bliss said but it was a start brigid parsons had made a full statement at hereford and had been released without charge it was a delicate situation and its satisfactory resolution depended on bliss nailing largo bliss wouldnt give up meanwhile natalie craven and her daughter had returned to the nant former dci ellie maylord had been consulted and would be travelling down bliss thought it would be a good idea if she and merrily met merrily agreed aftercare needed but dexter harris bliss said had been more or less textbook a black binliner had been found in a roadside litterbin inside it a claw hammer coated with blood and hair by this time dexters truck had been forensically examined truck hammer darrindexter a formality lols part in the final act had not been made public but he wasnt looking forward to the inquest lols theory about roland well that was never going to be proved one way or the other lol was convinced that when dexter had made darrin take the car that night it had been his intention that roland wasnt coming back everything that dexter had laid on darrin the brutality the cruelty was probably down to dexter all that and more howe it seemed had been unconcerned it was all academic now forensic psychology would say that dexter was formulapsychopathic the lies the cunning the remorseless cruelty merrily recalled a report that suggested over one per cent of the population was to some extent psychopathic most psychos didnt kill most killers didnt make a habit of it the thing is lol said now dexter was lets be honest he was dull an extremely dull person unbelievably selfrighteous limited intellect all that but as a killer he was imaginative he was instinctive creative he had flair christ lol like when he decided i needed to be killed he had it all worked out in no time disappearance some landfill site my dna all over alice he walks in and finds alice has had a stroke he acts on it he uses the whole situation including the weather conditions just like he did with darrin i mean both of those could have worked and hed have held out against interrogation because hed have resented it the cops would have been in the wrong he wasnt a criminal he was a working man with a clean record well since the age of twelve and you couldnt hold that against him but some of his family did and he resented it his family had treated him badly whatever happened to any of them they deserved it whats the betting that the damage inflicted on dexters familys property by darrin was not in fact done by darrin at all dexter lol nodded makes sense dexter seems to have created a whole new image for darrin within the family alice swallowed it anyway maybe she didnt see much of darrin but rolands death accidental engineered how good a driver was dexter merrily remembered blisss re construction unfortunately dexter panics stands on the brakes and the fiesta stalls on the kerb directly in the path of the oncoming lorry try not to think too hard about it lol said where does it come from then merrily said what was feeding his imagination your guess may be better than mine she slid down to the rug next to him although the snow was almost gone he hadnt left ledwardine since dexters death she hadnt yet asked him what the estate agent had told him before the office had closed for christmas an hour or so ago i kept wanting to confess to annie howe lol looked at her his glasses faintly misted maybe its something about her that withers your resolve but then i hadnt got much resolve anyway much more than you used to have sunshine i mean i did it i killed him why do people keep throwing false confessions at me you didnt touch him which makes it worse like hiring a hit man you didnt hire the beam every time i walked under it i instinctively ducked lol said although i knew i could walk under it upright with three or four inches to spare hed followed gomers advice told howe that dexter was coming after him and he just ran upstairs in fact lol had sat on the stairs and insulted dexter building up dexters fury to the point where but if hed suspected there might have been a low beam there merrily said hed have bent his head and then hed have taken me apart and you didnt know the beam was going to kill him well thats the point i didnt care lol look at me merrily said with alice lying there i wouldnt have cared prayer and cleansing in the inner hall some savage scrubbing of the floor shed offered to conduct dexters funeral at hereford crematorium but the bishop didnt think it was wise under the circumstances i wonder where he got his inhalers i think he or darrin would know people who did chemists shops not that dexter would personally associate with that kind of low life in the village this made him feel even more uncomfortable people smiled at lol now owre you mr robinson scary do you think i should ask jeavons over for christmas lunch i know its a bit late now and with eirion coming over lews going to his motherinlaws she looked at him suspiciously youve become very friendly with jeavons i dont understand it either normally i dont get on with priests at all all right merrily said what did the estate agent say she knew the agents had been trying to get hold of him because prof levin had called to pass on the message its not necessarily good news lol said the people who were buying the house called yesterday to pull out the husband said he was very annoyed that nobody had told them hes a lawyer in london he said thered been a precedent and someone had received a considerable outofcourt settlement as a result of a similar failure to disclose a problem of this nature huh they have a fiveyearold son and he was playing about upstairs and he came down in tears and said he wanted them to have their own house said the same thing the next time they came they got it out of him that he kept meeting an old woman on the landing in a cloak merrily sat up the wife went into jim prossers shop and asked him a few meaningful questions the agent said jim told them about lucy the poncho he said she was well known as a witch jim said that she thought owre you mr robinson the agent said normally this sort of thing didnt put people off any more kind of added to the charm of a house she said of course i know you were a friend of the late miss devenish meaning it wouldnt bother you it wouldnt have bothered these people either except that the kid suffers from lol hesitated hes got asthma i dont like this merrily said i knew you wouldnt i asked for some time to think about it if i told huw owen about this hed say it was some kind of occult trap hes away though yes you want to consult jeavons she looked at him in his gomer parry sweatshirt his spare pair of glasses a bruise around his left eye she leaned her head back against the sofa nothings bloody simple in this job is it early evening she had a phone call from beth pollen calling from the stanner hall hotel where she and jane were helping out jane said the atmosphere there was definitely better although that might be psychological amber she said was usually cheerful ben was quiet and contemplative i went to stanner rocks this afternoon beth pollen said martin booth whos in charge of the botanical survey took a group of us up there the first since the police removed their tapes and things the naturalists were jolly worried about damage done to the site by all that activity have you heard of the early star of bethlehem is that the unique the plant thats unique in this country to stanner rocks its just flowered oh despite the name this doesnt normally happen until february personally im taking it as a sign of something jane thought youd want to know she wanted to bring you a sprig but they wouldnt let her touch it merrily smiled i should think not erm have you spoken to alistair hardy at length right well about the twelve priests im sorry mrs pollen said oh well merrily watched lol playing with ethel the cat his sweatshirt had ridden up an area above his waist was still purple and black well i hope you have a good christmas she said afterword allowing the paranormal limited access to a mystery novel is a perilous business all i can say is ive lived not far from all of this for a long time and there are some aspects of it that nobody in the area even tries to explain away the central theme was founded on fullydocumented as well as some original research some years ago there was a programme i wrote and presented and which penny arnold produced for bbc radio called the return of the hound investigating the origins of arthur conan doyles most famous novel the quotes between the text from people with experience of the socalled hound of hergest and of course the bull in the church are taken from that programme it would be hard to doubt the sincerity behind any of these interviewees so thanks to all of them and also to susan and ken reeves of kington museum historians bob jenkins and alan lloyd alun lenny and roy palmer author of herefordshire folklore logaston press the very worthy successor to mrs leathers classic the folklore of herefordshire incidentally ive heard other intriguing stories relating to the hergest mystery from people unwilling to be quoted and you get the feeling that the spirit of sebbie dacre may also still be abroad in the kington area however the legend of black vaughan doesnt always add up and leaves much to be unravelled it would have been easy enough to add or alter a few details to make it more fiction friendly but i didnt like to touch it in the late s there was amused press speculation about the return of the hound of the baskervilles when a mystery predator was said to be at large in the area of clyro in radnorshire where the baskerville family had a country house and where the village pub is called the baskerville arms nothing was ever caught the recent beast of llangadog also had its curious aspects you can see the remarkable double tomb of thomas and ellen in the vaughan chapel at kington church and you can also see hergest court from the road although its not open to the public you may have difficulty finding stanner hall or any trace of the chancery family although the rocks are very apparent from the bypass thanks to fred slater author of the nature of central wales and andrew ferguson custodian of stanner rocks seriously dont go up there without permission the ascent can be dangerous and some unique plant life is at risk besides its more intriguing from a distance and you can spot the body parts on healing and deliverance many thanks this time to peter brooks who provided much technical assistance and a timely copy of is spiritualism of the devil by rev f fielding ould and john woolmer whose penetrating book healing and deliverance i discovered thanks to its publisher tony collins of monarch books healing the family tree by dr kenneth mcall is published by sheldon press recommended biographies of sir arthur are teller of tales by daniel stashower penguin very strong on the spiritualist years and the doctor the detective and arthur conan doyle by martin booth hodder and stoughton thanks for technical assistance to tim green and julian carey of bbc wales john mason pam baker and jane froud of the original cloak and dagger company deviser of murdermystery weekends to prof bernard knight for hangings to editors in order of appearance john jarrold peter lavery and nick austin for crucial tweaks to stefanie bierwerth for smoothing paths finally the contribution over six solid weeks during the final rewrite by my wife carol editor director inspired plotdoctor was unparalleled and rescued this book from that familiar abyss no one else could have done this with such perception and precision the background to this novel with pictures of stanner rocks hergest kington church etc can be found in merrilys border logaston press the songs of lol robinson are available on two cds songs from lucys cottage and a message from the morning available through the website wwwphilrickmancouk ps a short while ago when the hergest pool was drained for cleaning a large stone was found in the centre historian alan lloyd who was quite interested to find out if there was anything underneath it said no
