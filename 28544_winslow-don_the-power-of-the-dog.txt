don winslow the power of the dog prologue el sauzal state ofbaja california mexico the baby is dead in his mothers arms art keller can tell from the way the bodies lieher on top the baby beneath herthat she tried to shield her child she must have known art thinks that her own soft body could not have stopped bulletsnot from automatic rifles not from that rangebut the move must have been instinctive a mother puts her own body between her child and harm so she turned twisted as the bullets hit her then fell on top of her son did she really think that she could save the child maybe she didnt art thinks maybe she just didnt want the baby to see death blaze out from the barrel of the gun maybe she wanted her childs last sensation in this world to be that of her bosom enfolded in love art is a catholic at fortyseven years of age hes seen a lot of madonnas but nothing like this one cuernos de chivo he hears someone say quietly almost whispered as if they were in church cuernos de chivo horns of the goat aks art already knows thathundreds of mm shell casings lie on the patios concrete floor along with some gauge shotgun shells and some s probably art thinks from ars but most of the casings are from the cuernos de chivo the favored weapon of the mexican narcotraficantes nineteen bodies nineteen more casualties in the war on drugs art thinks hes used to looking at the bodies from his fourteenyear war with adan barrerahes looked at many but not nineteen not women children babies not this ten men three women six children lined up against the patio wall and shot blasted is more the word art thinks blasted to pieces in an incontinent rush of bullets the amount of blood is unreal a pool the size of a large car an inch thick with black dried blood blood splattered on the walls blood splattered on the manicured lawn where it glistens blackred on the tips of the grass the blades of which look to him like tiny bloody swords they must have put up a fight as they realized what was about to happen pulled from their beds in the middle of the night dragged out to the patio lined up against the wallsomeone had finally offered a struggle because furniture is tipped over heavy wroughtiron patio furniture glass shattered on the concrete art looks down and sees christ its a dollits brown glass eyes staring up at himlying in the blood a doll and a small cuddly animal and a beautifully rendered pinto horse in plastic all lying in blood by the execution wall children art thinks pulled out of sleep grab their toys and hold on to them even as especially as the guns roar an irrational image comes to him a stuffed elephant a childhood toy he always slept with it had one button eye it was stained with vomit with urine with all the various childhood effluvia and it smelled of all of them his mother had sneaked it away in his sleep and replaced it with a new elephant with two eyes and a pristine aroma and when art woke up he thanked her for the new elephant and then found and retrieved the old one from the trash arthur keller hears his own heart break he switches his gaze to the adult victims some are in pajamasexpensive silk pajamas and negligeessome in tshirts two of them a man and a woman are nakedas if they had been grabbed from a postcoital sleeping embrace what once had been love art thinks is now naked obscenity one body lies alone along the opposite wall an old man the head of the family probably shot last art thinks forced to watch his family killed and then dispatched himself mercifully art wonders was it some sort of sick mercy but then he sees the old mans hands his fingernails have been ripped out then the fingers chopped off his mouth is still open in a frozen scream and art can see the fingers sticking to his tongue meaning that they thought someone in his family was a dedo a fingeran informer because i led them to believe that god forgive me he searches through the bodies until he finds the one hes looking for when he does his stomach lurches and he has to fight back the vomit in his throat because the young mans face has been peeled like a banana the strips of flesh hang obscenely from his neck art hopes that they did this after they shot him but he knows better the bottom half of his skull has been blown off they shot him in the mouth traitors get shot in the back of the head informers in the mouth they thought it was him which was exactly what you wanted them to think art tells himself face itit worked just the way you planned but i never envisioned this he thinks i never thought theyd do this there must have been servants art says workers the police have already checked the workers quarters gone one of the cops says disappeared vanished he forces himself to look at the bodies again its my fault art thinks i brought this on these people im sorry art thinks i am so so sorry bending over the mother and child art makes the sign of the cross and whispers in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti el poderdel perro he hears one of the mexican cops murmur the power of the dog chapter one the men from sinaloa seest thou yon dreary plain forlorn and wild the seat of desolation void of light save what the glimmering of these livid flames casts pale and dreadful john milton paradiselost badiraguato district state ofsinaloa mexico the poppies burn red blossoms red flames only in hell art keller thinks do flowers bloom fire art sits on a ridge above the burning valley looking down is like peering into a steaming soup bowlhe cant see clearly through the smoke but what he can make out is a scene from hell hieronymus bosch does the war on drugs campesinosmexican peasant farmerstrot in front of the flames clutching the few possessions they could grab before the soldiers put the torch to their village pushing their children in front of them the campesinos carry sacks of food family photographs bought at great price some blankets some clothes their white shirts and straw hatsstained yellow with sweatmake them ghostlike in the haze of smoke except for the clothes art thinks it could bevietnam hes halfsurprised glancing at the sleeve of his own shirt to see blue denim instead of army green reminds himself that this isnt operation phoenix but operation condor and these arent the bamboothick mountains of i corps but the poppyrich mountain valleys of sinaloa and the crop isnt rice its opium art hears the dull bass whopwhopwhop of helicopter rotors and looks up like a lot of guys who were invietnam he finds the sound evocative yeah but evocative of what he asks himself then decides that some memories are better left buried choppers and fixedwing planes circle overhead like vultures the airplanes do the actual spraying the choppers are there to help protect the planes from the sporadic ak rounds fired by the remaining gomerosopium growerswho still want to make a fight of it art knows too well that an accurate burst from an ak can bring down a chopper hit it in the tail rotor and it will spiral down like a broken toy at a kids birthday party hit the pilot and well so far theyve been lucky and no choppers have been hit either the gomeros are just bad shots or theyre not used to firing on helicopters technically all the aircraft are mexicanofficially condor is a mexican show a joint operation between the ninth army corps and the state of sinaloabut the planes were bought and paid for by the dea and are flown by dea contract pilots most of them former cia employees from the old southeast asia crew now theres a tasty irony keller thinksairamerica boys who once flew heroin for thai warlords now spray defoliants on mexican opium the dea wanted to use agent orange but the mexicans had balked at that so instead they are using a new compound d which the mexicans feel comfortable with mostly keller chuckles because the gomeros were already using it to kill the weeds around the poppy fields so there was a ready supply yeah art thinks its a mexican operation we americans are just down here as advisers likevietnam just with different ball caps the american war on drugs has opened a front inmexico now ten thousand mexican army troops are pushing through this valley near the town of badiraguato assisting squadrons of the municipal judicial federal police better known as the federales and a dozen or so dea advisers like art most of the soldiers are on foot others are on horseback like vaqueros driving cattle in front of them their orders are simple poison the poppy fields and burn the remnants scatter the gomeros like dry leaves in a hurricane destroy the source of heroin here in the sinaloan mountains of westernmexico the sierra occidental has the best combination of altitude rainfall and soil acidity in thewestern hemisphere to grow papaver somniferum the poppy that produces the opium that is eventually converted to mexican mud the cheap brown potent heroin that has been flooding the streets of american cities operation condor art thinks there hasnt been an actual condor seen in mexican skies in over sixty years longer in the states but every operation has to have a name or we dont believe its real so condor it is arts done a little reading on the bird it is was the largest bird of prey although the term is a little misleading as it preferred scavenging over hunting a big condor art learned could take out a small deer but what it really liked was when something else killed the deer first so the bird could just swoop down and take it we prey on the dead operation condor anothervietnam flashback death from the sky and here i am crouched in the brush again shivering in the damp mountain cold again setting up ambushes again except the target now isnt some vc cadre on his way back to his village but old don pedro aviles the drug lord of sinaloa el patron himself don pedros been running opium out of these mountains for half a century even before bugsy siegel himself came here with virginia hill in tow to nail down a steady source of heroin for the west coast mafia siegel made the deal with a young don pedro aviles who used that leverage to make himself patron the boss a status hes maintained to this day but the old mans power has been slipping a little lately as some young upandcomers have started to challenge his authority the law of nature art supposesthe young lions eventually take on the old art has been kept awake more than one night in his culiacan hotel room by the sound of machinegun fire in the streets so common lately that the city has gained the nickname little chicago well after today maybe they wont have anything to fight about arrest old don pedro and you put an end to it and make yourself a star he thinks feeling a little guilty art is a true believer in the war on drugs growing up insan diego s barrio logan he saw firsthand what heroin does to a neighborhood particularly a poor one so this is supposed to be about getting drugs off the streets he reminds himself not advancing your career but the truth of it is that being the guy to bring down old don pedro aviles would make your career which truth be told could use a boost the dea is a new organization barely two years old when richard nixon declared a war on drugs he needed soldiers to fight it most of the new recruits came from the old bureau of narcotics and dangerous drugs a lot of them came from various police departments around the country but not a few of the early startup draft into the dea came from the company art was one of these company cowboys thats what the police types call any of the guys who came in from the cia theres a lot of resentment and mistrust of the covert types by the law enforcement types shouldnt be art thinks its basically the same functionintelligence gathering you find your assets cultivate them run them and act on the intelligence they give you the big difference between his new work and his old work is that in the former you arrest your targets and in the latter you just kill them operationphoenix the programmed assassination of the vietcong infrastructure art hadnt done too much of the actual wet work his job back invietnam was to collect raw data and analyze it other guys mostly special forces on loan to the company went out and acted on arts information they usually went out at night art recalls sometimes theyd be gone for days then reappear back at the base in the small hours of the morning cranked up on dexedrine then theyd disappear into their hooches and sleep for days at a time then go out and do it again art had gone out with them only a few times when his sources had produced info about a large group of cadres concentrated in the area then hed accompany the special forces guys to set up a night ambush he hadnt liked it much most of the time he was scared shitless but he did his job he pulled the trigger he took his buddies backs he got out alive with all his limbs attached and his mind intact he saw a lot of shit he wishes he could forget i just have to live with the fact art thinks that i wrote mens names down on paper and in the act of doing so signed their death warrants after that its a matter of finding a way to live decently in an indecent world but that fucking war that goddamn motherfucking war like a lot of people he watched the last helicopters taking off fromsaigon rooftops on television like a lot of vets he went out and got good and stinking drunk that night and when the offer came to move over to the new dea he jumped at it he talked it over with althie first maybe this is a war worth fighting he told his wife maybe this is a war we can actually win and now art thinks as he sits and waits for don pedro to show up we might be close to doing it his legs ache from sitting still but he doesnt move his stint invietnam taught him that the mexicans spaced in the brush around him are likewise disciplinedtwenty special agents from the dfs armed with uzis dressed in camouflage tio barrera is wearing a suit even up here in the high brush the governors special assistant is wearing his trademark black suit white buttondown shirt skinny black tie he looks comfortable and serene the image of latino male dignity he reminds you of one of those matinee idols from an old s movie art thinks black hair slicked back pencil mustache thin handsome face with cheekbones that look like theyre cut from granite eyes as black as a moonless night officially miguel angel barrera is a cop a sinaloa state policeman the bodyguard to the state governor manuel sanchez cerro unofficially barrera is a fixer the governors point man and seeing how condor is technically a sinaloa state operation barrera is the guy whos really running the show and me art thinks if i really want to be honest about it tio barrera is running me the twelve weeks of dea training werent that hard the pt was a breezeart could easily run the threemile course and play basketball and the selfdefense component was unsophisticated compared with langley the instructors just had them wrestle and box and art had finished third in the san diego golden gloves as a kid he was a mediocre middleweight with good technique but slow hands he found out the hard truth that you cant learn speed he was just good enough to get into the upper ranks where he could really get beat up but he showed he could take it and that was his ticket as a mixedrace kid in the barrio mexican fight fans have more respect for what a fighter can take than for what he can dish out and art could take it after he started boxing the mexican kids pretty much left him alone even the gangs backed off him in the dea training sessions he made it a point to take it easy on his opponents in the ring though there was no point in beating someone up and making an enemy just to show off the law enforcementprocedure classes were tougher but he got through them all right and the drug training was pretty easy questions like can you identify marijuana can you identify heroin art resisted the impulse to answer that he always could at home the other temptation he resisted was to finish first in his class he could have knew he could have but decided to fly under the radar the law enforcement guys already felt that the company types were trespassing on their turf so it was better to walk lightly so he took it a little easy in the physical training kept quiet in class punted a few questions on the tests he did enough to do well to pass but not enough to shine it was a little harder to be cool in the field training surveillance practice old hat hidden cameras mikes bugs he could install them in his sleep clandestine meetings dead drops live drops cultivating a source interrogating a suspect gathering intelligence analyzing data he could have taught the course he kept his mouth shut graduated and was declared a special agent of the dea they gave him a twoweek vacation and sent him straight to mexico right to culiacan the capital of the western hemisphere drug trade opiums market town the belly of the beast his new boss gave him a friendly greeting tim taylor the culiacan rac resident agent in charge had already perused arts shield and seen through the transparent screen he didnt even look up from the file art was sitting across from his desk and the guy said vietnam yup accelerated pacification program yup accelerated pacification program aka operation phoenix the old joke being that a lot of guys got peaceful in a hurry cia taylor said and it wasnt a question it was a statement question or statement art didnt answer it he knew the book on taylorhe was an old bndd guy whod lived through the lowbudget bad days now that drugs were a fat priority he didnt intend to lose his hardearned gains to a bunch of new kids on the block you know what i dont like about you company cowboys taylor asked no what you arent cops taylor said youre killers and fuck you too art thought but he kept his mouth shut kept it firmly clamped while taylor launched into a lecture about how he didnt want any cowboy shit from art how theyre a team here and art better be a team player and play by the rules art would have been happy to be a team player if they would have let him on the team not that art cared one hell of a lot you grow up in the barrio as the son of an anglo father and a mexican mother youre not on anybodys team arts father was a san diego businessman who seduced a mexican girl while on vacation in mazatlan art often thought it was funny that he was conceived albeit not born in sinaloa art senior decided to do the right thing and marry the girlnot too painful an option as she was a raving beauty art gets his good looks from his mothers side his father brings her back to the states only to decide that shes like a lot of things you get in mexico on vacationshe looked a lot better on a moonlit beach in mazatlan than in the cold anglo light of the american daytoday art senior dumped her when art was about a year old she didnt want to throw away the one advantage her son had in lifeus citizenshipso she moved in with some distant relations in barrio logan art knew who his father wassometimes hed sit in the little park on crosby street and look at the tall glass buildings downtown and imagine going into one of them to see his father but he didnt art senior sent checksfaithfully at first and then sporadicallyand hed get occasional bouts of paternal urges or guilt and show up to take art to dinner or maybe a padres game but their fatherson time was awkward and forced and by the time art was in junior high the visits had stopped altogether ditto the money so it was no easy thing when the seventeenyearold art finally made the trip downtown marched into one of those tall glass buildings strode into his fathers office laid his killer sat scores and ucla acceptance letter on his desk and said dont freak out all i want from you is a check he got it once a year for four years he got the lesson too yoyo youre on your own which was a good lesson to learn because the dea just chucked him into culiacan virtually on his own just get the lay of the land is what taylor told him at the start of a clichefest that also included get your feet wet easy does it and honest to god failing to prepare is preparing to fail it should have included and go fuck yourself because that was the thrust of it taylor and the cop types totally isolated him kept info from him wouldnt introduce him to contacts froze him out on meetings with the local mexican cops didnt include him in the morning coffeeanddoughnut bullshit or the sundown beer sessions where the real information was passed he was fucked from jump street the local mexicans werent going to talk to him because as a yanqui in culiacan he could only be one of two thingsa drug dealer or a narc he wasnt a drug dealer because he wasnt buying anything taylor wouldnt free up any money he didnt want art fucking up anything they already had going so he had to be a narc the culiacan police wouldnt have anything to do with him because he was a yanqui narc who should stay home and mind his own business and besides most of them were on don pedro aviless payroll anyway the sinaloa state cops wouldnt deal with him for the same reasons with the additional rationale that if kellers own dea wouldnt work with him why should they not that the team was doing much better the dea had been hammering on the mexican government for two years trying to get them to move against the gomeros the agents brought evidencephotos tapes witnessesonly to have the federales promise to move right away and then not move only to hear this is mexico senores these things take time while the evidence grew stale the witnesses got scared and the federales rotated posts so that the americans had to start all over again with a different federal cop who told them to bring him solid evidence bring him witnesses who when they did looked at them with perfect condescension and told them senores this is mexico these things take time while the heroin flowed down from the hills into culiacan like mud in a spring thaw the young gomeros slugged it out with don pedros forces on a nightly basis until the city sounded to art like danang or saigon only with a lot more gunfire night after night art would lie on the bed in his hotel room drinking cheap scotch maybe watching a soccer game or boxing match on tv pissed off and feeling sorry for himself and missing althie god how he missed althie he had met althea patterson on bruin walk in his senior year introducing himself with a lame line arent we in the same poli sci section tall thin and blond althea was more angular than curvy her nose was long and hooked her mouth a little too wide and her green eyes set a little too deep to be considered classically pretty but althea was beautiful and smartthey actually were in the same poli sci section and hed listened to her talk in class she argued her viewpoint a little to the left of emma goldman ferociously and that turned him on too so they went out for pizza and then they went to her apartment in westwood she made espresso and they talked and he found out that she was a rich girl from santa barbara her family old california money and her father a very big deal in the state democratic party to her he was madly handsome with that shock of black hair that fell over his forehead that rugged broken nose that saved him from being a pretty boy and the quiet intelligence that had brought a kid from the barrio to ucla there was something else tooa loneliness a vulnerability a hurt an edge of angerthat made him irresistible they ended up in bed and in the postcoital darkness he asked so can you cross that off your liberal checklist now what sleeping with a spic she thought about this for a few seconds then answered see i always thought that spic referred to a puerto rican what i can cross off is sleeping with a beaner actually he said im only half a beaner well then jesus art she said what good are you althea was the exception to arts doctrine of yoyo an insidious infiltrator into the selfsufficiency that was already well ingrained in him by the time he met her secrecy was already a habit a protective wall he had carefully constructed around himself as a kid by the time he fell in love with althie hed had the added advantage of professional instruction in the discipline of mental compartmentalization the companys talentspotters had lamped him in his sophomore year picked him like lowhanging fruit his international relations professor a cuban expatriate took him out for coffee then started advising him on what classes to take what languages to study professor osuna brought him home to dinner taught him which fork to use when which wine to select with what even which women to date professor osuna loved althea shes perfect for you he said she gives you sophistication it was more of a seduction than a recruitment not that art was hard to seduce they have a nose for guys like me art thought later the lost the lonely the bicultural misfits with a foot in two worlds and a place in neither and you were perfect for themsmart streettough ambitious you looked white but you fought brown all you needed was the polish and they gave you that then came the small errands arturo theres a bolivian professor visiting could you escort him around the city a few more of those then arturo what does dr echeverria like to do in his leisure time does he drink does he like the girls no perhaps the boys then arturo if professor mendez wanted some marijuana could you get it for him arturo could you tell me who our distinguished poet friend is speaking to on the telephone arturo this is a listening device if you could perhaps insinuate it into his room art did it all without blinking and did it all well they handed him his diploma and a ticket to langley practically at the same time explaining this to althie was an interesting exercise i can sort of tell you but i cant really was about the best he could manage she wasnt stupid she got it boxing she told him is the perfect metaphor for you what do you mean the art of keeping things out she said youre so skilled at it nothing touches you thats not true art thought you touch me they got married a few weeks before he shipped out to vietnam hed write her long passionate letters that never included anything about what he actually did he was changed when he got home she thought of course he was why wouldnt he be but the insularity that had always been there was intensified he could suddenly put oceans of emotional distance between them and deny that he was doing it then he would revert to being that sweet intensely affectionate man with whom she had fallen in love she was relieved when he said he was thinking about changing jobs he was enthused about the new dea he thought he could really do some good there she encouraged him to take the job even though it meant he was going to leave for another three months even when he came home just long enough to get her pregnant and left again this time for mexico he wrote her long passionate letters from mexico that never included anything about what he actually did because i dont do anything he wrote her not a goddamn thing except feel sorry for myself so get off your ass and do something she wrote back or quit and come home to me i know daddy could get you a job on a senators staff in no time just say the word art didnt say the word what he did was get off his ass and go see a saint everyone in sinaloa knows the legend of santo jesus malverde he was a bandito a daring robber a man of the poor who gave back to the poor a sinaloan robin hood his luck ran out in and the federales hanged him on a gallows just across the street from where his shrine now stands the shrine was spontaneous first some flowers then a picture then a small building of roughhewn planks put up by the poor at night even the police were afraid to tear it down because the legend grew that the soul of malverde lived in the shrine that if you came here and prayed and lit a candle and made a mandaa devotional promisejesus malverde could and would grant favors bring you a good crop protect you from your enemies heal your illnesses notes of gratitude detailing the favors that malverde has bestowed are stuck into the walls a sick child cured rent money magically appeared an arrest evaded a conviction overturned a mojado returned safely from el norte a murder avoided a murder avenged art went to the shrine figured it was a good place to start he walked down from his hotel waited patiently in line with the other pilgrims and finally got inside he was used to saints his mother had faithfully dragged him to our lady of guadalupe in barrio logan where he took catechism classes made his first communion was confirmed he had prayed to saints lit candles at the statues of saints sat as a child and looked at paintings of saints actually art was a pretty faithful catholic even during college he was a regular communicant in vietnam at first but his devotion waned and he stopped going to confession it was like forgive me father for i have sinned forgive me father for i have sinned forgive me father for i have oh fuck it whats the point every day i mark men for death every other week i kill them myself im not going to come in here and tell you that im not going to do it again when its on the schedule regular as mass sal scachi one of the special forces guys used to go to mass every sunday he wasnt out killing people art used to marvel how the perceived hypocrisy didnt faze him they even talked about it one drunken night art and this very italian guy from new york it dont bother me scachi said shouldnt bother you the vc dont believe in god anyway so fuck em they got into a ferocious debate art appalled that scachi actually thought they were doing gods work by assassinating vietcong communists are atheists scachi repeated who want to destroy the church so what were doing he explained is defending the church and that isnt a sin its a duty he reached under his shirt and showed art the saint anthonys medal he kept around his neck on a chain the saint keeps me safe he explained you should get one art didnt now in culiacan he stood and stared into the obsidian eyes of santo jesus malverde the saints plaster skin was stark white and his mustache a sable black and a garish circle of red had been painted around his neck to remind the pilgrim that the saint had like all the best saints been martyred santo jesus died for our sins well art said to the statue whatever youre doing its working and whatever im doing its not so art made a manda knelt lit a candle and left a twentydollar bill what the hell help me bring you down santo jesus he whispered in spanish and theres more where that came from ill give money to the poor walking back to the hotel from the shrine art met adan barrera art had walked past this gym a dozen times he had been tempted to check it out and never had but on this particular evening a fairly large crowd was inside so he walked in and stood at the edge adan was barely twenty then short almost diminutive with a thin build long black hair combed straight back designer jeans nike running shoes and a purple polo shirt expensive clothes for this barrio smart clothes smart kidart could see that right away adan barrera just had a look like he always knew what was going on art put him at about maybe but the kid standing beside him had to go easy and built big chest sloping shoulders lanky you wouldnt make them for brothers except for their faces same face on two different bodiesdeep brown eyes light coffeecolored skin more spanishlooking than indian they were standing on the edge of the ring looking down at an unconscious boxer another fighter stood in the ring a kid really certainly not out of his teens but with a body that looked like it had been chiseled out of living stone and he had those eyesart had seen them before in the ringthat had the look of a natural killer except now he seemed confused and a little guilty art got it right away the fighter had just knocked out a sparring partner and now had no one to work out with the two brothers were his managers it was a common enough scene in any mexican barrio for poor kids from the barrio there were two routes up and outdrugs or boxing the kid was an upandcomer hence the crowd and the two middleclass muttandjeff brothers were his managers now the short one was looking around the crowd to find someone who could step into the ring and go a few rounds a lot of guys in the crowd suddenly found something very interesting on the tops of their shoes art didnt he caught the short guys eye who are you the kid asked his brother took one look at art and said yanqui narc then he looked over the crowd straight at art and said vete al demonio picaflor basically get the hell out of here faggot art instantly answered pela las nalgas perra shove it up your ass bitch which was a surprise coming out of the mouth of a guy who looked very white the lanky brother started to push his way through the crowd to get at art but the smaller brother grabbed him by the elbow and whispered something to him tall brother smiled then the smaller one said to art in english youre about the right size you want to go a few rounds with him hes a kid art answered he can take care of himself the short brother said in fact he can take care of you art laughed you box the kid pressed used to art said a little bit well come on in yanqui the kid said well find you some gloves it wasnt machismo that made art accept the challenge he could have laughed it off but boxing is sacred in mexico and when people youve been trying to get close to for months invite you into their church you go so who am i fighting he asked one of the crowd as they were taping his hands and getting him into gloves el leoncito de culiacan the man answered proudly the little lion of culiacan hell be champion of the world one day art walked into the center of the ring take it easy on me he said im an old man they touched gloves dont try to win art told himself take it easy on the kid youre here to make friends ten seconds later art was laughing at his own pretensions between taking punches that is you couldnt be much less effective he told himself if you were wrapped in telephone wire i dont think you have to worry about winning worry about surviving maybe he told himself ten seconds later the kids hand speed was awesome art couldnt even see the punches coming never mind block them never mind counterpunch but you have to try its about respect so he launched a straight right behind a left jab and collected a wicked threepunch combination in return boomboomboom its like living inside a fucking timpani drum art thought backing away bad idea the kid came rushing in threw two lightning jabs and then a straight shot to the face and if arts nose wasnt broken it was doing a damn good imitation he swiped the blood off his nose covered up and took most of the subsequent drubbing on his gloves until the kid switched tactics and went downstairs digging rights and lefts into arts ribs it seemed like an hour later when the bell rang and art went back to his stool big brother was right there you had enough picaflor except this time the faggot wasnt quite so hostile art answered in a friendly tone im just getting my wind bitch he got the wind knocked out of him about five seconds into round two a wicked left hook to the liver dropped art right to one knee he had his head down and blood and sweat dripped off his nose he was gasping for air and out of the corners of his teary eyes he could see men in the crowd exchanging money and he could just hear the smaller brother counting to ten with a tone of foregone conclusion fuck you all art thought he got up heard cursing from some in the crowd cheers from a few come on art he told himself just getting the shit beat out of you isnt going to get you anywhere you have to put up some kind of a fight neutralize this kids hand speed dont let him get off punches so easy he charged forward took three hard shots for his trouble but kept going forward and worked the kid into the ropes stayed toe to toe with him and started throwing short chopping punches not hard enough to really hurt but enough to make the kid cover up then art ducked down hit him twice in the ribs and then leaned forward and tied him up take a few seconds off the round art thought get a blow lean on the kid maybe wear him out a little but even before little brother could come in and break the clinch the kid slipped under arts arms spun out and hit him with two punches in the side of the head art kept coming forward absorbing punches the whole time but it was art who was the aggressor and that was the point the kid was backing off dancing hitting him at will but nevertheless going backwards he dropped his hands and art hit him with a hard left jab in the chest driving him back the kid looked surprised so art did it again between rounds the two brothers were too busy giving their boxer hell to give art any shit he was grateful for the rest one more round he thought just let me get through one more round the bell rang a lot of dinero changed hands when art got off his stool he touched gloves with the kid for the last round looked into his eyes and instantly saw that hed wounded the kids pride shit art thought i didnt mean to do that rein in your ego asshole and dont take a chance on winning this thing he neednt have worried whatever the brothers had told the kid between rounds the kid made the adjustment constantly moving to his left in the direction of his own jab keeping his hands high pretty much hitting art at will then getting out of the way art was moving forward hitting at air he stopped stood in the center of the ring shook his head laughed and waved the kid to come on in the crowd loved it the kid loved it he shuffled into the center of the ring and started raining punches down on art who blocked them the best he could and covered up art would shoot a jab or counterpunch back every few seconds and the kid would fire over it and nail him again the kid wasnt going for knockout punches now there was no anger in him anymore he was truly sparring just getting in his workout and showing that he could hit art anytime he wanted playing to the crowd giving them the show theyd come to see by the end art was down on one knee with his gloves tight to his head and his elbows tucked into his ribs so he was taking most of the shots on his gloves and arms the final bell rang the kid picked art up and they embraced you are going to be champ one day art said to him you did okay the kid said thank you for the match you got yourself a good fighter art said as little brother was taking his gloves off were going all the way little brother said he stuck out his hand my name is adan thats my brother raul raul looked down at art and nodded you didnt quit yanqui i thought youd quit no faggot this time art noted if i had any brains id have quit he said you fight like a mexican raul said ultimate praise actually i fight like half a mexican art thought but he kept it to himself but he knew what raul meant it was the same in barrio loganit isnt so much what you can dish out as what you can take well i took plenty tonight art thought all i want to do now is go back to the hotel take a long hot shower and spend the rest of the night with an ice pack okay several ice packs were going out for some beers adan said you want to come yeah art thought yeah i do so he spent the night downing beers in a cafetin with adan years later art would have given anything in the world to have just killed adan barrera on the spot tim taylor called him into the office the next morning art looked like shit which was an accurate external reflection of his internal reality his head was pounding from the beers and the yerba hed ended up smoking in the afterhours club adan had hauled him to his eyes were black and there were still traces of dark dried blood under his nose hed showered but hadnt shaved because one he hadnt had time and two the thought of dragging anything across his swollen jaw was just unacceptable and even though he lowered himself into the chair slowly his bruised ribs screamed at him for the offense taylor looked at him with undisguised disgust you had quite a night for yourself art smiled sheepishly even that hurt you know about that you know how i heard taylor said i had a meeting this morning with miguel barrera you know who that is keller hes a sinaloan state cop the special assistant to the governor the man in this area weve been trying to get him to work with us for two years and i have to hear from him that one of my agents is brawling with the locals it was a sparring match whatever taylor said look these people are not our pals or our drinking buddies theyre our targets and maybe thats the problem art heard himself say some disembodied voice that he couldnt control hed meant to keep his mouth shut but he was just too fuckedup to maintain the discipline whats the problem fuck it art thought too late now so he answered that we look at these people like targets and anyway it pissed him off people as targets been there done that besides that i learned more about how things work down here last night than i did in the last three months look youre not in an undercover role here taylor said work with the local law enforcement people cant tim art said you did a good job of queering me with them im going to get you out of here tim said i want you off my team start the paperwork art said he was sick of this shit dont worry i will taylor said in the meantime keller try to conduct yourself like a professional art nodded and got up out of the chair slowly while the damoclean sword of bureaucracy was dangling art thought he might as well keep working whats the saying he asked himself they can kill you but they cant eat you which isnt truethey can kill you and eat youbut that doesnt mean you go easy the thought of going to work on a senatorial staff depressed the hell out of him it wasnt so much the work as it was althies father setting it up art having a somewhat ambivalent attitude toward father figures it was the idea of failure you dont let them knock you out you make them knock you out you make them break their fucking hands knocking you out you let them know that theyve been in a fight you give them something to remember you by every time they look in a mirror he went right back to the gym que noche bruta he said to adan me mata la cabeza pero gozamos we enjoyed ourselves all right art thought my head is splitting anyway hows the little lion cesar better than you adan said better than me wheres raul probably out getting laid adan said es el cono ese you want a beer hell yes damn it tasted good going down art took a long wonderful swig then laid the icecold bottle against his swollen cheek you look like shit adan said that good almost adan signaled the waiter and ordered a plate of cold meats the two men sat at the outdoor table and watched the world go by so youre a narc adan said thats me my uncle is a cop you didnt go into the family business adan said im a smuggler art raised an eyebrow it actually hurt blue jeans adan said laughing my brother and i go up to san diego buy blue jeans and sneak them back across the border sell them dutyfree off the back of a truck youd be surprised how much money there is in it i thought you were in college what was it accounting you have to have something to count adan said does your uncle know what you do for beer money tio knows everything adan said he thinks its frivolous he wants me to get serious but the jeans business is good it brings in some cash until the boxing thing takes off cesar will be a champion well make millions you ever try boxing yourself art asked adan shook his head im small but im slow raul hes the fighter in the family well i think i fought my last match i think thats a good idea they both laughed its a funny thing how friendships are formed art would think about that years later a sparring match a drunken night an afternoon at a sidewalk cafe conversation ambitions shared over shared dishes bottles and hours bullshit tossed back and forth laughs art would think about that the realization that until adan barrera hed never really had a friend he had althie but that was different you can describe your wife truthfully as your best friend but its not the same thing its not that male thing that brotheryouneverhad guyyouhangoutwith thing cuates amigos almost hermanos hard to know how that happens maybe what adan saw in art was what he didnt find in his own brotheran intelligence a seriousness a maturity he didnt have himself but wanted maybe what art saw in adan christ later hed try for years to explain it even to himself it was just that back in those days adan barrera was a good guy he really was or at least it seemed that way whatever it was that was lying dormant inside him maybe it lies in all of us art would later think it sure as hell did in me the power of the dog it was adan inevitably who introduced him to tio six weeks later art was lying on his bed in his hotel room watching a soccer match on tv feeling shitty because tim taylor had just received the okay to reassign him probably send me to iowa to check if drugstores are complying with regulations on prescribing cough medicine or something art thought career over there was a knock at the door art opened it to see a man in a black suit white shirt and skinny black tie hair slicked back in the oldfashioned style pencil mustache eyes black as midnight maybe forty years old with an old world gravitas senor keller forgive me for disturbing your privacy he said my name is miguel angel barrera sinaloa state police i wonder if i might have a few moments of your time no shit you can art thought and asked him in luckily art had most of a fifth of scotch left over from a bunch of lonely nights so he could at least offer the man a drink barrera accepted it and offered art a thin black cuban cigar in return i quit art said do you mind then ill live vicariously through you art answered he looked around for an ashtray and found one then the two men sat down at the small table next to the window barrera looked at art for a few seconds as if considering something then said my nephew asked if id stop in and see you your nephew adan barrera right my uncle is a cop art thought so this is tio art said adan conned me into getting in the ring with one of the best fighters ive ever seen adan fancies himself a manager tio said raul thinks hes a trainer they do all right art said cesar could take them a long way i own cesar barrera said im an indulgent uncle i let my nephews play but soon i will have to hire a real manager and a real trainer for cesar he deserves no less hell be a champion adan will be disappointed learning to deal with disappointment is part of becoming a man barrera said well thats no shit adan relates that you are in some sort of professional difficulty now how do i answer that art wondered taylor would no doubt employ a cliche about not washing our dirty laundry in public but hed be right hed shit jagged glass anyway if he knew that barrera was even here going under his head as it were to talk with a junior officer my boss and i dont always see eye to eye barrera nodded senor taylors vision can be somewhat narrow all he can see is pedro aviles the trouble with your dea is that it is forgive me so very american your colleagues do not understand our culture how things work how things have to work the man isnt wrong art thought our approach down here has been clumsy and heavyhanded to say the least that fuckedup american attitude of we know how to get things done just get out of our way and let us do the job and why not it worked so well in nam art answered in spanish what we lack in subtlety we make up for with a lack of subtlety barrera asked are you mexican senor keller half art said on my mothers side as a matter of fact shes from sinaloa mazatlan because art thought im not above playing that card but you were raised in the barrio barrera said in san diego this isnt a conversation art thought its a job interview you know san diego he asked i lived on thirtieth street but you stayed out of the gangs i boxed barrera nodded and then started speaking in spanish you want to take down the gomeros barrera said so do we sin falta but as a boxer barrera said you know that you just cant go for the knockout right away you have to set your opponent up take his legs away from him with body punches cut the ring off you do not go for the knockout until the time is right well i didnt have a lot of knockouts art thought but the theory is right we yanquis want to swing for the knockout right away and the man is telling me that it isnt set up yet fair enough what youre saying makes great sense to me art said its wisdom but patience is not a particularly american virtue i think if my superiors could just see some progress some motion your superiors barrera said are difficult to work with they are he searches for a word art finishes it for him falta gracia illmannered barrera agrees exactly if on the other hand we could work with someone simpatico un companero someone like yourself so art thinks adan asked him to save my ass and now hes decided its worth doing hes an indulgent uncle he lets his nephews play but hes also a serious man with a definite objective in mind and i might be useful in achieving that objective again fair enough but this is a slippery slope an unreported relationship outside the agency strictly verboten a partnership with one of the most important men in sinaloa and i keep it in my pocket a time bomb it could get me fired from the dea altogether then again what do i have to lose art poured them each another drink then said id love to work with you but theres a problem barrera shrugged y que i wont be here art said theyre reassigning me barrera sipped his whiskey with a polite pretense of enjoyment as if it were good whiskey when they both knew that it was cheap shit then he asked do you know the real difference between america and mexico art shook his head in america everything is about systems barrera said in mexico everything is about personal relationships and youre offering me one art thought a personal relationship of the symbiotic nature senor barrera my given names are miguel angel barrera said but my friends call me tio tio art thought uncle thats the literal translation but the word implies a lot more in mexican spanish tio could be a parents brother but he could also be any relative who takes an interest in a kids life it goes beyond that a tio can be any man who takes you under his wing an olderbrother type even a paternal figure sort of a godfather tio art began barrera smiled and accepted the tribute with a slight bow of his head then he said arturo mi sobrino arthur my nephew youre not going anywhere except up arts reassignment was canceled the next afternoon he was called back into taylors office who the fuck do you know taylor asked him art shrugged i just had my leash jerked all the way from washington taylor said is this some cia shit are you still on their payroll who do you work for kellerthem or us me art thought i work for myself but he didnt say it he just ate his ration of shit and said i work for you tim say the word ill have dea tattooed on my ass if you want it can be a heart with your name across it taylor stared across the desk at him obviously unsure of whether art was fucking with him or not and of how to respond he settled on a tone of bureaucratic neutrality and said i have instructions to let you alone to do your own thing do you know how i choose to view this keller as giving me enough rope to hang myself exactly how did i know ill produce for you tim art said getting up to leave the room ill produce for the team but on the way out he couldnt help singing albeit softly im an old cowhand from the rio grande but i cant poke a cow cuz i dont know how a partnership made in hell this is how art would later describe it art keller and tio barrera they met rarely and secretly tio chose his targets carefully art could see it buildingor more accurately deconstructing as barrera used art and the dea to remove one brick after another from don pedros structure a valuable poppy field then a cookery then a lab then two junior gomeros three crooked state policeman a federale who was taking the mordidathe bite the bribefrom don pedro barrera stayed aloof from it all never getting directly involved never taking any credit just using art as his knife hand to gut the aviles organization art wasnt just a puppet in all this either he used the sources barrera gave him to work other sources to establish leverage to create assets in the metastasizing algebra of intelligence gathering one source gets you two two gets you five five gets you well among the good things it also gets endless servings of shit from the cop types in the dea tim taylor had art on the carpet a halfdozen times where are you getting your info art whos your source you got a snitch were a team art theres no i in team yeah but there is in win art thought and thats what were finally doingwinning creating leverage playing one rival gomero against another showing the sinaloan campesinos that the days of the gomero overlords are really coming to an end so he told taylor nothing he had to admit there was an element of fuck you tim and your team while tio barrera maneuvered like a master technician in the ring always pressing forward but always with his guard up setting up his punches and throwing them only when there was minimal risk to himself knocking the wind and the legs out from under don pedro cutting off the ring then the knockout punch operation condor the mass sweep of troops and supporting aircraft with bombing and defoliants but still it was art keller who could direct them where to hit almost as if he had a personal map of every poppy field cookery and lab in the province which was almost literally true now art crouches in the brush waiting for the big prize with all the success of condor the dea is still focused on one goal get don pedro its all art has heard about where is don pedro get don pedro we have to get el patron as if we have to hang that trophy head on the wall or the whole operation is a failure hundred of thousands of acres of poppies destroyed the entire infrastructure of the sinaloan gomeros devastated but we still need that one old man as a symbol of our success theyre out there running around like crazy chasing every rumor and tidbit of intelligence but always a step behind or as taylor might say a day late and a dollar short art cant decide what taylor wants moreto get don pedro or for art not to get don pedro art was out in a jeep inspecting the charred ruins of a major heroin lab when tio barrera came rolling up out of the smoke with a small convoy of dfs troops the fucking dfs art wondered the direccion federal de seguridadfederal security directorateis like the fbi and cia rolled into one except more powerful the dfs boys virtually have carte blanche for whatever they do in mexico now tio is a jalisco state copwhat the hell is he doing with a squad of the elite dfs and in command no less tio leaned out of his open jeep cherokee and simply said with a sigh i suppose we had better go pick up old don pedro handing art the biggest prize in the war on drugs as if it were a bag of groceries you know where he is art asked better tio said i know where hes going to be so now art sits crouched in the brush waiting for the old man to walk into the ambush he can feel tios eyes on him he looks over to see tio pointedly looking at his watch art gets the message anytime now don pedro aviles sits in the front seat of his mercedes convertible as it slowly rumbles over the dirt back road theyve driven out of the burning valley up onto the mountain if he gets down the other side hell be safe be careful he tells young guero whos driving watch the holes its an expensive car we have to get you out of here patron guero tells him i know that don pedro snaps but did we have to take this road the car will be ruined there will be no soldiers on this road guero tells him no federales no state police you know this for a fact aviles asks again i have it straight from barrera guero says he has cleared this route he should clear a route aviles says the money i pay them money to governor cerro money to general hernandez barrera comes as regular as a womans curse to collect the money always the money to the politicians to the generals it has always been this way since don pedro was a boy learning the business from his father and there will always be these periodic sweeps these ritual cleansings coming down from mexico city at the behest of the yanquis this time its in exchange for higher oil prices and governor cerro sent barrera to give don pedro the word invest in oil don pedro sell off opium and put the money in oil its going up soon and the opium so i let the young fools buy into my poppy fields took their money and put it into the oil and cerro let the yanquis burn the poppy fields doing work that the sun would do for them for thats the great joke operation condor timed to happen just before the drought years come he has seen it in the sky the past two years seen it in the trees the grass the birds the drought years are coming five years of bad crops before the rains come back if the yanquis did not burn the fields don pedro tells guero i would have refresh the soil so it is a farce this operation condor a play a joke but still he has to get out of sinaloa aviles has not stayed alive for seventythree years by being careless so he has guero driving and five of his most trusted sicariosgunmenin a car behind men whose families all live in don pedros compound in culiacan who would all be killed if anything should happen to don pedro and guerohis apprentice his assistant an orphan whom he took off the streets of culiacan as a manda to santo jesus malverde the patron saint of all sinaloan gomeros guero whom he raised in the business to whom he taught everything a young man now his righthand man cat smart who can do monumental figures in his head in a flash who is nevertheless driving the mercedes too fast on this rough road slow down aviles orders gueroblondie because of his light hairchuckles the old man has millions and millions but he will cluck like an old hen over a repair bill he could throw this mercedes away and not miss it but will complain about the few pesos it will cost to wash the dust off it doesnt bother guero hes used to it he slows down we should make a manda to malverde when we get to culiacan don pedro says we cant stay in culiacan patron guero says the americans will be there to hell with the americans barrera advised us to go to guadalajara i dont like guadalajara don pedro says its only for a little while they come to a junction and guero starts to turn left to the right don pedro says to the left patron guero says don pedro laughs i have been smuggling opium out of these hills since your fathers father was tugging at your grandmothers pants turn right guero shrugs and turns right the road narrows and the dirt gets soft and deep keep going slowly don pedro says go slow but keep going they come to a sharp right curve through thick brush and guero takes his foot off the gas que cono te pasa don pedro asks what the hells the matter with you rifle barrels peak out from the brush eight nine ten of them ten more behind then don pedro sees barrera in his black suit and knows that everything is all right the arrest will be a show for the americans if he goes to jail at all he will be out in a day he slowly stands up and raises his arms orders his men to do the same guero mendez slowly sinks to the floor of the car art starts to get up he looks at don pedro standing in his car with his hands in the air quivering in the cold the old man looks so frail art thinks like a strong wind could blow him over white stubble on his unshaven face his eyes sunken with obvious fatigue just a weak old man near the end of the road it seems almost cruel to arrest him but tio nods his men open fire the bullets shake don pedro like a thin tree what are you doing art yells hes trying to his voice goes unheard under the roar of the guns guero crouches deep on the cars floor his hands over his ears because the noise is incredible the old mans blood falls like soft rain on his hands the side of his face his back even over the roar of the rifles he can hear don pedros screams like an old woman chasing a dog from the chicken coop a sound from his early childhood finally it stops guero waits for ten long moments of silence before he dares to get up when he does he sees the police emerge from the cover of the thick green brush behind him don pedros five sicarios are slumped dead blood running from the bullet holes in the side of their car like water from a downspout and beside him don pedro the patrons mouth and one eye are open the other eye is gone his body looks like one of those cheap puzzles where you try to roll the little balls into the holes except there are many many more holes and the old man is coated with shattered glass from the windshield like spun sugar coating the groom on an expensive wedding cake foolishly guero thinks of how angry don pedro would be at the damage to the mercedes the car is ruined art opens the car door and the old mans body falls out hes amazed to see that the old mans chest is still heaving with breath if we can airevac him out art thinks theres just a chance that tio walks over looks down at the body and says stop or ill shoot he draws a from his holster points it at the back of the old patrons head and pulls the trigger don pedros neck jerks off the ground then drops again tio looks at art and says he reached for his gun art doesnt answer he reached for his gun tio repeats they all did art looks around at the corpses strewn on the ground the dfs troops are picking up the dead mens weapons and firing into the air red flashes burst from the gun barrels this wasnt an arrest art thinks it was an execution the skinny blond driver crawls out of the car kneels on the bloodsoaked ground and puts his hands up hes tremblingart cant tell if its fear or cold or both youd be shaking too he tells himself if you knew you were about to be executed enough is fucking enough art starts to step between tio and the kneeling kid tio tio says levantate guero the kid shakily gets to his feet dios le bendiga patron god bless you patron boss then art gets itthis wasnt an arrest or an execution it was an assassination he looks at tio who has holstered his pistol and is now lighting one of his skinny black cigars tio looks up to see art staring at him nods his chin toward don pedros body and says you got what you wanted so did you pues tio shrugs take your trophy art walks back to his jeep and hauls out his rain poncho he comes back and carefully rolls don pedros body up in it then hefts the dead man in his arms the old man feels like he weighs practically nothing art carries him to the jeep and lays him across the backseat drives off to take the trophy back to base camp condor phoenix whats the difference hell is hell whatever you name it a nightmare wakes adan barrera a booming rhythmic bass he runs out of the hut to see giant dragonflies hovering in the sky he blinks and they turn into helicopters swooping down like vultures then he hears shouting and the sounds of trucks and horses soldiers running guns firing he grabs a campesino and orders hide me and the man takes him into a hut where adan hides under the bed until the thatched roof bursts into flames and he runs out to face the bayonets of the soldiers a disasterwhat the fuck is going on and his unclehis uncle will be furious he had told them to stay away this weekto stay in tijuana or even san diego to be anyplace but here but his brother raul had to see this badiraguato girl he was lusting after and there was going to be a party and adan had to go with him and now raul is god knows where adan thinks and i have bayonets pointed at my chest tio has basically raised the two boys since their father died when adan was four tio angel was barely a man himself then but he took on a mans responsibility bringing money to the household talking to the boys like a father seeing that they did the right thing the familys standard of living rose with tios progress in the force and by the time adan was a young teen he had a solidly middleclass lifestyle unlike the rural gomeros the barrera brothers were city kidsthey lived in culiacan went to school there to pool parties in town to beach parties in mazatlan they spent parts of the hot summers at tios hacienda in the cool mountain air of badiraguato playing with the children of the campesinos the boyhood days in badiraguato were idyllic riding bikes to mountain lakes diving from quarry rock faces into the deep emerald water of the granite quarries lazing on the broad porch of the house while a dozen tiasauntiesfussed over them and made them tortillas and albondigas and adans favoritefresh homemade flan blanketed with thick caramel adan came to love los campesinos they became a large loving family to him his mother had been distant since his fathers death his uncle all business and seriousness but the campesinos had all the warmth of the summer sun it was as his childhood priest father juan endlessly preached christ is with the poor they work so hard young adan observedin the fields in the kitchens and the laundry rooms and they have so many kids but when the adults come back from work they always seem to have time to hold the children bounce them on knees play games and jokes adan loved the summer evenings more than anything when the families were together and the women cooked and the kids ran around in mad giggling swarms and the men drank cold beer and joked and talked about the crops the weather the livestock then they all sat down and ate together at large tables under ancient oak trees and it got quiet as people first settled into the serious business of eating then as hunger faded the chatter started againthe jokes the familiar teasing the laughter after the meal as the long summer day eased into night and the air cooled adan would sit down as close as he could get to the empty chairs that would be filled when the men came back with their guitars then he sat literally at the feet of the men as they sang the tambora listened rapt as they sang of the gomeros and bandidos and revolucionarios the sinaloan heroes who made up the legends of his boyhood and after a while the men tired and talked about how the sun would be up early and the tias shooed adan and raul back to the hacienda where they slept on cots on the screenedin balcony on the sheets the tias had sprinkled with cool water and on most nights the abuelasthe old women the grandmotherswould tell them stories of the brujaswitchesstories of ghosts and spirits that took the forms of owls of hawks and eagles snakes lizards foxes and wolves stories of naive men enchanted by amor brujobewitchmentcrazed obsessive love and how the men fought battles with pumas and wolves with giants and ghosts all for the love of beautiful young women only to find out too late that their beloved was really a hideous old hag or an owl or a fox adan fell asleep to these stories and slept like the dead until the sun struck him in the eyes and the whole long wonderful summer day started again with the smell of fresh tortillas machaca chorizo and fat sweet oranges now the morning smells of ash and poison soldiers are storming through the village lighting thatched roofs on fire and smashing adobe walls with their rifle butts federale lieutenant navarres is in a very bad mood the american dea agents are unhappythey are tired of busting the little guys they want to go up the chain and theyre giving him a hard time about it implying that he knows where the big guys are and that hes deliberately leading them away theyve captured a lot of smallfry but not the big fish now they want garcia abrego chalino guzman aka el verde jaime herrera and rafael caro all of whom have so far slipped the net mostly they want don pedro el patron were not on a searchandavoid mission here are we one of the dea men in his blue baseball cap actually asked him it made navarres furious this endless yanqui slander that every mexican cop takes la mordida the bribe or as the americans say is on the arm so navarres is angry and humiliated and that makes a proud man a dangerous man then he sees adan one look at the designer jeans and nike running shoes tells the lieutenant that the short young man with his city haircut and his fancy clothes is no campesino he looks exactly like some midlevel young gomero punk from culiacan the lieutenant strides over and looks down at adan i am lieutenant navarres the officer says of the municipal judicial federal police where is don pedro aviles i dont know anything about that adan says trying to keep his voice from shaking im a college student navarres smirks what do you study business adan answers accounting an accountant navarres is saying and what do you count kilos no adan says you just happen to be here my brother and i came up for a party adan says look this is all a mistake if you will talk to my uncle he will navarres draws his pistol and backhands adan across the face the federales toss the unconscious adan and the campesino who hid him into the back of a truck and drive away this time adan wakes to darkness he realizes that its not night but that a black hood is tied over his head its hard to breathe and he starts to panic his hands are tied tightly behind his back and he can hear soundsmotors running helicopter rotors we must be at some kind of base adan thinks then he hears something worsea mans moans the solid thunks of rubber and the sharp crack of metal on flesh and bone he can smell the mans piss his shit his blood and he can smell the disgusting stink of his own fear he hears navarress smooth aristocratic voice say tell me where don pedro is navarres looks down at the peasant a sweating bleeding quivering mess curled up on the tent floor lying between the feet of two large federale troopers one holding a length of heavy rubber hose the other clutching a short iron rod the dea men are sitting outside waiting for him to produce they just want their information they dont want to know the process that produces it the americans navarres thinks do not like to see how sausages are made he nods to one of his federales adan hears the whoosh of the rubber hose and a scream stop beating him adan yells ah youve joined us navarres says to adan he stoops over and adan can smell his breath it smells like mint so you tell me where is don pedro the campesino yells dont tell them break his leg navarres says a terrible sound as the federale smashes the bar down on the campesinos shin like an ax on wood then screaming adan can hear the man moaning choking puking praying but saying nothing now i believe navarres says that he doesnt know adan feels the comandante coming close can smell the coffee and tobacco on the mans breath as the federale says but i believe you do the hood is jerked from adans head and before he can see anything its replaced with a tight blindfold then he feels his chair being tipped backward so that hes almost upside down his feet at a fortyfivedegree angle toward the ceiling where is don pedro i dont know he doesnt thats the problem adan has no idea where don pedro is although he profoundly wishes that he did and hes confronted with a harsh truthif he did know he would tell i am not as tough as the campesino he thinks not as brave not as loyal before i let them break my leg before i heard that awful sound on my bones felt that unimaginable pain i would tell them anything but he doesnt know so he says honestly i have no idea i am not a gomero hmmmm this little hum of incredulity from navarres then adan smells something gasoline they jam a rag into adans mouth adan struggles but large hands hold him down as they pour the gasoline up his nostrils he feels as if hes drowning and in fact he is he wants to cough to gag but the rag in his mouth wont let him he feels the vomit rising in his throat and wonders if hes going to suffocate in a mixture of puke and gasoline as the hands let him go and his head thrashes violently from side to side and then they pull the rag out and tip the chair back up when adan stops vomiting navarres asks him the question again where is don pedro i dont know adan gasps he feels the panic rise in his throat it makes him say a stupid thing i have cash in my pockets the chair is tilted back the rag shoved back in his mouth a flood of gas goes up his nose fills his sinuses feels like its flooding his brain he hopes it does hopes it kills him because this is unbearable just when he thinks hes going to black out they tilt the chair back up and take out the rag and he vomits on himself as navarres screams who do you think i am some traffic cop who stops you for speeding you offer me a tip im sorry adan gasps let me go i will contact you pay you what you want name the price back down again the rag the gasoline the awful horrible feeling of the fumes penetrating his sinuses his brain his lungs feeling his head thrashing his torso twisting his feet kicking uncontrollably when it finally stops navarres lifts adans chin between his thumb and forefinger you little traficante garbage navarres says you think everyone is for sale dont you well let me tell you something you little shityou cant buy me im not for sale theres no bargaining heretheres no deal you will simply give me what i want then adan hears himself say something very stupid comemierda navarres loses it screams i should eat shit i should eat shit bring him adan is yanked to his feet and dragged out of the tent to a latrine a filthy hole with an old toilet seat thrown across filled almost to the top with shit bits of toilet paper piss flies the federales lift the struggling adan and hold his head over the hole i should eat shit navarres is screaming you eat shit they lower adan until his head is completely immersed in the filth he tries to hold his breath he twists squirms struggles again tries to hold his breath but finally has to breathe in the shit they lift him out adan coughs the shit out of his mouth he gulps for air as they lower him again closes his eyes and mouth tightly vowing to die before he swallows shit again but soon hes thrashing his lungs demanding air his brain threatening to explode and he opens his mouth again and then hes drowning in filth and they lift him out and toss him on the ground now who eats shit i do hose him off the blast of water stings but adan is grateful hes on all fours gagging and vomiting but the water feels wonderful navarress pride restored hes fatherly now as he leans over adan and asks now where is don pedro adan cries i dont know navarres shakes his head get the other one he orders his men a few moments later the federales come out of the tent dragging the campesino his white pants are bloody and torn his left leg drags at an odd broken angle and a jagged piece of bone sticks through the flesh adan sees it and pukes on the spot he feels even sicker when they start to drag him toward a helicopter art pulls a kerchief tightly over his nose the smoke and ash are getting to him stinging his eyes settling in his mouth and god knows art thinks what toxic shit im sucking into my lungs he comes to a small village perched on a curve in the road the campesinos stand on the other side of the road and watch as soldiers get ready to put the torch to the thatched roofs of their casitas young soldiers nervously hold them back from trying to get their belongings out of the burning houses then art sees a lunatic a tall stout man with a full head of white hair his unshaven face rough with white stubble wearing an untucked denim shirt over blue jeans and tennis shoes holds a wooden crucifix in front of him like a bad actor in a blevel vampire movie he pushes his way through the crowd of campesinos and brushes right past the soldiers the soldiers must think hes crazy too because they stand back and let him pass art watches as the man strides across the road and gets between two torchbearing soldiers and a house in the name of your lord and savior jesus christ the man yells i forbid you to do this hes like somebodys dotty uncle art thinks whos usually kept in the house but got out in the chaos and is now wandering around with his messiah complex unleashed the two soldiers just stand there looking at the man unsure of what to do their sergeant tells them he walks over and screams at them to quit staring like two fregados and set fire to the chingada house the soldiers try to move around the crazy man but he slides over to block them quick feet for a fat man art thinks the sergeant takes his rifle and raises its butt toward the crazy man as though hes going to crack the mans skull if he doesnt move the lunatic doesnt move he just stands there invoking the name of god art sighs stops the jeep and gets out he knows he has no business interfering but he just cant let a crazy guy get his melon smashed without at least trying to stop it he walks over to the sergeant tells him that hell take care of it then grabs the lunatic by the elbow and tries to walk him away come on viejo art says jesus told me he wants to see you across the road really the man answers because jesus told me to tell you to go fuck yourself the man looks at him with amazing gray eyes art sees them and knows right away that this guy is no nut job but something altogether different sometimes you see a persons eyes and you know you just know that the bullshit hour is over these eyes have seen things and not flinched or looked away now the man looks at the dea on arts cap proud of yourself he asks im just doing my job and im just doing mine he turns back to the soldiers and once again orders them to cease and desist look art says i dont want to see you get hurt then close your eyes then the man sees the concerned look on arts face and adds dont worry they wont touch me im a priest a bishop actually a priest art thinks go fuck yourself what the hell kind of priestexcuse me bishopuses that kind of the thought is interrupted by gunfire art hears the dull poppoppop of ak fire and throws himself to the ground hugging the dirt as tightly as he can he looks up to see the priest still standing therelike a lone tree on a prairie now everyone else having hit the deckstill holding his cross up shouting at the hills telling them to stop shooting its one of the most incredibly brave things art has ever seen or foolish or just crazy shit art thinks he gets to his knees and then lunges for the priests legs knocks him over and holds him down bullets dont know youre a priest art says to him god will call me when he calls me the priest answers well god damnnear just reached for the phone art thinks he lies in the dirt next to the priest until the shooting stops then risks another look up and sees the soldiers starting to move away from the village toward the source of the gunfire would you happen to have an extra cigarette the priest asks i dont smoke puritan itll kill you art says everything i like will kill me the priest answers i smoke i drink i eat too much sexual sublimation i suppose im bishop parada you can call me father juan youre a madman father juan christ needs madmen parada says standing up and dusting himself off he looks around and smiles and the village is still here isnt it yeah art thinks because the gomeros started shooting do you have a name the priest asks art keller he offers his hand parada takes it asking why are you down here burning my country art keller like i said its your job parada says shitty job arturo he sees art react to the arturo well youre part mexican arent you parada asks ethnically on my mothers

texan no less yeehaw hook em horns a woman runs up and starts talking to parada shes crying and speaking so quickly art has a hard time understanding her he does pick up a few words though padre juan and federales and torturatorture parada turns to art theyre torturing people at a camp near here can you put a stop to it probably not art thinks its sop in condor the federales tune them up and then they sing for us father im not allowed to interfere in the internal matters of dont treat me like an idiot the priest says he has a tone of authority that makes even art keller listen lets get going he walks over and gets into arts jeep come on get your ass in gear art gets in starts the motor and rips it into gear when they get to the base camp art sees adan sitting in the back of an open chopper with his hands tied behind his back a campesino with a hideous greenstick fracture lies beside him the chopper is about to take off the rotors are spinning kicking dust and pebbles in arts face he jumps out of the jeep ducks below the rotors and runs up to the pilot phil hansen phil what the hell art shouts phil grins at him two birds art recognizes the reference you take two birds up one flies the other sings no art says he jabs a thumb toward adan that guy is mine fuck you keller yeah fuck me art thinks he looks in the back of the chopper where parada is already tending to the campesino with the broken leg the priest turns to art with a look that is both question and demand art shakes his head then pulls his cocks it and sticks it in hansens face youre not taking off phil art can hear federales lift their rifles and chamber rounds dea guys come running out of the mess tent taylor yells keller what the hell you think youre doing this what we do now tim art asks we toss people out of choppers youre no virgin keller taylor says youve jumped into the backseat lots of times i cant say anything to that art thinks its the truth youre done now keller taylor says youre

your country its my country parada yells and ill excommunicate your ass so fast such language father navarres says youll hear worse in a minute we are trying to find don pedro aviles navarres explains to art he points to adan this little piece of shit knows where he is and hes going to tell us you want don pedro art asks he walks back to his jeep and unrolls the poncho don pedros body spills onto the ground raising little puffs of dust you got him taylor looks down at the bulletriddled corpse what happened we tried to arrest him and five of his men art says they resisted theyre all dead all of them taylor says staring at art yeah no wounded no taylor smirks but hes pissed and art knows it art has just brought in the big trophy and now theres nothing taylor can do to him nothing at fucking all still its time to make a peace offering art nods his chin toward adan and the injured campesino and says softly i guess we both have things to keep quiet about tim yeah art climbs into the back of the helicopter and starts to untie adan im sorry about this not as sorry as i am adan says he turns to parada hows his leg father juan you know each other art asks i christened him parada says gave him his first communion and this man will be fine but he gives adan and art a look that says something different art yells to the front you can take off now phil culiacan hospital and step on it the chopper lifts off arturo parada says yeah the priest is smiling at him congratulations parada says youre a madman art looks down at the ruined fields the burned villages the refugees already forming a line on the dirt road out the landscape is scorched and charred as far as he can see fields of black flowers yeah art thinks im a madman ninety minutes later adan lies between the clean white sheets of culiacans best hospital the wound on his face from navarress pistol barrel has been cleaned and treated and hes been shot up with antibiotics but hes refused the proffered painkillers adan wants to feel the pain he gets out of bed and walks the corridors until he finds the room where at his insistence they have taken manuel sanchez the campesino opens his eyes and sees adan my leg its still there dont let them i wont adan says get some sleep adan seeks out the doctor can you save the leg i think so the doctor says but it will be expensive do you know who i am i know who you are adan doesnt miss the slight look or the slighter inflection i know who your uncle is save his leg adan says and you will be chief of a new wing of this hospital lose the leg youll spend the rest of your life doing abortions in a tijuana brothel lose the patient you will be in a grave before he is and it wont be my uncle who will put you there it will be me do you understand the doctor understands and adan understands that life has changed childhood is over life is serious now tio slowly inhales a cuban cigar and watches the smoke ring float across the room operation condor could not have gone any better with the sinaloan fields burned the ground poisoned the gomeros scattered and aviles in the dirt the americans believe they have destroyed the source of all evil and will go back to sleep as far as mexico is concerned their complacency will give me the time and freedom to create an organization that by the time the americans wake up they will be powerless to touch a federacion theres a soft knock on the door a blackclad dfs agent uzi slung over his shoulder enters someone here to see you don miguel he says hes your nephew let him in adan stands in the doorway miguel angel barrera already knows all about what happened to his nephewthe beating the torture his threat to the doctor his visit to paradas clinic in one day the boy has become a man and the man gets right to the point you knew about the raid adan says in fact i helped to plan it indeed the targets had been carefully chosen to eliminate enemies rivals and the old dinosaurs who would be incapable of understanding the new world they wouldnt have survived anyway and would only have been in the way now theyre not it was an atrocity adan says it was necessary tio says it was going to happen anyway so we might as well take advantage thats business adan well adan says and now tio thinks we will see what kind of man the boy has become he waits for adan to continue well adan says i want in the business tio barrera rises at the head of the table the restaurant has been closed for the nightprivate party ill say it is adan thinks the place is surrounded by dfs men armed with uzis all the guests have been patted down and relieved of firearms the guest list would be a veritable wish list for the yanquis every major gomero whom tio selected to survive operation condor is here adan sits beside raul and scans the faces at the table garcia abrego at fifty years old an ancient man in this trade silver hair and a silver mustache he looks like a wise old cat which he is he sits and watches barrera impassively and adan cant read his reaction from his face which tio has told adan is how he got to be fifty years old in this trade take a lesson from him sitting next to abrego is the man adan knows as el verde the green so called because of the green ostrichskin boots he always wears besides that conceit chalino guzman looks like a farmerdenim shirt and jeans straw hat sitting next to guzman is guero mendez even in this urbane restaurant guero is wearing his sinaloa cowboy outfit black shirt with motherofpearl snap buttons tight black jeans with huge silver and turquoise belt buckle pointedtoe boots and a large white cowboy hat even inside and guero cannot shut up about his miraculous survival of the federale ambush that killed his boss don pedro santo jesus malverde shielded me from the bullets guero was saying i tell you brothers i walked through the rain for hours afterward i didnt know i was alive i thought i was a ghost on and on and fucking on about how he emptied his pistola at the federales then jumped from the car and ranbetween the bullets brothersinto the brush from where he made his escape and how he worked his way back to the city thinking every moment was my last brothers adan lets his eyes move over the rest of the guests jaime herrera rafael caro chapo montana all sinaloa gomeros all wanted men now all on the run lost and windblown ships that tio has brought into safe harbor tio has called this meeting and in the very act of calling it has established his superiority hes made them all sit down together over huge buckets of chilled shrimp platters of thinly sliced carne and cases of the icecold beer that real sinaloans prefer over wine in the next room young sinaloan musicians are warming up to sing bandassongs praising the exploits of famous traficantes many of them sitting at the table in a private room farther in the back are gathered a dozen highpriced call girls who have been called in from haley saxons exclusive brothel in san diego the blood that has been spilled has dried tio says now is the time to put away all grudges to wash the bitter taste of venganza from our mouths these things are gone like the water of yesterdays river he takes a swallow of beer into his mouth swills it around then spits it on the floor he pauses to see if anyone objects no one does he says gone also is the life we led gone in poison and flame our old lives are like the fragile dreams we dream in the waking hours floating away from us like a wisp of smoke in the wind we might like to call the dream back to go on sweetly sleeping but that is not life that is a dream the americans wanted to scatter us sinaloans burn us off our land and scatter us to the winds but the fire that consumes also makes way for new growth the wind that destroys also spreads the seeds to new ground i say if they want us to scatter so be it good we will scatter like the seeds of the manzanita which grow in any soil grow and spread i say we spread out like the fingers of a single hand i say if they will not let us have our sinaloa we take the whole country there are three critical territories from which to conduct la pista secreta sonora bordering texas and arizona the gulf just across from texas louisiana and florida and baja next door to san diego los angeles and the west coast i ask abrego to take the gulf as his plaza to have as his markets houston new orleans tampa and miami i ask el verde don chalino to take the sonoran plaza to base himself in juarez to have new mexico arizona and the rest of texas for his market adan tries without success to read their reactions the gulf plaza is potentially rich but fraught with difficulties as american law enforcement finishes with mexico and concentrates on the eastern caribbean but abrego should make millionsno billionsif he can find a source for the product to sell he glances at el verde whose campesino face is impenetrable the sonoran plaza should be lucrative el verde should be able to move tons of drugs into phoenix el paso and dallas not to mention the route going north from those cities to chicago minneapolis and especially detroit but everyone is waiting for the other shoe to fall and adan watches their eyes as they realize that tio has saved the plum for himself baja tijuana provides access to the enormous markets of san diego los angeles san francisco san jose and to the transportation systems able to move product to the even richer markets of the northeast united states philadelphia boston and the gem of gemsnew york city so there is a gulf plaza and a sonora plaza but baja is the plaza la plaza so no ones real thrilled and no one is real surprised when barrera says myself i propose to move to guadalajara now theyre surprised none more so than adan who cant believe that tio is giving up the most potentially lucrative piece of real estate in the western world if the plaza isnt going to the family then who i ask barrera says guero mendez to take the baja plaza adan watches gueros face break into a grin then he gets it has an epiphany that explains the miracle of gueros survival in the ambush that killed don pedro knows now that the plaza is not a surprise gift but a promise fulfilled but why adan wonders what is tio up to and where is my place he knows better than to open his mouth and ask tio will tell him in private when hes ready garcia abrego leans forward and smiles his mouth is small under his white mustache like a cats mouth adan thinks abrego says barrera divides the world into three pieces then takes a fourth for himself i cannot help but wonder why abrego what crops grow in guadalajara barrera asks what border does jalisco sit on none it is a place to be thats all a safe place from which to serve our federacion its the first time hes put a word to it adan thinks the federation with himself as its head not by title but by positioning if you accept this arrangement barrera says i will share what is mine my friends will be your friends my protection your protection how much will we pay for this protection abrego asks a modest fee barrera says protection is expensive how expensive fifteen percent barrera abrego says you divide the country into plazas all very well and good abrego will accept the gulf but you have forgotten somethingin slicing up the fruit you slice up nothing there is nothing left our fields are burned and poisoned our mountains are overrun with policia and yanquis so you give us marketsthere is no opium for us to sell in these new markets of ours forget opium barrera says and the yerba guero begins forget the marijuana too barrera says its small stuff abrego holds his arms out and says so miguel angel el angel negro you tell us to forget la mapola and la yerba what would you have us grow stop thinking like a farmer i am a farmer we have a twothousandmile land border with the united states barrera says another thousand miles by sea thats the only crop we need what are you talking about abrego snaps will you join the federacion sure yes abrego says i accept this federation of nothing what choice do i have none adan thinks tio owns the jalisco state police and is partners with the dfs hes staged an overnight revolution through operation condor and come out on top butand abrego is also right about thison top of what el verde barrera asks si mendez si don miguel then hermanos barrera says let me show you the future they repair to a heavily guarded room in the hotel that barrera owns next door ramon mette ballasteros is waiting for them mette is a honduran adan knows usually connected with the colombians in medellin and the colombians do little if any business through mexico adan watches him dissolve powder cocaine into a beaker containing a mixture of water and bicarbonate of soda he watches as mette fixes the beaker over a burner and turns the flame up high its cocaine abrego says so what watch barrera says adan watches as the solution starts to boil and listens as the coke makes a funny crackling sound then the powder starts to come together into a solid mette carefully removes it and sets it out to dry when it does it forms a ball that looks like a small rock barrera says gentlemen meet the future art stands in front of santo jesus malverde i made you a manda art says you kept your part of the deal ill keep mine he leaves the shrine and takes a taxi to the edge of the city already the shantytown is going up the refugees from badiraguato are turning cardboard boxes packing crates and blankets into the makings of new homes the lucky and the early have found sheets of corrugated tin art even sees an old movie billboardtrue gritbeing raised as a roof a sunfaded john wayne looks down at the group of families building walls from old sheets odd bits of plywood broken cinder blocks parada has found some old tentsart wonders did he browbeat the armyand has set up a soup kitchen and a makeshift clinic some boards laid on sawhorses make a serving table a tank of propane feeds a flame that heats a thin sheet of tin on which a priest and some nuns are heating soup some women are making tortillas on a grill set over an open fire a few feet away art goes into a tent where nurses are washing children swabbing their arms in preparation for the tetanus shots the doctor is administering for small cuts and wounds from another part of the big tent art hears kids screaming he moves closer and sees parada cooing softly to a little girl with burns on her arms the girls eyes are wide with fear and pain the richest opium soil in the western world says parada and we have nothing to ease a childs pain id change places with her if i could art says parada studies him for a long moment i believe you its a pity that you cant he kisses the girls cheek jesus loves you a little girl in pain parada thinks and thats all i have to say to her there are worse injuries as well we have men beaten so badly the doctors have had to amputate arms legs all because the americans cant control their own appetite for drugs they come to burn the poppies and they burn children let me tell you jesus we could use you in person right now art follows him through the tent jesus loves you parada mutters nights like this make me wonder if thats just crap what brings you here guilt something like that art takes money from his pocket and offers it to parada its his last months salary it will buy medicine art says god bless you i dont believe in god art says doesnt matter parada says he believes in you then he art thinks is a sucker chapter two wild irish where eer we go we celebrate the land that makes us refugees from fear of priests with empty plates from guilt and weeping effigies shane macgowanthousands are sailing hells kitchen new york city callan grows up on bloody fables cuchulain edward fitzgerald wolfe tone roddy mccorley padraic pearse james connelly sean south sean barry john kennedy bobby kennedy bloody sunday jesus christ the rich red stew of irish nationalism and catholicism or irish catholic nationalism or irish national catholicism doesnt matter the walls of the small west side walkup and the walls of st bridgets elementary are decorated if thats the word with bad pictures of martyrdom mccorley dangling from the bridge of toome connelly tied to his chair facing the british firing party saint timothy with all them arrows sticking out of him poor hopeless wolfe tone slicing his own neck with a razor but fucking it up and severing his windpipe instead of his jugularanyway he manages to die before they manage to hang him poor john and poor bobby looking down from heaven christ on the cross of course there are the twelve stations of the cross in st bridgets itself christ being whipped the crown of thorns christ staggering through the streets ofjerusalem with the cross on his back the nails going in his blessed hands and feet a very young callan asks the sister if christ was irish and she sighs and tells him no but he might as well have been hes seventeen years old and hes slamming beers in the liffey pub on fortyseventh and twelfth with his buddy obop only other guy in the bar besides billy shields the bartender is little mickey haggerty little mickeys sitting at the far end of the bar doing some serious drinking behind an upcoming date with a judge whos a lock to put him eighttotwelve from his next bushmills little mickey came in with a roll of quarters all of which he fed into the jukebox while pressing the same button e so andy williams has been crooning moonriver for the past hour but the boys dont say nothing because they know all about little mickeys hijacking beef its one of those killernew york august afternoonsone of those its not the heat its the humidity afternoonswhen shirts stick to backs and grudges just plain stick which is what obops talking about to callan theyre sitting at the bar drinking beers and obop just cant let it go what they did to michael murphy what they did to michael murphy was wrong obop says it was a wrong thing it was callan agrees what happened with michael murphy is that hed shot and killed his best friend kenny maher it was one of them things they was both stoned at the time flat ripped on mexican mud the brownopium heroin that was making the rounds of the neighborhood at the time and it was just one of them things a quarrel between two junkies that gets out of hand and kenny whacks michael around a little and michael stays pissed off and he goes out and gets a little caliber target pistol and follows kenny home and puts one in his head then he sits down in the middle of fuckingfortyninth street sobbing because he killed his best friend its obop that comes along and gets him out of there before the cops come and hells kitchen being what it is the cops never find out who canceled kennys reservation except the cops are the only people in the neighborhood who dont know who killed kenny maher everyone else gets the word including eddie friel which is bad news for murphy eddie the butcher friel collects money for big matt sheehan big matt runs the neighborhood he runs the west side longshoremans union he runs the local teamsters he runs the gambling the loansharking the whores you name itexcept matt sheehan wont let any drugs in the neighborhood thats a point of pride with sheehan and a reason hes so popular with the kitchens older residents say what you will about matt theyll say hes kept our kids off of dope except for michael murphy and kenny maher and a few dozen others but that dont seem to make no difference to matt sheehans rep and a big part of matts rep is due to eddie the butcher because the whole neighborhood is scared to death of him when eddie the butcher comes to collect you pay preferably you pay in money but if not you pay in blood and broken bones and then you still owe the money at any given point in time roughly half of hells kitchen owes money to big matt sheehan which is another reason they all got to pretend to like him but obop he hears eddie talking about how someone should take care of that fucking junkie murphy and he goes to murphy and tells him he should go away for a while so does callan callan tells him this because not only does eddie have a reputation for backing up his bad words but mattys put the word out that junkies killing each other is bad for the neighborhood and bad for his reputation so obop and callan tell murphy he should split but murphy says fuck it hes staying where he is and they guess hes suicidal over having killed kenny but a few weeks later they suddenly dont see him around anymore so they figure he got smart and took off and this is what they figure until one morning eddie the butcher shows up in the shamrock cafe with a big grin and a milk carton hes like showing it around and he comes over to where callan and obop are trying to have a quiet cup of coffee to work on a hangover and he tilts the carton down so obop can see and he says hey look in here obop looks in the carton and then he throws up right on the table which eddie thinks is hysterical and he calls obop a pussy and walks away laughing and the talk in the neighborhood for the next few weeks is how eddie and his asshole buddy larry moretti go to michaels apartment drag him into the shower and stab him about a hundred and fortyseven times and then cut him up the story is that eddie the butcher goes to work on michael murphys body and cuts him up like hes a piece of pork and takes the different pieces out in garbage bags and scatters them around the city except for michaels cock which he puts in the milk carton to show around the neighborhood lest there be any doubt about what happens to you when you fuck with one of eddies buddies and no one can do anything about it because eddie is so connected with matt sheehan and sheehan has an arrangement with the cimino family so hes like untouchable except six months later obops still brooding about it saying its wrong what they did to murphy okay maybe they had to kill him obop is saying maybe but to do him that way then do what they did showing that part of him around no that is wrong that is so wrong the bartender billy shields is wiping the barwhich is like the first time maybe everand hes getting real nervous listening to this kid badmouth eddie the butcher hes wiping the bar like hes going to perform surgery on it later obop sees the bartender eyeing him but it doesnt slow him down obop and callan have been at it all day walking along the hudson toking on a joint and drinking beer from brown paper bags so while theyre not exactly wasted theyre not exactly all there either so obop keeps it up actually it was kenny maher that gave him the name obop theyre all in the park playing street hockey and theyre taking a break when stevie oleary as he was still known back then comes walking up and kenny maher he looks at stevie and he says we should call you bop stevies not displeased hes what fifteen and getting tagged by a couple of older guys is cool so he smiles and says bop why bop because of the way you walk kenny says you bounce on every step you sort of bop bop callan says i like that who cares what you like kenny says then murphy busts in what the fuck kind of a name is bop for an irishman fuckin look at him with that red hair hes standing on the corner cars stop look at the fuckin white skin and the freckles for christs sake how can you call him bop sounds like a black guy this is the whitest guy i ever seen in my life kenny thinks about this has to be irish huh fuck yes okay kenny says how about obop except he says it with the stress on the o so it becomes obop and it sticks anyway obop keeps it up about eddie the butcher i mean fuck that guy he says so hes hooked up with matty sheehan he can do anything he wants who the fuck is matty sheehan some lacecurtain old drunk harp still crying in his beer about jack kennedy i gotta respect this guy fuck him fuck the both of them steady callan says steady my ass obop says what they did to michael murphy was wrong he hunches over the bar and goes back to drinking his beer turns sullen like the afternoon its maybe ten minutes later when eddie friel walks in eddie friel is a big fucking guy he walks in and sees obop and says real loud hey pubic hair obop doesnt sit up or turn around hey eddie yells im talking to you that is pubic hair on your head isnt it all curly and red callan watches obop turn around what do you want hes trying to sound tough but callan can hear hes scared why not so is callan i hear you have a problem with me friel says no i got no problem obop says which callan thinks is the smart thing to say except friel isnt satisfied because if you got a problem with me im standing right here no i dont got a problem thats not what i heard friel says i heard you was going around the neighborhood running your mouth about you have a problem with something i may have did no if it wasnt one of them murderous new york august afternoons it would probably end right there shit if the liffey was airconditioned it would probably end right there but it aint its just got a couple of ceiling fans giving a bunch of dust and dead flies a lazy merrygoround ride so anyway it doesnt end right there where it should because obop has totally backed down his balls are like lying on the floor and theres no need to push this any further except that eddie is a sadistic prick so he says you lying little cocksucker down at the end of the bar mickey haggerty finally glances up from his bushmills and says eddie the boy told you he dont have no problem anyone ask you mickey friel says mickey says hes just a boy for christs sake then he shouldnt be running his mouth like a man friel says he shouldnt be going around talking about how certain people got no right to be running the neighborhood im sorry obop whines his voice is shaking yeah youre sorry friel says youre a sorry little motherfucker look at him hes crying like a little girl and this is the big man who thinks certain other people got no right to run the neighborhood look i said i was sorry obop whines yeah i hear what you say to my face friel says but what are you going to say behind my back huh nothing nothing friel pulls a from under his shirt get down on your knees what what friel mimics get down on your fucking knees you little cocksucker obop is pale anyway but now callan sees he is like white he looks dead already and maybe he is because it looks for all the world like friels going to execute him right here obop is shaking as he lowers himself off the stool he has to lower his hands to the floor first so he doesnt just topple over as he gets to his knees and hes cryingbig tears spilling out of his eyes and streaming down his face eddies got this shiteating grin on his face come on callan says to friel friel turns on him you want part of this kid eddie asks you need to decide who youre with us or him staring callan down him callan says as he pulls a from under his shirt and shoots eddie the butcher twice in the forehead eddie looks like he cant fucking believe what just happened he just looks at callan like what the fuck and then folds up hes lying on his back on the dirty floor when obop takes the from his hand sticks it in eddies mouth and starts jerking on the trigger obops crying and shrieking obscenities billy shields has his hands up i got no problem he says little mickey looks up from his bushmills and tells callan you might want to think about leaving callan asks should i leave the gun no mickey says give it to the hudson mickey knows the hudson river between thirtyeighth and fiftyseventh streets has more hardware at the bottom than say pearl harbor and the cops aint exactly going to drag the bottom to find the weapon that rained on eddie the butcher the reaction at manhattan south is going to go something like someone blanked eddie friel oh anyone want this last chocolate glazed no these kids problem is not the law these kids problem is matt sheehan not that its going to be mickey that goes running to big matt to tell him who popped eddie matt could have reached out one hamfisted hand to the judge and lifted some of the weight off mickey on this hijacking beef but he couldnt be bothered so mickey doesnt figure he owes any loyalty to sheehan but billy shields the bartender will trip all over himself to get a marker with big matt so these two kids might as well go hang themselves up on meat hooks and save matt the aggravation unless they can take out big matt first which they cant so these kids are pretty much dead but they shouldnt ought to stand around and wait for it go now mickey says to them get out of town callan tucks the back under his shirt and gets an arm under obops elbow and lifts him up from where hes crouching over eddie the butchers body come on he says hold on a second obop digs into friels pockets and comes out with a wad of crumpled bills rolls him on his side and takes something out of his back pocket a black notebook okay obop says they walk out the door cops come in around ten minutes later the homicide guy he steps over the pool of blood forming a big wet red halo around friels head then he looks at mickey haggerty homicide guy is just up from safes and lofts so he knows mickey looks at mickey and shrugs like what happened slipped in the shower mickey says they never get out of town what happens is they walk out of the liffey pub and follow mickey haggertys suggestion and walk right over to the river and toss in the guns then they stand out there and count eddies roll three hundred and eightyseven bucks obop says which is disappointing they aint gonna get very far on three hundred and eightyseven bucks and anyway they dont know where to go theyre neighborhood guys they never been anywhere else they wouldnt know what to do what not to do how to act how to function they oughta get on a bus to somewhere but where they go into a corner store and buy a couple quart bottles of beer and then get under an abutment under the west side highway to think it over jersey obop says this is about the limit of his geographical imagination you know anyone in jersey callan asks no do you no where they know people is in hells kitchen so they end up slamming a couple more beers and waiting until its dark and then they slip back into the neighborhood break into an abandoned warehouse and sleep there early in the morning they go to bobby remingtons sisters apartment on fiftieth street bobbys there having had another fight with his old man he comes to the door sees callan and obop standing there and pulls them inside jesus christ bobby says whatd you guys do he was going to shoot stevie callan explains bobby shakes his head he wasnt going to shoot him he was going to piss in his mouth is all thats the word out callan shrugs anyway are they looking for us obop asks bobby doesnt answer hes too busy pulling down blinds bobby do you have any coffee callan asks yeah ill make some beth remington comes out of her bedroom shes wearing a rangers jersey that comes down over her thighs her red hair is all tangled and droops down around her shoulders she looks at callan and says shit hi beth you gotta get outta here im just going to get em some coffee beth hey bobby beth says she flicks a cigarette out of a pack on the kitchen counter slips it into her mouth and lights it bad enough i got you crashing on my couch i dont need these guys no offense obop says bobby we need some hardware oh great beth says she flops down on the couch next to callan why the fuck did you come here nowhere else to go im honored she gets drunk a couple times and does the dirty with him and now he thinks he can come over here now hes in trouble bobby make them toast or something thank you says callan youre not staying here so bobby obop says can you hook us up they find out im fucked you could go to burke tell him its for you obop says what are you guys still doing in the neighborhood beth asks you should be in like buffalo by now buffalo obop says smiling whats in buffalo beth shrugs niagara falls i dunno they drink their coffee and eat their toast ill go see burke bobby says yeah thats what you need beth says to get sideways with matty sheehan fuck sheehan bobby says yeah go tell him that says beth she turns to callan you dont need guns what you need is bus tickets i got some money beth is a cashier at loews fortysecond street occasionally she sells one of the theaters tickets along with her own so she has a little cash tucked away we have money callan says then go they go they go all the way up to the upper west side hang around in riverside park up by grants tomb then they come back downtown beth lets them into loews and they sit in the back of the balcony all day watching star wars fucking death stars about to blow for like the sixth time when bobby shows up with a paper bag and leaves it by callans feet good movie huh he says and takes off as fast as he came in callan eases his ankle over to the bag and feels the metal they go into the mens room and open the bag an old and an equally ancient police special what obop says he didnt have flintlocks beggars cant be choosers callan feels a lot better with a little hardware at his waist funny how quick you miss not having it there you just feel light he thinks like you might float up off the ground the metal keeps you on the earth they sit in the theater until just before it closes then carefully work their way back to the warehouse a polish sausage saves their lives tim healey hes been sitting up there half the fucking night and hes hungrier than shit waiting for these two kids so he gets jimmy boylan to go out for a polish sausage what you want on it boylan asks sauerkraut hot mustard the works tim says so boylan goes out and comes back and tim wolfs down that polish sausage like hes spent the war in a japanese prison camp and that solid sausage is converting itself to gas in his intestines just when callan and obop are coming in theyre in a stairwell on the other side of a closed metal door when they hear healey cut loose they freeze jesus christ they hear boylan say anybody hurt callan looks at obop bobby gave us up obop whispers callan shrugs im gonna open the door get some air boylan says christ tim sorry boylan opens the door and sees the boys standing there he yells shit as he raises his shotgun but all callan can hear is the explosion of guns echoing in the stairwell as he and obop let loose the tinfoil slides off healeys lap as he gets up from the wooden folding chair and goes for his gun but he sees jimmy boylan staggering backwards as chunks of him are flying out the back of him and loses his nerve drops his to the ground and throws his hands up do him obop yells no no no no no healey yells theyve known fat tim healey all their lives he used to give them quarters to buy comic books one time theyre playing hockey in the street and callans backswing breaks tim healeys right headlight and healey comes out of the liffey and just laughs and says its okay youll get me tickets when youre playing for the rangers okay is all tim healey says now callan stops obop from shooting healey just get his gun he hollers hes yelling because his ears are ringing his voice sounds like its at the other end of a tunnel and his head hurts like a bastard healeys got mustard on his chin hes saying something about being too old for this shit like theres a right age for this shit callan thinks they take healeys and boylans gauge and hit the street running big matty freaks when he hears about eddie the butcher especially when he gets the word that it was two kids practically with shit in their diapers hes wondering what the world is coming towhat kind of world its going to bewhen you have a generation coming up that has no respect for authority what also concerns big matty is how many people approach him to plead mercy for the two kids they have to be punished big matt tells them but hes disturbed when they question his decision punished sure they tell him maybe break their legs or their wrists send them out of the neighborhood but they dont deserve to get killed for this big matt aint used to being challenged like this he dont like it all he also dont like that the pipeline dont seem to be working he should have had his hands on these two young animals within hours but theyve been down for days now and the rumors going around that theyre still in the neighborhoodwhich is shoving it in his facebut no one seems to know exactly where even people who should know dont know big matt even considers this idea of punishment decides that maybe the just thing to do is just to take the hands that pulled the triggers the more he considers it the more he likes the idea leave these two kids walking around hells kitchen with a couple of stumps as reminder of what happens when you dont show the proper respect for authority so hell have their hands cut off and leave it at that show them that big matt sheehan can be magnanimous then he remembers he dont have eddie the butcher anymore to do the cutting a day later he also dont have jimmy boylan or fat tim healey because boylan is dead and healey has just disappeared and kevin kelly has found it convenient to take care of some business in albany marty stone has a sick aunt in far rockaway and tommy dugan is on a bender all of which leads big matt to suspect that theres maybe a coupa downright revolutionin the works so he makes a reservation to fly down to his other home in florida which would be very good news for callan and obop except that it looks like before matty got on the plane he reached out to big paulie calabrese the new representantethe bossof the cimino family and called in a marker what do you think he gave him callan asks obop piece of the javits center obop says big matt controls the construction unions and the teamsters unions working on the huge convention center being planned on the west side the italians have been slavering after a piece of that business for a year or more the skim off the cement contract alone is worth millions now matts in no real position to say no but he could reasonably expect a little favor for saying yes professional courtesy callan and obop are holed up in a secondfloor apartment on fortyninth between tenth and eleventh they dont get a lot of sleep lie there looking at the sky or what you can see of it from a rooftop in new york weve killed two guys obop says yeah selfdefense though obop says i mean we had to right sure a while later obop says i wonder if mickey haggertys gonna trade us in you think hes looking at eighttotwelve on a robbery obop says he could trade up no callan says mickey is oldschool mickey could be oldschool obop says but he also could be tired of doing time this is his second bit callan knows that mickey will do his time and come back to the neighborhood and want to hold his head up and mickey knows he wont be able to get as much as a bowl of peanuts in any bar in the kitchen if he rolls over to the cops mickey haggertys the least of their worries which is what callans thinking as he looks out the window at the lincoln continental parked across the street so we might as well get it over with he says to obop obops got his head of kinky red hair under the kitchen tap trying to get cool yeah thats gonna workits a hundred and four out and theyre in a tworoom apartment on the fifth floor with a fan the size of a propeller on a toy boat and the water pressure is zero because the little neighborhood bastards have opened up every fire hydrant on the street and if all that wasnt bad enough theres a crew from the cimino family out there looking to whack them and will whack them soon as its late enough for darkness to provide a curtain of decency what do you wanna do obop asks you want to go out there blasting gunfight at the ok corral it would be better than baking to death up here no it wouldnt obop says up here sucks to be sure but down there wed be gunned down in the street like dogs we have to go down sometime callan says no we dont obop says he takes his head out from under the tap and shakes the water off as long as they still deliver pizza we never have to go down he comes over to the window and looks at the long black lincoln parked across the street fucking italians never change obop says you think theyd maybe mix in a mercedes a bmw i dunno a fuckin volvo or something anything but these fucking lincolns and caddies im tellin ya it must be some kind of goombah rule or something whos in the car stevie there are four guys in the car three more guys standing around outside real casual like smoking cigs drinking coffee shooting the shit like a mob announcement to the neighborhoodwere going to whack somebody here so you might want to be someplace else obop refocuses piccones subcrew of johnny boy cozzos crew obop says demonte wing of the cimino family how do you know the guy in the passenger seat is eating a can of peaches obop says so its jimmy picconejimmy peaches hes got this thing for canned peaches obop is the pauls peerage of mobdom he follows them like some guys follow baseball teams he has the whole five families organizational chart in his head so obop is hipped to the fact that since carlo cimino died last year the familys been in a state of flux most of the hardcore guys were sure cimino would pick neill demonte to be his successor but he went for his brotherinlaw paulie calabrese instead it was an unpopular choice especially among the old guard who think that calabrese is too whitecollar too soft too focused on turning the money into legitimate businesses the hard guysthe loan sharks extortion artists and flatout plain robbersdont like it jimmy big peaches piccone is one of these guys in fact hes sitting in the lincoln holding forth on it were the cimino crime family peaches is saying to his brother little peaches joey little peaches piccone is actually bigger than his older brother big peaches but no one is going to say that so the nicknames stick even the fuckin new york times calls us the cimino crime family we do crime if i wanted to be a businessman i wouldve joinedwhatibm peaches also doesnt like that demonte was overlooked as boss hes an old man whats the harm of letting him have his few years in the sun hes earned it what the old man should have done is he should have made mister neill boss and johnny boy the underboss then we would have had our thing our cosa nostra for a young guypeaches is twentysixhes a throwback a conservative a mafioso william f buckley without the tie he likes the old ways the old traditions in the old days peaches says like he was even around in the old days we would have just taken a piece of the javits center we wouldnt have to suck ass to some old harp like matty sheehan not like paulies gonna give us a taste anyway he dont care if we fuckin starve hey little peaches says hey what hey paulie gives this job to mister neill who gives it to johnny boy who gives it to us little peaches says all i need to know johnny boy gives us a job we do the job were gonna do the fuckin job peaches says he dont need his little brother giving him lectures about how it works peaches knows how it works likes how it works especially in the demonte wing of the family where it works like it did in the old days another thing peaches fucking worships johnny boy johnny boy is everything the mafia used to be what it oughta be again peaches thinks soon as it gets really dark peaches says well go up there and punch their tickets callans sitting there flipping through the black notebook your dads in here he says theres a surprise obop says sarcastically for how much two large probably bet on the budweiser clydesdales to show at aqueduct obop says hey here comes the pizza hey what the fuck is this theyre taking our pizza obop is genuinely pissed hes not especially angry that these guys are here to kill himthats to be expected thats just businessbut he takes the pizza hijacking as a personal affront they dont got to do that he wails thats just wrong which callan recalls is how this whole thing started in the first place he glances up from the black book to see this fat guinea with a big grin on his face holding a slice of pizza up at him hey obop yells its good peaches yells back theyve got our pizza obop says to callan its no big deal callan says obop whines im hungry then go down and take it from them callan says i might take a shotgun fuck callan can hear the guys out in the street laughing at them he doesnt care it doesnt get to him the way it gets to obop obop hates to be laughed at its always been an instant fight with him callan he can just walk away stevie what what did you say was the name of that guy down there which guy guy they sent to whack us jimmy peaches hes in here say what obop comes away from the window for how much a hundred thousand they look at each other and start to laugh callan obop says we got us a whole new ball game here because peaches piccone owes matty sheehan and thats just the principalthe vigorish has to be piling up faster than stink in a garbage strike so piccone is in serious trouble here hes in to matt sheehan deep which would be bad newsall the more motivation for him to do sheehan a solidexcept that callan and obop have the book which gives them an angle if they can live long enough to play it because its getting dark fast you got any ideas obop asks yes i do its one of them desperate fourthandlong plays but shit its fourth and long obop walks out onto the fire escape with a milk bottle in his hand yells hey you guinea bastards the boys look up from the continental just as obop lights the rag stuck in the bottle yells eat this and launches it in a long lazy arc at the lincoln what the fuck this is from peaches who presses the button to roll the window down and sees this freaking torch coming out of the sky straight at him so he scrambles to get the door open and get his ass out of the backseat of the lincoln and he does it just in time because obops aim is perfect and the bottle crashes onto the top of the car and flames spread across the roof peaches yells up at the fire escape thats a new fucking car and hes really pissed because he dont even have a chance to shoot at nobody because a crowd gathers and then theres sirens and all that shit and its just a couple of minutes before the whole block is full of irish cops and irish firemen who start hosing down whats left of the lincoln irish cops and irish firemen and about fifteen thousand fucking drag queens from ninth avenue and theyre standing around peaches screaming and screeching and dancing and shit he sends little peaches down to the phone on the corner to make a call and get a new fucking vehicle and then he feels metal pressed against his left fucking kidney and someone whispers mr piccone turn around very slowly please respectful like though which peaches appreciates he turns around and heres this irish kidnot the red brillopad asshole with the bottle but a tall dark kidstanding there with a pistol in a brown paper bag and holding something up in his other hand the fuck is it peaches wonders then he gets it matty sheehans little black book we should talk the kid says we should says peaches so theyre in the basement of paddy hoyles ptomaine palace way the fuck over on twelfth and you could call it a mexican standoff except there aint no mexicans involved what you got is you got this italoirish gettogether and what it looks like is callan and obop are standing at one end with their backs literally to the wall and callan he looks like some freaking desperado with a pistol in each hand and obop hes holding the shotgun leveled at his waist and by the door you got the two piccone brothers the italians they dont got their guns pulled theyre just standing there in their nice clothes looking very cool and very tough obop he respects this he totally gets it like theyve already been embarrassed once tonightnever mind losing a lincolntheyre not going to embarrass themselves further by looking like theyre even concerned with two punks openly holding an arsenal on them its mob chic and obop gets it in fact he likes it callan could give a rats ass if this thing starts to go wrong hes going to start pulling triggers and just see what happens how old are you guys anyway peaches asks twenty obop lies twentyone callan says youre two tough little humps ill tell you that peaches says anyway we gotta deal with this eddie friel thing here it comes callan thinks hes one slowmusclefiber twitch away from touching it all off i hated that sick twist says peaches pissing in guys mouths whats that about how many times did you fucking shoot him anyway like eight you guys wanted to get the job done didnt you he laughs little peaches laughs with him so does obop not callan hes just ready is all sorry about your car obop says yeah peaches says next time you want to talk use the fucking phone all right everyone except callan laughs its what i try to tell johnny boy says peaches i tell him you got me over here on the west side with the zulus and the prs and the wild irish what the fuck am i supposed to do im going to tell him theyre fucking flinging fire from the sky now i gotta get a new car wild fucking irish you look inside that little black book what do you think obop asks i think you did i definitely think you did what did you see depends on what happens here tell me what should happen here callan hears obop swallow knows that obop is scared to death but hes going to go for it anyway callan thinks do it stevie make the play first thing is obop says we aint got the book with us hey brillo peaches says we start going to work on you youll tell us where the book is that is not an ace youre holding ease up on that trigger there were still talking looking now at callan obop says we know where every penny is that sheehan has on the street no kiddinghes sweating bricks to get that book back fuck him says obop he dont get his book back you dont owe him shit is that right as far as were concerned obop says and eddie friel aint gonna say different obop sees the relief on peaches face so he presses it theres cops in that book he says union guys councilmen couple of million dollars in money out on the street matty sheehans a rich man peaches says why should he be obop says why not us why not you they watch peaches think watch him weigh the risks versus rewards after a minute he says sheehans doing some favors for my boss obop says you got that book you could deliver the same favors callan realizes hes made a mistake having the guns out his arms are getting tired shaky hed like to lower the gun but he doesnt want to send any messages still hes afraid that if peaches decides the wrong way his own hands will be too shaky to shoot straight even at this range finally peaches asks have you told anyone else about seeing my name in that book obop says no so quickly that callan realizes its a very important question makes him wonder why peaches borrowed the money what he was using it for wild irish peaches says to himself then to them keep your fucking heads down try not to kill anyone for a day or so all right ill get back to you on this then he turns around and walks back up the stairs his brother right behind him jesus callan says he sits down on the floor his hands start shaking like crazy peaches rings the doorbell of matt sheehans building some big fucking harp answers the door peaches hears sheehan inside asking who is it his voice sounds scared its jimmy peaches the guy says letting him in hes in the den thanks peaches goes down the hallway takes a left into the den room has green fucking wallpaper shamrocks and shit all over the place big picture of john kennedy another one of bobby picture of the pope guys got everything in here except a fucking leprechaun perched on a stool big matts got the yankees game on he gets out of his chair thoughpeaches likes the respectand gives peaches one of these big irishpolitician smiles and says james its good to see you did you have any luck with that little difficulty while i was gone yeah you found those two animals yeah and jimmys got the knife in him before matty can say gosh and begorra sticks the blade in under the left pectoral and shoves it upward rolls the blade around a little to make sure therell be no difficult ethical decisions at the hospital fucking knife gets stuck in sheehans ribs so jimmy has to put his foot into the mans broad chest and shove to get the blade out sheehan hits the floor so hard the pictures on the walls shake fat guy who let him in is standing in the doorway not looking like he wants to do anything how much you owe him peaches asks sevenfive you dont owe him nothing peaches says if he disappears they cut matty up and take him out to wards island dump him into the sewage disposal on the way back peaches is singing anybody here seen my old friend matty can you tell me where hes goooone a month after what has come to be known in irish hells kitchen as the rising of the moon river callans life has changed a little not only is he still living it which is a surprise to him hes become a neighborhood hero because while peaches was flushing sheehan he and obop were taking a black felttip pen to mattys little black book and literally settling some debts they had a great goddamn timeeliminating some entries reducing others maintaining the ones they figured would give them the most swag its fat times in the kitchen callan and obop set themselves up in the liffey pub like they own it which if you look carefully at the black book they sort of do people come in and practically kiss their rings either theyre so grateful theyre off the hook with matty or theyre so scared theyre still on the hook with the boys who took down eddie friel jimmy boylan and very probably matty sheehan himself someone else too larry moretti its the only killing callan will feel bad about eddie the butcher was necessary so was jimmy boylan so especially was matty sheehan but larry moretti is just revengefor helping eddie cut up michael murphy its expected of us obop says its a respect thing moretti knows its coming hes holed up in his place on th off broadway and hes been drinking on it hasnt made a meeting in a couple of weekshe just stays drunkso hes an easy mark when callan and obop come through the door morettis lying on the floor with a bottle got his head between the stereo speakers and hes listening to some fuckedup disco shit with the bass booming like distant artillery he opens his eyes for a second and looks at callan and obop standing there with their guns pointed at him and then he shuts his eyes and obop yells this is for mikey and starts shooting callan feels bad about it but he joins in and its weird blasting a guy whos already down then they got the body to deal with but obops come prepared and they roll moretti onto a sheet of heavy plastic and callan now realizes how strong eddie friel had to be to cut meat up like that its hard fucking work and callan goes into the bathroom a couple of times to throw up but they finally get moretti into enough pieces to get him into garbage bags and then they take the bags out to wards island obop thinks they should put morettis thing into a milk carton and walk it around the neighborhood but callan says no they dont need that shit the word gets out and a lot of people come into the liffey to pay tribute one guy who doesnt come in is bobby remington callan knows bobby is scared that they think he gave them up to matty and he knows that bobby didnt beth did you were just trying to protect your brother callan tells her when she shows up at his new apartment i understand that she looks down at the floor shes come looking good her long hair is brushed and shiny and shes wearing a dress a black dress cut just low enough in front to show the tops of her white breasts callan gets it shes come over prepared to give it up to save her life her brothers does stevie understand she asks ill make him understand callan says bobby feels awful she says no bobbys good he needs a job she says he cant get a union card callan feels weird hearing this addressed to him its the sort of favor people used to ask of matty yeah we can do that callan says hes holding paper from union officers in teamsters construction whatever tell him to come around i mean were friends how about me she asks are we friends hed like to make her shit hed love to make her but it would be different it would be like he was taking her just because he can because she owes him because he has power now and she doesnt so he says yeah were friends to let her know its all right its cool she doesnt have to put out for him and thats all we are yeah beth thats all he feels kind of bad because shes dressed up and put on makeup and everything but he doesnt want to go to bed with her anymore its kind of sad anyway bobby comes around and they hook him up with a job that his new boss assumes is a noshowand bobby doesnt disappoint him in this regardand other people come in to pay their vig or look for a favor and for about a month callan and obop are playing junior godfathers from a booth in the liffey pub until the real godfather calls big paulie calabrese reaches a hand out and demands that they come to queens to explain to him personally why a they are not dead and b his friend and associate matt sheehan is i told them it was you guys whacked sheehan peaches explains theyre sitting in a booth at the landmark tavern and peaches is trying to eat some fucking lamb shit with potatoes and greasy brown gravy poured all over it at least at the sitdown with big paulie theyll get a decent fucking meal it might be their last but itll be decent why did you do that callan asks he has his reasons obop says good says callan what are they because peaches carefully explains if i told him i did it hed have me killed no question this is a great reason callan says to obop he turns back to peaches so now hell just have us whacked not necessarily peaches says not necessarily no peaches explains you guys arent in the family youre not made guys youre not subject to the same discipline see if i were going to kill matt sheehan id have to get calabreses permission which he would never give so if i went ahead and did it anyway im in serious trouble oh this is good news callan says but you guys dont need permission peaches says all you need is a good reason and the right attitude what kind of attitude toward the future peaches says an attitude of friendship cooperation obop gets seriously geeked this is like a dream come true calabrese wants to hook us up he asks hes practically coming out of his seat i dont know if i want to be hooked up callan says obop says this is our shot this is the fucking cimino family they want to work with us theres another thing peaches says thats good says callan i was hoping that wasnt you know everything the book peaches says what about it my entry peaches says the hundred grand calabrese cant ever know about that if he does im dead why callan asks its his money peaches says sheehan laid off a couple hundred from paulie i borrowed it from matt so youre ripping off paul calabrese callan says we peaches corrects him jesus god says callan even obop doesnt look so enthusiastic now says i dunno jimmy what the fuck peaches says you dont know i was supposed to whack you guys those were my orders and i didnt obey them they could kill me just for that i saved your fucking lives twice first i didnt kill you then i took out matty sheehan for you and you dont know callan stares at him then he says so this meeting its gonna make us rich or its gonna make us dead thats pretty much it peaches says what the fuck callan says rich or dead theres worse choices the meeting is set for the back room of a restaurant in bensonhurst goombah central callan says very convenient if calabrese decides to kill us all he has to do is walk out and shut the door behind him he goes out the front our bodies go out the service entry or exit or whatever hes thinking this as hes looking in the mirror trying to knot his tie havent you ever worn a tie before obop asks his voice is high nervous sure i have says callan at my first communion shit obop comes over and starts to tie the tie for him then says turn around i cant tie it backwards like this your hands are shaking fuck yes theyre shaking they got to go to this sitdown naked no hardware of any kind no one carries a gun around the boss except the bosss people which is going to make it even easier to take them out not that they intend to go out unaccompanied they got bobby remington and fat tim healey and another kid from the neighborhood billy bohun going to cruise in a car outside the restaurant obops instructions are very clear anyone other than us comes out the front door he tells them kill them and another precaution beth and her girlfriend moira are going to be having lunch in the public part of the restaurant beth and moira are also going to be having a and a in their respective handbags just in case things go sick and the boys have a chance to get out of the back room as obop says if im going to hell its going to be on a crowded bus they take a subway to queens because obop says he doesnt want to come out of a happy successful meeting and get into his car and have it go boom italians dont do bombs peaches tries to tell him thats irish shit obop reminds him hes irish and takes the subway they get off in bensonhurst and him and callan are walking down the street toward the restaurant and turn the corner and obop says oh fucking shit what oh fucking shit what theres four or five wise guys standing out front of the restaurant callans like so what there are always four or five wise guys standing out front of wiseguy restaurantsits what they do thats sal scachi obop says big thick guy early forties with sinatrablue eyes and silver hair which is razorcut short for a goombah he looks like a wise guy callan thinks but then again he dont look like a wise guy and hes wearing these real square black shoes which are polished so they shine like black marble this is a serious fucking guy callan thinks whats his story he asks obop hes a fucking colonel in the green berets obop says youre shittin me i shit you not obop says tons of medals from nam and hes a made guy if they decide to take us off the count its scachi wholl do the subtraction now scachi turns and sees them coming steps away from his group walks up to obop and callan smiles and says gentlemen welcome to the first or last day of the rest of your lives no offense but i have to make sure youre not carrying sidearms callan nods and lifts his arms scachi pats him down with a few smooth moves all the way to his ankles then does the same with obop good he says now shall we go get some lunch he takes them into the back room of the restaurant callans seen it before in about fortyeight freaking mob movies murals on the walls depict happy scenes from sunny sicily theres a long table with a redandwhitecheckered tablecloth wineglasses espresso cups little pats of butter sitting on iced plates bottles of red bottles of white even though theyre exactly on time theres guys already there peaches nervously introduces them to johnny boy cozzo and demonte and a couple of others then the door opens and two hitters come in chests like butchers blocks and then calabrese comes in callan gets a glance in at johnny boy who has a smile on his face thats dangerously close to a smirk but they all do that sicilian hugging and kissing shit and then calabrese sits down at the head of the table and peaches makes the necessary introductions callan doesnt like it that peaches looks scared peaches gets their names out then calabrese holds up a hand and says first we eat then business even callan has to admit that the food is out of this world its the best meal callans had in his whole life it starts with a big antipasto with provolone and prosciutto and sweet red peppers thin rolls of ham and tiny little tomatoes that callans never seen before waiters are coming in and out like theyre nuns waiting on the pope they finish the appetizer and the pasta course comes in nothing fancy just small bowls of spaghetti in a red sauce then theres a chicken piccatathin slices of chicken breast in white wine lemon and capers and then a baked fish then theres another salad then desserta sweet white cake soaked with anisette all this and the wines coming in and out and by the time the waiters set the espressos down callans about half in the bag he watches calabrese take a long sip from an espresso cup then the boss says tell me why i shouldnt kill you one motherfuck of an essay question part of callan wants to scream you shouldnt kill us because jimmy piccone stole a hundred grand from you and we can prove it but he keeps his mouth shut trying to think of a different answer then he hears peaches say theyre good boys paul calabrese smiles but youre not a good boy jimmy if you were a good boy id be having lunch with matt sheehan today he turns and looks at obop and callan im still waiting for your answer so is callan hes trying to think whether hes going to hear one or whether he should try to bust through the two slabs of meat guarding the door make it into the dining room to grab the guns from beth and come back in blasting but even if i make it out and make it back callan thinks obop will be dead by then yeah but i can send him out on his crowded bus he tries to slide to the edge of his chair without anyone noticing inch to the edge of his seat and get his legs under him so he can burst off that chair maybe go straight for calabrese and get a hold around his neck and back out the door and go where he thinks the freaking moon where can we go that the cimino family cant find us fuck it he thinks go for the guns go out like men across the table sal scachi shakes his head at him its an almost imperceptible gesture but its there telling him that if he keeps moving hes dead callan doesnt move all this thinking seems to take about an hour but it actually takes only a few seconds in the shall we say tense atmosphere of the room and callan is actually surprised when he hears obops thin voice pipe up with you shouldnt kill us because because uhhhhhhhhh because we can do more for you than sheehan ever could callan says we can deliver you a piece of the javits center teamsters local construction local not a chunk of concrete moves or goes in you dont own a piece of you get ten percent of every shylock dollar we move on the street and we take care of all of this for you you dont have to lift a finger or get involved callan watches calabrese consider this and take his sweet freaking time about it which starts to piss callan off like hes almost hoping calabrese says fuck you guys so they can cut this diplomatic crap and just get down to it but instead big paulie says there are some conditions and some rules first well take thirtynot tenpercent of your book second well take fifty percent of any monies arising from union and construction activities and thirty percent of any monies emanating from any other activities in exchange i offer you my friendship and protection while you cannot become members of the family because you are not sicilian you can become associates you will work under the supervision of jimmy peaches i will hold him personally responsible for your activities if you have a need you go to jimmy if you have a problem you go to jimmy this wild west nonsense must stop our business functions best in an atmosphere of quietude do you understand yes mr calabrese calabrese nods from time to time i might have need of your assistance i will communicate that to jimmy who will communicate it to you my expectation is that in return

calabrese is looking at callan and obop shaking his head jimmy peaches is trying to remember the exact wording of the act of contrition then calabrese laughs laughs so hard he has to pull a white handkerchief out of his jacket pocket and dab his eyes that doesnt even do ithe has to sit back down finishes laughing and looks at scachi and says what are you standing there for shoot em then just as quickly he says im kidding im kidding you two boys thinking i was going to walk out that door and world war three was going to start aww thats funny he waves them toward the door this time he says

street and looks up at the blue sky and says you know what this means dont you no stevie what does it mean it means obop says throwing his arm around callan were the kings of the west side kings of the west side thats the good news the bad news is what jimmy peaches has done with the hundred grand he now has free and clear from the last will and testament of matty sheehan what hes done is hes bought dope with it not the usual heroin from the usual turkeytosicily connection not from the marseilles connection not even from the new laotian connection that santo trafficante set up noif he buys

wants to laugh except she doesnt want to you know break the spell next time he does it he keeps his own hand on top of hers and moves it around in circles she can feel him grow under her palm feels him twitch his face looks ridiculous time after that he pulls the car over and asks her to take it out and she like hates this guy right he utterly grosses her out but she does it the way he shows her

moving on in fact she gets a real good job in atlanta and wants nora to go with her but nora is like nah unless you can show me where the beach is in atlanta im not going eventually it comes down to a judge asking nora which parent shed like to live with and she almost says neither but what she actually says is my dad so by the time shes fifteen shes going to atlanta for major holidays and one month in the summer which is just bearable if like she has enough good weed the kids at school call her nora the whora but she doesnt care and neither really do they its not really so much a term of contempt as it is an acknowledgment of reality what do you say about a classmate who gets picked up from school in porsches mercedeses and limos none of which belong to her parents nora is stoned one afternoon filling out some stupid questionnaire for the guidance counselor and under after school activities she puts down blow jobs before she erases it she shows the form to her friend elizabeth and

you want to go go where cabo okay so when do you want to go jerry the doof asks she shrugs whenever shes about out of the car when jerry hands her a baggie full of fine herb hey her dad says when she

sits up all of a sudden hes like mr initiative rolling himself a nice tight joint nora goes into her room and closes the door wonders what to think about a father wholl pimp his own daughter for dope nora has a lifechanging experience in cabo she meets haley noras lying by the pool next to jerry the doofus and this chick on a chaise across the pool is clearly checking her out a verycoollady type

huh huh haley mocks see thats what i mean if you want to be an earner you have to stop saying things like huh well maybe i dont want to be an earner in which case have a nice weekend haley says she picks her magazine back up and goes back to reading but nora doesnt go anywhere just sits there feeling stupid its like five full minutes before she finds the nerve to say okay maybe i want to be an earner okay so what do you sell you i sell you nora starts to say huh then checks herself and says im not sure what you mean haley smiles lays an elegant hand on top of noras hand and says its as simple as it sounds i sell women to men for money noras quick on the uptake so this is about sex she says kiddo haley says everything is about sex haley gives her a whole speech but basically it boils down to this the whole world isall the timelooking to get off she wraps up the spiel by saying you want to give it away or sell it cheap thats your business if you want to sell it for big bucks thats my business how old are you anyway sixteen nora says jesus haley says she shakes her head what haley sighs the potential first the voice if you want to keep doing backseat blow jobs for trinkets you can talk like a beach girl haley tells her a couple of weeks after they meet in cabo if you want to move up in the world haley puts nora to work with some alcoholic refugee from the royal shakespeare company who drops noras voice about an octave thats important haley says a deep voice makes a dick sit up and listen the dipso tutor rounds out noras vowels punches up her consonants makes her do monologues portia rosalind viola paulina what studied torments tyrant hast for me what wheels racks fires what flaying boiling so her voice becomes cultured deeper fuller lower its all part of the package like the clothes haley takes her shopping for the books haley makes her read the daily newspaper and not the fashion page kiddo or the arts haley says a courtesan reads the sports section first then the financial pages then maybe the news so she starts showing up at school with the morning paper her friends are out in the parking lot having that lastminute bong hit before the bell rings and noras sitting there checking out the scores the dow jones the editorial page shes reading the national review the wall street journal the freaking christian science monitor and thats about the only time she spends in the backseat nora the whora goes to cabo and comes back nora the ice maiden shes a virgin again is how elizabeth explains it to their bewildered friends she doesnt mean it unkindly it just seems to be true she went to cabo and had her hymen reattached i didnt know you could do that their friend raven says elizabeth just sighs raven asks her for the name of the doctor nora becomes a gym fiend spending hours on the stationary cycle more hours on the treadmill haley hires her a personal trainer a fascist healthfreak chick named sherry whom nora dubs her physical terrorist this nazi has a body like a greyhound and she starts whipping noras body into the tight little package that haley wants to market gets her doing pushups situps crunches and starts her on weights the interesting thing is that nora starts to dig it all of itthe rigorous mental and physical training nora is like into it she gets up one morning and goes to wash her face with the special cleanser haley buys her looks in the mirror and shes like wow who is this woman she goes to class she hears herself discoursing about current affairs and shes like wow who is this woman whoever she is nora likes her her dad doesnt notice the change how could he nora thinks i dont come in a baggie haley takes her on a drive up to the sunset strip in la to show her the crack whores crack cocaine has hit the country like a virus and the whores have caught it big time theyre on their knees in alleys on their backs in cars some of them are young some oldnora is shocked that they all look so old and so sick i could never be one of these women nora says yes you could haley says if you dont stay straight keep off dope dont let your head get fuckedup most of all put the money away youll have ten to twelve peak earning years if you take care of yourself tops after that its all downhill so you want to have stocks bonds mutual funds real estate ill hook you up with my financial planner because the girl is going to need one haley thinks nora is the package when she turns eighteen shes ready to go to the white house white walls white carpet white furniture a pain in the ass to clean and maintain but worth it because it quiets the men the moment they walk in theres not one of them who wasnt as a boy scared shitless of spilling something on his mothers white whatever and when haley is in attendance she always wears white the house is me i am the house im untouchable my house is likewise untouchable her women always wear black nothing else always stark black haley wants her women to stand out and theyre always fully dressed never in lingerie or robeshaleys not running some cheap nevada mustang ranch shes been known to costume the women in turtlenecks in business suits in basic little black frocks in gowns she dresses her women in clothes that the men can imagine removing and she makes them wait to do that they have to jump through hoops even at the white house on the walls hang blackandwhite renditions of goddesses aphrodite nike venus hedy lamarr sally rand marilyn monroe nora finds the pictures intriguing especially the one of monroe because they look a little alike no kidding they do haley thinks shes billing nora as a young monroe without the body fat noras nervous shes staring into a video monitor of the sitting room looking at this party of clients one of whom is going to be her first professional lay she hasnt had sex in a year and a half anyway and shes not even sure she remembers how to do it never mind do it five hundred bucks worth so shes hoping she gets this one the tall dark shy one and it does seem that haley is trying to steer things in that direction nervous joyce asks her joyce is her polar opposite a flatchested gamine in a s paris outfitgigi as whorewhos been helping with her makeup and clothes an openneck black blouse over a black skirt yes everyone is the first time joyce says then it gets to be routine nora keeps looking at the four men sitting awkwardly on the big sofa they look young only in their midtwenties but they dont look like rich spoiled college kids and she wonders how they got the money to come here how they got here at all callan wonders the same thing like what the hell are we doing here big paulie calabrese would shit blood if he knew jimmy peaches was out here connecting the pipeline that will suck cocaine like a giant straw from colombia through mexico and on to the west side will you relax peaches says i set a place for you at the table will you fucking sit down and eat you deal you die callan reminds him thats what calabrese said yeah you deal you die jimmy says but if we dont deal we starve is fuckin paulie giving us a taste of the unions no the kickbacks no trucking construction no fuck him let him give me a taste of those businesses and then he can tell me dont deal in the meantime i deal the doors havent shut on the bellhops behinds and peaches says he wants to go to this cathouse hes heard about callans not into it we flew three thousand miles to get laid he asks we can get laid at home not like this we cant peaches says they say they got the best pussy in the world at this place sex is sex callan says what do you know about it peaches asks youre irish its not like callan aint tempted here its just that this was supposed to be a business trip and when it comes to business callan is just thatbusiness tough enough keeping the brothers piccone from stepping on their own dicks on the job never mind when theyre dogging women so he says i thought this was a business trip jesus will you lighten up peaches says youre gonna die on your headstone its gonna say you never had no fun well get laid well do business we might even take a minute to get a meal if thats okay with you i hear they got great seafood here yeah this is real smart of peaches callan thinks looking out the window at nothing but ocean he figures someone out here might have figured out how to cook a fish youre a grim bastard you know that peaches adds yeah im a grim bastard callan thinks ive punched what five guys tickets for the ciminos peaches tells me im a grim bastard who gave you the

me nervous good good he wants me to be nervous i want you to be alive i appreciate the sentiment callan i do peaches reaches over grabs callan by the back of the head and kisses him on the cheek there now you can go tell the priest you committed a homosexual act with a guinea i love ya ya mick bastard im telling you tonights strictly pleasure nevertheless callan straps on his silenced before they go out they pull up to the white house and a minute later theyre all standing in the foyer just gawking callan figures to drink a beer then stand back and keep an eye on things if anyones scheming to take peaches off the count theyll wait until jimmys humping away and then put one in the back of his head so callans going to drink his beer grab obop and set up some kind of security of course obop will tell him to fuck off he wants to get laid so security is going to be pretty much callans job so he sips on his beer as haley sets several black threering binders on the glass coffee table we have a number of ladies here tonight she says opening a binder each page has an x blackandwhite glossy photograph in a plastic sleeve with smaller fullbody poses on the reverse side haleys not about to parade her women out like a livestock auction no this is classy dignified and it serves to fire the mens imaginations knowing these ladies as i do she says ill be happy to assist you in making an appropriate match after the other men have made their selections she sits next to callan notices that hes fixated on noras head shot and whispers in his ear her eyes could make you come callan blushes to his toes would you like to meet her haley asks he manages a nod turns out that he would and he falls instantly in love nora comes into the room looks at him with those eyes he feels a charge that goes from his heart to his groin and back again and by the time it does hes a goner hes never seen anything so beautiful in his life the thought that somethingsomeoneso lovely could be his even for a little while is something he didnt think was possible in his life now its imminent he swallows hard for her part shes relieved its him hes not badlooking and he doesnt look mean she puts out her hand and smiles im nora callan do you have a first name callan she asks sean hello sean haleys beaming at them like a yenta she wanted the shy one for noras first time out so she manipulated the others to select the more experienced women now everyones paired off into the couples she wanted standing and chatting getting ready to go to the rooms she slips out back to her office so she can phone adan and tell him his customers are having a good time ill take care of the bill adan tells her its nothing its tip money compared to the business the piccone brothers could bring him adan can sell a lot of cocaine in california he has plenty of customers in san diego and la but the new york market would be enormous to put his product onto the streets of new york through the cimino distribution network well jimmy peaches can have all the whores he wants on the house adan doesnt come to the white house anymore not as a customer anyway bedding even highclass call girls doesnt fit his persona as a serious businessman besides hes in love lucia vivanca is the daughter of a middleclass family born in the usa shes won the daily double as raul puts it that is she has dual us and mexican citizenship only recently graduated from our lady of peace high school in san diego shes living with an older sister and taking classes at san diego state and shes a beauty petite with natural blond hair against striking dark eyes and a trim little figure that raul obscenely comments upon at every opportunity those chupas brother he says poking out of that blouse you could cut yourself on them too bad shes a chiflona shes not a cocktease adan thinks shes a lady wellbred cultured educated by nuns still he has to admit that hes frustrated after countless wrestling matches in the front seat of his parked car or on the sofa of her sisters apartment the rare times the watchful bruja gives them a few minutes alone lucia will just not give it up not until theyre married and i dont have the money to get married yet adan thinks not to a lady like lucia youd be doing her a favor raul argues by going with a whore not putting all that pressure on her in fact you owe it to lucia to go to the white house your morality is a selfish indulgence raul certainly isnt selfish in that regard adan thinks his generosity is more than abundant my brother adan thinks hits the white house the way a restaurant cook raids the pantry and eats up all the profits its my giving nature raul says what can i say im a people person keep your giving nature in your pants tonight adan says to him now tonight is about business he hopes things are going well at the white house would you like a drink callan asks nora a grapefruit juice thats all i dont drink nora says he has no clue what to do or say so he just stands there staring at her she stares back at him surprised not so much by what she feels but by what she doesnt feel contempt she cant seem to work up any contempt sean yeah i have a room here would you like to go hes grateful to her for cutting through the bullshit keep him from standing there feeling like a jerk hell yes i want to go he thinks i want to go up there and take off your clothes and touch you everywhere and be inside you and then i want to take you home take you back to the kitchen and treat you like the queen of the west side and have you be the first thing i see when i get up in the morning and the last thing i see at night yeah yeah i would she smiles and takes his hand and they are turning to go upstairs when peaches voice comes across the room yo callan callan turns to see him standing in the corner beside a small woman with short black hair yeah i wanna trade what callan asks nora says i dont think good keep on dont thinking peaches says he looks at callan so peaches is pissed he spotted nora when she came into the room maybe the most beautiful piece of ass hes ever seen in his life if hed been shown her first hed have picked her no callan says cmon be a sport everything in the room stops obop and little peaches stop scoping the women theyre with and start checking out the situation which is dangerous is what obops thinking because while jimmy peaches is clearly not the craziest of the piccone brothersthat honor goes to little peaches hands downjimmys got a temper on him its sudden it comes from nowhere and you never know what jimmy peaches is going to door worse order you to doon the spur of the moment and jimmys irritated right now thinking about callan because callan has gottenwhatmoody quiet since they got out to california and this makes jimmy nervous because he needs callan and now callans about to go upstairs to fuck the woman peaches wants to fuck and thats just not right because peaches is the boss here theres something else though that makes this argument dangerous and they all know it although no one in piccones crew is ever going to utter the words out loud peaches is afraid of callan flat out there it is they all know that peaches is good hes tough smart and mean hes stone but callan callan is the best callan is the stonecoldest killer theres ever been and jimmy peaches needs him and is scared of him and thats a volatile combination that is nitro on a bumpy road is what that is obop thinks he doesnt like this shit at all hes busted his ass putting them together with the ciminos theyre all making money and now its all going to go to shit over some gash what the fuck guys obop says no what the fuck peaches asks i said no callan repeats peaches knows that callan can whip that little out and put one between his eyes before any of them can blink but he also knows that callan cant gun down the whole freaking cimino family which is what hell have to do if he kills peaches so thats what peaches has going for him which really pisses callan off hes sick of being the guineas attack dog to hell with jimmy peaches to hell with him johnny boy sal scachi and paulie calabrese without taking his eyes off peaches he asks obop you got my back i got your back so there it is they got a situation here which dont look like its gonna end happy for him or anyone else until nora says why dont i decide peaches smiles thats fair is that fair callan its fair thinking that it aint fair that you get so close to beauty you cant breathe and then it slips away but what the fuck has fair ever had to do with it go ahead peaches says choose callan feels like his hearts outside of him out there beating away where everyone can see it she looks up at him and says youll like joyce shes beautiful callan nods im sorry she whispers she is too she wanted to go with callan but haley now back in the room and doing her best to defuse the situation has given her the eye and noras smart enough to understand shes supposed to choose the gross guy haleys relieved tonight has to go well adans made it very clear that tonight is not about her business its about his and seeing as how tio barrera set her up with the money to open the place she is going to take care of the barrera family business dont be sorry callan says to nora he doesnt go with joyce tells her no offense but no thanks and goes and stands by the car pulls his and holds it behind his back a few minutes later when a car pulls up and sal scachi gets out hes dressed california casual but hes still got them polished army shoes on guineas and their shoes callan thinks he tells scachi to stop right there and keep his hands where he can see them hey its the shooter scachi says dont worry shooter jimmy peaches got nothing to worry about from me what paulie dont know he gives callan a little punch under the chin and goes into the house hes happy as hell to be there because hes spent the past few months in his green suit working on some cia op called cerberus scachi with a crew of other forces guys putting up three radio towers in the fucking colombian jungle then keeping an eye on them to make sure the communist guerrillas dont knock them down now he has to make sure peaches gets hooked up with adan barrera which reminds him he turns around and calls to callan hey kid theres a couple of mexican guys coming scachi says do me a favordont shoot them he laughs and goes into the house callan looks up again at the light in the window peaches does her hard nora tries to slow him down soften him show him the sweet slow things that haley taught her but the man isnt having it hes hard already from his victory downstairs he throws her facedown on the bed yanks her skirt and panties down and shoves himself inside her you feel that huh he says she feels it it hurts hes big and shes not nearly wet enough and hes pounding at her so she definitely feels it feels his hands reach under her and rip her bra off and start to squeeze her breasts hard and at first she tries to talk to him to tell him that but then she feels the anger and contempt come over her and shes like knock yourself out asshole so she lets her pain out in cries he mistakes for pleasure so he rams her harder and she remembers to squeeze him so hell come but he pulls out dont give me any of your fucking whores tricks he turns her over and straddles her pushes her breasts together then lays his cock between them and pushes it up toward her mouth suck it she does she does it the best hell let her as he pistons in and out because she wants this over hes doing his own porno flick anyway so it is over soon as he grabs his cock and pumps it and lets himself loose on her face she knows what he wants shes seen the movies too so she takes some on her finger swirls it into her mouth and looks him in the eyes as she moans mmmmmm and sees him smile when peaches leaves she goes into the bathroom brushes her teeth until her gums bleed and swishes listerine around her mouth for a full minute until she spits it out she takes a long almost scalding shower then puts on a robe goes to the window and looks out she sees the nice one the shy one leaning against the car and wishes he could have been her boyfriend chapter four the mexican trampoline who has the boats who has the planes guadalajara mexico art keller watches the dc land he and ernie hidalgo sit in a car on a bluff overlooking theguadalajara airport art continues to watch as mexican federales help offload the cargo they dont even bother to change out of their uniforms ernie says why should they art answers theyre on the job arent they art has his nightvision binoculars trained on a cargo airstrip that juts sideways from the main runway on the near side of the strip a number of cargo hangars and a few small shacks serve as offices for the airfreight companies now trucks are parked outside the hangars and the federales carry crates from the plane into the backs of the trucks he says to ernie you getting this say cheese ernie answers the electric motor of his camera whirs ernie grew up among the gangs inel paso saw what dope did to his barrio and wanted to do something about it so when art offered him theguadalajara job he jumped at it now he asks and what do we think might be in the crates oreo cookies art suggests bunny slippers one thing we know it isnt art says it isnt cocaine because they both finish the line there is no coke inmexico they laugh at this shared joke a ritual chant a sarcastic rendering of the official line given to them by their bosses at the dea according to the suits in washington the planes full of coke thatve been coming in more regularly and more often than united airlines are a figment of art kellers imagination the received wisdom is that the mexican drug trade was destroyed back in the operation condor days the official reports say so the dea says so the state department says so and the attorney general says soand none of the aforementioned needs art keller to create fantasies about mexican drug cartels art knows what they say about him that hes becoming a genuine pain in the ass firing off monthly memos trying to create a federacion from a gaggle of sinaloan hillbillies who were chased out of the mountains nine years ago bugging everyone with a bunch of frito banditos who are running a little marijuana and maybe a little heroin when what he needs to realize is that theres a freaking crack epidemic ripping through the streets ofamerica and the cocaine is coming fromcolombia not goddamnmexico they even sent tim taylor over frommexico city to tell him to shut the fuck up the man in charge of the whole dea operation inmexico gathered art ernie hidalgo and shag wallace in the back room of the dea office inguadalajara and said were not where the action is you guys need to face that instead of inventing were not inventing anything art said wheres the proof were working on it notaylor said youre not working on it there is nothing for you to work on the attorney general of theunited states has announced to congress i read the speech that the mexican drug problem is all but over are you trying to make the ag look like an asshole i think he can manage that without any help from me ill be sure to tell him you said that arthurtaylor said you are not i repeat not to go running aroundmexico chasing snow that doesnt exist do we have an understanding here sure said art if anyone tries to sell me mexican cocaine i should just say no now three months later hes watching nonexistent federales loading nonexistent cocaine into nonexistent trucks that will deliver the cocaine to nonexistent members of the nonexistent federacion its the law of unintended consequences art thinks as he watches the federales operation condor was intended to cut the sinaloan cancer out ofmexico but what it did instead was spread it through the entire body and you have to give the sinaloans credittheir response to their little diaspora was pure genius somewhere along the line they figured out that their real product isnt drugs its the twothousandmile border they share with the united states and their ability to move contraband across it land can be burned crops can be poisoned people can be displaced but that borderthat border isnt going anywhere a product that might be worth a few cents one inch on their side of the border is worth thousands just one inch on the other side the productdea state and mexican government notwithstandingis cocaine the federacion made a very simple and profitable deal with the medellin andcali cartels the colombians pay for every kilo of cocaine the mexicans can safely deliver to them inside theunited states so basically the federacion got out of the druggrowing business and into the transportation business the mexicans take delivery of the coke from the colombians transport it to staging areas along the border move it across into safe houses in the states and then give it back to the colombians and get their thousand bucks per kilo the colombians move it to their labs and process it into crack and the shit is on the streets weekssometimes just daysafter leavingcolombia not throughflorida the dea has been pounding those routes like a rented mulebut through the neglected mexican back door the federacion art thinkswhen it absolutely positively has to be there overnight but how he wonders even he has to admit there are some problems with his theory how do you fly a plane under the radar fromcolombia toguadalajara across a central american terrain that is swarming not only with dea but thanks to the presence of the communist sandinista regime innicaragua with cia as well spy satellites awacsnone of them is picking up these flights and then theres the fuel problem a dc like the one hes looking at right now doesnt have the fuel capacity to make that flight in one shot it would have to stop and refuel but where it doesnt seem possible as his bosses have cheerfully pointed out to him yeah well it may not be possible art thinks but the plane is sitting there fat with cocaine just as real as the crack epidemic thats causing so much pain in the american ghettos so i know youre doing it art thinks looking at the plane i just dont know how youre doing it but im going find out and then im going to prove it whats this ernie asks a black mercedes pulls up to the office shack some federales trot up and open the back door of the car and a tall thin man in a black suit gets out art can see the glow from a cigar as the man walks through the cordon of federales into the office i wonder if thats him ernie asks who the mythical m himself ernie says m is the mexican sobriquet for the nonexistent head of the nonexistent federacion the intelligence that art has managed to gather over the past year is that ms federacion like caesars gaul is divided into three parts the gulf states sonora and baja together they cover the border with the united states each of these three territories is run by a sinaloan who was forced out of the home province by operation condor and art has managed to put a name to all three the gulf garcia abrego sonora chalino guzman aka el verde the green baja guero mendez at the top of this triangle based in guadalajara m but they cant put a name or a face to him but you can cant you art he asks himself you know in your gut whos the patron of the federacion you helped put him in office art peers through his night scope into the little office focuses on the man who now sits down behind a desk he wears a conservative black business suit a white buttondown shirt open at the neck no tie his black hair flicked with a little silver is combed straight back his thin dark face sports a pencil mustache and he smokes a thin brown cigar look at them ernie is saying theyre acting like this is a papal visit i mean i havent seen this guy before have you no art says setting the binoculars down i havent not for nine years anyway but tio hasnt changed much altheas asleep when art gets home to their rented house in the tlaquepaque district a leafy suburb of singlefamily homes boutiques and trendy restaurants why shouldnt she be asleep art thinks its three oclock in the morning hes spent the last two hours in the charade of tailing m to find out his identity well it was skillfully done anyway art thinks he and ernie had laid way off the black mercedes as it pulled out onto the highway that led back into downtown guadalajara they tailed the car through the old centro historico district and past the cross of squaresplaza de armas plaza de la liberacion plaza de la rotonda de los hombres and plaza tapatiathat has the cathedral at its center then into the modern business district and back out toward the suburbs where the black mercedes finally pulled off at a car dealership german imports luxury cars theyd stayed a block away and waited while tio let himself into the office then came out a few minutes later with a set of keys and got into a new mercedes no driver this time no guards they followed him out to the wealthy garden district where tio pulled into a driveway got out of the car and went into his house just another businessman coming home after a late nights work so art thinks in the morning ill go through another charade entering the car dealership and the home address into the system to come up with the identity of our alleged m miguel angel barrera tio angel art goes into the dining room opens the liquor cabinet and pours himself a johnnie walker black he takes his drink and walks down the hallway and looks in on his kids cassie is five and looks thank god like her mother michael is three and also favors althea although he has arts thicker build althea is thrilled that due to a mexican housekeeper and a mexican nanny both kids are on their way to being bilingual michael doesnt ask for bread anymore he asks for pan water has become agua art sneaks into each of their rooms kisses them softly on the cheeks and then goes back down the long hallway through the master bedroom and into the attached bathroom where he takes a long shower if althie was a crack in arts doctrine of yoyo the kids were a hydrogen bomb the moment he saw his daughter born and then lying in althies arms he knew his shell of himself alone had been blown to bits when his son came along it wasnt better it was just different looking down at that little version of himself and an epiphanythe only redemption for having a bad father is being a good one and hes been a good one a warm loving father to his kids a faithful warm husband to his wife so much of the anger and bitterness of his youth has faded away leaving only thisthis thing with tio barrera because tio used me back in the condor days used me to take out his rivals so he could set up his federacion played me for a sucker let me think i was destroying the drug network when all i was doing was helping him set up a bigger and better one face it he thinks as he lets the hot spray hit his tired shoulders its why you came here it had seemed an odd assignment request a backwater like guadalajara especially for the hero of operation condor bringing down don pedro put his career on a bullet he went from sinaloa to washington then to miami then to san diego art keller the boy wonder was about to be at thirtythree the youngest racresident agent in chargein the agency he could pick his spot everyone was stunned when he picked guadalajara took his career off the fast track and derailed it colleagues friends ambitious rivals asked why art wouldnt say even to himself really that he had unfinished business and maybe i should leave it that way he thinks as he gets out of the shower grabs a towel from the rack and dries off it would be so easy to back off and toe the company line just take the smalltime marijuana dealers the mexicans want to give you dutifully file reports that the mexican antidrug effort is going swimmingly which would be a good joke given that the usfunded mexican defoliation planes are dropping mostly watertheyre actually watering the marijuana and poppy crops and sit back and enjoy your tour here no investigation of m no revelations about miguel angel barrera its in the past he thinks leave it there you dont have to kiss the cobra yes you do its been eating away at you for nine years all the destruction all the suffering all the death brought by operation condor all so tio could set up his federacion with himself as its head the law of unintended consequences bullshit it was exactly what tio intended what he planned what he set up he used you set you like a dog on his enemies and you did it then you kept your mouth shut about it while they lauded you as a hero slapped you on the back finally let you on the team you pathetic son of a bitch thats what its been about hasnt it your desperation to finally belong you sold your soul for it now you think you can buy it back let it goyou have a family to take care of he slips into bed trying not to wake althea but it doesnt work time is it she asks almost four in the morning go back to sleep what timere you getting up she asks seven wake me she says i have to go to the library she has a readers ticket at the university of guadalajara where shes working on a postdoc thesis the agricultural labor force in prerevolutionary mexicoa statistical model then she says you want to mess around its four in the morning i didnt ask for time and temperature she says i asked you to do me cmon she reaches for him her hand feels warm and in a few seconds hes inside her it always feels like coming home to him when she climaxes she grabs his ass and pushes him in tight that was beautiful baby she says now let me sleep he lies awake in the morning art looks at the pictures of the airplane of the federales offloading the coke then opening the car door for tio then tio sitting at the desk in the office then he listens to ernie brief him on what he already knows i got on epic ernie says referring to the el paso intelligence center a computer databank that coordinates dea customs and immigration information miguel angel barrera was a former sinaloa state policeman in fact the bodyguard to the governor himself heavy connections with the mexican dfs now get this he played on our teamhe was one of the state cops who ran operation condor back in some epic reports credit barrera with singlehandedly dismantling the old sinaloan heroin operation he left the force and disappeared off the epic radar after that no hits post art asks nada ernie answers you pick up his story here in guadalajara hes a very successful businessman he owns the car dealership four restaurants two apartment buildings and considerable realestate holdings he sits on the boards of two banks and has powerful connections in the jalisco state government and in mexico city not exactly the profile of a drug lord shag says shag is a good old boy out of tucson a vietnam vet who found his way from military intelligence into the dea and is in his own quiet way as much of a hardass as ernie is he uses his awshucks cowboy persona to disguise his smarts and a number of drug dealers are now in prison because they underestimated shag wallace until you see him supervising a shipment of coke ernie says pointing at the photographs could he be m art says only one way to find out taking he thinks one more step toward the edge of the cliff there will be no investigation of the barrera cocaine connection he says is that clear ernie and shag look a little stunned but they both nod i want to see nothing on your logs no paperwork of any kind he says were just chasing marijuana in that connection ernie work your mexican sources see if the barrera name rings any alarms shag work the airplane what about surveillance on barrera ernie asks art shakes his head i dont want to stir him up before were ready well bracket him work on the street work on the plane work in toward him if thats where it leads but shit art thinks you know it does the dcs serial number is nvx shag works through the tangled paper chase of holding corporations shell companies and dbas the trail ends at an airfreight company called servicios turisticossetcooperating out of aguacate airport in tegucigalpa honduras someone running drugs out of honduras is about as surprising as someone selling hot dogs in yankee stadium honduras the original banana republic has an old and distinguished history in the drug trade dating back to the turn of the twentieth century when the country was outandout owned by the standard fruit and united fruit companies the fruit companies were based in new orleans and the citys docks were outandout owned by the new orleans mafia through its control of the dockworkers union so if the fruit companies wanted their honduran bananas offloaded the boats had better be carrying something else under those bananas so much dope came into the country in those banana boats that mafia slang for heroin became banana the honduran registry isnt surprising art thinks and it answers the question of where the dcs are refueling the ownership of setco is likewise enlightening two partnersdavid nunez and ramon mette ballasteros nunez is a cuban expat now living in miami nothing extraordinary there what is extraordinary is that nunez was with operation a cia op in which cuban expatriates were trained to go in and take political control after the successful bay of pigs invasion except the bay of pigs was conspicuously not a success some of the operation guys ended up dead on the beach others went to firing squads the lucky ones made it back to miami nunez was one of the lucky art doesnt really need to read the file on ramon mette ballasteros he already knows the book mette was a chemist for the gomeros back in the heroin heyday got out just before condor and went back to his native honduras and into the cocaine business the word is that mette personally financed the coup that recently overthrew the honduran president okay art thinks the two profiles actually walk the company line a major coke dealer owns an airline that hes using to fly coke to miami but at least one of setcos planes is flying to guadalajara and that doesnt conform to the official line the next normal step would be to call the dea office in tegucigalpa honduras but he cant do that because it was closed last year due to lack of business honduras and el salvador are now both being handled out of guatemala so art gets on the horn to warren farrar the rac in guatemala city setco art says what about it farrar asks i was hoping youd tell me art says theres a pause that art is tempted to describe as pregnant then farrar says i cant come out and play with you on this art really art wonders why the hell not we only have about eight thousand conferences a year just so we can come out and play with each other on things exactly like this so he takes a shot why was the honduras office closed warren what are you fucking around with art i dont know thats why im asking because im wondering if the quid pro quo for mette financing a presidential coup was the new government tossing out the dea in response farrar hangs up well thanks a bunch warren whats got you so nervous next art phones the state departments drug assist desk a title so pungent with irony it makes him want to weep because they tell him in polite bureaucratese to please go fuck himself next art calls the cia liaison desk puts in his request and gets a call back that same afternoon what he doesnt expect is a call back from john hobbs himself back in the day hobbs was the head of operation phoenix art had briefed him a few times hobbs had even offered him a job after his year incountry but by that time the dea had beckoned and art went now hobbs is the cias station chief for central america makes sense to me art thinks a cold warrior goes where theres a cold war they make small talk for a few minutes how are althea and the kids how do you like guadalajara then hobbs asks what can we do to be of assistance arthur i was wondering if you could help me get a handle on an airfreight company called setco art says its owned by ramon mette yes my people passed along your request hobbs says that has to be a negative im afraid a negative yes hobbs says a no yes we have no bananas art thinks we have no bananas today hobbs continues we dont have anything on setco well thanks for giving me the call then hobbs asks what have you got going on down there arthur im just getting some radar pings art lies that setco might be moving some marijuana around marijuana sure art says thats about all thats left in mexico these days well good luck with that arthur hobbs says sorry we couldnt be of any help i appreciate the effort art says he hangs up wondering why the companys chief of latin american operations would take time out from his busy day of trying to overthrow the sandinistas to call him personally and lie to him nobody wants to talk about setco art thinks not my colleagues in the dea not the state department not even cia the whole interagency alphabet soup just spells out yoyo youre on your own ernie reports pretty much the same thing you put the name barrera out to any of the usual sources and they clam up even the most loquacious snitches develop a case of lockjaw barreras one of the most prominent businessmen in town except no one ever heard of him so drop it art tells himself this is your chance cant why not just cant at least be honest okay maybe because i just cant let him win maybe because i owe him a beating yeah except hes beating you and hes not even showing up you cant lay a glove on him its truethey cant get near tio then the damnedest thing happens tio comes to them colonel vega the ranking federale in jalisco and the man whom art is supposed to be liaising with comes into arts office sits down and says sadly senor keller i will be frank i have come here to ask you politely but firmlyplease cease your harassment of don miguel angel barrera he and art stare at each other then art says as much as id like to help you colonel this office isnt conducting an investigation of senor barrera not that i know about anyway he yells out into the main office shag are you investigating senor barrera no sir ernie no art raises his arms in a shrug senor keller vega says glancing out the door at ernie your man is tossing don miguels name about in a very irresponsible fashion senor barrera is a respected businessman with many friends in government and apparently in the municipal judicial federal police youre mexican arent you vega asks im american but where are you going with this but you speak spanish art nods then youre familiar with the word intocable vega says getting up to leave senor keller don miguel is intocable untouchable with that concept imparted vega leaves ernie and shag come into arts office shag starts to speak but art signals for him to shut up and gestures for them all to go outside they follow him for about a block before he says how did vega know were running an op on barrera back inside it takes them just a few minutes to find the little mike under arts desk ernie goes to rip it out but art grabs his wrist and stops him i could use a beer art says how about you guys they go to a bar downtown thats beautiful ernie says in the states the cops bug the bad guys here the bad guys bug the cops shag shakes his head so they know everything we know well art thinks they know we suspect tio is m they know that weve tracked the plane to nunez and mette and they know we cant get shit after that so whats making them nervous why send in vega to shut down an investigation thats going nowhere and why now okay art says well broadcast to them let them think theyve backed us off you guys stand down for a while what are you going to do boss me im going to touch the untouchable back in the office he regretfully tells ernie and shag that theyre going to have to shut down the barrera investigation then he goes to a phone booth and calls althea im not going to make it home for dinner im sorry me too he says kiss the kids good night for me i will love you love you too every man has a weakness art thinks a secret that could drag him down i should know i know mine but whats yours tio art doesnt make it home that night or the next five im like an alcoholic art thinks hes heard reformed drunks talk about how they would drive to the liquor store all the time swearing they werent going to go then go in swearing they werent going to buy then buy swearing they werent going to drink the booze theyd just bought then theyd drink it im that guy art thinks drawn toward tio like a drunk to the bottle so instead of going home at night he sits in his car on the broad boulevard parked a block and a half from tios car dealership and watches the office through the rearview mirror tio must be selling a lot of cars because hes there until eight or eightthirty in the evening and then he gets into his car and drives home art sits at the bottom of his road the only way in or out of the housing development until midnight or one but tio doesnt come out finally on the sixth night art gets lucky tio leaves the office at sixthirty and drives not to the suburbs but back downtown art stays back in the rushhour traffic but manages to stay with the mercedes as it drives through the centro historico and pulls up beside a tapas restaurant three federales two jalisco state policemen and a couple of guys that look like dfs agents are on guard outside and the sign on the restaurant door reads cerradoclosed one of the federales opens tios door tio gets out and the federale drives the mercedes away like a parking valet a jalisco state cop opens the closed restaurant door and tio walks in another jalisco cop waves to art to keep his car moving art rolls his window down i want to grab a bite private party yeah i guess art thinks he parks the car two blocks away takes his nikon camera with the lens and sticks it under his coat he crosses the street and walks half a block up then takes a left into the alley and walks until he figures hes at the back of the building across the street from the restaurant then hops the fireescape ladder and pulls it down he climbs up the metal ladder bolted to the bricks until he makes it the three stories up to the roof dea racs arent supposed to be doing this kind of worktheyre supposed to be office creatures liaising with their mexican counterparts but seeing as how my mexican counterparts are across the street guarding my target art thinks the liaison thing isnt going to work out he ducks and crosses the roof then lies down behind the low parapet that edges the building surveillance work is hell on the drycleaning bill he thinks as he stretches out on the dirty roof rests the lens on the parapet and focuses on the restaurant and you cant turn it in on your expense account either he settles down to wait but he doesnt have to wait long before a parade of cars pulls up alongside talaveras tapas place the drill is the samethe jalisco police stand guard while the federales play valet and a major player in the mexican drug trade gets out and goes into the restaurant its like a hollywood opening for drug stars garcia abrego head of the gulf cartel gets out of his mercedes the older man looks distinguished with his silver hair trim mustache and businessmans gray suit guero mendez baja cartel looks like the narcocowboy he is his blond hairhence the nickname guero blondiehangs long under his white cowboy hat he wears a black silk shirt open to the waist black silk pants and black cowboy boots with pointed toes capped with silver chalino guzman looks more like the peasant he is in an illfitting old suit jacket mismatched pants and green boots jesus art thinks its a fucking apalachin meeting except these guys dont look too worried about police interference it would be like the godfathers of the cimino genovese and colombo families getting together for a sitdown guarded by the fbi except if this was the sicilian mafia id never get this close but these guys are complacent they think theyre safe and theyre probably not wrong whats curious though art wonders is why this restaurant tio owns half a dozen places in guadalajara but talaveras isnt one of them why wouldnt he hold this summit meeting in one of his own joints but i guess this dispels any doubt about tio being m the traffic stops out front and art settles in for the long wait there is no such thing as a quick mexican dinner and these boys probably have an agenda jesus what i wouldnt give to have a microphone in there he pulls a kit kat bar out of his pants pocket unwraps it breaks off two sections and puts the rest back not knowing when hell get a chance to grab more food then he rolls onto his back crosses his arms over his chest for warmth and takes a nap bagging a couple of hours of uneasy sleep before car doors and voices wake him up showtime he rolls back over and sees them all coming out on the sidewalk if theres no such thing as a federacion he thinks theyre doing a damn good imitation of one theyre absolutely brazen all standing out on the sidewalk laughing shaking hands and lighting each others cuban cigars as they wait for the federale valets to bring their cars around shit art thinks you can practically smell the smoke and the testosterone overload the atmosphere changes suddenly when the girl comes out shes stunning art thinks a young liz taylor but with olive skin and black eyes and long lashes which shes batting at all the men while an older man who has to be her father stands in the doorway smiling nervously and waving adios to the gomeros but theyre not leaving guero mendez is all over the girl he even takes off his cowboy hat art notices maybe not your best move guero at least until you wash your hair but guero bowsactually bowssweeps his hat along the sidewalk and smiles up at the girl his silver teeth flash in the streetlights yeah guero thatll get her art thinks tio rescues the girl comes over puts an almost paternal arm around gueros shoulders and smoothly walks him back toward his car which has just pulled up they hug and do their goodbye thing and guero looks over tios shoulder at the girl before he gets into his car must be true love art thinks or at least true lust then abrego leaves with a dignified handshake instead of an embrace and art watches as tio walks back to the girl bends over and kisses her hand latin chivalry art wonders or no but art eats lunch at talaveras the next day the girls name is pilar and sure enough shes talaveras daughter she sits in a booth in the back pretending to study a textbook every now and again performing a selfconscious turn of the hip as she looks up from under those long lashes to see who might be checking her out every guy in the place art thinks she doesnt look fifteen except for a remaining trace of baby fat and the perfected adolescent pout on her precociously full lips and even though it makes him feel a little like a child molester art cant help but notice that she has a figure that is definitely very postadolescent the only thing that tells art shes fifteen is the ongoing argument shes having with her mother who sits down in the booth and loudly reminds her several times that shes only fifteen and papa glances up anxiously every time the door opens the hell is he so nervous about art wonders then he finds out tio walks through the door art has his back to the door and tio walks right past him doesnt even notice his longlost nephew art thinks hes so focused on the girl and he has flowers in his handhonest to god he has flowers clutched in his long thin fingersand honest to god has a box of candy under his other arm tio has come courting now art gets why talaveras so freaked out he knows that miguel angel barrera is accustomed to the droit de seigneur of rural sinaloa in which girls her age and younger are routinely deflowered by the dominant gomeros and thats their concern that this powerful man this married man is going to turn their precious beautiful virginal daughter into his segundera his mistress to use her and then throw her aside her reputation ruined her chances for a good marriage destroyed and theres not a goddamn thing they can do about it tio wont rape the girl art knows he wont take her by force that might happen up in the hills of sinaloa but it wont happen here but if she accepts him if she goes with him willingly the parents are helpless and what fifteenyearolds head wouldnt be turned by attention from a rich and powerful man this kid isnt stupidshe knows its flowers and candy now but it could be jewelry and clothes trips and vacations shes at the base of an arc but she cant see the downside from where shes standingthat one day the jewelry and clothes will slide back to flowers and candy and then it wont even be that anymore tios back is turned to art who leaves some pesos on the table gets up as quietly as he can goes to the counter and pays the check thinking she may look like a young piece of strange to you tio to me she looks like a trojan horse nine oclock that night art climbs into a pair of jeans and a sweater and goes into the bathroom where althea is taking a shower babe i gotta go out now yeah shes too smart to ask where hes going shes a cops wife shes been in the dea with him for the past eight years she knows the drill but knowing doesnt stop her from worrying she slides the glass door open and kisses him goodbye im guessing i shouldnt wait up good guess what are you doing he asks himself as he drives toward the talaveras house in the suburbs nothing im not going to drink he finds the address and pulls over a halfblock away on the other side of the street its a quiet neighborhood solidly uppermiddleclass just enough streetlights to make it safe not enough to be obtrusive he sits in his dark spot and waits that night and the next three hes there each night as the talavera family comes home from the restaurant as a light goes on in a room upstairs then goes off a little while later when pilar turns in for the night art gives it another halfhour and then goes home maybe youre wrong he thinks no youre not tio gets what he wants arts about to go home on the fourth night when a mercedes comes down the street kills its headlights and pulls up in front of the talavera house ever gallant art thinks tio sends a car and driver no taxicab for this underage piece of ass its fucking pathetic he thinks as he watches pilar come out the front door and scurry into the backseat of the car art gives it a good head start then pulls out the car pulls up in front of a condo on a little knoll in the west suburbs its in a nice quiet neighborhood fairly new individual units nestled among the citys trademark jacaranda trees the address is new to art not any of the properties hes traced to tio how sweet art thinksa brandnew love nest for a brandnew love tios car is already there the driver gets out and opens the door for pilar tio meets her at the door and ushers her in theyre in each others arms before the door is even shut jesus art thinks if i were fucking a fifteenyearold girl id at least pull the curtains but you think youre safe dont you tio and the most dangerous place on earth is where youre safe hes back at la casa del amor as he styles it late that morning when he knows that tio will be at the office and pilar in well ahem school hes wearing the overalls he uses to work in his own garden and he carries a pair of clippers in fact he does trim a couple of unruly jacaranda branches as he makes his reconnaissance noting the color of the exterior paint and plaster the location of the phone lines the windows the pool the spa any outbuildings a week later after visits to a hardware store and a modelsupply shop and a call to a mailorder techno warehouse in san diego he goes back wearing the same outfit and clips a few more branches on his way to ducking behind the shrubs that have been thoughtfully planted outside the bedroom wall he likes this location not for prurient reasonshed actually rather not hear that part of itbut because the telephone lines go into the bedroom he pulls a small flathead screwdriver from his pocket and delicate as a surgeon pries a minuscule opening behind the aluminum windowsill he inserts the tiny fx bug into the opening removes a small tube of caulking from his pocket and reseals the opening then takes the little bottle of green paint that closely matches the original color and with a tiny brush meant for painting model airplanes paints over the caulk he blows gently on the paint to dry it then leans back to assess his work the bug illegal and unauthorized is also undetectable the fx can pick up any sound within ten yards and throw it for another sixty so art has some flexibility he goes outside the complex to the sewer opening he takes the unit that contains the receiver and a voiceactivated tape recorder and ducttapes it to the top of the sewer now it will be a simple matter of swinging by taking out one cassette and replacing it with a fresh one he knows its going to be hitandmiss but he needs only a few hits tio will use la casa del amor mostly as a spot for his assignations with pilar but hell also use the phone he might even use the condo for meetings even the most cautious criminal art knows cant separate his business from his personal life of course he admits neither can you he lies to ernie and shag they take jogs together now ostensibly its arts mandate for his team to stay in shape but in reality its a cover for them to have the conversations they cant have in the office its hard to listen in on a moving target particularly in the open plazas of downtown guadalajara so every day before lunch they change into sweats and nikes and go out for their run i have a ci he tells them a confidential informant he feels bad about lying to them but its for their own protection if this goes sick and wrong as it almost has to he wants to take it all on his own shoulders if his guys know that hes running an illegal tap theyre obliged by regulations to inform their superiors otherwise theyre concealing guilty knowledge which would ruin their careers he knows that they would never rat him out so he makes up a confidential informant an imaginary friend art thinks at least its consistenta nonexistent source for nonexistent coke et cetera thats great boss ernie says who sorry art says its early were just dating they get it a relationship with a snitch is like a relationship with the opposite sex you flirt you seduce you tempt you buy them presents you tell them how much you need them you cant live without them and if they do get in bed with you you dont tell evenespeciallythe boys in the locker room at least not until its a done deal and by the time it becomes common knowledge its usually about over anyway so this becomes arts day he puts in his hours at the office goes home leaves the house late at night to retrieve his daily tape then comes home and listens to it in his study this goes on for two useless weeks what he hears is mostly love talk sex talk as tio woos his young inamorata and gradually instructs her in the finer points of lovemaking art fastforwards through most of this but he gets the idea pilar talavera is growing up fast as tio starts introducing some interesting grace notes into the music of love well interesting if youre into that sort of thing which art is decidedly not in fact it makes him want to puke youve been a bad girl have i yes and you need to be punished its a commonplace of surveillanceyou hear so much shit that you never wanted to hear then albeit rarely the rose in the manure pile one night art brings his tape home makes himself a scotch and sips on it while he goes through that evenings sick tedium and hears tio confirm the delivery of three hundred wedding gowns to an address in chula vista a neighborhood that sits between san diego and tijuana now that youve got it art thinks what do you do with it the sop requires that you turn the info over to your mexican colleagues and simultaneously to the dea office in mexico city for transferral to the san diego office well if i turn it over to my mexican counterpart it goes straight to tio and if i turn it in to tim taylor hell just repeat the official line that there are no wedding gowns moving through mexico and hell demand to know who my source is which i aint about to give him they talk it over on the morning jog were fucked ernie says no were not art answers time to take the next step toward the cliff he leaves the office after lunch and goes to a phone booth in the states he thinks its the criminals who have to sneak around and use pay phones here its the cops he phones a guy he knows on the san diego police narco squad he met russ dantzler at some interagency conference a few months ago seemed like a decent guy a player yeah and what i need now is a definite player with a set of stones russ art keller dea we had a couple of beers together what was it last july dantzler remembers him whats up art art tells him this might be bullshit he finishes but i dont think so you might want to hit it hell yes he might want to hit it and theres nothing the attorney general of the united states or the state department or the entire federal government can do about it the feds come down on san diego pd san diego pd is just going to tell them to go fuck themselves sideways with something jagged with a proper regard to cop etiquette dantzler asks what do you want from me you keep me out of it and you keep me in it art answers you forget i gave you the tip and you remember to share any intel you get with me deal dantzler says but i need a warrant art just in case youve forgotten how things work in a democracy that scrupulously protects the rights of its citizens i have a ci he lies gotcha they dont need to say anything more dantzler will take the info to one of his own guys who will tell it to one of his cis wholl then turn around and tell it to dantzler who will take it to a judge and prestoprobable cause the next day dantzler calls art back at the phone booth at a prearranged time and screams three hundred pounds of cocaine thats six million dollars in street value art ill make sure you get a lot of the credit forget i gave you anything art says just remember you owe me two weeks later the el paso police also owe art for the seizure of a trailertruck full of cocaine a month after that art goes back to russ dantzler with another tip about a house in lemon grove the subsequent raid yields a paltry fifty pounds of cocaine plus million in cash three moneycounting machines and stacks of interesting documents that include bank deposit slips the deposit slips are so interesting that when dantzler takes them into federal court the judge freezes an additional million in assets deposited under several names in five san diego county banks although none of the names is miguel angel barrera every penny of the money belongs either to him or to cartel members who are paying him a fee to keep their assets safe and art can hear from the phone traffic that none of them is very happy neither is tim taylor the dea boss is looking at a faxed copy of the san diego uniontribune its headline screaming massive drug bust in lemon grove with references to a federacion and at another fax from the ags office screaming just what the fuck is going on he gets on the horn to art just what the fuck is going on he yells what do you mean goddammit i know what youre doing then i wish youd share it with me you have a ci and youre running it through other agencies and goddamn it arthur youd better not be the one leaking this shit to the press im not art answers truthfully im leaking it to other agencies so they can leak it to the press whos the ci there is no ci art answers i have nothing to do with this yeah except three weeks later he gives the lapd a pound bust in hacienda heights the arizona state cops get a trailertruck with pounds rolling up i anaheim pd pops a house for cash and prizes totaling ten mil they all deny getting anything from him but they all speak his gospel la federacion la federacion la federacion forever and ever world without end amen even the rac bogota comes to the altar shag answers the phone one day and holds it into his chest as he tells art its the big man himself straight from the front lines of the war on drugs even two months ago chris conti the rac in colombia wouldnt have touched his old friend art keller with the proverbial tenfoot pole but now even conti has apparently gotten religion art he says i ran across something i think you might be interested in you coming up here art asks or do you want me to come down there why dont we split the difference you been to costa rica lately what he means is that he doesnt want tim taylor or anyone else to know hes sitting down with art keller they meet in quepos sit in a palmfrond cabana on the beach conti comes bearing gifts he spreads a series of deposit slips out on the rough table the slips match up with the cashiercheck receipts from the bank of america in san diego that were captured in the last raid documentary proof linking the barrera organization with colombian cocaine whered you get these art asks smalltown banks in the medellin area well thanks chris you didnt get them from me of course not conti lays a grainy photograph on the table an airstrip in the jungle a bunch of guys standing around a dc with the serial numbers nvx art recognizes ramon mette right away but one of the other men rings a fainter bell middleaged he has a short military haircut and wears fatigues over highly polished black jump boots been a long time a long time vietnam operation phoenix even then sal scachi liked polished boots you thinking what im thinking conti asks well if youre thinking the man looks company youre thinking right last time i heard scachi had been a bird colonel in special forces then pulled the pin which is a company resume all the way look conti says ive heard some rumors i trade in rumors go ahead three radio towers in the jungles north of bogota conti says i cant get near the area to check it out the medellin people are easily capable of that kind of technology art says and it would explain the mystery of how the setco planes are flying under the radar three radio towers emitting vor signals could guide them out and back the medellin cartel has the technology to build them conti says but does it have the technology to make them disappear what do you mean satellite photos okay they dont show up conti says not three radio towers not two not one we can read license plates off those photos art a vor towers not going to show up and what about the planes art i get the awacs gen and they dont show up any plane flying from colombia to honduras has to go over nicaragua sandinista land and that my friend we definitely have the eye in the sky on thats no shit art thinks nicaragua is the bullseye in the reagan administrations central american scope a communist regime right in the heart of the monroe doctrine the administration was sponsoring the contra forces that surround nicaragua from honduras to the north and from right here in costa rica on the south but then the us congress passed the boland amendment banning military aid to the contras now you have a former special forces guy and ardent anticommunist theyre atheists arent they fuck em in the company of ramon mette ballasteros and a setco plane art leaves costa rica more freaked out than when he got there back in guadalajara art sends shag to the states on a mission the cowboy huddles up with every narco squad and dea office in the southwest and in his soft cowboy drawl tells them this mexican thing is for real its going to blow up and when it does you dont want to be caught with your pants down trying to explain why you didnt see it coming shit you can toe the company line in public but in private you might want to be playing ball with us because when the trumpets blow amigos were gonna remember who are the sheep and who are the goats theres nothing that the boys in washington can do about it what are they going to dotell american cops not to make drug busts on american soil the justice department wants to crucify art they suspect that hes disseminating this shit but they cant touch him even when the state department calls up screaming about irreparable damage to our relationship with an important neighbor the ags office would like to flog art keller up pennsylvania avenue then nail him to a pole on capitol hill except he hasnt done anything they can prove and they cant transfer him out of guadalajara because the media has picked up on la federacion so how would that look so they have to sit by in mounting frustration as art keller builds an empire based on pronouncements from the invisible unknowable nonexistent cid cid is kind of impersonal isnt it shag asks one day i mean for a guy whos contributing as much as he is what do you want to call him art asks deep throat suggests ernie its been done art says but he is sort of a mexican deep throat chupar ernie says lets call him source chupar blow job source chupar gives art a bank account with every other law enforcement agency on the border they deny getting anything from the guy but they all owe him owe him shit they love him the dea cant function without local cooperation and if they want that cooperation they better not fuck with art keller no art keller is fast becoming intocable except hes not its wearing him down running an op against tio while pretending that hes not leaving his family late at night keeping his activities secret keeping his past secret waiting for tio to track it back to him and then come to remind him that they have a past relationship tio to sobrino arts not eating hes not sleeping he and althea rarely make love anymore she chides him for being irritable secretive closed untouchable art thinks as he sits on the edge of his bathtub at four in the morning hes just thrown up the leftover chicken mole that althea left in the fridge for him and that he ate at threethirty no the past isnt catching up with you youre marching toward it resolutely step by step walking toward the abyss tios lying awake nights trying to figure out who the soplonthe informeris the federacion patronesabrego mendez el verdehave taken serious shots and theyre putting enormous pressure on him to do something because its obvious that the problem is right here in guadalajara because all three plazas have been hit abrego mendez el verde all insist that there must be a soplon in ms organization find him they are saying kill him do something or we will pilar talavera lies beside him breathing evenly and easily in the deep untroubled sleep of youth he looks down at her shiny black hair her long black eyelashes now closed her full upper lip moist with sweat he loves the fresh young smell of her he reaches out to the night table grabs a cigar and lights it the smoke wont wake her neither will the smell hes gotten her used to it besides he thinks nothing could wake the girl after such a session as we have had how odd to have found love at this age how odd and how wonderful she is my happiness he thinks la sonrisa de mi corazonthe smile of my heart i will make her my wife within a year a quick divorce then a quicker marriage and the church the church can be bought i will go to the cardinal himself and offer him a hospital a school an orphanage we will marry in the cathedral no the church will be no problem the problem is the soplon condenado source chupar costing me millions worse making me vulnerable i can just hear abrego now the jealous zorro viejo the old fox whispering against me m is losing it hes charging us fortunes for protection he cant deliver there is a soplon in his organization abrego wants to be patron of the federacion anyway how long before he thinks hes strong enough to act will he come at me directly or will he use one of the others no he thinks theyll all act together if i cant find the soplon it starts at christmas the kids have been bugging art to take them to see the big christmas tree in the cross of squares downtown he had hoped theyd be satisfied with the posadas the nightly parades of children who go house to house through the tlaquepaque neighborhood dressed as mary and joseph looking for a place to stay but the little processions only fired the kids up to go see the tree and the pastorelas the funny slapstick plays about the birth of christ that are performed outside the cathedral it isnt the time for funny plays art has just listened in on one of tios conversations about sixteen hundred pounds of cocaine in eight hundred boxes all brightly wrapped in christmas paper with ribbons and bows and the whole holiday nine yards thirty million dollars worth of christmas cheer at a safe house in arizona and art hasnt decided yet whom hes going to take it to but he knows hes been neglecting his family so on the saturday before christmas he takes althea the kids and the extended household of the cook josefina and the maid guadalupe shopping in the open market in the old district he has to admit that hes having a wonderful time they go christmas shopping for each other and buy little handcrafted ornaments for the tree back at the house they have a long wonderful lunch of freshly sliced carnitas and blackbean soup then sweet honied sopaipillas for dessert then cassie spots one of the fancy horsedrawn carriages enamelblack with red velvet cushions and she has to have a ride please daddy please and art negotiates a price with the driver in his bright gaucho suit and they all get under a blanket in the back and michael sits on arts lap and falls asleep to the steady clopclop of the horses hooves on the cobblestones of the plaza not cassie shes beside herself with excitement looking at the white caparisoned horses with the red plumes in their harnesses and then at the sixtyfoot tree with its bright lights and as art feels his sons deep breathing against his chest he knows that hes happier than its possible to be its dark by the time the ride ends and he gently wakes michael and hands him down to josefina and they walk through the plaza tapatia toward the cathedral where a small stage has been set up and a play is about to start then he sees adan his old cuate wears a rumpled business suit he looks tired like hes been traveling he sees art and walks into a public rest room at the edge of the plaza i need to use the bathroom art says michael do you need to go say no kid say no i went in the restaurant go see the show art says ill catch up with you adans leaning against the wall when art comes in art starts to check the stalls to make sure theyre empty but adan says i already did that and no one will be coming in long time no see arturo what do you want we know its you what are you talking about dont play games with me adan says just answer me a questionwhat do you think youre doing my job art says its nothing personal its very personal adan says when a man turns on his friends it is very fucking personal were not friends anymore my uncle is very unhappy about this art shrugs you called him tio adan says just like i do that was then art says things change that doesnt change adan says thats forever you accepted his patronage his counsel his help he made you what you are we made each other adan shakes his head so much for an appeal to loyalty or gratitude he reaches into his lapel pocket and art takes a step toward him to check him from pulling the gun easy adan says he takes out an envelope sets it on the edge of a sink thats a hundred thousand us dollars cash but if you prefer we can make deposits for you in the caymans costa rica im not for sale really whats changed art grabs him pushes him against the wall and starts to pat him down you wearing a wire adan huh you setting me up where are the fucking cameras art lets him go and starts searching the room in the top corners the stalls under the sinks he doesnt find anything he stops searching and exhausted leans against the wall a hundred thousand right now for good faith adan says another hundred for the name of your soplon then twenty a month just for doing nothing art shakes his head i told tio you wouldnt take it adan says you prefer a different kind of coin okay well give you enough marijuana busts to make you a star again thats plan a whats plan b adan walks over wraps his arms around art and holds him tightly says quietly into his ear arturo youre an ungrateful inflexible guerowannabe prick but youre still my friend and i love you so take the money or dont take the money but back off you dont know what youre fucking around with here adan leans back so hes facetoface with art their noses are practically touching as he looks him in the eyes and repeats you dont know what youre fucking around with here he steps back takes the envelope and holds it up no art shakes his head adan shrugs and puts the envelope back into his pocket arturo he says you dont even want to know about plan b then he walks out art steps to the sink runs the tap and splashes cold water on his face then he dries himself off and goes outside to meet his family theyre standing on the edge of a small crowd in front of the stage the kids hopping up and down in delight to the antics of two actors dressed as the angel gabriel and lucifer banging each other on the head with sticks fighting for the soul of the christ child when they leave the parking garage that night a ford bronco pulls off the curb and follows them the kids dont notice of coursetheyre sound asleepand neither do althea josefina and guadalupe but art keeps track of him in the rearview mirror art plays with him for a while through the traffic but the car stays with him not even trying to disguise himself art thinks so hes trying to make a point send a message when art pulls into the driveway the car passes then turns around then parks across the street a halfblock away art gets his family inside then makes an excuse about forgetting something in the car he goes out walks over to the bronco and knocks on the window when the window slides down art leans in pins the man to the seat reaches into his left lapel pocket and hauls out his wallet he tosses the wallet with the jalisco state police badge back onto the cops lap thats my family in there art says if you scare them if you frighten them if they even get the idea youre out here im going to come back take that pistola you have on your hip and shove it so far up your ass itll come out your mouth do you understand me brother im just doing my job brother then do it better but tios message has been delivered art thinks as he walks back into the houseyou dont fuck your friends after a mostly sleepless night art gets up makes himself a cup of coffee and sips at it until his family wakes up then he fixes the kids breakfast kisses althea goodbye and drives toward the office on the way he stops at a phone booth to commit professional suicidehe calls the pierce county arizona sheriffs department merry christmas he says and tells them about the eight hundred boxes of cocaine then he goes to the office and waits for a phone call of his own altheas driving back from the grocery store the next morning when a strange car starts to follow her not even being subtle about it just getting on her tail and staying there she doesnt know what to do shes afraid to drive home and get out of the car and shes afraid to go anywhere else so she heads for the dea office shes absolutely terrifiedher two kids are in car seats in the backand shes three full blocks from the office when the car forces her over and four men with guns get out the leader flashes a jalisco state police badge identification senora keller he asks her hand shakes as she fumbles for her drivers license as she does he leans through the window looks in the back and says nice children she feels stupid as she hears herself say thank you she hands him the license passport its at home youre supposed to have it on you i know but weve been here a long time and maybe youve been here too long the cop says im afraid youll have to come with me but i have my children with me i can see that senora but you must come with me althea finds herself near tears but what am i supposed to do with my children the cop excuses himself for a moment and goes back to his car althea sits trying to get herself under control for long minutes she fights off the temptation to look in the rearview mirror to see whats going on likewise fights the urge to just get out of the car with the kids and start walking finally the cop comes back leans through the window and with elaborate courtesy says in mexico we appreciate the meaning of family good afternoon art gets his phone call tim taylor phoning to say hes heard something disturbing and they need to talk about it taylors still yapping at him when the shooting starts plan b first they hear the roar of a speeding car then the cacophony of aks going off then they are all on the floor crouching behind desks art ernie and shag wait for a few minutes after the shooting stops and then go out to look at arts car the ford tauruss windows are all blown out the tires flat and a few dozen large bullet holes punched into its sides shag says i dont think youre going to get blue book on this boss the federales are there within moments if they werent here already art thinks they take him to the station where colonel vega looks at him with deep concern thank god you were not in the vehicle he says whoever could have done such a thing do you have any enemies in the city senor keller you know goddamn well who did this art snaps your boy barrera vega gives him a look of wideeyed incredulity miguel angel barrera but why would he want to do such a thing you yourself told me you are not investigating don miguel vega keeps him in the interview room for three and a half hours basically interrogating him about his investigations on the pretext of trying to determine who might have had a motive for the attack ernies halfafraid hes not coming out he parks himself in the lobby and refuses to leave until his boss comes back out those doors while ernies camped there shag drives over to the kellers house and tells althea arts fine but when art gets home althea is in their bedroom packing i got us on a flight to san diego tonight she says well stay with my parents for a while what are you talking about i was scared today art she says she tells him about the interaction with the jalisco cop about what it felt like to hear that his car had been shot up and that he was being taken to the federale station ive never been really scared before art i want out of mexico theres nothing to be scared of she looks at him like hes nuts they shot your car up art they knew i wasnt in it so when they bomb the house she says are they going to know that me and the kids arent in it they wont hurt families what is that she asks some sort of rule yes it is he says anyway its me theyre after its personal what do you mean its personal when he hasnt answered after about thirty seconds she says art what do you mean he sits her down and tells her about his prior relationship with tio and adan barrera tells her about the ambush in badiraguato the execution of six prisoners and how he kept his mouth shut about it how it helped tio form his federacion which is now flooding the streets of america with crack and how its up to him to do something about it she looks at him incredulously you have all that on your shoulders he nods you must be a pretty powerful guy art she says what were you supposed to have done back then it wasnt your fault you couldnt have known what barrera was up to i think art says maybe a part of me knew and just didnt want to admit it so you feel you have to atone for this in some way she asks by bringing the barreras down even if it costs your life something like that she gets up and goes into the bathroom it seems to him as if shes in there forever but its really only a few minutes later when she comes out goes into the closet grabs his suitcase and tosses it onto the bed come with us i cant do that this crusade of yours is more important to you than your family she asks nothing is more important to me than my family prove it she says come with us althea you want to stay here and play high noon fine she says if you want to keep your family together start packing just enough for a few days tim taylor said hed arrange to have the rest of our things packed and shipped you talked to tim taylor about this he called she says which is more than you did by the way i was in an interrogation room which is supposed to make me feel better goddamn it althie what do you want from me i want you to come with us i cant he sits on the bed his empty suitcase beside him like a piece of evidence that he doesnt love his family he does love themdeeply and profoundlybut he just cant bring himself to do what shes asking why not he asks himself is althea right do i love this crusade more than my own family dont you get it she asks this isnt about the barreras its about you its about you not being able to forgive yourself its not them youre obsessed with punishing its yourself thanks for the dimestore psychotherapy fuck you art she snaps her suitcase shut i called a taxi at least let me take you to the airport not unless youre getting on the plane its too hard on the kids he picks up her bag and carries it downstairs stands there with her bag in his hand as she and josefina exchange hugs and tears he squats down to hug cassie and michael michael doesnt really understand cassies tears are warm on arts cheek why arent you coming daddy she asks i have some work i have to do art says ill be along in just a little bit but i want you to come with us youll have so much fun with grandpa and grandma he says a horn beeps and he carries their bags outside the street is crowded with a posada the local kids dressed as joseph and mary and kings and shepherds the latter bang their staffs decked out with ribbons and flowers in time with the music of a little band that follows the procession down the street art has to hand the bags over the children to the cab driver aeropuerto art says yo se the cabbie says as the driver puts the luggage in the trunk art gets the kids into the backseat he hugs and kisses them again and keeps a smile on his face as he says goodbye althea is standing awkwardly by the front passenger door art hugs her and goes to kiss her but she turns to take it on her cheek i love you he says take care of yourself art she gets in art watches until the cabs red taillights disappear in the night then he turns and makes his way through the posada hears the singing in the background come in you holy pilgrims into this humble house it is a poor lodging but it is a gift from the heart he sees the white bronco still parked down the street and heads for it bumping into a little boy who asks the ritual question a place to stay tonight senor do you have a room for us what a place to stay no not tonight he makes it over to the bronco and knocks on the window when it slides down he grabs the cop pulls him out of the window and hits him with three straight hard rights before slamming him onto the street holding him by the shirtfront he hits him over and over again yelling i told you not to fuck with my family i told you not to fuck with my family two of the local parents pull him off he shucks himself out of their grip and starts to walk back to his house as he does he sees the cop still lying on the ground reach around and pull the pistol from his hip holster do it art says do it motherfucker the cop lowers his gun art makes his way through the shocked crowd and goes into his house he kills two strong scotches then goes to bed art spends christmas day with ernie and teresa hidalgo at their insistence and over his objections he gets there late not wanting to watch ernesto jr and hugo open their presents but he arrives with toys in his hands and the boys already crazed with overstimulation jump around screaming tio arturo tio arturo he feigns an appetite teresa has gone to great trouble to make a traditional turkey dinner traditional for him not for a hispanic household so he forces himself to down a great quantity of turkey and mashed potatoes which he really doesnt want he insists on clearing the table and its in the kitchen that ernie says to him boss ive been offered a transfer to el paso oh im going to take it okay ernie has tears in his eyes its teresa shes scared here for me for the boys you dont owe me any explanations yeah i do look i dont blame you tio has unleashed his federale dogs to harass the dea agents in guadalajara the federales have come to the office searching for guns illegal wiretapping equipment even drugs theyve stopped the agents in their cars two or three times a day on the flimsiest of pretexts and tios sicarios drive past their houses at night or park across the street wave to them in the morning when they come out to get their newspapers so art doesnt blame ernie for bugging out just because ive lost my family he thinks doesnt mean he should lose his he says i think youre doing the right thing ernie sorry boss dont be they share an awkward hug when it breaks up ernie says itll be a month or so before the new job opens up so sure well do some damage before you go art excuses himself shortly after dessert he cant stand the thought of going back to his empty house so he drives around until he finds an open bar sits on a stool and has two drinks that dont numb him enough to face going home so instead he drives to the airport sits in his car on the ridge over the airfield and watches the setco flight come in on dancer on prancer he says to himself on donner on blitzen santas sleigh coming in with goodies for all the good children we could seize enough snow to cover a minnesota winter he thinks and the snow would just keep coming we could seize enough cash to pay off the national debt and the cash would just keep rolling in as long as the mexican trampoline is still in operation it doesnt matter the coke just bounces from colombia to honduras to mexico and then into the states gets turned into crack and bounces merrily onto the street the white dc sits on the runway this coke isnt meant to be snorted by stockbrokers or starlets this coke is going to be smoked as cracksold at ten bucks a rock to the poor mostly black and hispanic this coke aint going to wall street or hollywood its going to harlem and watts to south chicago and east la to roxbury and barrio logan art sits up on the ridge and watches the federales finish loading the coke into trucks the usual setco drill he thinks smooth and intocable and hes about to go home when something new happens the federales start loading something on to the plane art watches as they lift crate after crate into the dcs cargo hold what the hell he thinks he swings his binocs around and sees tio supervising the loadin what the hell what could they be loading on to the plane he considers it on the drive home okay he thinks you have airplanes flying coke out of colombia the planes arent guided by any radio signals and they fly under the radar they stop and refuel in honduras under the protection of ramon mette whose partner is an old operation cuban expat the planes then fly to guadalajara where theyre offloaded under tios protection and distributed to one of the three cartelsgulf sonora or baja the cartels take the coke across the border to safe houses then deliver it back to the colombians at a kilo then the mexican cartels pay tio a percentage of that fee its the mexican trampoline art thinks cocaine bouncing from medellin to honduras to mexico to the states and the honduran dea office is closed mexico doesnt want to do anything about it and the dea the justice department and the state department dont want to know see no evil hear no evil and for gods sake speak no evil okay thats old news whats different whats different is twoway traffic now you have something going back the other way but what hes thinking about this as he unlocks the door and goes into his empty house and feels a gun barrel shoved into the back of his head dont turn around i wont fuckin a i wont im scared enough just feeling the gun i dont need to see it see how fucking easy it is art the man says to get to you its an american voice art thinks east coast new york he risks a look down but all he can see are the tips of the mans shoes black shined to a mirrorlike gloss i get that sal art says the subsequent moment of silence tell him hes right that was really fucking stupid art sal says he pulls the trigger art hears the dry metallic click jesus god he says his knees feel weak like water like hes going to fall down his heart is racing his body hot he feels like he cant breathe the next chamber aint empty art okay knock this shit off sal says you dont know what youre fucking with same thing adan told me art thinks same words did barrera send you he asks when you got a gun at my head you can ask the questions sal says im telling you stay away from the airport next timeand thered better not be a next time arthurwe wont be having a dialogue youll just be alive and then you wont got it yeah good sal says im going to be leaving now dont turn around and arthur yeah cerberus what nothing the man says dont turn around art doesnt turn around as he hears sal walk away he stands where he is for a full minute until he hears a car on the street pull away then he sits down and starts shaking it takes a few minutes and a heavy scotch to get it together but he tries to think it through stay away from the airport so whatever it is they were loading on that plane art thinks theyre very sensitive about it and what the hell is cerberus he looks out the window and theres another jalisco cop out there on surveillance he goes into his study and calls ernie at home i need you to bring a car over here come in the other way and park it two blocks south take a cab home he lets himself out the back way through the kitchen door then climbs over the back fence into his neighbors yard and out onto the back street he finds ernies car where its supposed to be but theres a problem ernies still in it i told you to take a cab home art says as he slides in i guess i didnt hear that part go home art says when ernie doesnt move he says look i dont want to fuck up your life too when are you going to let me in on this ernie asks as he gets out of the car when i know what im doing art says like maybe never he gets into ernies car and drives to la casa del amor what if theyre waiting for me he thinks as he makes his way over to the wall to retrieve the tape youll just be alive and then you wont click out he shakes off his fear and makes his way through the shrubbery to the wall takes a quick glance over the top and sees that tios bedroom light is on crouching by the wall he taps his earpiece into the tape recorder so he can listen live they say eavesdroppers never hear anything nice about themselves art thinks as he listens did it work tio asks i dont know sals spanish is pretty good art thinks but its definitely the same voice i think so though the guy seemed pretty scared yeah no shit art thinks let me stick a gun in your neck and see how cool you are did he know anything about cerberus i dont think so he didnt respond at all relax art thinks i dont know shit about it whatever it is then he hears tio say we cant take the chance the next exchange exchange art thinks what exchange well do el norte el norte art thinks in the states yeah art thinks do it tio fly it across the border because as soon as you do im going to reach up and grab that plane right out of the sky borrego springs california january the plane any plane really flies toward a vor signal a vor variable oscillation radio signal is kind of like the radio version of a lighthouse but instead of a beam of light it emits sound waves that register as beeps on a planes radio or a pulsing light on its instrument panel all airports even small ones have a vor but a plane full of dope isnt going to land at an airport in the united states not even a small one what its going to do is land on a private airstrip bulldozed out of a remote part of the desert the vor signals are still crucial because the pilot is going to locate the landing strip by triangulating the location between three vor signals in this case the vors at borrego springs ocotillo wells and blythe what happens is that the people on the ground are going to get on the adf radio and give him that location crossreferencing it by distance and compass pointscalled vectors in air navigationfrom the three known locations of the vors then theyre going to park at the end of that landing strip and when they see the plane theyll become their own landing tower if you will by flashing their headlights the pilot will line his plane up toward the headlights and bring down the plane with its valuable cargo for security reasons the guys on the ground arent going to give that pilot the landing location until hes in the air because once hes in the air what could happen well lots because the f in adf stands for frequency and thats what art has from listening in on tios conversations and hes tuned in on it so hes going to know the landing location just as soon as the pilot does but thats not good enougharts crew cant wait for him to land and then bust everyone because they cant get close enough without being spotted long before the plane gets there once you get out of the little town of borrego springs california the anzaborrego desert is a million acres of nothing and if you turn on so much as a flashlight its going to stand out like a spotlight and its quiet out there so a jeep sounds like an armored column youre not going to get close even if you can get there in time once you learn the location this is why art is going in a different directioninstead of trying to chase the plane down and then sneak up on it hes just going to land it at his own airstrip its outrageous his plan its so out there so totally crazed that no ones going to expect it first he needs an airstrip turns out that shag knows a rancher out there where it takes about a hundred acres to feed a single cow so shags old buddy has him a few thousand acres and yes he has a landing strip because as shag explains to art old wayne flies to ocotillo to buy his groceries and he aint kidding and as old waynes opinion of drug dealers is about the same as his opinion of the federal government hes happy to host this little ambush and even happier to keep his mouth shut about it next thing art needs is a coconspirator because the aforementioned washington dc would be somewhat less than thrilled to have the guadalajara rac conduct a stunt like this several hundred miles away from his assigned territory what art needs is someone who can make the necessary arrests and seizures get it in the press and then start to track the airplane back without any interference from the dea or the state department so thats why he has russ dantzler sitting next to him another thing art needs to do is jam the pilots adf switch him over to a new frequency and then talk him down to the party at old waynes ranch so the most important thing art needs is as old wayne might put it one big old shitload of luck adans sitting in the front of a land rover in the middle of the chingada desert with a few million dollars worth of coke in the air and his future in his hands and now the chingada radio wont work whats wrong with it he snaps again i dont know the young technician repeats fiddling with knobs dials and switches trying to get the signal back electrical storm something on the plane im trying the kid sounds scared he shouldraul takes out a and points it at the kids head try harder put that away adan snaps thats not going to help raul shrugs and tucks the pistol back into his belt but the radiogeek kids hand is shaking on the dials now this isnt the way it was supposed to go downhe was just supposed to do a little easy work for a little easy coke and now theyre threatening to blow his brains out if he cant get the plane on the adf and he cant all he can get is a led zeppelinonacid kind of guitarfeedback squeal and his hand is rattling on the dials relax adan says just get the plane in im trying the kid repeats looking like hes going to cry adan looks at raul like see what you did raul frowns especially when jimmy peaches walks over and taps on the window the fuck is going on were trying to get the plane on the radio adan says how hard is that peaches asks harder if you keep bothering us raul says go back hang in your truck everythings cool no everything isnt cool peaches thinks as he walks back to the truck first thing that isnt cool is im out here playing lawrence of arabia in east bumfuck second thing is im sitting in a truck chockfulla felony third thing is i got major nonreturnable investment in the truck that i leveraged with other peoples money fourth thing is them other people is johnny boy cozzo johnnys brother gene and sal scachi none of which is exactly known for his forgiving nature which brings me to the fifth thing which is that if big paulie ever gets wind were dealing dope hes gonna have us whackedthe us starting with mewhich leads me to the sixth thing which is that all the coke is now in an airplane somewhere in the sky and these beaners cant seem to find it now they cant find the fucking plane he says to little peaches as he climbs back into the truck what do you mean little peaches asks which word didnt you fucking understand irritable fucking a im irritable drive all the way out to california with a truck full of guns and not just a few pistols but major freaking weaponryms ars ammo they even got a couple of laws back there and what the fucking mexicans need rocket launchers for ill never know but that was the dealthe beaners wanted to get paid in weapons this time so i get the money from the cozzos and sal add a little secret surcharge to cover my end and haul ass all over the east coast hustling up this freaking arsenal then i drive it all the way across the country shitting my pants every time i see a state trooper because i got life in lewisburg in the back peaches is also irritable because things in the cimino family aint going so well first of all big paulie has his panties in a wad about the commission case what with new york eastern district da giuliani threatening to lay about a century each on the heads of the other four families so paulie aint letting them do nothing to earn a living no robberies no hits and of course no dope and when they kick it up the chain that theyre fucking starving here the answer comes back down that they should have invested their money they should have legitimate businesses to fall back on which is bullshit peaches thinks all the fucking hoops you gotta jump through to get madefor what sell shoes fuck that fucking paulie is such a fucking woman peaches has even started calling him the godmother just the other day on the phone him and little peaches were talking about it hey peaches says you know that maid the godmother is pronging you ready for this i hear hes got this pumpup dick he uses how does that work little peaches asks nothin i want to think about peaches says i guess its like a flat tire and you pump it up to get it hard hes got what like an inner tube in his dick i guess so peaches says anyway its wrong what hes doing tappin the maid right there in the house where his wife is living its disrespectful thank god carlo aint alive to see it if carlo was alive thered be

fucking chauffeur im telling you it better be john little peaches says anyway we cant take no chances on this shipment we gotta get it and put it out on the street and get some fuckin money in here i hear that callans thinking pretty much the same thing as he sits in the back of the truck in the middle of a cold desert night wishes he had more than just his old leather jacket who knew obop says to him that it would be cold in the fucking desert whats going on callan asks he doesnt like this shit doesnt like being out of new york doesnt like being out in the middle of nowhere doesnt even like what theyre doing here he sees whats going on in the streets what crack is doing to the neighborhood to the whole city he feels badits not a right way to make a living the union shit is one thing the construction shit the loansharking the gamblingeven the contractsbut he dont really like helping peaches put crack on the street what are we gonna do obop had said when it came up say no yeah this thing fucks up its our ass too i know so here they are sitting in the back of a truck on top of enough weaponry to take a small banana republic waiting for the plane to come down so they can make the exchange and go home unless the mexicans get cute in which case callan has ten rounds in the clip and another in the chamber you got an arsenal in here obop asks what you want with a its enough fuck yes it is obop thinks remembering eddie friel fuck yes it is find out whats going on callan says obop bangs on the wall whats going on they cant find the fucking plane youre kidding yeah im kidding peaches yells back the plane landed we made the switch and were all sitting at roccos eating linguini with clam sauce how do you lose a whole airplane callan asks theres nothing out here thats the problem the pilot is eight thousand feet over the desert looking at nothing but dark down there he can find borrego springs he can find ocotillo wells or blythe but unless someone gets on the horn and gives him the landing location he has as much chance of finding that airstrip as he does of seeing the cubs win the world series zip its a problem because he has only so much fuel and pretty soon hes going to have to think about turning around and flying back to el salvador he tries the radio again and gets the same metallic squeal then he turns it up one halffrequency and hears come in come in where the hell you been the pilot asks youre on the wrong frequency says you art thinks saint anthony is the patron saint of hopeless causes and art makes a mental note to thank him with a candle and a twentydollar bill as shag says into the radio mike you want to bitch or you want to land i want to land the small knot of men huddled around the radio on this freezing night look at one another and flatout grin it warms them up considerably because theyre within moments of landing literally a setco flight full of cocaine unless it all goes sick and wrong as it very well could shag doesnt care my careers fucked anyway he gives the pilot the landing coordinates ten minutes the pilot says i copy out ten minutes art says a long ten minutes says dantzler a lot can happen in ten minutes in ten minutes the pilot might get hinky change his mind and turn the plane around in ten minutes the real airstrip might break through dantzlers radio jam and make contact with the plane guiding it to the correct location in ten minutes art thinks there could be an earthquake that sends a crack down the middle of this airstrip and swallows us all in ten minutes he lets out a long sigh no shit dantzler says shag smiles at him adan barrera isnt smiling his stomach is churning his jaw is clamped tight this is the deal that cant be allowed to go wrong tio had warned him this one has to happen for a lot of reasons adan thinks hes a married man now he and lucia were married in guadalajara with father juan performing the ceremony himself it had been a wonderful day and a more wonderful night after years of frustration finally getting inside lucia she had been a surprise in bed a morethanwilling partner enthusiastically wriggling and writhing calling his name her blond hair splayed on the pillow in unconscious symmetry with her open legs so married life is great but with marriage comes responsibility especially now that lucia is pregnant that adan thinks as he sits out in the desert changes everything now youre playing for keeps now youre about to be a papa with a family to support their future in your hands hes not unhappy about thison the contrary hes thrilled hes excited to be taking on a mans responsibility delighted beyond measure by the thought of having a childbut it means that more than ever this deal cannot be allowed to go wrong try another frequency he tells the technician ive tried every he sees raul touch the butt of the pistol in his belt ill try them again he says even though hes now convinced its not the frequency its the equipment the radio itself who knows what might have gotten jarred loose bouncing around out here people are always the same he thinks they have millions of dollars of coke floating around somewhere up there but they arent willing to spend an extra couple hundred bucks on a radio to bring it in instead i have to work with this cheap shit he doesnt offer this critique to his employers though he just keeps twirling the knobs adan stares up into the night sky the stars seem so low and so bright he feels like he can almost reach up and pull one down he wishes he could do the same thing with the airplane so does art because theres nothing up there nothing but the stars and a sliver of moon he checks his watch heads turn as if hes pulled a gun its been ten minutes youve had your ten minutes he thinks youve had your endless nerverattling stomachturning heartpounding ten minutes so stop playing with us stop the torture he looks into the sky again its what theyre all doing standing in the cold staring at the sky like some prehistoric tribe trying to figure out what it all means its over art says a minute later he must have figured it out shiiit says shag sorry art dantzler says sorry boss its all right art says we gave it a shot but it isnt all right they probably wont ever get another chance to land physical proof that the mexican trampoline is real and theyll close the guadalajara office and bust us up and that will be it well give it another five minutes and then shut up shag says they all stare at himits uncharacteristically brusque of the cowboy listen he says then they can just make it out the sound of an engine an airplane engine shag sprints to the truck fires up the engine and blinks the lights the planes running lights blink back in two minutes art watches the plane come down from the blackness and land smoothly the pilot breathes a sigh of relief as he sees a man trot over then the man sticks a gun in his face surprise asshole russ dantzler says you have the right to remain silent silent the guy is motherfucking speechless shag isnt hes in the car with art doing a cowboy bundini brown you are the greatest boss you have the arms of an orangutan you are king kong you reach into the sky and pull down airplanes art laughs then he sees dantzler walk over to the car the san diego narc is shaking his head and even in the faint light looks pale shaken art dantzler begins the guy the pilot he says what that hes working for us art opens the door to where they have the pilot sitting in the back phil hansen should be a very nervous guy but he isnt hes leaning back as if hes waiting out a traffic ticket thats going to get fixed anyway art would like to slap the smirk off his face long time no see keller he says casually like this is all one big joke what the hell is this about you working for us hansen looks at him serenely cerberus what cmon cerberus ilopongo hangar four what the fuck are you talking about the smile fades from hansens face now he looks alarmed you thought what you got a pass art asks you fly a couple hundred ks of coke into the united states and you think you get a pass what makes you think that asshole they said you were they said i was what nothing hansen turns his head and looks out the window art says if you have a get out of jail free card now is the time to lay it down give me a name phil who do i call you know who to call no i dont tell me im done here he stares out the window someone fucked you phil art says i dont know who told you what but if you think were playing for the same team youre mistaken we got you carrying thirtytolife weight phil youre going to do fifteen minimum but its not too late to get on the right side of this cooperate with me and if it works out ill see that you get a deal when hansen turns back to him there are tears in his eyes he says i have a wife and kids in honduras ramon mette art thinks the guy is scared shitless that mette will retaliate against his family tough shityou should have thought of that before you started flying coke around you want to see them before they have kids of their own talk to me arts seen the look beforehe calls it the skell scale the guilty guy weighing his options realizing to his horror that there is no good option just a less bad one he waits for hansen to work it out hansen shakes his head art slams the car door and walks out into the desert for a minute he could bust the plane now but what good would it do it would prove that setco is flying drugs but he already knows that and it wouldnt tell him whats going back as cargo on the return trip and to whom no its time to take another big chance he walks back over to dantzler lets play this one different let the plane go through what then we can track it three ways art says see where the coke goes see where the money goes see whats on the plane going back dantzler gets on board with it what the hell is he going to do its art fucking keller asking art nods and gets back into the car just testing he tells hansen you passed get going art watches the plane take off again then he gets on the radio to tell ernie to expect the return setco flight to photograph it and let it go but ernie doesnt answer ernie hidalgo has gone off the radar chapter five narcosantos there are two things the american people dont want another cuba on the mainland of central america and another vietnam ronald reagan mexico january six hours after ernie goes off the screen art storms into colonel vegas office one of my men is missing he says i want this city turned upside down and inside out i want you to arrest miguel angel barrera and i dont want to hear any of your shit senor keller your shit about not knowing where he is and anyways hes innocent i want you to pick up all of thembarrera his nephews abrego mendez every goddamn one of the drugpushing cocksuckersand i you dont know that hes been kidnapped vega says he might be having an affair he might be drunk somewhere you certainly dont know that barrera has anything to do with art comes across the mans desk right in the colonels face if i have to art says ill start a fucking war he means it hell call in every favor threaten to go to the press go there threaten to go to certain congressmen go to themhell bring a division of marines down fromcamppendleton and start a real goddamn shooting war if thats what it takes to rescue ernie hidalgo ifplease god please jesus and mary the mother of godernies still alive a second later he adds now why are you still sitting there they hit the streets all of a sudden like magic vega knows where the gomeros are its a miracle art thinks vega knows where every low and middlelevel narcotraficante in the city lives hangs out or does business they roust them allvegas federales bust through the city like the gestapo only they dont find miguel angel or adan or raul or mendez or abrego its the same old dye test art thinks the same old searchandavoid mission they know where these guys were they just cant seem to find where they are vega even leads a raid on barreras condominium the address of which he suddenly acknowledges but when they get there they find that miguel angel is gone they also find something else that makes art go absolutely berserk a photograph of ernie hidalgo an id photo taken in the guadalajara mjfp office art grabs it and waves it in vegas face look at this he yells did your guys give him this picture did your fucking guys do that certainly not my ass art says he goes back to the office and calls tim taylor inmexico city i heardtaylor says so what are you doing ive been at the ambassadors officetaylor says hes going to see the president personally did you get teresa and the kids out she didnt want to go but shit arthur but i had shag take her to the airport art says they should be insan diego now what about shag hes working the streets im pulling you guys out the hell you are art says theres a brief silence thentaylor asks what do you need art an honest cop art says he tellstaylor about the photo he found in barreras condo then says i dont want any more of these mjfp assholes send me someone clean someone with some weight antonio ramos arrives inguadalajara that afternoon adan listens to the man scream and to the quiet voice patiently asking the same question over and over again who is chupar who is chupar who is chupar ernie tells them again that he doesnt know his interrogator doesnt believe him and pushes the ice pick in again scraping it against ernies shinbone the question starts again you do know tell us who he is who is source chupar ernie gives them names any names he can think of minor dealers major dealers federales jalisco state policeany gomero or dirty cop he doesnt care anything to make them stop they dont they dont buy a single name he gives them the doctorthe others actually call the man doctorjust keeps it up with the ice pick slowly patiently meticulously unshaken by ernies shouts unhurried who is chupar who is chupar who is chupar i dont knoooooowwww the ice pick finds a new angle to a fresh piece of bone and scrapes guero mendez comes out of the room shaken i dont think he knows guero says he knows raul says hes machoa tough son of a bitch lets hope hes not too tough adan thinks if hell just give us the name of the soplon we can let him go before all this gets too far out of hand i know the americans adan had told his uncle better than you do they can bomb burn and poison other peoples but let one of their own be harmed and theyll react with selfrighteous savagery hours after the agent was reported missing an army of dea agents busted adans safe house in rancho santa fe it was the biggest drug bust in history two thousand pounds of cocaine worth million two tons of sinsemilla worth another million plus another million in cash plus moneycounting machines scales and other miscellaneous office equipment of the drug trade not to mention fifteen illegal mexican workers who were employed in weighing and packaging the coke but it cost far more than that adan thinks as he tries to shut out the moans of pain coming from the other room it cost far more than that drugs and money you can always replace but a child a lymphatic malformation the doctors had called it cystic lymphangioma they said it had nothing to do with the stress of their sudden flight from their home insan diego steps ahead of the dea nothing to do with the jostling of the highspeed run across the border intotijuana nothing to do with the flight toguadalajara the doctors said the condition develops in the early months of pregnancy not late and they dont really know what causes it only that somehow adan and lucias daughters lymph channels failed to develop properly and because of that her face and neck are deformed distorted and there is no treatment or cure and while the lifespan is usually normal there are risks of infection or stroke sometimes difficulty with breathing lucia blames him not him directly but their lifestyle the business the pista secreta if they had been able to stay in the states with the excellent prenatal care if perhaps the baby had been born at scripps clinic as planned if perhaps in those first moments when they saw that something was terribly wrong if theyd had access to the best doctors in the world perhaps just perhaps even though the doctors in guadalajara assured her it wouldnt have made any difference lucia wanted to go back to the states to have the baby but she wouldnt go without him and he couldnt go there was a warrant out for him and tio forbade it but if i had known he thinks now if id had the slightest thought that anything might have been wrong with the baby i would have taken the chance and with it the consequences goddamn the americans and goddamn art keller adan had called father juan in those first few terrible hours lucia was in agony they all were and father juan had hurried to the hospital right away came and held the baby baptized her on the spot just in case and then held lucias hand and talked with her prayed with her told her that she would be a wonderful mother to a special wonderful child who would need her then when lucia finally yielded to the tranquilizers and fell asleep father juan and adan went out to the parking lot so the bishop could smoke a cigarette tell me what youre thinking father juan said that god is punishing me god doesnt punish innocent children for the sins of their fathers parada answered the bible he thought notwithstanding then explain this to me adan said is this the way god loves children do you love your child despite her condition of course then god loves through you thats not a good enough answer its the only one i have and its not good enough adan thought and thinks it now and thishidalgo kidnapping is going to destroy us all if it hasnt already grabbinghidalgo had been the easy part christ the police had done it for them three cops pickedhidalgo up in la plaza de armas and delivered him to raul and guero who drugged him blindfolded him and brought him here to this house where the doctor had revived him and started his ministrations which so far have produced no results he hears the doctors soft patient voice from inside the room tell me the names the doctor says of the government officials who are on miguel angel barreras payroll i dont have any names did chupar give you those names you said that he did tell them to me i was lying making it up i dont know then tell me the name of chupar the doctor says so we can ask him instead of you so we can do this to him instead of you i dont know who he is is it possible adan wonders that the man really doesnt know he hears echoes of his own scared voice eight years ago during operation condor when the dea and the federales beat and tortured him for information that he didnt have told him that they had to be sure that he didnt know so kept up the torture after he told them again and again i dont know christ he says what if he doesnt know what if he doesnt raul shrugs the fucking americans need to be taught a lesson anyway adan hears the lesson being conducted in the other room hidalgos moans as the metal of the ice pick grinds against his shinbone and the doctors gently insistent voice you want to see your wife again your children surely you owe them more than you owe this informant think why have we blindfolded you if we intended to kill you we wouldnt have bothered but we intend to let you go back to your family to teresa and ernesto and hugo think of them how worried they are how scared your little sons must be how they want their papa back you dont want them to have to grow up without a father do you who is chupar what did he tell you whose names did he give you and hidalgos response punctuated by sobs i dont know who he is pues it starts again antonio ramos grew up on the garbage dumps of tijuana literally he lived in a shack outside the dump and picked through garbage for his meals clothes even his shelter when they built a school nearby ramos went every day and if some other kid teased him for smelling like garbage ramos beat the kid up ramos was a big kidskinny from lack of food but tall and with quick hands after a while he wasnt teased he made it all the way through high school and when the tijuana police accepted him it was like going to heaven good pay good food clean clothes he lost that skinny look and filled out and his superiors found out something new about him they knew he was tough they didnt know he was smart the dfs mexicos intelligence service found it out too and recruited him now if theres an important assignment that requires smart and tough ramos usually gets the call he gets the call to bring back this american dea agent hidalgo at all or any cost art meets him at the airport ramos nose and several knuckles are crooked and broken he has thick black hair a shock of which hangs over his forehead despite his occasional attempts to control it jammed into his mouth is his trademark black cigar every cop needs a trademark he tells his men what you want the bad boys saying is look out for the macho with the black cigar they do they say it and they watch out and theyre scared of him because ramos has a wellearned reputation for his own brand of rough justice guys rousted by ramos have been known to yell for the police the police wont comethey dont want any of ramos either theres an alley near avenida revolucion in tj nicknamed la universidad de ramos its littered with cigar stubs and snuffedout bad attitudes and its where ramos when he was a tj street cop taught lessons to the boys who thought they were bad youre not bad he told them im bad then he showed them what bad was if they needed a reminder they could usually find one in the mirror for years afterward six bad hombres have tried to kill ramos ramos went to all six funerals just in case any of the bereaved wanted to take a shot at revenge none of them did he calls his uzi mi esposamy wife hes thirtytwo years old within hours he has in custody the three policemen who picked up ernie hidalgo one of them is the chief of the jalisco state police ramos tells art we can do this the fast way or the slow way ramos takes two cigars from his shirt pocket offers one to art and shrugs when he refuses it he takes a long time to light the cigar rolling it so that the tip lights evenly then takes a long pull and raises his black eyebrows at art the theologians are right art thinkswe become what we hate then he says the fast way ramos says come back in a little while no art says ill do my part thats a mans answer ramos says but i dont want a witness ramos leads the jalisco police chief and two federales into a basement cell i dont have time to fuck around with you guys ramos says heres the problem right now youre more afraid of miguel angel barrera than you are of me we need to turn that around please the chief says we are all policemen no im a policeman ramos says slipping on black weighted gloves the man you kidnapped is a policeman youre a piece of shit he holds the gloves up for them all to see i dont like to bruise my hands ramos says the chief says surely we can work something out no ramos says we cant he turns to the bigger younger federale put your hands up defend yourself the federales eyes are wide scared he shakes his head doesnt raise his hands ramos shrugs as you wish he feints with a right to the face and then puts all his weight behind three ripping left hooks to the ribs the weighted gloves smash bone and cartilage the cop starts to fall but ramos holds him up with his left hand and hits him with three more shots with his right then he throws him against the wall turns him around and drives rights and lefts into his kidneys holds him against the wall by the back of the neck as he says you embarrassed your country worse you embarrassed my country and holds him with one hand by the neck and the other by the belt and runs him full speed across the room into the opposite wall the federales head hits the concrete with a dull thud his neck snaps back ramos repeats the process several times before he finally lets the man slide to the floor ramos sits down on a wooden threelegged stool and lights his cigar as the two other cops stare at their unconscious friend who lies facedown his legs jerking spasmodically the walls are splotched with blood now ramos says youre more afraid of me than of barrera so we can get started where is the american policeman they tell him everything they know they delivered him to guero mendez and raul barrera ramos tells art and a doctor alvarez which is why i think your friend might still be alive why is that alvarez used to work for dfs ramos says as an interrogator hidalgo must have information they want si no art says he doesnt have the information arts stomach sinks theyre torturing ernie for the identity of chupar and there is no chupar tell me tio says ernie moans i dont know tio nods to doctor alvarez the doctor uses oven mitts to pick up a whitehot iron rod which he inserts oh my god ernie shouts then his eyes widen and his head collapses on the table where they have strapped him down his eyes are closed hes unconscious and his heartbeat which was racing a moment ago is now dangerously slow the doctor sets down the oven mitts and grabs a syringe full of lidocaine which he injects into ernies arm the drug will keep him conscious to feel the pain it will keep his heart from stopping a moment later the americans head snaps up and his eyes pop open we wont let you die tio says now talk to me tell me who is chupar i know arts looking for me ernie thinks moving heaven and earth i dont know he gasps who chupar is the doctor picks up the iron bar again a moment later ernie shouts oh my godddddddd art watches the flame ignite then flicker then reach up toward heaven he kneels in front of the bank of votive candles and says a prayer for ernie to the virgin mary to saint anthony to christ himself a tall fat man comes down the center aisle of the cathedral father juan the priest has changed little in nine years his white hair is a little thinner his stomach somewhat thicker but the intense gray eyes still have their light youre praying parada says i thought you didnt believe in god ill do anything parada nods how can i help you know the barreras i baptized them parada answers gave them their first communion confirmed them married adan to his wife parada thinks held their malformed beautiful baby in my arms reach out to them art is saying i dont know where they are i was thinking of radio art says television they respect you theyll listen to you i dont know parada says certainly i can try right now of course parada says then adds i can hear your confession there isnt time so they drive to the radio station and parada broadcasts his message to those who have kidnapped the american policeman pleads with them in the name of god the father and jesus christ and mother mary and all the saints to release the man unharmed urges them to consult their souls and then to even arts surprise pulls the ultimate cardthreatens excommunication if they harm the man condemns them with all his power and authority to eternal hell then repeats the hope of salvation release the man and come back to god his freedom is your freedom gave me an address ramos is saying what art asks hes been listening to paradas broadcast on the office radio i said they gave me an address ramos says he loops the uzi over his shoulder mi esposa lets go the house is in a nondescript suburb ramos two ford broncos overflowing with his special dfs troops roar up and the men jump out gunfirelong undisciplined ak burstscomes out of the windows ramos men drop to the ground and return the fire in short bursts the shooting stops covered by his men ramos and two others run to the door with a battering ram and knock it in art goes in just behind ramos he doesnt see ernie he runs to every room of the small house but all he finds are two dead gomeros a neat hole in each forehead lying by the windows a wounded man sits propped against the wall another sits with his hands high above his head ramos pulls his pistol and puts it to the head of the wounded man donde ramos asks where no se art flinches as ramos pulls the trigger and the mans brains splatter against the wall jesus art shouts ramos doesnt hear this he puts the pistol against the other gomeros temple donde sinaloa donde un rancho de guero mendez como lo encuentro the gomero shouts no seno seno sepor favorpor el amor de dios art grabs ramos by the wrist no ramos looks for a second like he might shoot art then he lowers his pistol and says we have to find that farm before they move him again you should let me shoot this bastard so he doesnt talk the gomero breaks down into sobs por el amor de dios you have no god you motherless fuck ramos says cuffing him along the side of the head te voy a mandar pal carajo im going to send you to hell no art says if the federales find out we know about sinaloa ramos says theyll just move hidalgo again before we can find him if we can find him art thinks sinaloa is a large rural state locating a single farm there is like finding a specific farm in iowa but killing this guy wont help put him in isolation art says ay diosque chingon que eres ramos yells god youre a pain in the ass but ramos orders one of his men to take the gomero and keep him somewhere and find out what else he knows and says for gods sake dont let him talk to anyone or it will be your balls i stuff in his mouth then ramos looks at the bodies on the floor and throw out the garbage he says adan barrera hears paradas radio message the bishops familiar voice comes softly over the background chords of hidalgos rhythmic moans then thunders the threat of excommunication superstitious shit guero says this was a mistake adan says a blunder an enormous miscalculation the americans have reacted even more extremely than he had feared bringing all their enormous economic and political pressure to bear on mexico city the fucking americans closed the border leaving thousands of trucks stranded on the road their loads of produce rotting in the sun the economic cost staggering and the americans are threatening to call in loans screwing mexico with the imf launching a debt and currency crisis that could literally destroy the peso so even our boughtandpaidfor friends in mexico city are turning against us and why not the mjfp and dfs and the army are responding to the americans threats rounding up every cartel member they can find raiding houses and ranches theres rumor that a dfs colonel beat a suspect to death and shot three others so theres four mexican lives already lost for this one american but no one seems to care because theyre only mexicans so the kidnapping was an enormous mistake compounded by the fact that for all the cost they havent even learned the identity of chupar the american clearly doesnt know he would have told he could not have stood the bonetickling the electrodes the iron bar if hed known he would have told and now he lies moaning in the bedroom that has become a torture chamber and even the doctor has thrown his hands up and said he cannot get anything more and the yanquis and their lambiosos are tracking me down and even my old priest is sending me to hell release the man and come back to god his freedom is your freedom perhaps adan thinks you might be right ernie hidalgo exists now in a bipolar world there is pain and there is the absence of pain and that is all there is if life means pain its bad if death mean the absence of pain its good he tries to die they keep him alive with saline drips he tries to sleep they keep him awake with injections of lidocaine they monitor his heart his pulse his temperature careful not to let him die and end the pain always with the same questions who is chupar what did he tell you whose names did he give you who in the government who is chupar always the same answers i dont know he didnt tell me anything i havent told you nobody i dont know followed by more pain then careful nursing then more pain then a new question out of the blue a new question and a new word what is cerberus have you heard of cerberus did chupar ever talk to you about cerberus what did he tell you i dont know no i havent no he didnt he didnt tell me anything i swear to god i swear to god i swear to god what about art did he ever talk to you about cerberus did he ever mention cerberus did you ever overhear him talking to anyone about cerberus cerberus cerberus cerberus you know the word then no i swear to god i swear to god god help me god help me please god help me the doctor leaves the room leaves him alone with his pain leaves him wondering where is god where is arthur where are jesus mother mary and the holy ghost mary bring me mercy mercy comes oddly enough in the form of the doctor its raul who suggests it shit that moaning is driving me fucking crazy he says to the doctor cant you shut him up i could give him something give him something adan says the moans are bothering him too and if theyre planning to release him as he wants to do it would be better to deliver him in the best shape possible which isnt very good but is better than dead and adan has an idea how to give the cop back and get what they want in return reach out again to arturo heroin the doctor asks youre the doctor raul says heroin adan thinks homegrown mexican mud the irony is deft fix him up he tells the doctor ernie feels the needle go into his arm the familiar prick and burn then something differentblessed relief the absence of pain maybe not absence say detachment as if hes floating on a cumulus cloud high above the pain the observed and the observer the pain is still there but its distant eloi eloi thank you mother mary mexican mud mmmmmmm arts in the office with ramos poring over maps of sinaloa and comparing them with intelligence reports on marijuana fields and guero mendez trying to somehow narrow down the grid on television an official from the mexican attorney generals office is solemnly pronouncing in mexico the category of major drug gang does not exist he could work for us art says maybe the category of major drug gang doesnt exist in mexico art thinks but it sure as hell does in the united states the second they got the news about ernies disappearance dantzler busted the cocaine shipment in two directions his sweep just missed adan at his safe house in san diego but the bust was epic on the east coast he hit pay dirt again arresting one jimmy big peaches piccone a capo in the cimino family the fbi in new york passed along every surveillance photo of the crew they had and arts looking through them when he sees something that freezes his balls the photo is obviously taken outside some wiseguy hangout and theres fat jimmy piccone and his equally obese little brother and a few other goombahs and then theres someone else standing there sal scachi art gets on the phone to dantzler yeah thats salvatore scachi dantzler tells him a made man in the cimino family in the piccone crew apparently scachi isnt in a crew dantzler says hes sort of a wise guy without a portfolio he reports directly to calabrese

of us art i see one cop your man is dead in the background along with ernies groans he hears something that gives him if possible worse chills what do you know about cerberus art kneels in the confessional the screen slides back art cant make out the face behind the screen which he supposes is the point of this sacrilegious charade we warned you and warned you and warned you adan says and you wouldnt listen is he alive hes alive adan says now its up to you to keep him alive if he dies ill find you and kill you who is chupar arts already thought this throughif he tells adan that there

go you will both be out of mexico on the next flight and art dont you ever come back the window slides shut the waves rise ominously then break and crash on his body waves of pain larger with each set ernie wants more drugs he hears the door open are they coming with more drugs or more pain guero looks down at the american cop the dozens of puncture wounds where the ice pick was inserted are pussy and infected his face is bruised and swollen from the beatings his wrists feet and genitals are burned from the electrodes his ass the stench is horrendousthe infected wounds the piss the shit the rancid sweat clean him adan had ordered and who is adan barrera to give orders when i was killing men he was selling blue jeans to teenyboppers and now he comes back having made a dealwithout ms knowledge or permissionto release this man in exchange for what empty promises from another american cop who is going to do what guero wonders after he sees his tortured mutilated comrade who is adan kidding hidalgo will be lucky to survive the car ride even so he will probably lose his legs maybe his arms what kind of peace does adan think he will buy with this bleeding stinking rotting piece of flesh he squats beside hidalgo and says were going to take you home home si guero says you can go home now go to sleep when you wake up you will be home he sticks the needle into ernies vein and pushes the plunger the mexican mud takes only a second to hit ernies body jerks and his legs kick back they say that a jolt of heroin is like kissing god art looks at ernies naked corpse lying fetal inside a sheet of black plastic in a ditch off a dirt road in badiraguato his dried blood is caked flat black against the shiny black plastic the black blindfold is still around his eyes otherwise hes naked and art can see the open wounds where they jammed an ice pick through his flesh and scraped his bones the electrode burns the signs of anal rape the needle marks from the lidocaine and heroin injections up and down his arms what have i done art asks himself why did someone else have to pay for my obsession im sorry ernie im so goddamn sorry and ill pay them back for you so help me god there are copsfederales and sinaloa state policeeverywhere the state police arrived first and effectively trampled the scene obscuring tire prints footprints fingerprints any evidence that might tie anyone to the murder now the federales have assumed control and are going over everything again making sure that not a shred of evidence has been neglected the comandante comes over to art and says dont worry senor we will never rest until we find out who did this terrible thing we know who did it art answers miguel angel barrera shag wallace loses it goddamnit three of your fucking guys kidnapped him art pulls him away hes holding him up against the car when a jeep comes roaring up and ramos hops out and trots over to art ramos says we found him who barrera says ramos we have to go now where is he el salvador how did apparently ms little girlfriend is homesick ramos says she called mommy and daddy el salvador february el salvador the savior is a little country about the size of massachusetts located on the pacific coast of the central american isthmus its not art knows a banana republic like its eastern neighbor honduras but a coffee republic whose workers have such a reputation for industriousness that they were nicknamed the germans of central america the hard work hasnt done them much good the socalled forty families about percent of the current population of three and a half million have always owned almost all the fertile land mostly in the form of large coffee fincasplantations the more land that was devoted to growing coffee meant less land devoted to growing food and by the midnineteenth century most of the hardworking salvadoran campesinos were basically starving art looks at the green countryside it looks so peacefulpretty reallyfrom the air but he knows that its a killing ground the serious slaughter started in the s as campesinos started to flock into the flmn the marti national liberation front or into workers unions while students and priests led the movement for labor and land reform the forty families responded by forming a rightwing militia called ordenthe spanish acronym means orderand the order they had in mind was the same old order orden most of its members activeduty salvadoran army officers got right to work campesinos workers students and priests started disappearing their bodies finally turning up on roadsides or their heads left in school playgrounds as a civics lesson the united states pursuing its cold war agenda pitched in many of the orden officers were trained at the us school of the americas to hunt down flmn guerrillas and farmers students and priests the salvadoran army had the help of americandonated bell helicopters c transport planes m rifles and m machine guns they killed a lot of the guerrillas but also hundreds of students teachers farmers factory workers and priests nor were the flmn exactly angels art thinks they committed their own murders and funded themselves through kidnappings but their efforts paled in comparison to the wellorganized amply funded salvadoran army and its orden doppelganger seventyfive thousand deaths art thinks as his plane lands in a country that has become its own mass grave a million refugees another million homeless out of a population of only five and a half million the sheraton lobby is gleaming and clean the welldressed and the wellheeled relax in its airconditioned lounge or sit in the cool dark bar everyone is so clean and so nicely dressedin cool linens and the white dresses and jackets of the tropics its all so nice in here art thinks and so american there are americans everywhere drinking beer at the bar sipping cokes in the coffee shop and most of them are military advisers theyre in civvies but the military look is unmistakablethe short sidewall haircuts the shortsleeved polo shirts the jeans over tennis shoes or highly polished brown armyissue ever since the sandinistas took over nicaragua just to the south el salvador has become an american military ghetto ostensibly the americans are there to advise the salvadoran army in their war against the flmn guerrillas but theyre also there to make sure that el salvador doesnt become the next domino to topple in central america so you have american soldiers advising the salvadorans and american soldiers advising the contras and then you have the spooks the company types are as obvious in their own way as the offduty soldiers are in theirs they dress better for one thingthey wear tailored suits with open shirts and no ties instead of sports clothes that came off the rack at the base commissary their haircuts are stylisheven a little long in the current latin american fashionand their shoes are expensive churchills and bancrofts if you see a spook wearing tennis shoes art thinks hes playing tennis so there are the soldiers and the spooks and then there are the embassy typeswho might be neither either or both there are the actual diplomats and the consular officials who deal with the daily mundane issues of visas and lost passports and american retrohippie kids arrested for vagrancy andor drug use then there are the cultural attaches and the secretaries and the typists and then there are the military attaches who look just like the military advisers except that they dress better and then there are the embassy employees who wear fictional job descriptions as transparent veils of decency and who are really spooks they sit in the embassy and monitor radio broadcasts out of managua their ears keenly pitched for the sound of a cuban accent or better yet russian or they work the street as they say meeting their sources in exactly such places as the sheraton bar trying to suss out which colonel is on the way up which is on the way out which might be planning the next golpecoupand whether this would be a good thing or a bad thing so you have your soldiers your spooks your embassy types and your embassy spooks and then you have your businessmen coffee buyers cotton buyers sugar buyers the coffee buyers look like they belong they should art thinks their families have been down here for generations they have the easy air of ownership of the placethis is their bar theirs and the salvadoran growers with whom theyre having lunch on the broad patio the cotton and sugar buyers look more classically american corporatethese are more recent crops on the salvadoran landscapeand the american buyers have yet to blend in they look uncomfortable incomplete without ties so you have a lot of americans and you have a lot of wealthy salvadorans and the only other salvadorans you see are either hotel workers or secret police secret police art thinks now theres an oxymoron the only thing secret about the secret police is how they manage to stand out so much art stands in the lobby and picks them out like bulbs on a christmas tree its simpletheir cheap suits are bad imitations of the expensive tailored look of the upper class and while they try to look like businessmen they still have the brown weathered faces of campesinos no ladino from the forty families is going to enroll in the ranks of the police secret or otherwise so these guys assigned to monitor the comings and goings at the sheraton still look like farmers attending a city cousins wedding but art knows the role of the secret police in a society like this isnt to blend in but to be seen to be noticed to let everyone know that big brother is watching and taking notes ramos finds the cop hes looking for they repair to a room and start the negotiations an hour later he and art are on their way to the compound where tio is holed up with his lolita the drive out of san salvador is long frightening and sad el salvador has the highest population density in central america growing every day and art sees the evidence everywhere little shanty villages seem to occupy every wide spot in the roadjerryrigged stalls made of cardboard corrugated tin plywood or just plain chopped brush offer everything for sale to people who have little or nothing with which to buy their owners rush the jeep when they see the gringo in the front seat the kids push up against the jeep asking for food money anything art keeps driving he has to get to the compound before tio disappears again people disappear in el salvador all the time sometimes at the rate of a couple hundred a week snatched by rightwing death squads and then theyre just gone and if anyone asks too many questions about it he disappears too all third world slums are the same art thinksthe same mud or dust depending on the climate and the season the same smells of charcoal stoves and open sewers the same heartbreakingly monotonous scenery of malnourished kids with distended bellies and big eyes its sure as hell not guadalajara where a large and generally prosperous middle class softens the slope between rich and poor not in san salvador he thinks where the shanty slums press against gleaming highrises like the thatched huts of medieval peasants pressed against castle walls except these castle walls are patrolled by private security guards wielding automatic rifles and machine pistols and at night the guards venture out from the castle walls and ride through the villagesin jeeps instead of on horsebackand slaughter the peasants leaving their bodies at crossroads and in the middle of village squares and rape and kill women and execute children in front of their parents so the survivors will know their place its a killing ground art thinks el salvador the savior my ass the compound sits in a grove of palm trees a hundred yards from the beach a stone wall topped by barbed wire surrounds the main house the garage and the servants quarters a thick wooden gate and a guard shack block the driveway from the private road art and ramos crouch behind the wall thirty yards from the gate hiding from the full moon a dozen salvadoran commandos are posted at intervals around the walls perimeter its taken frantic hours of negotiation to procure salvadoran cooperation but now the deal is in place they can go in and get barrera whisk him to the us embassy fly him out on a state department jet to new orleans and charge him there with firstdegree murder and conspiracy to distribute narcotics a cowed realestate agent has been hauled out of bed and taken to his office where he gives the commando team a diagram of the compound the shaken man is being held incommunicado until the raid is over art and ramos pore over the diagram and come up with an operational plan but it all has to be done quickly before barreras protectors in the mexican government can get wind of it and interfere and it has to be done cleanlyno fuss no muss and above all no salvadoran casualties art checks his watch am three minutes until h hour a breeze wafts the scent of jacaranda from the compound reminding art of guadalajara he can see the tops of the trees over the wall their purple leaves shimmering silver in the bright moonlight on the other side he hears the waves lap softly on the beach a perfect lovers idyll he thinks a perfumed garden paradise well lets hope paradise is about to be lost for good this time he thinks lets hope tio is sleeping soundly sexually drugged into a postcoital stupor from which he can be rudely awakened art has an admittedly vulgar image of tio being dragged bareassed into the waiting van the more humiliation the better he hears footsteps then sees one of the compounds private security guards headed toward him casually flashing a light along the wall looking for any lurking burglars art slowly scrunches his body closer to the wall the flashlight beam hits him square in the eyes the guard reaches for his holstered pistol then a cloth garrote slips around his neck and ramos is lifting him off the ground the guards eyes bulge and his tongue comes out of his mouth and then ramos eases the unconscious man to the ground hell be okay ramos says thank god art thinks because a dead civilian would screw up the whole delicate deal he looks at his watch as it hits five and the commandos must be a crack unit because at that precise second art hears a dull whomp as an explosive charge blows the gate of the wall ramos looks at art your gun what better to have your gun in your hand art had forgotten he even had the damn thing he pulls it from his shoulder holster and now hes running behind ramos through the blown gate and into the garden past the servants quarters where the frightened workers lie on the ground a commando pointing an m at them as art runs toward the main house he tries to remember the diagram but as the adrenaline flows in his memory flows out and then he thinks screw it and just follows ramos who trots at a quick but easy pace in front of him esposa swinging on his hip art glances up at the wall where blackclad commando snipers perch like crows their rifles trained on the compounds grounds ready to mow down anyone who tries to run out then suddenly hes at the front of the main house and ramos grabs him and shoves him down as theres another bass thump and the sound of wood splintering as the front door flies off ramos looses half a clip into the empty space then he steps in art enters behind him trying to rememberthe bedroom where is the bedroom pilar sits up and shouts as they come through the door pulls the sheet up over her breasts and screams again tioand art cant quite believe this its all too surrealis actually hiding under the covers hes pulled the sheets up over his head like a small child who thinks if i cant see them they cant see me but art can most definitely see him art is all adrenalinehe yanks off the sheet grabs tio by the back of the neck jerks him up like a barbell and then slams him facefirst onto the parquet wood floor tio isnt bareassed but wearing black silk boxer shorts which art can feel slide along his leg as he plants his knee into the small of tios back grabs his chin and lifts his head back far enough so that his neck threatens to snap then jams the pistol barrel into his right temple dont hurt him pilar screams i didnt want you to hurt him tio wrenches his chin from arts hold and cranes his neck to stare at the girl pure hatred as he pronounces a single word chocho cunt the girl turns pale and looks terrified art pushes tios face to the floor blood from tios broken nose flows across the polished wood ramos says come on we have to hurry art starts to pull the handcuffs from his belt dont cuff him ramos says with undisguised irritation art blinks then he gets ityou dont shoot a man whos trying to escape if the man is handcuffed ramos asks do you want to do him in here or out there thats what he expects me to do art thinks shoot barrera thats why he thinks i insisted on coming along on the raid so i could do just that his head whirls as he realizes that maybe everybody expects him to do that all the dea guys shagespecially shagexpect him to enforce the old code that you dont bring a cop killer back to the house that a cop killer always dies trying to escape christ do they expect that tio sure does says smoothly calmly tauntingly me maravilla que todavia estoy vivo im amazed im still alive well dont be too amazed art thinks as he pulls the hammer back date prisa ramos says hurry up art looks up at himramos is lighting a cigar two commandos are looking down at him waiting impatiently wondering why the soft gringo hasnt already done what should be done so the whole plan to bring tio back to the embassy was a sham art thinks a charade to satisfy the diplomats i can pull the trigger and everyone will swear that barrera resisted arrest he was pulling a gun i had to shoot him and nobodys going to look too closely at the forensics either date prisa except this time its tio saying it and he sounds annoyed almost bored date prisa sobrino hurry up nephew art grabs him by the hair and yanks his head up art remembers ernies mutilated body lying in the ditch bearing the marks of his torture he lowers his mouth to tios ear and whispers vete al demonio tio go to hell uncle ill meet you there tio answers it was supposed to have been you arturo but i talked them into taking hidalgo instead for old times sake unlike you i honor relationships ernie hidalgo died for you now do it be a man art squeezes the trigger its hard it takes more pressure than he remembers tio grins at him art feels the presence of pure evil the power of the dog he jerks tio to his feet barrera smiles at him with utter contempt what are you doing ramos asks what we planned he holsters his pistol then cuffs tios hands behind his back lets get going ill do it ramos says if youre squeamish im not art says vamonos one of the commandos starts to slip a black hood over tios head art stops him then gets into tios face and says lethal injection or the gas chamber tio be thinking about it tio just smiles at him smiles at him hood him art orders the commando pulls the black hood over tios head and ties it at the bottom art grabs his pinioned arms and marches him outside through the perfumed garden where art thinks the jacarandas have never smelled so sweet sweet and sickly art thinks to himself like the incense he remembers from church as a kid the first scent of it was pleasant the next would make him feel a little sick thats how he feels now as he frogmarches tio through the compound toward the van waiting in the street except the van isnt waiting anymore and about twenty rifle barrels are pointed at him not at tio at art keller theyre salvadoran regular army troops and with them a yanqui in civilian clothes and shiny black shoes sal scachi keller i told you the next time id just shoot art looks around and sees snipers perched on the walls there was a little difference of opinion within the salvadoran government scachi says we got it worked out sorry kid but we cant let you have him as art wonders who we are scachi nods and two salvadoran soldiers take the hood off tios head no wonder he was fucking smiling art thinks he knew the cavalry couldnt be far off some other soldiers bring pilar out she wears a negligee now but it accents more than it hides and the soldiers gape at her openly as they walk her past tio she sobs im sorry tio spits in her face the soldiers have her hands behind her back and she cant wipe it off so the saliva runs down her cheek i wont forget this tio says the soldiers march pilar to a waiting van tio turns to art i wont forget you either all right all right scachi says nobodys forgetting anybody don miguel lets get you into some real clothes and out of here as for you keller and you ramos the local police would like to throw you both in prison but we talked them into deportation instead there are military flights waiting so if this little pajama party is over cerberus art says scachi grabs him and hauls him off to the side the fuck did you say cerberus art answers he thinks hes figured it all out now ilopongo airport sal hangar four scachi stares at him then says keller you just earned firstballot entry into the asshole hall of fame five minutes later arts in the front seat of a jeep i swear to christ scachi says as he drives if it was up to me id put one in the back of your head right now ilopongos a busy airfield military aircraft helicopters and transport planes are everywhere along with the personnel needed to maintain them sal steers the jeep to a series of large quonsethuttype hangars with signs on the front designating them numbers through the door of hangar slides open and sal drives inside the door closes behind him the hangar is bustling a couple dozen men some in fatigues some in cammies all armed are unloading cargo from a setco plane three other men are standing around talking its been arts experience that any time you see a bunch of men working and other men standing around talking the ones talking are the ones in charge he can see one of their faces david nunez ramon mettes partner in setco cuban expatriate operation veteran nunez breaks off the conversation and walks over to where the crates are being stacked he barks an order and one of the worker bees opens a crate art watches nunez lift a grenade launcher out of the crate like its a religious idol bitter men handle weapons differently than the rest of us he thinks the guns seem connected to them in a visceral way as if a wire runs from the trigger through their dicks and to their hearts and nunez has that look in his eyehes in love with the weapon he left his balls and his heart on the beach in the bay of pigs and the weapon represents his hope of retribution its the old cubamiamimafia drug connection art realizes hooked up again and flying coke from colombia to central america to mexico to mafia dealers in the united states and the mafia pays in armaments which go to the contras the mexican trampoline sal hops out of the jeep and goes up to a young american who has to be a military officer in mufti i know that guy art thinks but from where who is he then the memory comes back shit i should know that guyi did night ambushes with him in vietnam operation phoenix what the hell is his name he was special forces back then a captain craig thats it scott craig shit hobbs has the old team here art watches scachi and craig talking pointing to him he smiles and waves craig gets on the radio and theres another confab behind him art can see packages of cocaine stacked to the ceiling scachi and craig walk over to him this what you wanted to see art scachi asks you happy now yeah im fucking thrilled to death you shouldnt joke scachi says craigs giving him the bad look it isnt working he looks like a boy scout art thinks boyish face short hair cleancut good looks an eagle scout going for his dope for guns badge the question is craig says to art are you going to be a team player well it would be the first time wouldnt it art thinks scachis apparently thinking the same thing kellers got a reputation as a cowboy he says out on the lone prairieee bad place to be craig says lonely shallow grave scachi adds ive left a full account of everything i know in a safedeposit box art lies anything happens to me it goes to the washington post youre bluffing art scachi says you want to find out scachi walks away and gets on the radio comes back a little later and snaps an order hood the motherfucker art knows hes in the back of an open car probably a jeep from the bouncy action he knows hes moving he knows that wherever theyre taking him its a long way away because it feels like theyve been traveling for hours it feels like that anyway but he doesnt really know because he cant see his watch or anything else and now he understands the terrifying disorienting effect of being hooded the floating fearful sensation of not being able to see but being able to hear and each sound a stimulus for a progressively frightened imagination the jeep stops and art waits to hear the metallic scrape of a rifle bolt or the click of a pistol hammer being pulled back or worse the whoosh of a machete slicing first through the air and then he feels the gears shift and the jeep lurches forward again and now he starts to tremble his legs twitch uncontrollably and he cant stop them nor can he stop his mind from producing images of ernies tortured corpse he cant stop the thought dont let them do to me what they did to ernie or its logical corollary better him than me he feels ashamed wretched coming to the realization that when push comes to shove when the terrible reality is at hand he really would have them do it to someone else rather than himselfhe wouldnt take ernies place if he could he tries to remember the act of contrition recalling what the nuns taught him in elementary schoolif youre about to die and theres no priest to give you absolution if you say a sincere act of contrition you can still go to heaven he remembers that what he cant remember is the goddamn prayer itself the jeep stops the motor idles hands grab art above the elbows and lift him out of the jeep he can feel leaves under his feet he trips over a vine but the arms wont let him fall he realizes that theyre taking him into the jungle then the hands push him down to his knees it doesnt take much forcehis legs feel like water take off the hood art knows the voice giving the crisp order john hobbs the cia station chief theyre at some kind of military base a training camp by the looks of it deep in the jungle to his right young soldiers in cammies are running an obstacle coursebadly to his left he sees a small airstrip that has been carved out of the jungle straight ahead of him hobbss small tidy face comes into focusthe thick white hair the bright blue eyes the disdainful smile and take off the handcuffs art feels the circulation come back into his wrists then the burning pinsandneedles sensation as it does hobbs gestures for him to follow and they go into a tent with a couple of canvas chairs a table and a cot sit down arthur id like to stand for a while hobbs shrugs arthur you need to understand that if you werent family you would have been disposed of already now whats this nonsense about a safedeposit box now art knows he was right that his lastgasp hail mary had hit the targetif the cocainerunning out of hangar was just the work of renegades they would have capped him back on the road he repeats the threat he made to scachi hobbs stares at him then asks what do you know about red mist what the hell is red mist art wonders art says look i only know about cerberus and what i know is enough to sink you i agree with your analysis hobbs says now where does that leave us with our jaws clamped on each others throats art says and neither of us can let go lets go for a walk they hike through the camp past the obstacle course the shooting range the clearings in the jungle where cammieclad soldiers sit on the ground and listen to instructors teach ambush tactics everything in the training camp hobbs says was paid for by miguel angel barrera jesus barrera understands understands what hobbs leads him up a steep trail to the top of a hill hobbs points out over the vast jungle stretching below what does that look like to you he asks art shrugs rain forest to me hobbs says it looks like a camels nose you know the old arab proverb once the camel gets his nose inside the tent the camel will be inside the tent thats nicaragua down there the communist camels nose in the tent of the central american isthmus not an island like cuba that we can isolate with our navy but part of the american mainland hows your geography passable then youll know hobbs says that nicaraguas southern borderwhich were looking atis a scant three hundred miles from the panama canal it shares a northern border with an unstable honduras and a lessstable el salvador both of which are struggling against communist insurgencies so is guatemala which would be the next domino to fall if youre up on your geography youll know that there is very little but mountainous jungle and rain forest between guatemala and the southern mexican states of yucatan quintana roo and chiapas those states are overwhelmingly rural and poor populated by landless helots who are perfect victims for a communist insurgency what if mexico falls to the communists arthur cuba is dangerous enoughnow imagine a twothousandmile border with a russian satellite country imagine soviet missiles based in hardened silos in jalisco durango baja so what they take texas next no they take western europe hobbs says because they knowand its the truththat even the united states doesnt have the military or financial resources to defend a twothousandmile border with mexico and the fulda gap at the same time this is crazy is it hobbs asks the nicaraguans are already exporting arms across the border to the flmn in el salvador but dont even take it that far just consider nicaragua a soviet client state that straddles central america imagine soviet subs based on the pacific side from the gulf of fonseca or on the atlantic side along the gulf of mexico they could turn the gulf and the caribbean into a soviet lake consider this if you think it was hard for us to spot missile silos in cuba try detecting them in those mountains over there in the cordillera isabelia intermediaterange missiles could easily reach miami new orleans or houston with very little response time available to us thats not to mention the threat of submarinelaunched missiles striking from somewhere in the gulf or the caribbean we cannot allow a soviet client state to remain in nicaragua its that simple the contras are willing to do the job or would you rather see american boys fighting and dying in that jungle arthur those are your choices thats what you want me to choose dopepushing contras cuban terrorists salvadoran death squads that murder women kids priests and nuns theyre brutal vicious and evil hobbs says the only worse people i can think of are the communists look at the globe hobbs continues we ran away in vietnam and the communists learned exactly the right lesson from that they took cambodia in the blink of an eye we did nothing they marched on afghanistan and we did nothing except pull some athletes out of a track meet so its afghanistan next its pakistan and then its india and then its done arthurthe entire asian landmass is red you have soviet client states in mozambique angola ethiopia iraq and syria and we do nothing and nothing and nothing so they think fine lets see if they do nothing in central america so they take nicaragua and how do we respond the boland amendment its the law its suicide hobbs says only a fool or congress couldnt see the folly of allowing a soviet puppet to remain in the heart of central america the stupidity beggars description we had to do something arthur so the cia takes it upon itself to the cia took nothing on itself hobbs says this is what im trying to tell you arthur cerberus comes from the highest possible authority in the land ronald reagan is churchill hobbs says at a critical moment in history he has seen the truth for what it is and has had the resolve to act are you telling me he doesnt know any of the details of coursehobbs says he simply ordered us to reverse the tide incentral america and overthrow the sandinistas by whatever means necessary ill read chapter and verse to you arthurnational security department directive number three authorizes the vice president to take charge of activities against communist terrorists operating anywhere in latin america in response the vice president formed tiwgthe terrorist incident working groupbased in el salvador honduras and costa rica which in turn instituted the nhaothe national humanitarian assistance operationwhich in accordance with the boland amendment is meant to provide nonlethal humanitarian aid to nicaraguan refugees aka the contras operation cerberus doesnt run through the companythats where youre wrongbut through the vps office scachi reports directly to me and i report to the vp why are you telling me this im appealing to your patriotismhobbs says the country i love doesnt get in bed with people who torture its own agents to death then to your pragmatismhobbs says he takes some documents out of his pocket bank records deposits made to your accounts in the caymans costa rica panama all from miguel angel barrera i dont know anything about that withdrawal slipshobbs says with your signature it was a deal i had to make the lesser of two evils exactlyhobbs says i understand the dilemma completely now im asking you to understand ours you keep our secrets we keep yours fuck you art turns and starts to walk back down the trail keller if you think were just going to let you walk out of here art holds up his middle finger and keeps walking away there must be some sort of arrangement art shakes his head they can take their domino theory he thinks and shove it sideways what couldhobbs offer me that would make up for ernie nothing there is nothing in this world nothing you can offer a man whos lost everythinghis family his work his friend his hope his trust his belief in his own country theres nothing you can offer that man that means anything but it turns out there is then art understandscerberus isnt a guard hes an usher a panting grinning tonguelolling doorman who eagerly invites you into the underworld and you cant resist chapter six the lowest bottom shook and every bolt and bar of massy iron or solid rock with ease unfastens on a sudden open fly with impetuous recoil and jarring sound th infernal

the hotel bend and sway and actually smack the top of the building next door she hears it though hears the wicked dull crack then the wall behind the bed falls in and she opens the door and runs into the hallway outside mexico city is shaking to death the city is built on an old lake bed soft soil which in turns sits on the large cocos tectonic plate which is constantly shifting under the mexican landmass the city and its soft loose foundation sit just two hundred miles from the edge of the plate and one of the worlds largest faults the giant middle american trench which runs under the pacific ocean from the mexican resort town ofpuerto vallarta all the way topanama for years there have been small quakes along the northern and southern edges of this plate but not near the center not nearmexico city which the scientists refer to as a seismic gap the geologists compare it to a string of firecrackers that have exploded along both ends but not in the center they say that sooner or later the center has to catch fire and explode the trouble starts about thirty kilometers beneath the earths surface for countless eons the cocos plate has been trying to sink to slide under the plate to the east of it and on this morning it succeeds forty miles off the coast miles west ofmexico city the earth cracks sending a giant quake through the lithosphere if the city had been closer to this epicenter it might have held up better the highrise buildings might have survived the highfrequency rapid jolting that happens near the actual quake the buildings might have jumped and landed and cracked but held up but as the quake moves from the center its energy dissipates which counterintuitively makes it more dangerous because of that soft soil the quake fades into long slow rolling motionsa set of giant waves if you will that get under that soft lake bed that bowl of jello the city is built onand that jello just rolls rolling the buildings with it shaking the buildings not so much vertically as horizontally and thats the problem each floor of the highrises moves farther sideways than the floor below the now topheavy buildings literally slide out into the air knock heads and slide back again for two long minutes the tops of these buildings slide sideways back and forth in the air and then they just break concrete blocks fall off and tumble down onto the street windows burst huge jagged pieces of glass fly into the air like missiles interior walls collapse support beams with them rooftop swimming pools crack sending tons of water to collapse the roofs beneath them some buildings just snap off at the fourth or fifth floors sending two three eight twelve stories of stone concrete and steel slamming into the street below thousands of people falling with them buried under them building after building of them in four minutescollapses in the quake the government literally fallsthe secretariat of the navy the secretariat of commerce and the secretariat of communications all topple the citys tourist center reads like a roll of casualties name after namethe hotel monte carlo the hotel romano the hotel versailles the roma thebristol the ejecutivo the palacio the reforma the intercontinental and the regis all go down the top half of the hotel caribe snaps off like a stick dumping mattresses luggage curtains and guests through the crack and onto the street whole neighborhoods virtually disappearcolonia roma colonia doctores unidad aragon and the tlatelolco housing project where a twentystory apartment tower collapses on its occupants in a particularly cruel twist the quake destroys the general hospital of mexico and thejuarezhospital killing and trapping patients and desperately needed doctors and nurses nora doesnt know any of this she runs into the hallway where room doors that have fallen in look like cards in a sophisticated house of cards that has started to collapse a woman runs ahead of her and presses for the elevator no nora yells the woman turns and looks at her wideeyed with fear dont take the elevator nora says take the stairs the woman stares at her nora tries to remember the words in spanish but cant then the elevator doors slide open and water pours out like a scene from a bad grotesque horror film the woman turns around looks at nora laughs and says agua vamos nora says vamonos whatever lets go come on she grabs the woman by the hand to try to pull her down the hall but the woman wont budge she yanks her hand back and starts to press the elevators down button again and again nora leaves her and finds the exit door to the stairwell the floor ripples and rolls under her feet she gets into the stairway and its like being in a long swaying box the force knocks her from side to side as she runs down the stairs there are people in front of her now and behind the stairwell is getting crowded sounds horrible sounds echo in the confined space cracking breaking the noises of a building tearing itself apartand screamswomens screams and worse the shrill keening of children she grabs on to the handrail to steady herself but its moving too one floor two she tries to count by the landings then gives up is it three floors four five she knows she has to go seven idiotically she cant remember how they number their floors inmexico do they start on ground and go first second or is the ground floor the first then second third fourth what does it matter just keep moving she tells herself then an awful lurch like a ship rolling slams her into the left wall she keeps her balance gets her feet under her again just keep moving just keep moving get out of this building before it comes down on top of you just keep going down these stairs she thinks oddly of the steep stairs going down frommontmartre through the place willette how some people take the cable car but she always takes the steps because its good for her calves but also because she just enjoys it and if she walks instead of rides it justifies a chocolat chaud at that pretty cafe at the bottom and i want to go back there again she thinks i want to sit at a sidewalk table again and have the waiter smile at me and watch the people see the funny cathedral the basilique du sacre coeur at the top the one that looks like it was made from spun sugar think about that think about that dont think about dying in this trap this crowded swaying rolling deathtrap god its getting hot in here god stop screaming it doesnt do any good shut up theres a breath of air now people are jammed in front of her and then the jam breaks up and she moves behind the people in the lobby chandeliers drop from the ceiling like rotten fruit from a shaken tree falling and shattering on the old tile floor she steps over the broken glass toward the revolving doors so jammedshe waits her turnshe gets in no need to push its being more than pushed from behind she gets a scent of airwonderful air she sees dim sunlight shes almost out then the building comes down on her hes saying mass when it hits ten miles from the epicenter in the cathedral of ciudad guzman archbishop parada holds the host above his head and offers a prayer to god its one of the perks and privileges of being archbishop of the guadalajara archdiocese that he gets to come out here to say the occasional mass in the little town he loves the cathedrals classic churrigueresque architecture mexico s unique adaptation of the european gothic into the pagan aztec and mayan the cathedrals two gothic towers are rounded into precolumbian polyforms flanking a dome decorated with a panoply of multicolored tiles even now as he faces the retablo behind the altar he can see the gilded wood carvingseuropean cherubs and human heads but also native scrolls of fruit and flowers and birds the love of color of nature the joy of lifethis is what makes him revel in the mexican brand of christianity the seamless blending of indigenous paganism with an emotional unshakable faith in jesus it is not the dry spare religion of european intellectualism with its hatred of the natural world no the mexicans have the innate wisdom the spiritual generosityhow shall he put thisarms long enough to wrap themselves around this world and the next in a warm embrace thats pretty good he thinks as he turns back toward the congregation i should find a way to work that into a sermon the cathedral is crowded with worshippers this morningeven though its a thursdaybecause he is there to celebrate the mass i have he thinks enough of an ego to enjoy that fact the truth is that hes an enormously popular archbishophe gets out among the people shares their concerns their thoughts their laughs their meals oh god he thinks how i share their meals he knows that its a village joke in whatever town he visits and he visits all of them widen the chair at the head of the tablearchbishop juan is coming to dinner he takes a host and starts to place it on the tongue of the worshipper kneeling in front of him then the floor bounces beneath him thats exactly what it feels like a bounce then another and another until the bounces blend into one constant series of jolts he feels something wet on his sleeve looks down to see wine hopping out of the cup held by the acolyte beside him he puts his arm around the boys shoulders move first under the arches he says then outside everyone go now calmly quietly he gently pushes the altar boy go on the boy steps down from the altar parada waits he will wait there until the rest of the crowd in the church has filed out be calm he tells himself if you are calm they will be calm if theres panic people might crush one another to get out so he stays and looks around the carved animals come to life they hop and quiver the carved faces nod up and down a frenzied agreement parada thinks on what i wonder outside the two towers tremble they are made of old stone beautifully handcrafted by local artisans so much love went into them so much care but they stand in the town of ciudad guzman in the province of jalisco a name that comes from the original tarascan inhabitants and means sandy place the stones in the tower are fine strong and level but the mortar was made from that sandy soil it could hold firm against many things wind and rain and time but it was never meant to hold up against a earthquake thirty kilometers deep and just ten miles away so as the worshippers patiently file out the towers quiver the mortar holding them together shakes loose and they collapse on top of the greatgrandchildren of the men who carved them and set them in place the towers crash through the tiled dome and come down on twentyfive worshippers because the church is crowded this morning for the love of bishop juan who stands on the altar untouched in shock and horror as the people in front of him just disappear in a cloud of yellow dust the host still in his hand the body of christ nora is pulled from the dead a steel support beam saved her life it fell diagonally onto a broken piece of wall and stopped another column from crushing her left a crack of space a little air as she lay buried beneath the rubble of the regis hotel so she could at least breathe not that theres much to breathe the air is filled with so much dust she chokes on it she coughs she cant see a thing but she can hear is it minutes later hours she doesnt know but in that time she wonders if shes dead if this is what hell istrapped in a small hot space unable to see choking on dust im dead she thinks dead and buried she hears the sounds of moans cries of pain and wonders if this will last forever if this is her eternity where a whore goes when she dies she has just enough space to lay her head on her arm maybe i can sleep through hell she thinks sleep through eternity it hurts she finds that her arm is caked with moist blood then she remembers the mirror shattering and the glass flying into her arm im not dead she thinks feeling the wet blood dead people dont bleed im not dead she thinks im buried alive then she starts to panic starts to hyperventilate knowing that she shouldnt that shes only using up the small supply of oxygen more quickly but she cant help it the thought of being buried alive in this coffin under the groundshe remembers some stupid poe story they made her read in high school the scratch marks on the top of the coffin she wants to scream no point in using up my air freaking out she thinks theres better things to do with it she yells simply help over and over again at the top of her lungs then she hears sirens footsteps the sound of feet right above her help a beat then donde estas right here she yells then thinks then yells aqui she hears and feels things being lifted above her orders being given cautions issued then she reaches her hand up as far as it will go a second later feels the incredible warmth of another hand grabbing hers then she feels herself being pulled out and up and then miraculously shes standing in open space well sort of open theres a ceiling of sorts above walls and columns slanting crazily like standing in a museum of ruins a rescue worker holds her by the arms looks curiously at her then she smells something a sweet sickly smell god what is that a spark hits the gas and sets it off nora hears a sharp crack then a bass boom that rattles her heart and she falls over the hole when she looks up again theres fire everywhere its like the freaking air is on fire and moving toward her the men yell vamonosahorita lets go right now one of the men grabs noras arm again and pushes her and theyre running flames are all around them and burning debris falls on their heads and she hears a crackling sound smells an acrid sour smell and a man is slapping at her head and she realizes that her hair is on fire but she doesnt feel it the mans sleeve catches on fire but he keeps pushing her pushing her and then suddenly theyre in the open air and she wants to fall down but the man wont let her he keeps pushing her and pushing her because behind them whats left of the regis hotel tumbles and burns the other two men dont make it they join the other heroes who will die trying to rescue people trapped in the earthquake nora doesnt know this yet as she trots across avenida benito juarez into the relative safety of the open space of la alameda park she drops to her knees as a policewoman a traffic warden throws a coat over her head and pats out the fire nora looks around herthe regis hotel is a pile of burning rubble next door the salinas y rocha department store looks like its been cut in half red green and white streamers decorations from independence day are floating in the air above the truncated shell of the building all around her as far as she can see through the clouds of dust buildings lie toppled or cut in half huge chunks of stone concrete and twisted steel lie in the streets and the people all over the park people are on their knees praying the sky is dark from smoke and dust blocking out the sun and over and over again she hears the same muttered phrase el fin del mundo the end of the world the right side of noras hair is scorched black her left arm is bloody and studded with tiny shards of glass the shock and adrenaline are wearing off and the pain is starting to come in for real parada kneels over the corpses giving them posthumously the last rites a line of corpses awaits his attention twentyfive bodies wrapped in makeshift shroudsin blankets towels tablecloths anything that could be found lying in a neat line in the dirt outside the fallen cathedral while frantic townspeople comb the ruins for more search for their loved ones missing trapped under the old stone desperately hopefully listening for any signs of life so his mouth mumbles the latin words but his heart something has broken inside him has cracked as surely and lethally as the earth has cracked there is now a fault line between me and god he thinks the god that is the god that isnt he cant tell them thatit would be cruel theyre looking to him to send the souls of their dearly departed to heaven he cant disappoint them not at this time maybe never the people need hope and i cant take it away im not as cruel as you he thinks so he says the prayers anoints them with oil and goes on with the ritual behind him a priest approaches padre juan cant you see im busy youre wanted in mexico city im needed here they are orders padre juan whose orders the papal nuncio the priest says everyone is being summoned to organize the relief you have done such work before so i have dozens of dead here there are thousands dead in mexico city the priest says thousands no one knows how many says the priest and tens of thousands homeless so parada thinks there it isthe living must be served as soon as im done here parada says he goes back to giving the last rites they cant get her to leave a lot of people trypolice rescue workers paramedicsbut nora wont go to get medical help your arm senorita your face bullshit she says there are a lot of people hurt a lot worse im okay im in pain she thinks but im okay its funny a day ago i would have thought that those two things couldnt go together but now i know they can so her arm hurts her head hurts her face scorched from the fire like a very bad sunburn hurts but she feels okay in fact she feels strong pain fuck painthere are people dying she doesnt want help nowshe wants to help so she sits down and carefully picks the glass out of her arm then washes it in a broken water main rips a sleeve off the linen pajamas shes still wearing glad that shes always opted for linen over some flimsy silk thing and ties it around the wound then she tears the other sleeve and uses it as a kerchief over her nose and mouth because the dust and smoke are choking and the smell its the smell of death unimaginable if youve never smelled it unforgettable once you have she tightens the kerchief on her face and goes in search of something to put on her feet not hard to do seeing as how the department store has basically exploded its contents onto the street so she appropriates a pair of rubber flipflops doesnt consider it looting there is no lootingdespite the overwhelming poverty of many of the citys residents there is no looting and joins a volunteer rescue crew digging up the rubble of the hotel searching for survivors there are hundreds of these crews thousands of volunteers digging through fallen buildings all over the city working with shovels picks tire irons broken rebar and bare hands to get to the people trapped underneath carrying the dead and wounded out in blankets sheets shower curtains anything to help the hopelessly overextended emergency personnel other volunteer crews help remove the rubble from the streets to clear the way for ambulances and fire trucks fire department helicopters hover over burning buildings lowering men on winches to pluck out people who cant be reached from the ground all the while thousands of radios drone a litany pierced by screams of grief or joy from the listeners as the announcer reads the names of the dead and the names of the survivors there are other soundsmoans whimpers prayers screams cries for helpall muffled all from deep within the ruins voices of people trapped under tons of rubble so the workers keep working quietly doggedly the volunteers and professionals search for survivors digging beside nora is a troop of girl scouts they cant be more than nine years old nora thinks looking at their serious determined faces already carrying literally the weight of the world so there are girl scouts and boy scouts soccer clubs bridge clubs and just individuals like nora who form themselves into teams doctors and nurses the few who are left after the collapse of the hospitals comb the rubble with stethoscopes lowering the instruments to the rocks to listen for any faint signs of life when they do the workers holler for quiet the sirens stop the vehicles turn off their motors and everyone remains perfectly still and then a doctor might smile or nod and the crews move in carefully gently but efficiently moving the rock and steel and concrete and sometimes theres a happy ending with someone plucked from the rubble other times it is sadderthey just cant move the rubble fast enough they are too late and find a lifeless body either way they keep working all that day and through the night nora stops once during the night takes a break and gets a cup of tea and a slice of bread from a relief station set up in the park the park is crowded with the newly homeless and with people afraid to stay in their houses and apartment buildings so the park resembles a giant refugee center which nora thinks i guess it is whats different about it is the quiet radios are turned on low people whisper prayers talk quietly to their children theres no arguing no pushing or shoving for the small supply of food or water people wait patiently in line bring the spare meals to the old and the children help one another carry water set up makeshift tents and shelters dig latrines those whose homes werent damaged bring blankets pots and pans food clothing a woman hands nora a pair of jeans and a flannel shirt take these i couldnt its getting cold nora takes the clothing thank you gracias nora goes behind a tree to change clothes never felt so good the flannel feels wonderful and warm on her skin she has closets full of clothes at home she thinks most of which shes worn once or twice shed give a lot right now for a pair of socks shes known that the elevation of the city is more than a mile high but now she feels it as the night gets cold she wonders about the people still trapped beneath the buildings if they can stay warm she finishes her tea and bread then ties her kerchief back on and walks back to the ruins of the hotel gets on her knees beside a middleaged woman and starts to move more rubble parada walks through hell fires burn crazily rampantly from broken gas lines flames glow from inside the shells of ruined buildings lighting the stygian darkness outside the acrid smoke stings his eyes dust fills his nose and mouth and makes him cough he gags on the smell the sickening stench of decomposing bodies the stink of burned flesh underneath those sharp smells the duller but still pungent scent of human feces as the sewer systems have failed it gets worse as he moves along encounters child after child wandering crying for their mothers and fathers some of them in just underwear or pajamas others in full school uniforms he gathers them up as he goes along he has a little boy in one arm and hes holding the hand of a little girl with the other and shes holding another childs hand who is holding another by the time he gets to la alameda park he has over twenty children with him he wanders until he finds where catholic relief has set up a tent parada finds a monsignor and asks have you seen antonucci meaning cardinal antonucci the papal nuncio the vaticans highest representative in mexico hes saying mass at the cathedral the city doesnt need a mass parada says it needs power and water food blood and plasma the spiritual needs of the community si si si si parada says walking away he needs to think to get his head together theres so much to be organized so many people with so many needs its overwhelming he pulls a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and starts to light one a voicea womans voicebites out of the darkness put that out are you nuts he snuffs the match out shines his flashlight and finds the womans face an extraordinarily pretty face even under all the dust and grime broken gas lines she says do you want to blow us all up there are fires all over he says then i guess we dont need another one huh no i suppose not parada says youre american yeah you got here quickly i was here nora says when it happened ah he looks her over feels the faint ghost of a longforgotten stirring the woman is small but theres something of the warrior about her a real chip on her shoulder she wants to fight but she doesnt know what or how like me he thinks he puts a hand out juan parada nora just nora parada observes no last name do you live in mexico city nora no i came down on business what kind of business are you in he asks she looks him square in the eye im a call girl im afraid i dont a prostitute ah what do you do he smiles im a priest youre not dressed like a priest youre not dressed like a prostitute he says actually im even worse than a priest im a bishop an archbishop is that better than a bishop if youre judging solely by rank he says i was happier as a priest then why dont you go back to being a priest he smiles again and nods and says im going to wager that youre a very successful call girl i am nora says ill bet youre a very successful archbishop as a matter of fact im thinking of quitting why im not sure i believe anymore nora shrugs and says fake it fake it its easy she says i do it all the time oh ohhhh i see parada feels himself blushing but why should i fake anything power nora says seeing paradas puzzled look she goes on an archbishop must be pretty powerful right in some ways nora nods i sleep with a lot of powerful men i know that when they want something done it gets done so so she says pointing her chin at the park around her theres a lot that needs to get done ah from the mouths of babes parada thinks not to mention prostitutes well its been nice talking to you he says we should stay in touch a whore and a bishop nora says clearly youve never read the bible parada says the new testament mary magdalene ring a bell no in any case it would be all right for us to be friends he says then quickly adds i dont mean that kind of friends of course i took a vow i simply mean i would like it if we were friends i think id like that too he takes a card from his pocket when things calm down would you call me yeah i will good well id better get going things to do me too he walks back to the catholic relief tent start getting these kids names he orders a priest then compare them with the roll of dead missing and survivors someone somewhere must be keeping a list of parents looking for children crossindex their names against that who are you the priest asks im the archbishop of guadalajara he says now get moving and put someone else to getting these children food and blankets yes your grace and ill need a car your grace a car parada says ill need a car to take me to the nunciate the papal nunciate antonuccis residence is in the south of the city far from the most damaged areas the electricity will be running the lights on most importantly the phones will be working many of the streets are blocked your grace and many of them arent parada says youre still standing there why two hours later papal nuncio cardinal girolamo antonucci returns to his residence to find an upset staff and archbishop parada in his office his feet up on the desk sucking on a cigarette snapping orders into the telephone parada looks up when antonucci comes in can you get us some more coffee parada asks its going to be a long night and a longer day tomorrow guilty pleasures hot strong coffee fresh warm bread and thank god antonucci is italian and smokes parada thinks as he draws into his lungs that guiltiest of all guilty pleasures at least among the ones available to a priest he exhales the smoke and watches it rise to the ceiling listening as antonucci sets his cup down and says to the minister of the interior i have spoken to his holiness personally and he wishes me to assure the government of his beloved people of mexico that the vatican stands ready to offer whatever aid it can despite the fact that we still do not enjoy formal diplomatic relations with the government of mexico antonucci looks like a bird parada thinks a tiny bird with a small neat beak he was dispatched from rome eight years ago with the mission of bringing mexico formally back into the fold after over one hundred years of official government anticlericism since the ley lerdo of had seized the vast churchowned haciendas and other lands and sold them off the revolutionary constitution of had stripped the power of the church in mexico and the vatican retaliated by excommunicating any mexican who took the constitutional oath so for a century an uneasy truce has existed between the vatican and the mexican government formal relations have never been resumed but not even the most rabid socialists of the prithe partido revolucionario institucional the institutional revolutionary party that has ruled mexico in a oneparty pseudodemocratic government since would try to totally abolish the church in this land of faithful peasants so there have been petty harassments such as the ban on clerical garb but mostly there has been a grudging accommodation between the government and the vatican but it has always been a goal of the vatican to regain formal status in mexico and as a politician from the churchs archconservative wing antonucci has lectured parada and the other bishops that we must not lose the faithful of mexico to godless communism so its natural parada thinks that antonucci would view the earthquake as an opportunity see the deaths of ten thousand of the faithful as gods way of bringing the government to its knees necessity will force the government to eat a lot of crow over the next few days it has yet to humble itself by accepting aid from the americans but it will and it has yet to crawl to the church for help but here it is and well give them the money money that weve collected from the faithful rich and poor for centuries the coin in the collection plate untaxed invested at great profit so now parada thinks we will extract a price from a prostrate country to give it back the money we took from it in the first place christ would weep money changers in the temple we are the money changers in the temple you need money antonucci says to the minister you need it quickly and youre going to have a hard time borrowing it given your governments already precarious credit ratings well issue bonds wholl buy them antonucci asks a hint of a satisfied sneer playing at the corners of his mouth you cant offer enough interest to tempt investors for that kind of money you cant even service never mind repay the debts you already have we should know we already hold a stack of mexican paper insurance the minister says youre underinsured antonucci says your own department of the interior has turned a blind eye to all the hotels practice of underinsurance to encourage tourism the stores the apartment buildingssame thing even the government ministries that collapsed were grossly underinsured or selfinsured i should say without the funds to back it up its a bit of a scandal im afraid so while your government might hold the vatican in official disdain the financial institutions have a somewhat better opinion of us i believe its referred to in the jargon as triple a machiavelli could only have been an italian parada thinks if it werent such a hideously cynical piece of extortion youd almost have to admire it but theres too much work to be done and its urgent so parada says lets cut through the shit shall we we will gladly bring whatever aid we can financial and material on an informal basis you in return will allow our clergy to wear the cross and clearly label any material aid as coming from the holy roman catholic church you will guarantee that the next administration within thirty days of taking office will commence goodfaith negotiations on establishing formal relations between the state and the church thats in antonucci snaps almost three years away yes i did the math parada says he turns back to the minister do we have a deal yes they do just who do you think you are antonucci asks after the minister leaves dont you ever supersede me in a negotiation again i had him on the run is that our role now parada asks to keep needy people on the run you do not have the authority to am i being taken to the woodshed parada asks if so please be quick about it i have work to do you seem to forget that i am your direct superior you cant forget what you dont acknowledge in the first place parada says youre not my superior youre a politician sent by rome to conduct politics antonucci says the earthquake was an act of god i cant believe what im hearing which provides an opportunity to save the souls of millions of mexicans dont save their souls parada yells save them that is sheer heresy good it isnt just the earthquake victims parada thinks its the millions living in poverty the literally countless millions in the slums of mexico city the people living on garbage dumps in tijuana the landless peasants in chiapas who are in reality little more than serfs this liberation theology doesnt fly with me antonucci says i dont care parada says i dont answer to youi answer to god i can pick up this phone and have you transferred to a chapel in tierra del fuego parada grabs the phone and hands it to him do it he says id be very happy being a parish priest at the ends of the earth why arent you dialing shall i do it for you im calling your bluff ill call rome and then ill call the newspapers to tell them exactly why im being transferred he watches little red spots appear on antonuccis cheeks the bird is upset parada thinks i have ruffled his smooth feathers but antonucci regains his calm his placid exterior even his selfsatisfied smile as he sets down the receiver good choice parada says with a confidence he doesnt feel ill head up this relief effort ill launder the churchs money so as not to embarrass the government and ill help bring the church back to mexico im waiting for the quid antonucci says in the pro quo the vatican will make me a cardinal because the power to do good can come only with well power antonucci says you have become something of a politician yourself its true parada thinks good fine so be it so we have an understanding parada says suddenly hes become more of a cat than a bird parada thinks thinking hes swallowed the canary that ive sold my soul to him for the sake of my ambition a transaction that he can understand good let him think it fake it the lovely american prostitute had said shes rightits easy tijuana adan barrera contemplates the deal he just made with the pri it was really quite simple he thinks you go into breakfast with a briefcase full of cash and you leave without it it stays under the table by your feet never mentioned but assumed a tacit understanding despite american pressure to the contrary tio will be allowed to come home from his exile in honduras and retire tio will live quietly in guadalajara and manage his legitimate businesses in peace thats the upside of the arrangement the downside is that garcia abrego will realize his longtime ambition of replacing tio as el patron and perhaps this is not such a bad thing tios health is precarious and face it hes changed since that talavera bitch betrayed him god he actually loved the little segundera wanted to marry her and hes not the same man he was so abrego will assume the leadership of the federacion from his base in the gulf states el verde will continue to run sonora guero mendez will still have the baja plaza and the mexican federal government will look the other way thanks to the earthquake the government needs cash to rebuild and right now there are only two sourcesthe vatican and the narcos the church has already kicked in adan knows and so will we but there will be a quid pro quo and the government will honor it in addition the federacion will also foot the bill to make certain that the ruling party the pri wins the upcoming elections as it has since the revolution even now adan is helping abrego organize a millionaplate fundraising dinner to which every major narco and businessman in mexico will be expected to contribute if that is they want to do business and do we ever need to do business adan thinks the hidalgo fiasco was a major disruption and even with arturo out of the country and things settling down there is a lot of money to be made up now with our relationship with mexico city on firm footing again we can get back to business as usual which means stealing the baja plaza from guero it had been tios idea for his nephews to infiltrate tijuana like cuckoo birds because the longterm plan is to slowly grow rich in power and influence and then throw guero out of his nest hes an absentee landlord anyway trying to run the baja plaza from his ranch outside culiacan guero relies on lieutenants to run the daytoday in la plaza narcos loyal to him like juan esparagoza and tito mical and adan and raul barrera it had been tios idea for adan and raul to ingratiate themselves with the scions of the tijuana establishment become part of the fabric so if they want to rip you out they cant do it without ripping the whole blanket and that they will not do do it slowly do it carefully do it without guero taking notice but do it start with the kids hed advised senior will do anything to protect junior so adan and raul had launched a charm offensive bought expensive homes in the exclusive colonia hipodromo and suddenly they were just there actually everywhere like one day there was no raul barrera and the next day hes everywhere you go go to a club raul is there picking up the tab go to the beach raul is out there doing karate katas go to the races raul is there laying down piles of bills on long shots go to a disco raul is there flooding the place with dom perignon he starts to gather a following around him the scions of tijuana society the nineteen and twentyyearold sons of bankers lawyers doctors and government officials who like to park their cars alongside a wall by a huge ancient oak tree and talk shit with raul pretty soon the tree becomes just the treeand everyone whos anyone hangs out at el arbol like fabian martinez fabian is moviestar handsome he doesnt resemble his namesakesome old singerbeachmovie guyhe looks like a young hispanic tony curtis fabian is a handsome kid and knows it everyones been telling him this since he was six years old and the mirror is just a confirmation hes tall with copper skin and a wide sensuous mouth his black hair is full and worn slicked straight back he has bright white teethcreated by years of expensive orthodonticsand a smile that is seductive he knows this because hes practiced ita lot fabian is hanging out one day when he overhears someone say lets go kill somebody fabian looks at his cuate alejandro this is just too cool this is right out of scarface although raul barrera doesnt look anything like al pacino raul is tall and wellbuilt with big heavy shoulders and a neck that goes along with the karate moves hes always demonstrating today hes wearing a leather jacket and a san diego padres baseball cap the jewelry thoughthats like pacino raul is dripping in itthick gold chains around his neck gold bracelets on his wrists gold rings and the inevitable gold rolex watch actually fabian thinks rauls older brother looks more like al pacino but there the resemblance to scarface ends fabians met adan barrera only a few times at a nightclub with ramon at a boxing match another time at el bigteds big boy hamburger joint on avenida revolucion but adan looks more like an accountant than a narcotraficante no mink coats no jewelry very quiet and softspoken if nobody pointed him out to you you wouldnt know he was there raul you know is there today hes leaning against his bright red porsche targa talking casually about killing somebody anybody who has a grudge raul asks them who do you want hosed off the street fabian and alejandro exchange another glance theyve been cuatesbuddiesa long time almost from birth seeing as how they were born just a few weeks apart in the same hospitalscripps in san diego this was a common practice among tijuanas upper class back in the late s they went across the border to have their children so that the kids would have the advantage of dual citizenship so fabian and alejandro and most of their cuates were born in the states went to kindergarten and preschool together in the exclusive hipodromo neighborhood in the hills above downtown tijuana around the time they were ready to go into the fifth or sixth grade their mothers moved back to san diego with the children so that the kids could attend middle and high school in the states learn english become totally bicultural and make the transnational contacts that would become so important to success in later life their parents recognized that while tijuana and san diego might be in two different countries theyre in the same business community fabian alejandro and all their buddies went to the catholic allboy augustine high school in san diego their sisters went to our lady of peace their parents took a quick look at the san diego public schools and decided they didnt want their children to be that bicultural they spent their weekdays with the priests and their weekends back in tijuana partying at the country club or hitting the beach resorts of rosarito and ensenada or sometimes they stayed in san diego doing the same shit that american teenagers do on the weekendshopping for clothes in the mall going to movies heading out to pacific beach or la jolla shores partying at the house of whichever friends parents were away for the weekend and theyre away a lotone of the bonuses of being a rich kid is that your parents have the money to travel drinking screwing smoking dope these boys have cash in their pockets and dress well they always didjunior high high school fabian alejandro and their crowd wore the latest styles shopped at the best stores even now both of them in college back in baja they have the pocket money to put the best threads on their backs a lot of the time they dont spend in discos and clubs or hanging out here under el arbol they spend shopping they spend a hell of a lot more time shopping than they do studying thats for sure its not that either of them is stupid theyre not particularly fabianhes one smart kid he could ace a business course with his eyes closedwhich they are in class about half the time fabian can figure compound interest in his head by the time youve punched the numbers into your calculator he could be a terrific student but theres no need it isnt part of the plan the plan is this you go to high school in the states you come back and get gentlemens cs at college your daddy puts you into business and with all the connections youve made on both sides of the border you make money thats the life plan but the plan didnt figure on the barrera brothers moving into town it wasnt anywhere on the chart that adan and raul barrera would move into colonia hipodromo and rent a big white mansion on the hill fabian met raul at a disco hes sitting at a table with a bunch of friends and this amazing guy walks infulllength mink coat bright green cowboy boots and a black cowboy hat and fabian looks at alejandro and says will you look at this they think the dude is a joke except the joke looks at them shouts for a waiter and orders thirty bottles of champagne thirty bottles of champagne and not some cheap shit eitherdom for which he pays cash then he asks whos partying with me everybody as it turns out the party is on raul barrera the party is on period man then one day hes not just there hes taking you there like theyre sitting around el arbol one day smoking a little weed and doing some karate and raul starts talking about felizardo the boxer fabian asks cesar felizardoonly about the biggest hero in mexico no the farmworker raul answers he finishes a spinning back kick then looks at fabian yes the boxer hes fighting perez next week here in town you cant get tickets fabian answers no you cant get tickets raul says you can hes from my town raul says culiacan i used to manage himhes my viejo you guys want to go ill hook it up yes they want to go and yes raul hooks it up ringside seats the fight doesnt last longfelizardo knocks perez out in the third roundbut still its a kick the bigger kick is that raul takes them into the dressing room afterwardthey actually get to meet felizardo he stands around talking with them like theyre old buddies fabian notices something else here too felizardo treats them like buddies and raul he treats like a cuate but the boxer treats adan differently theres an air of deference in the way he talks to adan and adan doesnt stay long just comes in and quietly congratulates the boxer and then leaves but everything stops for the few minutes hes in the room yeah fabian gets the idea that the barrera brothers can take you places and not just grandstand seats at the soccer match raul takes them there or box seats at the padres games raul takes them there or even to vegas where they all fly a month later stay at the mirage lose all their fucking money watch felizardo pound the shit out of rodolfo aguilar for six rounds to retain his lightweight title then party with a platoon of highpriced call girls in rauls suite and fly homehungover fuckedout and happythe next afternoon no he gets the idea that the barreras can take you places in a hurry that you might not get in years if ever working fourteenhour days in your daddys office you hear things about the barrerasthe money they throw around comes from drugs yeah like duhbut you especially hear things about raul one of the stories theyve heard whispered about raul goes like this hes sitting in his ride outside the house bandera music blasting on the speakers and the bass turned up to sonicboom level when one of the neighbors comes out and knocks on the car window raul lowers the window yeah could you turn it down the guy screams over the music i can hear it inside its rattling the windows raul decides to fuck with him a little what he yells i cant hear you the mans in no mood to be messed with he is macho too so he hollers the music turn it down its too fucking loud raul takes his pistol from his jacket sticks it in the mans chest and pulls the trigger its not too fucking loud now is it pendejo the mans body disappears and no one complains about rauls music after that fabian and alejandro have talked about that story and decided that it must be bullshit right it cant be true its too scarface to be real but now here is raul finishing up a roach and suggesting lets go kill somebody like hes suggesting going to baskinrobbins for an ice cream cone come on raul says there must be somebody you want to get even with fabian smiles at alejandro and says all right fabians dad had given him a miata alejandros parents had kicked forth with a lexus they were out racing the cars the other night like they do a lot of nights except this one night fabian goes to pass alejandro on a twolane road and theres another car coming the other way fabian just tucks it back into his lane missing a headon crash by a pelo del chocho turns out the other driver is a guy who works in his fathers office building and recognizes the car he calls fabians dad who has a shit fit and jerks the miata for six months and now fabian is without a ride fabian tells this tale of woe to raul its a joke right its a goof a laugh stoner talk it is until a week later when the man disappears one of those rare nights that fabians dad comes home for dinner fabians there and his dad starts talking about how a man in his building is missing just dropped off the face of the earth and fabian excuses himself from the table and goes into the bathroom and splashes cold water on his face he meets alejandro later at a club and they talk about it under the cover of the booming music shit fabian says do you really think he did it i dont know alejandro says then he looks at fabian laughs and says noooooo but the man never comes back raul never says word one about it but the man never comes back and fabian is like freaked out it was just a joke he was just testing just bouncing off rauls bullshit and now because of it a man is dead and how as a school counselor might ask does that make you feel fabians surprised by the answer he feels freaked guilty and good powerful you point your finger and adios motherfucker its like sex only better two weeks later he works up the nerve to talk to raul about business they get into the red porsche and go for a drive how do i get in fabian asks in what la pista secreta fabian says i dont have a lot of money i mean not a lot of my own money you dont need money raul says i dont you have a green card yeah thats your starter kit easy as that two weeks later raul gives fabian a ford explorer and tells him to drive it across the border at otay mesa tells him what time to cross and what lane to use fabians scared as shit but its a weird good scaredits a shot of adrenaline a kick he crosses the border like it doesnt exist the man waves him right through he drives to the address raul gives him where two guys get into his explorer and he gets into theirs and then drives back to tj raul lays ten grand american on him cash fabian hooks alejandro up too theyre cuates dig buddies alejandro makes a couple of runs as his wingman and then hes in business for himself its all good theyre making money but were not making real money he tells alejandro one afternoon feels real to me but the real money is in moving coke he goes to raul and says hes ready to move up thats cool bro raul says were all about upward mobility he tells fabian how it works and even sets him up with the colombians sits with him while they make a pretty standard contractfabian will take delivery of fifty kilos of coke dropped off a fishing boat at rosarito hell take it across the border at a thousand a key a hundred of that g though goes to raul for protection bam forty gs just like that fabian does two more contracts and buys himself a mercedes like you can keep the miata dad park that japanese lawn mower and keep it parked and while youre at it you can lay off busting my chops about grades because ive already aced marketing i am already a commodities broker dad dont worry about whether you can bring me into the firm because the last thing in this world i want is a job couldnt afford the pay cut you think fabian was pulling chicks before you should see him now fabian has money hes twentyone years old and living large the other guys see it the other sons of doctors and lawyers and stockbrokers they see it and they want it pretty soon most of the guys who hang around rauls little circle at el arboldoing karate and blowing yerbaare in the business theyre driving the shit into the states or theyre making their own contracts and kicking up to raul theyre in itthe next generation of the tijuana power structureup to their necks pretty soon the group gets a nickname the juniors fabian becomes like the junior hes hanging loose down in rosarito one night when he bumps into a boxer named eric casavales and his promoter an older guy named jose miranda erics a pretty good boxer but tonight hes drunk and completely miscomprehends this soft yuppie pup he jostles in the street drinks are spilled shirts are stained words exchanged laughing casavales whips a pistol out of his waistband and waves it at fabian before jose can walk him away so casavales staggers off laughing at the scared look on rich boys face when he saw the pistol barrel and hes still laughing as fabian goes to his mercedes takes his own pistol out of the glove box finds casavales and miranda standing out in front of the boxers car and shoots them both to death fabian throws the pistol into the ocean gets back into his mercedes and drives back to tj feeling pretty good pretty good about himself thats one version of the story the otherpopular at teds big boyis that martinezs confrontation with the boxer wasnt accidental at all that casavaless promoter was holding up a fight that cesar felizardo needed in order to move up and just wouldnt budge on it even after adan barrera approached him personally with a very reasonable offer nobody knows what the real reason is but casavales and miranda are dead and later that year felizardo gets his fight for the lightweight championship and wins it fabian denies killing anyone for any reason but the more he denies it the more the stories gain credence raul even gives him a nickname el tiburon the shark because he moves like a shark through the water adan doesnt work the kidshe works the grownups lucia is an enormous help with her pedigree and oldschool style she takes him to a good tailor buys him conservative expensive business suits and understated clothes adan tries but fails to make raul undergo the same transformation if anything his brother becomes more flamboyant adding to his sinaloan narcocowboy wardrobe for instance a fulllength mink coat she takes him to the private power clubs to the french restaurants in the rio district to the private parties at the private homes in the hipodromo chapultepec and rio neighborhoods and they go to church of course theyre at mass every sunday morning they leave large checks in the collection plate make large contributions to the building fund the orphans fund the fund for aged priests they have father rivera to the house for dinner they host backyard barbecues they serve as godparents for an increasing number of the young couples just starting their families theyre like any other young upwardly mobile couple in tijuanahes a quiet serious businessman with first one restaurant then two then five shes a young businessmans wife lucia goes to the gym to lunch with the other young wives to san diego to shop at fashion valley and horton plaza she understands this as her duty to her husbands business but limits it to her duty the other wives understandpoor lucia must spend time with the poor child she wants to be home she is devoted to the church shes a godmother now to half a dozen babies it hurts hershe feels that shes doomed to stand with a stricken smile on her face holding someone elses healthy child by the baptismal font adan when hes not at home can be found in his office or in the back of one of his restaurants sipping coffee and doing the numbers on a yellow manuscript pad if you didnt know what business he was really in you would never guess it he looks like a young accountant a numberscruncher if you couldnt see the actual figures scratched in pencil on the manuscript pad you would never think that they are calculations of x kilos of cocaine times the delivery fee from the colombians minus the transport costs the protection costs the employee wages and other overhead gueros percent cut tios ten points there are more prosaic calculations as to the cost of beef tenderloin linen napkins cleaning supplies and the like for the five restaurants he now owns but most of his time is taken up with the more complicated accounting of moving tons of colombian cocaine as well as gueros sinsemilla and a small bit of heroin just to keep their hand in the market he rarely if ever sees the actual drugs the suppliers or the customers adan just handles the moneycharging it counting it cleaning it but not collecting itthats rauls business raul handles his business take the case of the two money mules who take k of barrera cash drive it across the border and keep driving toward monterrey instead of tijuana but mexican highways can be long and sure enough these two pendejos get picked up near chihuahua by the mjfp who hold them long enough for raul to get there raul is not pleased he has one mules hands stretched across a paper cutter then asks him didnt your mother ever teach you to keep your hands to yourself yes the mule screams his eyes are bulging out of his head you should have listened to her raul says then he leans all his weight on top of the blade which crunches through the mules wrists the cops rush the guy to the hospital because raul has been quite clear that he wants the handless man alive and walking around as a human message board the other errant mule does make it to monterrey but hes chained and gagged in the trunk of a car that raul drives to a vacant lot douses with gasoline and sets on fire then raul drives the cash to tijuana himself has lunch with adan and goes to a soccer match no one tries to expropriate any barrera cash for a long time adan doesnt get involved with any of this messy stuff hes a businessman its an exportimport for himexport the drugs import the cash then handle the cash which is a problem its the sort of problem a businessman wants to have of coursewhat do i do with all this moneybut its still a problem adan can wash a certain amount of it through the restaurants but five restaurants cant handle millions of dollars so hes on a constant search for laundry facilities but its all numbers to him he hasnt seen any drugs in years and no blood adan barrera has never killed anybody never as much as thrown a fist in anger no all the toughguy stuff all the enforcement goes rauls way he doesnt seem to mind quite the contrary and this division of labor makes it easier for adan to deny what really brings the money into the household and thats what he needs to get back to doing bringing the money in chapter seven christmastime and the tuberculosis old men at the nelson wheeze and cough and someone will head south until this whole thing cools off tom waitssmall change new york city december callan planes a board in one long smooth motion he runs the plane from one end of the wood to the other then steps back to examine his work it looks good he takes a piece of fine sandpaper wraps it around a block of scrap wood and starts to smooth the edge he just created things are good mostly callan reflects theyre so good because they got so bad take peaches big cocaine score actually minus zero callan got not one cent from that seeing as how all the cocaine ended up in a feebee storage locker before it could be put out on the street the feds must have had it up the whole time because as soon as peaches brought that coke into the jurisdiction of the eastern district of new york giulianis trained feebees were on it like flies on shit and peaches got indicted for possession with intent to distribute heavy weight peaches is looking at having his midlife crisis in ossining if he lives that long and he has to come up with carl sagan bail money not to mention lawyer money not to mention while all this is going on he isnt earning so peaches is like ante up boys its tax time so not only do callan and obop lose their coke investment they got to kick in to the big peaches defense fund which takes a chunk out of their kickback money extortion money and loanshark money but the good news is that they didnt get indicted on the coke for all his faults peaches is a standup guyso is little peachesand although the feds got peaches on tape talking to andor about every goombah in the greater new york metropolitan area they dont have obop or callan which callan thinks is a major fucking blessing that weight of coke puts you in for thirtytolife closer to life so thats good that makes the air very sweet just being able to smell it and know youre going to keep smelling it youre already ahead on your day but peaches is up a pole so is little peaches and word is the feds got cozzo and cozzos brother and a couple of others and theyre just waiting to try to flip big peaches to nail it down yeah good luck on that callan thinks peaches is oldschool oldschool dont roll over for nothing but hard time is the least of peaches problems because the feds have indicted big paulie calabrese not for the coke but on a boatload of other rico predicates and big paulies really sweating it because its only been a few months since that major hardon giuliani got four other bosses a century each in the penitentiary and big paulies case is coming up next that giuliani is a funny fuck well aware of the old italian toast cent annimay you live a hundred yearsexcept what he means is may you live a hundred years in the hole and giuliani wants to hit for the cyclehe wants to punch out all the heads of the old five families and it looks like paulie is going down understandably paulie dont want to die in the joint so hes a little tense hes looking to take a little of his agita out on big peaches you deal you die peaches hes screaming that hes innocent that the feds set him up that he wouldnt dream of defying his boss by dealing dope but calabrese keeps hearing rumors about tapes that have peaches talking about the coke and saying a few inflammatory things about paul calabrese himself but peaches is like tapes what tapes and the feds wont turn the tapes over to paulie because they dont intend to use them as evidence in calabreses caseyetbut calabrese knows that theyre sure as hell going to use them against peaches in his case so peaches has them and paulies demanding that he bring them around to the house at todt hill which peaches is desperate not to do because he might as well just stick a grenade up his ass reach around and pull the pin because hes on them tapes saying shit like hey you know that maid the godmother is pronging you ready for this i hear hes got this pumpup dick he uses and other choice tidbits about the godmother and what a cheap mean limpdick asshole he is not to mention a verbal rundown of the whole cimino batting order so peaches does not want paulie getting an earful of them tapes what makes it even more tense is that the cancer is finally taking neill demonte the oldschool cimino underboss and the only thing keeping the cozzo wing of the family from open rebellion so not only is that restraining influence gone but the underboss position is going to be vacant and the cozzo wing has expectations that johnny boy and not tommy bellavia better be made the new underboss i aint reporting to no fucking chauffeur peaches grumbles like he isnt already skating on skinny ice like hes going to have a fucking chance to report to anybody other than the warden or saint peter callan gets all this gossip from obop who just refuses to believe that callans getting out you cant get out obop says why not what you think you just walk away obop asks you think theres an exit door thats what i was thinking callan says why are you gonna stand in it no obop says quickly but there are people out there who have you know resentments you dont want to be out there alone thats what i want well not exactly the truth is callans in love he finishes planing the board and walks home thinking about siobhan he met her at the glocca mora pub on twentysixth and third he is sitting at the bar having a beer listening to joe burke play his irish flute and he sees her with a group of friends at a table in the front its her long black hair he notices first then she turns around and he sees her face and those gray eyes and hes done for he goes over to the table and sits down turns out her name is siobhan and shes just over frombelfast grew up onkashmir road my dad was from clonnard callan says kevin callan i heard of him she says then turns away what i came here to get away from all that then why are you in here he asks shit every other song they sing in the place is about all thatabout the troubles past present or future even now joe burke puts down the flute picks up the banjo and the band launches into the men behind the wire armoured cars and tanks and guns came to take away our sons but every man will stand behind the men behind the wire she says i dont knowits where the irish go isnt it there are other places he says have you had dinner im here with friends itd be okay with them but not with me shot down in flames then she says another time though is that another time like a polite blowoff callan asks or another time we make a date im off thursday night he takes her to an expensive place on restaurant row just outside the kitchen but well within his and obops sphere of influence not a piece of clean linen arrives in this place without him and obop give it the pass the fire inspector dont notice that the back door stays locked a beat cop always finds it convenient to stroll past the place and show the colors and sometimes a few cases of whiskey come straight off the truck without the hassle of an invoice so callan gets a prime table and attentive service jesus siobhan asks as she scans the menu can you afford this yeah what do you do she asks for work which is an awkward question this and that this being labor racketeering loansharking and contract murder that being dope it must be lucrative she says this and that he thinks shes maybe going to get up and walk out right then but instead she orders the fillet of sole callan dont know shit about wine but he stopped by the restaurant that afternoon and let it be known that whatever the girl orders the wine steward should bring the right bottle he does compliments of the house siobhan gives callan a funny look i do some work for them callan explains this and that yeah he gets up a few minutes later to go to the bathroom finds the manager and says look i want the check okay sean the owner would fucking kill me if i gave you a check because this isnt the deal the deal is whenever sean callan and stevie oleary come in they eat and no check appears and they leave a heavy cash tip for the waiter that is just understood just like its understood that they dont come in too often but spread their visits around the places on restaurant row hes nervoushe dont go out on a lot of dates and when he does usually its to the gloc or the liffey and if they eat at all its a burger or maybe some lamb stew and they usually just get shitfaced and stagger back and screw and dont hardly remember it he only comes into a place like this on business toas obop puts itshow the flag that she says wiping the final remnants of chocolate mousse off her lips was the best meal ive ever had in my entire life the bill comes and its a fucking whopper when callan looks at it he dont know how the average guy can afford to live he pulls a wad of bills from his pocket and lays them on the tray this gets him another curious look from siobhan still hes surprised when she takes him to her apartment and leads him straight into the bedroom she pulls her sweater over her head and shakes her hair out then reaches behind herself to unsnap her bra then she kicks off her shoes steps out of her jeans and gets under the covers you still have your socks on callan says my feet are still cold she says are you coming in he strips down to his underwear and waits until hes under the sheets to take off his shorts she guides him inside her she comes quickly and when hes about to come he tries to pull out but she locks her legs around him and wont let him its okay im on the pill i want you to come in me then she rolls her hips and that settles it in the morning she gets up to go to confession otherwise she tells him she cant take communion on sunday are you going to confess us he asks of course are you going to promise not to do it again he asks halfafraid the answer will be yes i wouldnt lie to a priest she says then shes out the door he falls back asleep wakes up when he feels her get back in bed with him but when he reaches for her she refuses him telling him that hell have to wait until after mass tomorrow because her soul has to be clean to take communion catholic girls callan thinks he takes her to midnight mass pretty soon theyre together most of the time too much of the time according to obop then they move in together the actress siobhan has been subletting from comes back from her tour and siobhan has to find a place to live which is not easy in new york on what a waitress makes so callan suggests she just move in with him i dont know she says thats a big step we sleep together almost every night anyway almost being the operative word there youll end up living in brooklyn brooklyns okay its okay but its a long subway ride you really want me to move in with you i really want you to move in with me the problem is his place is a shit hole a thirdfloor walkup on fortysixth and eleventh one room and a bath hes got a bed a chair a tv an oven hes never turned on and a microwave you make how much money peaches asks and you live like this its all i need except now it isnt so he starts looking for another place hes thinking about the upper west side obop dont like it it wouldnt look good he says you leaving the neighborhood theres no good places left here callan says everythings taken turns out thats not true obop drops a word to a few building managers some deposits get returned and four or five nice apartments become available for callan to choose from he picks a place on fiftieth and twelfth with a small balcony and a view of the hudson he and siobhan start playing house she starts buying stuff for the placeblankets and sheets and pillows and towels and all the female shit for the bathroom and pots and pans and dishes and dishcloths and shit which freaks him out at first but then he kind of likes it we could eat at home more she says and save a lot of money eat at home more he asks we dont eat at home at all thats what i mean she says it adds up we spend a fortune we could be saving saving for what he dont get it peaches sets him straight men live in the now eat now drink now get laid now were not thinking about the next meal the next drink the next fuckwere just happy now women live in the futureand this you better learn you dumb mick the woman is always building the nest everything she does what shes really doing is gathering twigs and leaves and shit for the nest and the nest is not for you paisan the nest is not even for her the nest is for the bambino so siobhan starts cooking more and at first he dont like ithe misses the crowds and the noise and the chatterbut then he gets to liking it likes the quiet likes looking at her as she eats and reads the paper likes wiping the dishes the hell you drying dishes for obop asks him get a dishwasher theyre expensive no theyre not obop says you go to handrigans pick out a dishwasher it comes off the back of the truck handrigan gets the insurance ill just wipe the dishes but a week later him and obop are out taking care of business and siobhans at home when the buzzer buzzes and two guys come up with a dishwasher in the box on a hand truck whats this siobhan asks a dishwasher we didnt order a dishwasher hey one of the guys says we just humped this thing up here we aint humping it back down and i aint telling obop i didnt do what he said for me to do so why dont you just be a nice girl and let us hook up the dishwasher for you she lets them put it in but its a topic of discussion when callan gets home whats this she asks its a dishwasher i know what it is she says i mean what is it im going to give fucking stevie a beating is what it is callan thinks but he says a housewarming present its a very generous housewarming present obops a generous guy its stolen isnt it depends on what you mean by stolen its going back that would be complicated whats complicated about it he dont want to explain to her that handrigan has probably already put in a claim for it and for three or four others just like it which hes sold for halfprice in a soupandsandwich scam so he just says its complicated is all im not stupid you know she says no ones said anything to her but she gets it just living in the neighborhoodgoing to the store to the cleaners dealing with the cable guy the plumbershe feels the deference with which shes treated its little thingsa couple of extra pears tossed into the basket the clothes done tomorrow instead of the day after the uncharacteristic courtesy of a cabbie the man at the newsstand the construction guys who dont hoot or whistle that night in bed she says i left belfast because i was tired of gangsters he knows what she meansthe provos have become little more than thugs controlling in belfast most of the things that well most of the things that he and obop control in the kitchen he knows what shes telling him he wants to beg her to stay but instead says im trying to get out just get out its not that simple siobhan its complicated thats right it is the old myth about only leaving toesup is just thata myth you can walk away but it is complicated you cant just up and stroll you have to ease out otherwise there are dangerous suspicions and what would i do he thinks for money he hasnt put much away his is the businessmans lamenta lot of money comes in but a lot goes out too people dont understandtheres calabreses cut and peaches right off the top then the bribesto union officials to cops then the crew gets taken care of then he and obop cut up whatevers left which is still a lot but not as much as you think and now they have to kick into the big peaches defense fund well there aint enough to retire on not enough to open a legit business and anyway he wonders what would that be what the hell am i qualified for all i know about is extortion and strongarm andface itturning the lights out on guys what do you want me to do siobhan anything what wait tables i dont see myself with a towel over my arm one of them long silences in the dark before she says then i guess i dont see myself with you he gets up the next morning shes sitting at the table drinking tea and smoking a cig you can take the girl out of ireland but he thinks he sits down across the table and says i cant get out just like that thats not how it works i need a little more time she gets right down to it one of the things he loves about hershes bottomline how much time a year i dunno thats too long but it might take that long she nods several times then says as long as youre headed toward the door okay i mean steadily toward the door yeah i get that so now a couple of months later hes trying to explain it to obop look this is all fuckedup you know i dont even know how it all got started im sitting in a bar one afternoon and eddie friel walks in and then it all just gets out of hand i dont blame you i dont blame anybody all i know is this has got to end im out as if to put a period on it he puts all his hardware into a brownpaper grocery bag and gives it to the river then goes home to have a talk with siobhan im thinking of carpentry he says you know storefronts and apartments and shit like that maybe eventually i could build cabinets and desks and stuff i was thinking of going to talk with patrick mcguigan maybe see if hed take me on as an unpaid apprentice we have enough money set aside to see us over until i can get real work sounds like a plan were gonna be poor ive been poor she says im good at it so the next morning he goes to mcguigans loft on eleventh and fortyeighth they went to sacred heart together and talk about high school for a few minutes and about hockey for a few more minutes and then callan asks if he can come to work for him youre shitting me right mcguigan says no im serious hell yes he iscallan works like a mother learning the trade shows up at seven sharp every morning with a lunch bucket in his hand and a lunchbucket attitude in his head mcguigan wasnt sure what to expect but what he really didnt expect was for callan to be a workhorse he figured him to be a drunk or a hungover druggie maybe but not the citizen who walks through the door on time every morning no the guy came to work and he came to learn callan finds he likes working with his hands at first hes all thumbshe feels like a jerk a mookbut then it starts coming along and mcguigan once he sees that callan is serious is patient takes the time to teach him things brings him along gives him small jobs to screw up until he gets to the point where he can do them without screwing up callan goes home at night tired end of the day hes physically worn outhes sore his arms achebut mentally he feels good hes relaxed hes not worried about anything theres nothing hes done during the day hes going to have bad dreams about that night he stops going around to the bars and pubs where he and obop used to hang out he dont go around the liffey or the landmark no more mostly he comes home and he and siobhan have a quick supper watch some tv go to bed one day obop shows up at the carpentry studio he stands there in the doorway looking stupid for a minute but callan aint even looking at him hes paying attention to his sanding and then obop turns around and leaves and mcguigan thinks maybe he should say something but there dont seem to be nothing to say its like callan just took care of it thats all and now mcguigan dont have to worry about the west side boyos coming by but after work callan goes and searches out obop finds him on the corner of eleventh and fortythird and they walk over to the waterfront together fuck you obop says what was that thats me telling you that my work is my work what i cant come say hello not when im working we aint what friends no more obop asks were friends i dunno says obop you dont come around no one sees you you could come have a pint sometimes you know i dont hang in the bars no more obop laughs youre gettin to be a regular fuckin boy scout arent you laugh if you want yeah i will they stand there looking across the river its a cold evening the water looks black and hard yeah well dont do me any favors obop says youre not any fuckin fun anyway since youre on this workingclasshero joelunchbucket thing its just that people are asking about you whos asking about me people peaches look obop says theres a lot of heat right now a lot of pressure people getting edgy about other people maybe talking to grand juries im not talking to anybody yeah well see that you dont callan grabs stevie by the lapels of his pea coat are you getting heavy with me stevie no a hint of a whine because you dont get heavy with me stevie im just saying you know callan lets loose of him yeah i know he knows its a lot harder to walk out than to walk in but hes doing it hes walking away and every day he gets more distance every day he gets closer to getting this new life and he likes this new life he likes getting up and going to work working hard and then coming home to siobhan having dinner going to bed early getting up and doing it all over again he and siobhan are getting along great they even talk about getting married then neill demonte dies i have to go to the funeral callan says why siobhan asks to show respect to some gangster shes pissed off shes angry and scared that hell slip back into all of it because hes struggling with all the old demons in his life and now it seems likes he just walking right back into it after hes worked so hard to walk away ill just go pay my respects and come back he says how about paying me some respect she asks how about respecting our relationship i do respect it she throws up her hands hed like to explain it to her but he doesnt want to scare her that his absence would be misunderstood that people who are already suspicious of him would get more suspicious that it might cause them to panic and do something about their suspicions do you think i want to go you must because thats what youre doing you dont understand thats right i dont understand she walks away and slams the bedroom door behind her and he hears the click of the lock he thinks about kicking the door in then thinks better of it so he just punches the wall and walks out hard to find a place to park at the cemetery what with every wise guy in the city there not to mention the platoons of local state and federal cops one of whom snaps callans picture as he walks past but callan dont care right now hes like fuck everybody and his hand hurts trouble in paradise obop says when he sees the hand go fuck yourself thats it says obop youre not getting your funeral etiquette merit badge now then he shuts up because its clear from the darkness on callans face that he aint in the mood for humor it seems like every wise guy that giuliani hasnt already put in the slammer is here you got your cozzo brothers all razorcut hair and tailored suits you got the piccones you got sammy grillo and frankie lorenzo and little nick corotti and leonard dimarsa and sal scachi you got the whole cimino family plus some genovese captainsbarney bellomo and dom cirillo and some lucchese peopletony ducks and little al darco and whats left of the colombo family now that persico is doing his hundred and even a few of the old bonanno guyssonny black and lefty ruggiero all here to pay respect to aniello demonte all here to try to sniff out how things are going to go now that demonte is dead they all know it depends on who calabrese picks to be the new underboss because with the likelihood that paulies going away the new underboss is going to be the next boss if paulie picks cozzo then therell be peace in the family but if he picks someone else look out so all the goombahs are here to try to suss it out theyre all here with one huge exception big paulie calabrese peaches just cant believe it everyones waiting for his big black limo to pull up so they can start the service but it doesnt arrive the widow is appalled she doesnt know what to do and finally johnny cozzo steps up and says lets get started guy doesnt go to his own underbosss funeral peaches says after the service that is wrong that is just wrong he turns to callan im glad to see you here anyway where the fuck you been around you aint been around me callans not in the mood you guineas dont own me he says you watch your fucking mouth come on jimmy obop says hes good people so peaches says to callan i hear youre supposed to be what a carpenter now yeah peaches says i knew a carpenter got nailed to a cross when you come for me jimmy callan says come in a hearsebecause thats how youre leaving cozzo moves in between them what the fuck he says you wanna make more tapes for the feds what do you want now the jimmy peaches live album i need you fucking guys to stick together now shake hands peaches puts out his hand to callan callan takes it and peaches wraps his other hand around the back of callans head and pulls him close shit kid im sorry its the tension its the grief i know me too i love you you dumb fucking mick peaches whispers in his ear you want out good for you youre out you go build your cabinets and desks and whatever and be happy all right life is short you gotta be happy while you can thank you jimmy peaches releases callan and says loudly ill beat this drug thing well have a party okay okay callans invited back to the ravenite with the rest of them but he doesnt go he goes home finds a parking spot walks up the stairs and waits outside the door for a minute working up his nerve before he can turn the key and go in shes there sitting in a chair by the window reading a book starts to cry when she sees him i didnt think you were going to come back i didnt know if you were going to be here he bends over and hugs her she holds him very tightly when she lets go he says i was thinking we could go get a christmas tree they pick a pretty one its small and a little sparse it isnt a perfect tree but it suits them they put some corny christmas music on and theyre busy decorating their tree the rest of the night they dont even know that big paulie calabrese has named tommy bellavia as his new underboss they come for him the next night callans walking home from work the front of his jeans and the tops of his shoes covered with sawdust its a cold night so he has the collar of his coat pulled up around his neck and his watch cap pulled low over his ears so he doesnt see or hear the car until it pulls up beside him a window slides down get in theres no gun nothing sticking out its not needed callan knows that sooner or later hes going to get in the carif not this one the next oneso he gets in slides into the front seat lifts his arms and lets sal scachi unbutton his coat and feel under his arms the small of his back down his legs so its true scachi says when hes done youre a civilian now yeah a citizen scachi says the fuck is this sawdust yeah sawdust shit i got it on my coat a nice coat callan thinks has to be five bills scachi pulls onto the west side highway heads uptown and then pulls under a bridge and stops a good spot callan thinks to put a bullet into somebody conveniently near the water he hears his heart thumping so does scachi nothing to be afraid of here kid what do you want from me sal one last job scachi says i dont do that kind of work no more he looks across the river at the lights of jersey such as they are maybe me and siobhan should move to jersey he thinks get a little distance from this shit and then we could walk along the river and look at the lights of new york you dont have a choice kid scachi says either youre with us or youre against us and youre too dangerous for us to let you be against us youre billy the kid callan i mean youve shown from day one you got a taste for revenge right remember eddie friel yeah i remember eddie friel callan thinks i remember i was scared for myself and scared for stevie and the gun came out and up like something else was moving it and i remember the look in eddie friels eyes as the bullets smacked into his face i remember i was seventeen years old and id give anything to have been anywhere but in that bar that afternoon some people gotta go kid scachis saying and it would be impolitic for anyone actually in the family to do it you understand i understand callan thinks big paulie wants to purge the cozzo wing of the familyjohnny boy jimmy peaches little peachesbut he also wants to be able to deny that he did it blame it on the wild irish we have killing in our blood and i do have a choice he thinks i can kill or i can die no he says no what im not killing any more people look im not doing it callan repeats if you want to kill me kill me he feels free all of a sudden like his soul is already in the air flying over this dirty old town cruising around the stars you got a girl right crash back to earth her names something funny scachis saying like its not spelled the way its pronounced something irish right no i rememberits like old dress material girls used to wear chiffon what is it to this dirty world you think scachis saying something happens to you theyre just going to leave her to run to giuliani repeat pillow talk you guys maybe had she dont know anything yeah but whos going to take the chance huh there aint nothin i can do about it callan thinks even if i grabbed sal right here took his gun and emptied it into his mouthwhich i could doscachis a made guy and theyd kill me and theyd still kill siobhan too who callan asks who do you want me to kill noras phone rings wakes her up shes sleepy having been out on a late date do you want to work a party haley asks i dont think so nora says shes surprised that haleys asking her shes a long way past working parties this ones a little different haley says it is a party they want several girls but its all going to be oneonone youve been specifically asked for some kind of corporate christmas party in a manner of speaking nora looks at the digital clock on her alarm radio its in the morning she needs to get up have her coffee and grapefruit and get to the gym come on haleys saying itll be fun im even going where is it thats the other fun thing haley says the partys in new york thats some tree all right nora says to haley theyre standing by the skating rink in rockefeller plaza looking up at the enormous christmas tree the plaza is packed with tourists carols blare through loudspeakers salvation army santas ring bells streetcart vendors hawk warm chestnuts see haley says i told you itd be fun it has been nora admits to herself six of them five working girls and haley flew firstclass on a redeye were picked up by two limos at la guardia and driven to the plaza hotel nora had been there before of course but never at christmastime and it did seem different beautiful and oldfashioned with all the decorations up and her room had a view of central park where even the horse carriages were festooned with holly wreaths and poinsettia she took a nap and a shower then she and haley set out on a serious shopping expedition to tiffanys and bergdorfs and sakshaley buying nora mostly just looking spend a little haley said youre so cheap im not cheap nora says im conservative because a thousand dollars is not just a thousand dollars to her its the interest on a thousand dollars invested over the course of say twenty years its an apartment in montparnasse and the ability to live there comfortably so she doesnt spend money loosely because she wants her money out there working for her but she does buy two cashmere scarvesone for herself and one for haleybecause it is very cold and because she wants to give haley a present here she says when they step back out onto the street she pulls the chalkgray scarf from the bag wrap up for me i dont want you to catch cold how sweet you are nora wraps her own scarf around her neck then adjusts her fauxfur hat and coat its one of those clear cold new york city days when a breath of air is startling in its frigid intensity and the wind comes rushing down the canyons that are the avenues to bite your face and make your eyes water so when noras eyes tear up as she looks at haley she tells herself its the cold have you ever seen the tree haley asks what tree the christmas tree in rockefeller center haley says i guess not come on so now theyre standing gawking at the huge tree and nora has to admit that shes having fun the last christmas this is the point jimmy peaches is making to sal scachi its my last freaking christmas outside the joint hes saying calling phone booth to phone booth to leave the feds out of the conversation for once for a long freaking time they got me dead to rights sally im going away for thirtytolife this fucking rockefeller act by the time i get pussy again i probably wont care but but nothing peaches says its my party and i want a big fucking steak i want to go to the copa with a beautiful babe on my arm i wanna hear vic damone sing and then i want to get the worlds best piece of ass and fuck until my dick is sore think of how it will look jimmy my dick the fact that youre bringing five hookers to the sitdown sal says hes pissed hes wondering when and if jimmy peaches will ever grow the fuck up the guy is a loose fucking cannon you bust your balls to get something set up right then this fat horny fuck does something like fly five working girls in from fucking california just what he needsfive people in the room who arent supposed to be there five innocent fucking bystanders what does john think about this john thinks its my party fucking a he does peaches thinks john

nora the bestlooking most delectable piece hes ever had ass like a ripe peach hes never gotten her out of his head putting her on all fours and slamming her from behind watching those peaches quiver okay sal says how about meeting the women at the copa after sparks fuck that jimmy what this is serious business tonight i know that i mean it doesnt get more serious which is why peaches says im going to do some serious partying look sal says bringing the hammer down im in charge of security for this thing then make sure im secure peaches says thats all you gotta do sal then forget about it okay i dont like it dont like it peaches says fuck you merry christmas yeah sal thinks as he hangs up merry christmas to you jimmy i got your present all ready for you there are a few packages under the tree good thing its a small tree because there arent many presents money being tight and all but hes gotten her a new watch and a silver bracelet and some of those vanilla candles she likes and there are a few packages for himthey look like clothes which he needs a new work shirt maybe some new jeans a nice little christmas they were planning to go to midnight mass open presents in the morning try to cook a turkey hit an afternoon movie a nice quiet little christmas but that aint gonna happen callan thinks not now it was going to end anyway but it ends quicker because she finds the other package the one he shoved way under the bed he comes home early from work that evening and shes sitting there with the long box at her feet shes turned the tree lights on they blink red and green and white behind her whats this she asks howd you get that i was dusting under the bed she says what is it its a swedish model garl gustaf mm submachine gun with a folding metal stock and a thirtysixround magazine more than enough to do the job numbers filed off clean and untraceable only twentytwo inches long with the stock folded weighs eight pounds he can carry the box like a christmas present down to midtown drop the box and carry the gun under his pea coat sal had it delivered he doesnt tell her all that what he says is stupid and obvious you werent supposed to see that she laughs i thought it was a present for me i was feeling guilty for opening it siobhan youre back into it again arent you she says gray eyes hard as stone youre doing another job i have to why he wants to tell her but he cant let her carry that weight around with her the rest of her life so he says you wouldnt understand oh i understand she says im from kashmir road remember belfast i grew up watching my brothers and uncles leave the house with their little christmas boxes going out to kill people ive seen machine guns under the bed before its why i lefti was sick of the killing and the killers like me i thought youd changed i have she gestures down to the box i have to he repeats why she asks whats so important its worth killing for you he thinks you are but he stands there mute a dumb witness against himself i wont be here when you come back this time she says im not coming back he says i have to go away for a while jesus she says were you planning on telling me or were you just going to go i was planning on asking you to come with me its true he has two passports two sets of tickets he digs them out from the bottom of the desk drawer and lays them on top of the box at her feet she doesnt pick them up she doesnt even look at them just like that she asks a voice inside him is screaming tell her tell her youre doing it for her for the both of you beg her to come he starts to tell her but then he cant she would never forgive herself being part of it shed never forgive you i love you he says i love you so much she gets up from the chair comes close and says i dont love you i did but i dont now i dont love what you are a killer he nods youre right he walks past her puts his ticket and passport into his pocket closes the box and hefts it over his shoulder you can live here if you want he says the rents paid i cant live here this was a good place though he thinks looking around the small apartment the happiest best place of his life this place this time here with her he stands there trying to think of the words to tell her that but nothing comes out get out she says go murder somebody thats what you do isnt it yeah he gets out in the street its raining like hell a cold icy rain he pulls up his collar and looks back up at the apartment sees her still sitting by the window bent over her face in her hands the tree lights blinking red and green and white behind her her dress sparkles in the lights a sequined top of red and green very christmasy haley had said very sexy tres decollete in fact jimmy peaches cant help looking down her dress otherwise she has to admit that hes acting the gentleman cleans up surprisingly well in his steel gray armani even the black shirt and tie dont seem horrible a touch of goombah chic perhaps but not entirely gross same with the restaurant she expected some gaudy sicilian horror show but sparks steak house despite the prosaic name turns out to be done in understated good taste not her tastethe oakpaneled walls and hunting prints basically the english look are not her thing but its tasteful all the same and not at all what she expected from a mob hangout they arrived in several limos and a doorman held an umbrella to cover the two feet between the car and the long green awning they make quite an entrance the wise guys with their dates on their arms diners sitting at tables in the big front room stop eating and openly stare and why not nora thinks the girls are fantastic haleys best served to order chosen by their hair color their faces their figures cool lovely sophisticated women without a touch of the whore about them elegantly dressed impeccably coiffed beautifully mannered the men practically blush with pride as they make their entrance the women dontthey take the adulation as their birthright they take no visible notice of it a properly obsequious headwaiter shows them to the private room in the back everyone watches them go in well not everyone not callan he misses their entrance hes around the corner on third avenue waiting for the word to move in closer he sees the limos come working their way through the thick rushhour holiday traffic then turning right onto fortysixth toward sparks so he figures that johnny boy and the piccones and obop have arrived for the sitdown he checks his watch its dead on time scachis there to greet them all the wise guys and the girls in turn hes the host right he set up the meeting he even sneaking a glance down her dress kisses noras hand a pleasure he says god he can see why peaches would want her for his last ride an incredible beauty they all are but this one johnny boy takes scachi by the arm sal he says just wanted to take a minute to thank you for setting this up i know it took a lot of diplomatic work a lot of details if we get the result we hope for tonight maybe we can have peace in the family thats all i want johnny and a place for you at the table im not looking for that scachi says i just love my family johnny i love this thing of ours i want to see it stay strong unified thats what we want too sally i gotta go out check on things sal says sure johnny boy says now you can call and tell the king he can make his entrance now that the peasants are here see thats just the kind of attitude johnny boy laughs merry christmas sal they hug and exchange kisses on the cheeks merry christmas johnny sal puts on his coat and starts to go oh and johnny yeah happy fucking new year sal steps outside under the awning miserable fucking night sheets of rain coming down threatening to turn into an ice storm the drive back to brooklyns going to be a bitch and a half he takes the small walkietalkie from his overcoat pocket and holds it under his collar and against his mouth you there yeah callan says im calling the boss in sal says so the clocks on everythings good just like we talked sal says you got ten minutes kid callan walks over to a trash can drops the box into it slides the gun under his coat and starts to walk down fortysixth street into the rain the champagne flows over the glass to laughs and giggles what the hell peaches announces champagne we got he fills all the glasses nora lifts hers she wont really drink it but shell take a sip for the upcoming toast anyway she likes the bubbles in her nose a toast peaches says hey we got some bad stuff in our lives but we got some good stuff too so dont nobody be sad this holiday life is beautiful we have plenty to celebrate in this season of hope nora thinks then all hell breaks loose callan opens his coat and swings the gun out pulls back the bolt as he aims through the driving rain bellavia sees him first hes just finished opening the car door for mr calabrese and he looks over and sees callan theres a small glimmer first of recognition and then of alarm in the mans piggish eyes and he starts to ask what are you doing out here but then he realizes the answer and goes for his own gun inside his coat much too late his arm is blasted away as the mm parabellum rounds stitch across his chest he falls back against the open door of the black lincoln continental then slumps onto the sidewalk callan turns the gun on calabrese their eyes meet for half a second before callan pulls the trigger again the old man staggers then seems to melt into a puddle with the rain callan steps in and stand above the two crumpled bodies holds the barrel near bellavias head and squeezes the trigger twice bellavias head bounces off the wet concrete then callan places the barrel to calabreses temple and pulls the trigger callan drops the gun turns around and walks east toward second avenue the blood flows down the gutter after him nora hears the screams the door flies open the headwaiter comes in yelling that someones been shot outside nora stands up they all do but they dont know why dont know whether to run outside or stay where they are then sal scachi comes in to tell them everyone stay put he orders someone killed the boss noras like what boss who now the keening of sirens drowns out everything else and she jumps as pop her heart is in her throat everyone startles as johnny boy still sitting pours the champagne into his glass a cars waiting at the corner the rear passenger door opens and callan gets in the car turns east on fortyseventh goes to the fdr and heads uptown there are fresh clothes in the back callan takes his own clothes off and wriggles into the new ones all the while the driver doesnt say nothing just efficiently works his way through the brutal traffic so far callan thinks its gone just the way theyd planned it bellavia and calabrese arrived expecting to find a crime scene their colleagues brutally murdered and the stage set for their own weeping and gnashing of teeth and cries of we came here to make peace in our family only thats not what sal scachi and the rest of the family had in mind you deal you die but if you dont deal you die anyway because thats where the money and the power are and if you let the other families get all the money and the power youre just on a slow road to suicide that was scachis reasoning and it was correct so calabrese had to go and johnny boy had to become king its a generational thing sal had explained on their long walk in riverside park out with the old in with the new of course it will take a while for it all to shake out johnny boy will deny any involvement because the heads of the other four families or whats left of them would never accept his doing this without their permission which they would never have given a king scachi had lectured him will never sanction the assassination of another king so johnny boy will swear that hell track down the drugdealing cocksuckers who killed his boss and therell be a few recalcitrant calabrese loyalists wholl have to follow their boss to the next world but it will all shake out in the end johnny boy will reluctantly allow himself to be chosen as the new boss the other bosses will accept him and the dope will flow again uninterrupted from colombia to honduras to mexico to new york where its going to be a white christmas after all but i wont be here to see it callan thinks he opens the canvas bag on the floor as agreed a hundred thousand dollars in cash a passport airline tickets sal scachi set it all up a ride to south america and a new gig the car makes it onto the triborough bridge callan looks out the window and even through the rain can see the manhattan skyline somewhere in there he thinks was my life the kitchen sacred heart the liffey pub the landmark the glocca morra the hudson michael murphy and kenny maher and eddie friel and jimmy boylan larry moretti and matty sheehan and now tommy bellavia and paulie calabrese and the living ghosts jimmy peaches and obop siobhan he looks back at manhattan and what he sees is their apartment her coming to the table for breakfast on saturday mornings her hair mussed no makeup so beautiful sitting there with her over a cup of coffee and the newspaper mostly unread and looking out over the gray hudson with jersey on the other side callan grew up on fables cuchulain edward fitzgerald wolfe tone roddy mccorley padraic pearse james connelly sean south sean barry john kennedy bobby kennedy bloody sunday jesus christ they all ended bloody chapter eight days of the innocents in rama was there a voice heard lamentation and weeping and great mourning rachel weeping for her children and would not be comforted for they are not matthew tegucigalpa honduras san diego california guadalajara mexico art sits on a park bench integucigalpa and watches a man in a maroon adidas tracksuit leave his building across the street ramon mette has seven of the suitsone for each day of the week every day he puts on a fresh one and leaves his mansion in suburban tegus for a threemile jog flanked by two security guards in matching outfits except theirs are bulging in unusual places to allow for the macs they carry to keep him safe on his jogs so mette goes out every morning runs a threemile roundtrip and returns to the mansion and takes a shower while one of the bodyguards whips up a fruit smoothie in the blender mango papaya grapefruit and this beinghonduras bananas then he takes his drink out onto the patio and sips it while he reads the paper makes some phone calls conducts a little business then goes to his private gym to pump some iron thats his routine by the clock every day for months except this one morning the bodyguard opens the door a sweaty puffing mette goes in and a pistol butt slams into the side of his head he slides onto his knees in front of art keller his bodyguard stands helplessly with his hands up as a blackclad honduran secretservice trooper points an m at his head there have to be fifty troopers standing there which is odd mette thinks through a haze of pain and dizziness because dont i own the secret service apparently not because none of them do shit as art keller kicks mette square in the teeth stands over him and says i hope you enjoyed your jog because its the last youre ever going to get so mettes drinking his own blood instead of a fruit smoothie as art slips the old black hood over his head ties it tight and frogmarches him to a waiting van with tinted windows and this time theres no one there to object as they haul him onto an air force plane for a flight to the dominican republic where hes taken to the american embassy arrested for the murder of ernie hidalgo taken to another plane and flown to san diego where hes promptly arraigned denied bail and put in a solitary cell in the federal holding facility all of this touches off riots in the streets oftegucigalpa where thousands of angry citizens incited and paid for by mettes lawyers burn the american embassy in protest against yanqui imperialism they want to know where this american cop gets the huevos to come into their country and snatch one of their prominent citizens a lot of people inwashington are wondering the same thing they would also like to know where art keller the disgraced former rac of the closedguadalajara office gets the balls to create an international incident and not just the balls but the package to pull it off how the hell did that happen quito fuentes is a smalltime operator he is now and he was in when he drove the tortured ernie hidalgo from the safe house inguadalajara to the ranch in sinaloa now he lives intijuana where he does smalltime dope deals with smalltime americans coming across the border for a quick score you do that kind of business you dont want to show up light in case one of the yanqui kids decides hes a real bandito and tries to take your dope and make a run for the border no you want some weight on your hip andquito s current piece is well a piece of shit quitoneeds a new gun which contrary to public image is hard to come by inmexico where the federales and the state police like to have a monopoly on firepower lucky forquito living as he does in tj hes right next door to the worlds biggest arms supermarket los estados unidos so hes all ears when paco mendez calls fromchula vista to tell him hes got a deal for him a clean mac he just has to move allquito has to do is come pick it up butquito doesnt like to venture north of the border anymore not since the thing with the yanqui cop hidalgo quitoknows hes pretty safe from arrest on that thing inmexico but in theunited states it might be a different story so he tells paco thanks but no thanks and couldnt he just bring it down to tj its more of a hopeful question than a realistic one because you have to be either a very well connected or b some kind of fucking moron to try to smuggle any firearm never mind a machine pistol intomexico if you got caught the federales would beat you like wet laundry on a dry line then youd catch a minimum twoyear sentence in a mexican prison paco knows that they dont feed you in mexican prisonsthats your familys problem and paco doesnt have family inmexico anymore and as hes neither well connected nor a fucking moron he tellsquito he doesnt think he can make that trip but as paco has to turn this gun into some quick cash he tellsquito let me think about it ill call you back he hangs up and tells art keller he wont come over then you have a big problem art says no shit a big problema cocaine and a gun charge and just in case paco isnt gripping hard enough already art adds ill take it federal and ill ask the judge for consecutive sentences im trying paco whines you dont get points for effort art says youre a real ballbuster you know that i know that art says do you know that paco slumps in his chair okay art says just get him to the fence yeah well do the rest so paco gets back on the horn and arranges to make the deal at the rickety chainlink border fence alongcoyotecanyon nomansland you go intocoyotecanyon at night youd better bring a gun and even that might not be enough because a lot of gods children got guns incoyotecanyon a big scar in the rolling hills of barren dirt that flank the ocean along the border the canyon runs from the north edge of tj for about two miles into theunited states and it is bandit country late in the afternoon thousands of wouldbe immigrants start forming up on either side of the canyon on a ridge above the dry aqueduct that is the actual border when the sun goes down they make a rush through the canyon simply overwhelming the outmanned border patrol agents its the law of numbersmore get through than get caught and even if you get caught theres always tomorrow maybe because real banditos get into the canyon and lie in wait like predators for the herd of mojados to come through pick off the weak and the wounded rob rape and murder take what little cash the illegals have drag their women into the bushes and rape them then maybe slit their throats so you want to come pick oranges in los estados unidos you have to run the gauntlet ofcoyotecanyon and in that chaos in the dust from a thousand running feet in the darkness amid screams gunfire and flashing blades with the border patrol vehicles roaring up and down hills like cowboys trying to control a stampede which they are which it is a lot of business gets done along the fence deals for dope for sex for guns and thats whatquito s doing as he crouches by a hole cut in the fence gimme the gun gimme the money quitocan see the mac glittering in the moonlight so hes pretty sure his old cuate pacos not going to rip him off so he reaches through the hole to hand paco the cash and paco grabs not the money but his wrist and holds on quitotries to pull back but now there are three yanquis grabbing him and one of them says youre under arrest for the murder of ernie hidalgo andquito says you cant arrest me im inmexico no problem art says then starts to pull him into the united states just starts yanking him through the hole in the fence but one of the jagged pieces of the cut fence snags quitos pants but art keeps pulling and the sharp wire piercesquito s butt then pokes out the other side so hes lying there basically impaled through the left butt cheek and hes screaming im stuck im stuck art doesnt carehe braces his feet against the american side of the fence and just pulls the wire rips through quitos butt and now hes really screaming because hes hurt and bleeding and in america and the yanquis are punching the shit out of him and then they stick a rag in his mouth to shut him up and handcuff him and theyre carrying him toward a jeep and quito sees a border patrol agent and tries to scream for help but the migra just turns his back like he dont see nothing quitotells all this to the judge who looks solemnly down at art and asks him where the arrest took place the defendant was arrested in theunited states your honor art says he was on american soil the defendant claims you pulled him through the fence then asquito s public defender literally hops up and down with indignation art answers theres not a word of truth to that your honor mr fuentes came into the country of his own volition to purchase an illegal firearm we can offer a witness would that be mr mendez yes your honor your honor the pd says mr mendez obviously has made a deal with there was no deal art says my hand to god next the doctors not going to be so easy doctor alvarez has a thriving gynecology practice inguadalajara and he isnt leaving theres nothing on earth thats going to lure him across or even near the border he knows the dea is aware of his

misery i dont know soft and bored art says dont tell me youre not bored sitting here day after day cranking out tamales for tourists youve kept up with the news you know i got mette and fuentes

sees her out the door says good night to his receptionist and steps back into his private office to gather up some papers before going home he doesnt hear the seven men come through the outer door he doesnt hear anything until ramos steps into his office points a stun gun at his ankle and shoots alvarez falls to the floor and rolls in pain youve seen your last funciete doctor ramos says no chocho where youre going and shoots him again ramos says hurts like a bastard doesnt it yes alvarez moans if it were up to me id put a bullet in your head right now ramos says lucky for you it isnt up to me now youre going to do everything i say arent you yes good they blindfold him wrap telephone ties around his wrists and take him out the back door to a car waiting in the alley and shove him into the backseat where they make him lie on the floor ramos gets in and sets his feet on alvarezs neck and they drive to a safe house in the suburbs they bring him into the darkened living room and take off the blindfold alvarez starts to cry when he sees the tall man stretched out in the chair in front of him do you know who i am art asks ernie hidalgo was my close friend un hermano sangre de mi sangre alvarez is trembling uncontrollably now you were his torturer art says you scraped his bones with metal skewers you shoved whitehot iron rods inside him you gave him shots to keep him conscious and alive no alvarez says dont lie to me art says it only makes me angrier i have you on tape a stain emerges on the front of the doctors pants and spreads down one leg hes pissing himself ramos says strip him they pull his shirt off and leave it dangling around his bound wrists jerk his pants and his shorts down to his ankles alvarezs eyes widen in little orbs of terror all the more so when kleindeist says take a whiff what do you smell alvarez shakes his head from the kitchen kleindeist says think hardyouve smelled it before no okaymetal heating a piece of rebar over the stove one of ramos men comes in holding the redhot glowing metal in an oven mitt alvarez faints wake him up art says ramos shoots him in the calf alvarez comes to and screams bend him over the couch they heave alvarez over the arm of the couch two men hold his arms and spread them wide two others pin his feet to the floor the other man brings over the hot iron and shows it to him no please no i want the names art says of everyone you saw in the house with ernie hidalgo and i want them now no problema alvarez starts talking like a comic speedreader on crank adan barrera raul barrera he says angel barrera guero mendez what adan barrera raul barrera no art snaps the last name guero mendez he was there si si si he was the leader senor alvarez takes a gulp of air then says he killed hidalgo how an overdose of heroin alvarez says an accident we were going to free him i swear la verdad pick him up art looks at the sobbing doctor and says youre going to write out a statement telling all about your involvement all about the barreras and mendezde acuerdo de acuerdo then youre going to write another statement art says affirming that you were not tortured or compelled to make this statement in any wayde acuerdo si then regaining his composure he starts to deal will you offer me some kind of consideration for my cooperation ill put in a good word for you art says they sit him down at the kitchen table with paper and pen an hour later both statements are finished art reads them puts them in his briefcase and says now youre going for a little trip no senor alvarez screams he knows all about little trips they usually involve shovels and shallow graves to the united states art says we have a plane waiting at the airport youre going of your free will i assume yes of course goddamn right of course art thinks the man just dropped a dime on the barreras and guero mendez his life expectancy in mexico is approximately nil art hopes his longevity in marion federal penitentiary will be of old testament proportions two hours later they have alvarez cleaned up and with a fresh pair of pants on a plane to el paso where he is arrested and arraigned in the torture murder of ernie hidalgo at his jailing hes photographed naked from his head to his knees to show that he hasnt been tortured and art faithful to his promise puts in a good word for alvarez through the federal prosecutors he doesnt seek the death penalty he wants life in prison without the possibility of parole life without hope the mexican government protested and a squadron of american civilliberties lawyers joined them but both mette and alvarez are sitting in marion federal maximum security prison awaiting their appeals quito fuentes is in a san diego jail cell and no one has laid a restraining hand on art keller those who would cant and those who can wont because he lied art lied his ass off to the senate committee that investigated rumors that the cia was somehow complicit with the contras armsfordrugs dealings art still has a transcript of his testimony running in his head like the sound track of a movie you cant shut off q have you ever heard of an airfreight company called setco a remotely q are you now or were you ever of the belief that setco airplanes were being used to transport cocaine a i have no knowledge on that subject q did you ever hear of something called the mexican trampoline a no q may i remind you that youre under oath a yes q have ever heard of tiwg a whats that q the terrorist incident working group a not until just now q how about nsd directive a no q the nhao arts lawyer leaned across and said into the microphone counsel if you just want to go fishing may i suggest you charter a boat q have you ever heard of nhao a only recently in the newspapers q did anyone at nhao pressure you in regard to your testimony im not going to let this go on much longer arts lawyer said q did colonel craig for instance pressure you this question had the intended effect of waking up the press colonel scott craig was shoving the american flag pole and all right up another committees butt as it tried to pin him to the armsforhostages deal with the iranians in the process craig was becoming an american folk hero a media darling a television patriot the country focused in on the irancontra sideshow the shitty gunsforhostages deal and never caught on to the real scandalthat the administration had helped the contras deal drugs for arms so the suggestion that colonel craig whom art had last seen at ilopongo offloading cocaine had pressured keller into silence was a dramatic moment thats outrageous counselor arts lawyer said q i agree will your client answer the question a i came here to answer your questions truthfully and accurately and thats what im attempting to do q so would you answer the question a ive never met nor had any conversations with colonel craig on any subject whatsoever the media went back to sleep q how about something called cerberus mr keller did you ever hear of that a no q did something called cerberus have anything at all to do with the murder of agent hidalgo a no althea left the gallery at that answer later at the watergate she told him maybe a bunch of senators cant tell when youre lying art but i can can we just go and have a nice dinner with the kids art asked how could you what align yourself with a bunch of rightwing stop he held his hand up and turned his back to her hes tired of hearing it hes tired of hearing everything althea thought if he was remote during their last few months in guadalajara that was a goddamn honeymoon compared to the man who came home from mexico or didnt come home not the man she recognized as her husband he didnt want to talk didnt want to listen spent most of his long administrative leave sitting alone out by her parents pool or taking long lone walks through pacific palisades or down on the beach hed sit at dinner barely speaking or worse launching into an angry diatribe about how politics is all bullshit then excusing himself to go upstairs alone or out for a nocturnal stroll late nights hed lie in bed thumbing the tv remote like some kind of speed freak switching from channel to channel pronouncing everything crap and more crap on the increasingly rare occasions that they would make love if you wanted to call it that he was aggressive and quick as if he were trying to work out his anger rather than express his love or even his lust im not a punching bag she said one night as he lay on top of her in one of his spectacular postcoital depressions ive never hit you thats not what i meant he remained a dutiful if wooden father he did all the daddy things he used to do but now it was more like he was just going through the motions like a robot version of art taking the kids to the park robot art showing michael how to bodyboard robot art playing tennis with cassie the kids knew althea tried to get him to see someone he laughed a shrink a shrink a counselor somebody all they do is give you drugs he said christ then take them she thought it got worse when the subpoenas came the meetings with dea bureaucrats administration officials congressional investigators and lawyersgod so many lawyers she was worried that the legal fees would bankrupt them but all he would say was not to worry its taken care of she never knew where the money was coming from but it was coming because she never saw a legal bill not one art of course refused to discuss it im your wife shed pleaded one night why wont you open up to me there are things you cant know about he said he wanted to talk to her tell her everything get close again but he couldnt it was like there was this invisible wall this sciencefiction force fieldnot between them but inside himthat he just couldnt break through it was as if he spent all his time walking through water underwater looking up at the light of the real world but seeing only the waterdistorted faces of his wife and his kids unable to reach up reach through and touch them unable to let them touch him instead he dove deeper retreated into silence the slow poison of a marriage that day at the watergate he looked at althea and knew that she knew hed taken a divelay down and lied for the administration helped them cover up a shitty deal that had put crack out onto the streets of american ghettos what she didnt know was why this is why art thinks now as he peers through the window blinds across the way at cosmos street where tio barrera is holed up i got you now motherfucker art says and no ones going to snatch you out of it this time tios been switching residences every few days moving around between his dozen apartments and condos in guadalajara whether its a result of his fearing arrest or as rumor has it because hes been smoking his own product tio has become increasingly paranoid with good reason art thinks hes been watching tio in this place for three days now thats a long time for tio to be in any one place hell probably move again this afternoon or thinks he will art has his own plans for tios next move but it has to be done right his government has promised the mexican government that it will be done with no fuss no muss above all with no collateral casualties and art has to disappear as soon as possiblethis has to look like a mexican operation all the way a triumph for the federales whatever art thinks i dont care tio as long as it ends with you in a prison cell he crouches by the window and peeks out again the reward for my years in the desert as he came to call that godawful stretch of and when he maneuvered through the minefield of investigations sweated out the perjury indictment that never came watched as one president left office and his vice presidentthe same man who had run the secret war against the sandinistascame in my years in the desert art recalls transferred from one desk job to another as his marriage dried up as he and althea retreated into separate rooms and separate lives as althea finally demanded a divorce and he fought it every step of the way even now art thinks a fresh set of divorce papers sits unsigned on the kitchenette table of his barren little apartment in downtown san diego i will never art told his wife let you take my kids eventually peace came not to the kellers but to nicaragua elections were held the sandinistas were tossed out the secret war came to end and about five minutes later art went to john hobbs to claim his reward the destruction of every man involved in the murder of ernie hidalgo a laundry list ramon mette quito fuentes doctor alvarez guero mendez raul barrera adan barrera and miguel angel barrera tio whatever art might have thought about the president john hobbs colonel scott craig and sal scachi they were men of their word art keller was given a free hand and all possible cooperation he went on his tear as a result hobbs had said we have a burned embassy in honduras and a raging civilliberties battle and our diplomatic relationship with mexico is in ashes to stretch the metaphor to the breaking point state would like to host an autodafe for you to which justice will bring the marshmallows but im confident art says that i have the full support of the white house and the president which was art reminding hobbs that before the current president occupied the white house he was busy funding the contras with cocaine so lets not hear any more bullshit about state and justice the extortion worked art got permission to go after tio not that this had been easy to arrange negotiations at the highest level and art hadnt even been involved hobbs went to los pinos the presidents residence to make the deal the arrest of miguel angel barrera would remove one stumbling block to the passage of nafta nafta is the key the absolutely essential key to mexican modernization with it in place mexico can move ahead into the next century without it the economy will stagnate and collapse and the country will remain a third world backwater forever mired in poverty so theyll trade barrera as part of the deal for nafta but theres another more troublesome condition this is the last arrest this closes the books on the hidalgo murder art keller wont even be allowed back in the country after this so hell get barrera but not adan raul or guero mendez thats okay art thinks i have plans for them but first tio so now art watches and waits the problem is tios three bodyguards cerberus again art thinks the unavoidable threeheaded guard dog armed with mm machine pistols aks and hand grenades and willing to use them not that it worries art overmuch his team has firepower too there are twentyfive special federale officers with ms sniper rifles and the whole swat arsenal not to mention ramos and his crew of privateers but the mexican mandate was we can absolutely not have a gun battle in the streets of guadalajara it just cannot happen and art is determined to live up to the deal so theyre trying to find an opening its the girl who gives it to them barreras latest stringyhaired mistress she wont cook art has watched the past three mornings as the bodyguards have trooped out to a local comida to buy their breakfast listened through sound detectors at the arguments her shouting their grumbling as they go out and come back twenty minutes later nourished and ready for a long day of guarding miguel angel not today art thinks going to be a short day today they should be coming out he says to ramos dont worry i worry art says what if she gets a sudden attack of domesticity that pig ramos asks forget it now if she were my woman shed cook breakfast shed wake up in the morning whistling and wanting to please me the happiest woman in mexico but hes edgy too art sees his jaws are clamped on the omnipresent cigar and his fingers are drumming little tattoos on the stock of esposa his uzi as he adds they have to eat lets hope so art thinks if they dont and we miss this opportunity the whole fragile arrangement with the mexican government could fall apart theyre already nervous reluctant allies the secretary of the interior and the governor of jalisco have literally distanced themselves from the operation theyre miles out at sea on a threeday diving excursion so that they can plead noninvolvement to both the nation and the surviving barrera brothers and there are so many moving pieces in this operation all of which have to be coordinated that the whole thing is extremely timesensitive the team of federales from mexico city is in place here waiting to grab barrera at the same time a special unit of army troops is perched on the edge of town ready to move in and detain the entire jalisco state police force its chief and the governor of the state until barrera is flown to mexico city arraigned and jailed its a state coup detat art thinks planned to the second and if this moment passes it will be impossible to maintain secrecy for another day the jalisco police will get their boy barrera out the governor will plead ignorance and it will be over so it has to be now he watches the front door of the house please god let them be hungry let them go to breakfast he stares at the door of the house as if he could make it open tio is a crackhead hooked on the pipe its tragic adan thinks as he looks at his uncle what started as a pantomime of disability has become real as if tio acted his way into a role that he cant shake off always a slim man hes thinner than ever doesnt eat chainsmokes one cigar after another when hes not inhaling the smoke he coughs it up his once jetblack hair is now silver and his skin has a yellowish tint hes hooked up to a glucose iv on a rolling stand that he drags behind him everywhere like a pet dog hes fiftythree years old a young girlchrist what is this the fifth or sixth since pilarcomes in plops her ample ass down on the easy chair and clicks the television on with the remote raul is shocked at the disrespect even more shocked when his uncle says meekly calor de mi vida we are talking business warmth of my life my ass adan thinks the girlhe cant even think of her nameis yet another pale imitation of pilar talavera mendez twenty pounds heavier limp greasy hair a face thats many carnitas away from being pretty but there is a faint resemblance adan could understand the obsession with pilargod what a beautybut with this segundera he cant comprehend especially when the girl puts a pout on her gash of a fat mouth and mewls youre always talking business make us some lunch adan says i dont cook she sneers and waddles out they can hear another television come on loudly from another room she likes her soap operas tio explains adan has been silent so far sitting back in his chair and watching his uncle with growing concern his obvious bad health his weakness his attempts to replace pilar attempts as persistent as they are disastrous tio angel is fast becoming a pathetic figure and yet he is still the patron of the pasador tio leans over and whispers do you see her who tio her tio croaks mendezs mujer pilar guero had married the girl met her as she got off the plane from her salvadoran honeymoon with tio and actually married a girl whom most mexican men wouldnt have touched because not only was she not a virgin she was barreras thingontheside his segundera thats how much guero loves pilar talavera si tio adan says i see her tio nods looks quickly toward the living room to make sure the girl is still watching television and then whispers is she still beautiful no tio adan lies she is fat now and ugly but she isnt she is adan thinks exquisite he goes to mendezs sinaloa ranch every month with their tribute and he sees her there shes a young mother now with a threeyearold daughter and an infant son and she looks terrific the adolescent baby fat is gone and shes matured into a beautiful young woman and tio is still in love with her adan tries to get back on track what about keller what about him tio asks he snatched mette out of honduras adan says and now hes kidnapped alvarez right here from guadalajara are you next its a real concern adan thinks tio shrugs mette got complacent alvarez was careless im none of those things im careful i change houses every few days the jalisco police protect me besides i have other friends you mean the cia adan asks the contra war is over what use are you to them now because loyalty is not an american virtue adan thinks nor is long memory if you dont know that just ask manuel noriega in panama he had also been a key partner in cerberus a touch point on the mexican trampoline and where is he now same place as mette and alvarez in an american prison except it wasnt art but noriegas old friend george bush who put him there invaded his country grabbed him and put him away so if youre counting on the americans to repay you with loyalty tio count on the fingers of one hand i watched arts performance on cnn there is a price for his silence and the price might be you might be all of us dont worry mi sobrino tio is saying los pinos is a friend of ours los pinos the residence of the president of mexico what makes him such a friend adan asks twentyfive million of my dollars tio answers and that other thing adan knows what that other thing is that the federacion had helped this president to steal the election four years ago back in it seemed certain that the opposition candidate the leftist cardenas was going to win the election and topple the pri which had been in power since the revolution then a funny thing happened the computers that counted the votes magically malfunctioned the election commissioner appeared on television to shrug and announce that the computers had broken down and that it would take several days to count the votes and determine the winner and during those several days the bodies of the two opposition watchdogs in charge of monitoring the computer votesthe two men who could have and would have asserted the truth that cardenas had won percent of the votewere found in the river facedown and the election commissioner had gone back on television to announce with a perfectly straight face that the pri had won the election the current presidente took office and proceeded to nationalize the banks the telecommunications industries the oil fields all of which were purchased at belowmarket prices by the same men who had come to his fundraising dinner and left twentyfive million dollars apiece on the table as a tip adan knows that tio hadnt arranged the murders of the election officialsthat had been garcia abregobut tio would have known about it and given his okay and while abrego is thick as thieves with los pinospartners in fact with el bagman the presidents brother who owns a third of all the cocaine shipments that abrego runs through his gulf carteltio has good reason to believe that los pinos has every reason to be loyal to him adan has his doubts now he looks at his uncle and sees that hes anxious to end the meeting tio wants to smoke his crack and wont do it in front of adan its sad he thinks as he leaves to see what the drug has done to this great man adan takes a taxi to the cross of squares and walks toward the cathedral to request a miracle god and science he thinks the sometimes cooperative sometimes conflicting powers to whom adan and lucia go to try to help their daughter lucia turns more to god she goes to churchprays offers masses and benedictions kneels before a panoply of saints she buys milagros outside the cathedral and offers them up she burns candles she gives money she sacrifices adan goes to church on sundays makes his offerings says his prayers takes communion but its more of a gesture a nod to lucia he doesnt believe anymore that help will come from that direction so he genuflects mumbles the words goes through the motions but they are empty gestures on his regular trips to culiacan to bring his regular offering to guero mendez he stops at the shrine of santo jesus malverde and makes his manda he prays to the narcosanto but puts more hope in the doctors adan markets drugs he gets biopharmacology pediatric neurologists neuropsychologists psychoneurologists endocrinologists brain specialists research chemists herbal healers native healers charlatans quacks doctors everywherein mexico colombia costa rica england france switzerland and even just across the border in the usa adan cant go on those visits cant accompany his wife and daughter on their sad futile trudges to specialists at scripps in la jolla or mercy in los angeles he sends lucia with written notes written questions stacks of medical records histories tests results lucia takes gloria by herself crosses the border under her maiden nameshes still a citizenand sometimes they are gone for weeks sometimes months when adan aches for his daughter they always return with the same old news that there is no news no new miracle has been discovered or revealed not by god or the doctor there is nothing more they can do adan and lucia comfort each other with hope and faithwhich lucia possesses and adan feignsand love adan loves his wife and daughter deeply hes a good husband a wonderful father other men lucia knows might have turned their backs on a deformed child might have avoided the girl avoided the home made a thousand excuses to spend time away not adan he is home almost every night almost every weekend hes in glorias room the first thing every morning to kiss her and give her a hug then he makes her breakfast before he goes off to work when he comes home in the evening his first stop is to her room he reads to her tells her stories plays games with her nor does adan hide his child like something shameful he takes her for long strolls in the rio district takes her to the park to lunch to the circus anywhere everywhere they are a common sight in the better neighborhoods of tijuanaadan lucia and gloria all the shopkeepers know the girlthey give her candy flowers small pieces of jewelry hairpins bracelets pretty things when adan has to go away on businessas he is now on his regular junket to guadalajara to visit with tio then to culiacan with a briefcase of cash for guerohe calls every day several times a day to speak with his daughter he tells her jokes funny things that he has seen he brings her presents from guadalajara culiacan badiraguato and those trips to the doctors that he can go onall of them except in the united stateshe goes hes become an expert on cystic lymphangioma he reads he studies he asks questions he offers incentives and rewards he makes large donations to research quietly inveighs his business partners to do the same he and lucia have nice things a nice home but they could have much nicer things a much bigger home except for the money they spend on doctors and donations and pledges and masses and benedictions and playgrounds and clinics lucia is glad for this she doesnt need nicer things a bigger home she doesnt needand wouldnt wantthe lavish and frankly tasteless mansions that some of the other narcotraficantes have lucia and adan would give anything they have any parent would to any doctor or any god every doctor and every god who would cure their child the more science fails the more lucia turns to religion she finds more hope in a divine miracle than in the hard numbers of the medical reports a blessing from god from the saints from our lady of guadalupe could reverse the tide of those numbers in the blink of an eye in the flutter of a heart she haunts the church becomes a daily communicant brings their parish priest father rivera home for dinners for private prayer and counseling sessions for bible study she questions the depth of her faith perhaps it is my doubt that is blocking a milagro questions the sincerity of adans she urges him to attend mass more often to pray harder to give even more money to the church to talk with father rivera to tell him whats in your heart to make her feel better he goes to see the priest riveras not a bad guy if a bit of a fool adan sits in the priests office across the desk from him and says i hope youre not encouraging lucia to believe that its her lack of faith that prevents a cure for our daughter of course not i would never suggest or even think such a thing adan nods but lets talk about you rivera says how can i be of help to you adan really im fine it cant be easy it isnt its life and how are things between you and lucia theyre fine rivera gets this clever look on his face then asks and in the bedroom may i ask how are the connubial adan makes a successful effort to suppress a smirk it always amuses him when priests these selfcastrated eunuchs want to give advice on sexual matters rather like a vegetarian offering to barbecue your steak for you nevertheless its obvious that lucia has been discussing their sex life with the priest otherwise the man would never have had the nerve to raise the subject the fact is that theres nothing to discuss there is no sex life lucia is terrified of getting pregnant and because the church forbids artificial contraception and she will do nothing that might indicate anything other than a total commitment to the laws of the church he has told her a hundred times that the chances of having another baby with a birth defect are a thousand to one a million to one really but logic has no traction with her she knows hes right but she tearfully confesses to him one night that she just cant bear the thought of that moment in the hospital that moment when she was told when she saw she cant bear the thought of reliving that moment she has tried to make love with him several times when the rhythms of natural contraception allowed but she simply froze up terror and guilt adan observes are not aphrodisiacs the truth he would like to tell rivera is that it isnt important to him that hes busy at work busy at home that all his energies are taken up with running a business the specific nature of that business is never discussed taking care of a very ill severely handicapped child and trying to find a cure for her compared with their daughters suffering the lack of a sex life is insignificant i love my wife he tells rivera i have encouraged her to have more children rivera says to enough adan thinks this is getting insulting father he says gloria is all we can care for now he leaves a check on the desk goes home and tells lucia that he has spoken with father rivera and the talk strengthened his faith but what adan really believes in are numbers it hurts him to see this sad futile faith of hers he knows she is hurting herself more deeply every day because the one thing adan knows for certain is that numbers never lie he deals with numbers all day every day he makes key decisions based on numbers and he knows that arithmetic is the absolute law of the universe that a mathematical proof is the only proof and the numbers say that their daughter will get worse not better as she gets older that his wifes fervent prayers are unheard or unanswered so he puts his hopes in science that someone somewhere will come up with literally the right formula the miracle drug the surgical procedure that will trump god and his useless entourage of saints in the meantime there is nothing to do but keep putting one foot in front of the other in this futile marathon neither god nor science can help his daughter noras skin is a warm pink flushed from the baths steaming water she has on a thick white terrycloth bathrobe and a towel wrapped in a turban around her hair and she plops down on the sofa puts her feet up on the coffee table and picks up the letter she asks are you going to am i going to what parada asks as her question pulls him out of the sweet reverie of the coltrane album playing on the stereo resign i dont know he says i suppose so i mean a letter from il papa himself but you said it was a request nora says hes asking not ordering thats just a courtesy parada answers it amounts to the same thing one doesnt refuse a request of the popes nora shrugs first time for everything parada smiles ah for the careless courage of youth it is he thinks a simultaneous flaw and virtue of young people that they have so little regard for tradition and even less for authority a superior asks you to do something you dont wish to do easyjust refuse but it would be so easy to accede he thinks more than easytempting resign and become a mere parish priest again or accept an assignment to a monasterya period of reflection they would probably call it a time for contemplation and prayer it sounds wonderful as opposed to the constant stress and responsibility the endless political negotiations the ceaseless efforts to acquire food housing medicine not to mention the chronic alcoholism spousal abuse unemployment and poverty and the myriad tragedies that spring from them its a burden he thinks with full realization of his own selfpity and now il papa is not only willing to remove the cup from my hands hes requesting that i give it up will in fact forcibly rip it from me if i dont meekly hand it over this is what nora doesnt understand one of the few things that nora doesnt understand shes been coming to visit for years now at first it was short visits of a few days helping out at the orphanage outside the city then it turned into longer visits with her staying for a few weeks and then the weeks turned into months then she would go back to the states to do what she does to make her money and then return and the stays at the orphanage became longer and longer which is a good thing because shes invaluable there to her surprise shes become quite good at doing whatever needs to be done some mornings its looking after the preschool kids others its supervising repair of the seemingly endless plumbing problems or negotiating with contractors on prices for the new dormitory or driving into the big central market in guadalajara to get the best deal on groceries for the week at first each time a task came up shed whine the same refraini dont know anything about thatjust to get the same answer from sister camella youll learn and she did she has shes become a veritable expert on the intricacies of third world plumbing the local contractors simultaneously love and hate to see her comingshes so beautiful but so relentlessly ruthless and theyre both shocked and delighted to see a woman walk up to them and pronounce in butchered but effective spanish the words no me quiebres el culo dont bust my ass other times she can be so charming and seductive that they give her what she wants at barely a profit she leans over and looks up at them with those eyes and that smile and tells them that the roof cant really wait until they have the cashthe rains are coming dont you see the sky no they dont what they see is her face and body and lets be honest her soul and they go and fix the condenada roof and they know shes good for the money shell get it because who at the diocese is going to say no to her no one thats who no one has the balls and at the market dios mio shes a terror strolls through the vegetable stands like a queen demanding the best of this the freshest of that squeezing and smelling and asking for samples to test one morning a fedup grocer asks her who do you think youre buying for the patrons of a luxury hotel she answers my kids deserve as good or better or do you disagree she gets them the best food at the best price the rumors about her abound shes an actressno a whoreno she is the cardinals mistress no she was a highpriced courtesan and she is dying of aids she has come to the orphanage to do penance for her sins before she goes to meet god but that story loses credence as a year goes bythen two then five then sevenand still she comes to the orphanage and her health hasnt declined and her looks havent faded and by that time the speculation on her past has pretty much ended anyway she does enjoy the meals on her visits to the city she eats herself into a near stupor then takes a glass of wine into the big bathroom with real tiles and soaks in hot water until her skin is a glowing pink then she dries herself with the big fluffy towels the ones at the orphanage are small and practically transparent and a maid comes in with the clean clothes that were being washed while she was in the tub and then she rejoins father juan for an evening of conversation music or movies she knows hes taken advantage of her bath to go outside in the garden and sneak cigarettes the doctors have told him and told him and told him and his response is what if i give up the smokes and then get hit by a car i will have sacrificed all that pleasure for nothing and then he does this funny thing of sucking on a mint before she comes back as if hes fooling anybody as if he needs to fool her in fact theyve come to measure the length of her baths by cigarettesim going to have a fivecig bath or if she feels especially grimy and tired this is going to be an eightcig bathbut he still goes to the trouble to deny by silent implication that thats what hes doing and he always sucks on the mint anyway this game has been going on now for almost seven years seven yearsshe cant believe it on this particular visit she came unusually in the morning having spent all night bringing a sick child into the city hospital and then sitting up with him when the crisis had passed shed taken a taxi over to juans residence and availed herself of a bath and a full breakfast now she sits in his den and listens to the music where has it gone she asks him as the coltrane solo rises to a crescendo and then falls again where has what gone seven years where its always gone he says doing what there is to be done i suppose shes worried about him he looks tired worn down and even though they make a joke of it hes lost weight lately and he seems more susceptible to colds and bouts of flu but its more than his health its also his safety noras afraid theyre going to kill him its not only his constant political sermons and labor organizing for the past few years hes been spending more and more time in the state of chiapas making the church down there a center for indigenous indian movement infuriating the local landowners hes been increasingly outspoken on a range of social issues always taking a dangerously leftwing position even coming out against the nafta treaty which he argues will only further dispossess the poor and the landless hes even railed against it from the pulpit angering his superiors in the church and the right wing in mexico the writing is literally on the wall the first time she saw one of the posters she angrily went to tear it down but he stopped her he thought it was funny the cartoonish drawing of him with the legend el cardenal rojothe red cardinaland the announcement dangerous criminalwanted for betraying his country he wanted to have one copied and framed it doesnt scare himhe assures her that even the rightwingers wouldnt kill a priest but they murdered oscar romero in guatemala didnt they his robes didnt deflect those bullets a rightwing death squad marched into his church as he was saying mass and gunned him down so shes afraid of the mexican guardia blanca and of these posters that encourage some lone nut to make himself a hero by killing a traitor theyre just trying to intimidate me juan told her when they first saw the posters but thats just what scares her because she knows that he wont be intimidated and when they see that he wont what will they do so maybe the request to resign is a good thing she thinks which is why she floats the idea of his resigning shes too smart to overtly bring up his health his fatigue and the threats against him but she wants to leave the door open for him to walk away just walk away alive i dont know she says casually maybe its not such a bad idea he told her about the argument when the papal nuncio had summoned him to mexico city to explain his grave pastoral and doctrinal errors in chiapas this liberation theology antonucci had started i dont care about liberation theology im relieved to hear it i only care about liberation antonuccis little finchlike face darkened as he said christ liberates our soul from hell and death and i would think that would be sufficient liberation that is the good news of the gospel and that is what you are supposed to deliver to the faithful of your diocese and that not politics should be your main concern my main concern parada said is that the gospel becomes good news to the people now and not after they starve to death this political orientation was all the rage after vatican two antonucci said but perhaps it has escaped your notice that we have a different pope now yes parada said and he sometimes gets things backwards everywhere he goes he kisses the ground and walks on the people antonucci said this is no joke theyre investigating you who is the latin affairs desk at the vatican antonucci said bishop gantin and he wants you removed on what grounds heresy oh ridiculous is it antonucci picked up a file from his desk did you celebrate mass in a chiapan village last may garbed in mayan robes replete with a feathered headdress those are symbols that the indigenous people so the answer is yes antonucci said you were openly engaging in pagan idolatry do you think that god only arrived here with columbus youre quoting yourself now antonucci said yes i have that little tidbit here let me see yes here it is god loves all humankind do you have an objection to that statement and therefore has revealed his godself to all cultural and ethnic groups in the world before any missionary arrived to speak of christ a process of salvation was already there we know in truth that columbus did not bring god aboard his ships no god is already present in all these cultures so missionary work has a whole different meaningannouncing the presence of a god who is already there do you deny saying that no i embrace it they are saved before christ yes sheer heresy no it isnt its pure salvation that one simple statement columbus did not bring god with him did more than a thousand catechisms to launch a spiritual revival in chiapas as the indigenous people began to search their own culture for signs of the revealed god and found themin their customs their stewardship of the earth their ancient laws on how to treat their brothers and sisters it was only then when they had found god in themselves that they could truly receive the good news of jesus christ and the hope of redemption from five hundred years of slavery half a millennium of oppression humiliation and dire desperate murderous poverty and if christ didnt come to redeem that then he didnt come at all how about this then antonucci asked the mystery of the trinity is not the mathematical riddle of three in one it is the manifestation of the father in politics the son in economics and the holy spirit in the culture does this really reflect your thinking yes yes it is because it takes all of thatpolitics economics and culturefor god to reveal himself in all his power thats why weve spent the past seven years building cultural centers clinics farming coops and yes political organizations antonucci said you would reduce god the father to mere politics and jesus christ his son our savior to the level of a chair of marxist theoretics in some thirdrate economics department and i wont even comment on your blasphemous connection of the holy spirit to local pagan culture whatever that even means the fact that you dont know what that means is the problem no antonucci said the problem is the fact that you do do you know what an old indian man asked me the other day doubtless youre going to tell me he asked me does this god of yours save just our souls or does he save our bodies too i tremble to think how you might have answered him you should they sat there across a desk staring at each other then parada let down a bit and tried to explain look at what were achieving in chiapas we have six thousand indigenous catechists now spread through every village teaching the gospel yes lets look at what youve achieved in chiapas antonucci said you have the highest percentage of converts to protestantism in all of mexico only a little more than half of your people are even catholic anymore the lowest percentage in mexico so thats what this is really about parada snapped coke is worried about losing market share to pepsi but parada instantly regretted the quip it was immature and prideful and killed any chance for a rapprochement and antonuccis main contention is true he thinks now i went to the countryside to convert the indians instead they converted me and now this nafta horror would throw them off what little land they have left to make room for the more efficient large ranches to open the way for larger coffee fincas mining lumber operations and of course oil drilling must everything he wonders be sacrificed on the altar of capitalism now he gets up turns the music down and searches the room for his cigarettes he always has to look for them just like he has to look for his glasses she doesnt help even though she sees them sitting by a side table hes smoking way too much it cant be helping the smoke really bothers me she says im not going to light it he says finding the pack im only going to suck on it try the gum i dont like the gum he sits back down across from her and says you want me to get out she shakes her head i want you to do what you want to do stop handling me he snaps just tell me what you think you asked she says you deserve some kind of a life youve earned it if you decide to resign no one will blame you theyll blame the vatican and you can walk away from all this with your head up she gets up from the sofa walks to the sidebar and pours herself a glass of wine she wants the wine but mostly she wants to avoid his eyes doesnt want him looking at her as she says im selfish okay i couldnt stand it if anything happened to you ah the shared unspoken thought hangs heavily between them if he were to resign not just the cardinalate but the priesthood itself then they could but he could never do that she thinks and i wouldnt really want him to and youre being an exceptionally foolish old man he thinks shes forty years your junior and you are when all is said and done a priest so he says im afraid im the one who is being selfish perhaps our friendship is keeping you from seeking a relationship dont that would meet more of your needs you meet all my needs the expression on her face is so serious that he is taken aback for a moment those startling eyes so intense he answers certainly not all all dont you want a husband he asks a family children no she wants to scream dont leave me dont make me leave you i dont need a husband or a family or children i dont need sex or money or comfort or safety i need you and there are probably a billion psychological reasonsindifferent father sexual dysfunction fear of committing to a man whos actually available a shrink would have a fucking field daybut i dont care you are the best man ive ever known the smartest kindest funniest best man ive ever known and i dont know what id do if anything ever happened to you so please dont go away dont make me go away youre not going to resign are you she asks i cant okay is it sure she never really thought he would resign a soft knock on the door and his assistant murmurs that he has an unscheduled visitor who has been told who is it parada asks a senor barrera the assistant answers i have told him i will see him nora gets up i need to get going anyway they embrace and she goes to get dressed parada goes into his private office to find adan sitting there hes changed parada thinks he still has the boyish face but its a boy with cares and little wonder parada thinks what with the sick child parada offers his hand to shake adan takes it and unexpectedly kisses his ring thats certainly unnecessary parada says its been a long time adan almost six years then why thank you for the gifts you send gloria adan says youre welcome parada says i also say masses for her and offer prayers theyre appreciated more than you know how is gloria the same parada nods and lucia fine thank you parada goes behind his desk and sits down leans forward on the desk clasps his fingers together and looks at adan with a studied pastoral expression six years ago i reached out to you and asked for your mercy on a helpless man you answered by killing him it was an accident adan says it was out of my control you can lie to yourself and to me parada says you cannot lie to god why not adan thinks he lies to us but he says on the lives of my wife and my child i was going to release hidalgo one of my colleagues accidentally gave him an overdose trying to reduce his pain which he required because he had been tortured not by me enough adan parada says waving his hand as if to swat away the evasion why are you here how can i minister to you you cant then im asking you to be a pastor to my uncle jesus walked on water parada says i dont know that its been done since meaning meaning parada says as he takes a pack of cigarettes from the desktop shakes one into his mouth and lights it that despite the official party line i have to believe that some people are beyond redemption what you are asking for is a miracle i thought you were in the miracle business i am parada answers for instance right now i am trying to feed thousands of hungry people provide them with clean water decent homes medicine education and some hope for the future any one of these would be a miracle if its a matter of money fuck your money parada says there is that plain enough adan smiles remembering why he loves this man and why father juan is probably the only priest tough enough to help tio he says my uncle is in torment good he should be when adan raises an eyebrow parada says im not sure i believe in a fiery hell adan but if there is one your uncle is doubtless going there hes addicted to crack i will let the irony of that pass without comment parada says you are familiar with the concept of karma vaguely adan says i know he needs help and i know that you cannot refuse to help a soul in torment a soul who comes in true repentance seeking to change his ways parada says does that describe your uncle no does it describe you no parada stands up then what do we have to talk about please go see him adan says he takes a notepad from his jacket pocket and scribbles tios address if you could persuade him to go to a clinic a hospital there are hundreds in my diocese who want such treatment and cant afford it parada says send five of them with my uncle and send their bills to me as i said before right fuck my money adan says your principles their suffering from the drugs you sell he says with a cigarette in his mouth adan drops his head looks at the floor for a second then says im sorry i came to ask you for a favor i should have checked my attitude at the door i meant to parada takes a long pull on the cigarette walks to the window and looks outside onto the zocalo where the street vendors have spread their blankets and laid out their milagros to sell ill go see miguel angel he says i doubt it will do any good thank you father juan parada nods father juan yes there are a lot of people who want to know that address im not a policeman parada says i shouldnt have said anything adan says he walks to the door goodbye father juan thank you change your life adan its too late if you really believed that parada says you wouldnt have come here parada walks adan out the door into the small foyer where a woman is standing with a small overnight bag over her shoulder i should be going nora says to parada she looks at adan and smiles nora hayden parada says adan barrera mucho gusto adan says mucho gusto she turns to parada ill be back in a few weeks ill look forward to it she turns to leave im just going now myself adan says may i carry your bag do you need a taxi that would be nice she kisses parada on the cheek adios buen viaje outside in the zocalo she says that sly smile on your face is there a sly smile on my face is misplaced its not what you think you misunderstand adan says i love and respect the man any happiness he finds in this world i would never begrudge him were just friends as you wish we are adan looks across the square theres a good cafe over there i was about to have breakfast and i hate to eat alone do you have the time and inclination to join me i havent eaten come on then adan says crossing the square with her he adds look i just have to make one phone call go ahead he gets his cell phone out and dials glorias number hola sonrisa de mi alma he says when she answers she is the smile of his soul her voice is his dawn and his dusk how are you this morning good papa where are you in guadalajara he says visiting tio how is he hes good too adan says he looks out over the square where the street merchants have gathered in strength ensancho de mi corazon comfort of my heart they sell songbirds here shall i bring one home to you what songs do they sing papa i dont know he says i think you have to teach them songs do you know any papa she laughs delighted knowing shes being teased i sing to you all the time i know you do your songs crack my heart yes please papa she says i would love to have a bird what color yellow i think i see a yellow one or green she says any color papa when will you be home tomorrow night he says i have to go see tio guero then ill come home i miss you i miss you too he says ill call you tonight i love you i love you he ends the call your girlfriend nora asks the love of my life adan says my daughter ah they choose an outdoor table adan pulls the chair out for her then sits down he looks across the table at those remarkable blue eyes she doesnt look away or flinch or blush just looks right back at him and your wife she asks what about her thats what i was going to ask nora says the door cracks like a gunshot wood shattering on metal angels pito slides out of the girl as he turns to see federales coming through the door art thinks its almost comical as tio shuffles with his pants around his ankles into a grotesque imitation of a run the rolling iv stand following him like a harried servant trying to reach the guns that are stacked in the corner of the room then the stand topples over in a crash pulling the needle out of his arm and tio falls in the corner on top of the guns and comes up with a hand grenade and sits there fumbling with the pin until a federale grabs him and jerks the grenade out of his hand theres still a fat white ass sticking up from the kitchen table like a gigantic pile of dough and the sound of a thwack as ramos walks over and whacks it with the butt of his rifle she yelps an indignant ow you should have cooked breakfast you lazy slut he grabs her by the hair and pulls her up get your pants on no one wants to look at your nalgas grandes your big ass ill give you five million dollars angel is saying to the federale five million dollars american to let me go then he sees art standing there and knows that five mil isnt going to do it that there isnt enough money he starts crying kill me please kill me now and this is the face of evil art thinks a sad burlesque the man sitting there in the corner with his pants off begging me to kill him pathetic three minutes ramos says before the guards get back lets get this piece of shit out of here then art says he kneels down so his mouth is right next to his uncles ear and whispers tio let me tell you what youve always wanted to know what who source chupar was who guero mendez art lies guero mendez motherfucker he hated you art adds for taking that little bitch away from him and ruining her he knew the only way of getting her back was to get rid of you maybe i cant get to adan raul and guero art thinks so ill settle for the next best thing ill make them destroy each other adan collapses on noras body she holds his neck and strokes his hair that was incredible he says you havent had a woman in a long time she says was it that obvious they had left the cafe and gone directly to a nearby hotel his fingers had trembled unbuttoning her blouse you didnt come he says i will she says next time next time an hour later she braces her hands against the windowsill her legs a muscular v as he pumps into her from behind the breeze through the open window cools the sweat on her skin as she moans and whimpers a beautiful fake climax until he is satisfied and lets himself come later lying on the floor he says i want to see you again that can be arranged nora says its just a matter of business tio sits in a cell his arraignment didnt go wellnot the way it should have gone at all i dont know why they connect me with the cocaine business he said from the dock im a car dealer all i know about the drug trade is what i read in the newspapers and the people in the courtroom laughed laughed and the judge bound him over for trial no baila dangerous criminal the judge said a definite risk of flight especially in guadalajara where the defendant is alleged to have considerable influence in the law enforcement community so they had put himshackledon a military aircraft and flown him to mexico city under a special canopy from the plane to a van with blackpainted windows then to almoloya prison and into solitary confinement where the cold makes his bones ache and the screaming need for crack gnaws at his bones like a hungry dog the dog chewing on him chewing on him wanting that cocaine but worse than any of that is the anger the rage of betrayal the betrayal of his alliesfor there must have been a betrayal at the highest levels for him to be sitting in this cell that hijo de puta and his brother in los pinos whom we bought and paid for and put in office the election that was stolen from cardenas using my money and the money i made the cartel give themand they have betrayed me like this the motherless whores the cabrones the lambiosos and the americans the americans whom i helped in their war against the communists they have betrayed me too and guero mendez who stole my love mendez who has the woman that should have been mine and the children that should have been mine and pilar that cunt who betrayed me tio sits on the floor of the cell his arms around his legs rocking back and forth with need and rage it takes him a day to find a guard to sell him crack he inhales the delicious smoke and holds it in his lungs lets it seep into his brain give him euphoria then clarity then he sees it all revenge on mendez on pilar he falls asleep smiling fabian martinezaka el tiburonis a stone killer the junior has become one of rauls key sicarios his most efficient gunman that newspaper editor in tijuana whose investigative journalism got a little too investigativeel tiburon took him out like a target in a video game that loser californian surfer and dope dude who had three tons of yerba dropped off on the beach near rosarita but didnt pay his landing feeel tiburon popped him like a balloon and then went out to party and those three totally fucking idiotic pendejos from durango who did a tombe a robberymurder on a shipment of coke that the barreras had guaranteedwell el tiburon took an ak and hosed them off the street like dogshit then poured gasoline over their bodies set them on fire and let them burn like luminarias the local firemen were afraid with good reason to put them out and the story goes that two of the guys were still breathing when el tiburon dropped the match on them thats bullshit fabian would say denying the story i used my lighter whatever he kills without feeling or conscience which is what we need raul thinks now as he sits in the car with the kid and asks him to do this favor for the barrera pasador we want you to take over making the cash deliveries to guero mendez raul tells him become the new courier thats it fabian asks hed thought it would be something else something wet something that involved the sharp sweet adrenaline high of killing actually there is something else pilars children are the loves of her life shes a young madonna with a threeyearold daughter and an infant son her face and body more mature and there is character around her eyes that wasnt there before she sits at the edge of the pool and dangles her bare feet in the water the children are la sonrisa de mi corazon she tells fabian martinez then adds pointedly sadly not my husband fabian thinks that guero mendezs estancia is totally gross traficante chic is how pilar privately describes it to him her tone not even attempting to hide her contempt i am trying to change it but he has this image in his head narcovaquero fabian thinks drug cowboy instead of running from his rural roots guero flaunts them creates a grotesque modern version of the great landowners of the pastthe dons the ranchers the vaqueros who wore widebrimmed hats and boots and chaps because they needed them out in the mesquite herding cattle now the new narcos are turning the image on its head black polyester cowboy shirts with fake motherofpearl buttons polyester chaps in bright pastelslime greens canary yellows and coral pinks and highheeled boots not practical walking boots but pointedtoe yanqui cowboy boots made from all kinds of materials the more exotic the betterostrich alligatordyed in bright reds and greens the old vaqueros would have laughed or would spin in their graves and the house pilars embarrassed by it its not the classic estancia styleonefloor tile roof gentle gracious porchbut a threestory monstrosity of yellow brick pillars and ironwork railing and the interiorleather chairs with cattle horns as wings and hooves for feet sofas made from red and white cattle hide barstools with saddles for seats with all his money she sighs what he could do speaking of money fabian has a briefcase of it in his hand more money for guero mendez to commit to his war against taste fabians the courier now the pretext being that its too dangerous for the barrera brothers to move around with all thats happened to miguel angel they have to lie low so fabian will make the monthly cash deliveries and report from the front theyre having a weekend party at the ranch pilar is playing the gracious hostess and fabian is surprised to find himself thinking that she is graciouslovely and charming and subtle hed expected some frumpy housewife but shes not that and at dinner that night in the large formal dining room now crowded with guests he sees her face in candlelight and her face is exquisite she glances over and sees him looking this moviestarhandsome boy with the good stylish clothes pretty soon he finds himself walking out by the pool with her and then she tells him that she doesnt love her husband he doesnt know what to say so he shuts his mouth hes surprised when she continues i was so young so was he and muy guapo no and forgive me he was going to rescue me from don angel which he did make me into a grand lady which he has an unhappy grand lady fabian says stupidly youre unhappy i dont love him she says isnt that terrible of me i am a terrible person he treats me well gives me everything he has no other women doesnt go with whores i am the love of his life and thats what makes me feel so guilty guero worships me and i have contempt for him because of that when he is with me i dont feel i dont feel and then i start to make a list of the things i dislike about him hes crass he has no taste hes a hick a hillbilly i hate it here i want to go back to guadalajara real restaurants real shops i want to go to museums concerts galleries i want to travelsee rome paris rio i dont want to be boredwith my life with my husband she smiles then looks back at the guests gathered around the enormous bar at the other end of the pool they all think im a whore they dont of course they do she says evenly but none of them is brave enough to say it out loud of course not fabian thinksthey all know the story of rafael barragos he wonders if she does rafi had been at a barbecue at the ranch shortly after guero and pilar were married and was standing around with some cuates when guero came out of the house with pilar on his arm and rafi chuckled and under his breath made a wisecrack about guero hitching his cart to barreras puta and one of his good buddies went to guero and told him and that night rafi was grabbed from his guest room and the silver plate that he had given them for a wedding present was melted down in front of him and a funnel was stuck in his mouth and the molten silver poured into it as guero watched thats how rafis body was foundhanging upside down from a telephone pole on a roadside twenty miles from the ranch his eyes widened in agony his open mouth filled with hardened silver and no one dared to take the body down not the police not even the family and for years the old man who herded goats by that place told about the strange sound the crows beaks made as they pecked through rafis cheeks and struck silver and that spot along the road became known as donde los cuervos son ricoswhere crows are rich so yes fabian thinks as he looks at her the reflected water from the pool glimmering gold on her skin everyone is afraid to call you a puta theyre probably afraid to even think it and fabian thinks if guero did that to a man who merely insulted you what would he do to the man who seduces you he feels a stab of fear but then feels it turn into excitement it turns him on it makes him proud of his own cool courage his prowess as a lover then she leans close to him and to his shock and excitement whispers yo quiero rabiar i want to burn i want to rage i want to go crazy adan screams his orgasm he collapses on noras soft breasts and she holds him tightly with her arms and squeezes him rhythmically inside herself my god he gasps nora smiles did you come he asks oh yes she lies it was beautiful she doesnt want to tell him that she never comes with a man that later alone she will use her own fingers to give herself relief it would be pointless to tell him and she doesnt want to hurt his feelings she actually likes him feels a certain sort of affection for him and besides its just not something you tell a man youre trying to please theyve been meeting regularly for some months since their first encounter in guadalajara now like today they usually take a hotel room in tijuana which is an easier commute for her from san diego and obviously convenient for him so once a week or so he disappears from one of his restaurants and meets her in a hotel room its the cliched love in the afternoon hes always home in the evening adan made this clear from the very start i love my wife shed heard this a thousand times they all love their wives and most of them really do this is about sex not love i dont want to hurt her adan stated as if he were laying out a business policy which nora thought he was i dont want her to be embarrassed or humiliated in any way shes a wonderful person i will never leave her or my daughter good nora said both of them businesspeople they come to an arrangement quickly and without any emotional fuss she never wants to see any actual money he opens a bank account for her and deposits a certain amount every month he chooses the dates and times for their assignations and she will be there but he has to provide a weeks notice if he wants to see her more than once a week thats fine but he still has to let her know in advance once a month the results of a blood test certifying her sexual health will discreetly arrive at his office hell do the same for her and they can dispense with the annoying condom one other thing they agree onfather juan cannot know about them in a crazy way they each feel as if theyre cheating on himshe on their platonic friendship adan on their former relationship does he know what you do for a living hed asked her yes and does he approve were friends anyway nora said does he know what you do for a living im a restaurateur uhhuh she didnt believe it then and she certainly doesnt believe it now after months of meeting with him the name had rung a faint bell anyway from a night almost ten years ago at the white house when jimmy piccone had so brutally inaugurated her into the trade so when she returned from guadalajara she called haley asked her about adan barrera and got the whole rundown be careful haley advised the barreras are dangerous maybe nora thinks now as adan falls into a postcoital slumber but she hasnt seen that side of adan and doubts that it even exists hes been only gentle to her even sweet she admires his loyalty to his sick daughter and his frigid wife he has needs is all and hes trying to get them met in the most ethical way possible for a relatively sophisticated man hes remarkably unsophisticated in bed shes had to ease him into certain practices teach him positions and techniques the man is startled by the depth of pleasure she can make him feel and hes unselfish she thinks he doesnt come to bed with the consumer mentality that so many johns have the sense of entitlement that comes with their platinum cards he wants to please her wants her to be as satisfied as he is wants her to feel the same joy he doesnt treat me she thinks like a vending machine put in your quarter pull the knob and get the candy goddamn it she thinks i like the man hes started to open up sexually and personally they spend the interstitial moments talking not about drug business of coursehe knows she knows what he does and they leave it at thatbut about the restaurant business the multitude of problems associated with putting food in the mouths and smiles on the lips of the consuming public they talk about sportshes delighted to find that she can discuss boxing in depth and knows the difference between a slider and a curveballand about the stock market shes a shrewd investor who starts her day the same way he does with the wall street journal beside her morning coffee they discuss menu items debate the rankings of middleweights dissect the relative strengths and weaknesses of mutual funds versus municipal bonds she knows its another cliche just as hackneyed as love in the afternoon but men do come to hookers to talk the wives of the world would take a chunk out of her business if they glanced at the sports pages spent a few minutes watching espn or wall street week their husbands would willingly spend a few hours discussing feelings if the wives were willing to just talk about stuff a little more so its part of her job but she really enjoys her conversations with adan shes interested in the topics and she likes talking about them with him shes used to intelligent successful men but adan is really smart hes an unrelenting analyst he thinks things through performs intellectual surgery until he cuts to the bottom line and face it she tells herself youre attracted to his sorrow to the sadness he carries with such quiet dignity you think you can ease his pain and you like that its not about the usual shallow satisfaction of leading a man around by the dick but about taking a man whos in pain and making him forget his sadness for a little while yeah nurse nora she thinks florence fucking nightingale with a blow job instead of a lantern she leans over and gently touches his neck until his eyes pop open you have to get up she says you have an appointment in an hour remember thanks he says sleepily he gets up and goes into the shower like most things he does its brisk and efficienthe doesnt luxuriate under the spray of hot water but washes up towels off comes back into the room and starts to get dressed but today as he buttons his shirt he says i want us to be exclusive oh adan that would be very expensive she says a little disconcerted caught offguard i mean if you want all my time youd have to pay for all my time i assumed as much can you afford that money is not my problem in life adan she says i dont want you taking money from your family she instantly regrets saying it because she can see hes offended he looks up from his shirt stares at her in a way shes never seen before and says i think you already know that is something i would never do i know im sorry ill get you a condo here in tijuana he says we can agree on annual compensation and renegotiate it at the end of every year other than that we never have to discuss the money you would simply be my mistress i was thinking more of the word lover he says nora i do love you i want you in my life but theres only so much of my life to go around and most of it is already taken up i understand i know you do he says and i appreciate that more than you can know i know you dont love me but i think im more than just a customer to you the arrangement im proposing isnt ideal but i think it can give us the most we can have with each other hes prepared for this she thinks he thought it through chose his exact words and practiced them i should probably think thats pathetic she tells herself but im actually touched that he took the time and the thought adan im flattered she says and tempted its a lovely offer can i take a little time to think about it of course she thinks hard after he leaves takes stock youre twentynine years old she tells herself a young twentynine a good twentynine but nevertheless just on the edge of overthehill the breasts are still firm the ass is still tight the stomach flat none of that will change for a while but every year it will be harder to maintain even with the workout fanaticism time will take its toll and there are younger girls coming up girls with long legs and high breasts girls to whom gravity is still an ally girls who have the bodies without hours on the stationary bicycle and the treadmill without the situps and the weight lifting without the diets and increasingly those are the girls the platinum johns are going to want so how many years do you have left years at the top because the middle is not where you want to be and the bottom is a place you dont want to go how many years before haley starts sending you out to the blist clients then stops sending you at all two three five at the outside then what will you have banked enough money to retire depends on the market on the investments in two or three or five years i might have enough money to live in paris or i might have to work in which case whats the work there are two broad streams in the sex industry prostitution and porn sure theres stripping but thats where most girls start and they dont stay for long they either get out or go into prostitution or porn you skipped the dancing phasethank you haleyand went straight to the top end of the prostitution business but what happens next if you dont take adans offer and the market doesnt perform porn god knows shes had offers the money is good if the work is hard and she hears that theyre careful about the health issues but god theres something about doing it in front of a camera that puts her off and again how long could it last six or seven years tops then it would be a steep slide to the lowbudget video quickies fucking on a mattress in the backyard of some house in the valley girlgirl scenes orgy scenes being the hot horny housewife the nympho motherinlaw the sexstarved cockhungry grateful eager older woman youd kill yourself in a year a razor along the wrists or a drug overdose same with the inevitable slide as a call girl youve seen it cringed at it pitied the women who stayed too long didnt save their money didnt get married didnt hook up with a longterm john youve watched as their faces became bedworn their bodies old their spirits crushed and pitied them pity self or otherwise you couldnt stand that take this mans offer he loves you he treats you well take his offer while youre still beautiful while he still wants you while you can still give him more pleasure than he ever dreamed possible take his money and put it away and then when he gets tired of you when he starts looking harder at the younger girls starts looking at them the way he looks at you now then you can leave with your dignity intact and a decent life in front of you retire from the business and just live she decides to tell adan yes guamuchilito sinaloa mexico tijuana mexico colombia fabian burns with what pilar had whispered to him yo quiero rabiar was she telling me he wonders what i think she was telling me leads to other thoughts about her mouth her legs her feet dangling in the water the outline of her sex beneath the bathing suit and fantasiesof reaching his hand beneath that suit and feeling her breasts of stroking her chocho of hearing her moan of being inside her and and did she mean rabiar spanish is a subtle tongue in which each word can take many meanings rabiar can mean to thirst to burn to rage to go crazy all of which he thinks she meant and it can also refer specifically to s ampm and he wonders if she could have possibly meant that she wants to be tied up whipped fucked roughlyand that gives him yet more tantalizing fantasies surprising fantasies that hes never had before about anyone he pictures himself tying her down with silk scarves spanking her beautiful ass whipping her sees himself behind her she on her hands and knees fucking her doggiestyle and she yelling at him to pull her hair and he grabs a handful of that thick black shiny hair and yanks it back like the reins of a horse so her long neck arches and stretches and she screams with pain and pleasure yo quiero rabiar ay dios mio the next time he goes to rancho mendez weeks laterendless weeks later he can barely breathe as he gets out of the car theres a tightness in his chest and he feels lightheaded and guilty wonders as guero greets him with an embrace if his wanton lust for the mans wife isnt visible on his face and hes sure it must be when she comes out the door of the house and smiles at him she is carrying the baby and has her arm around the little girl to whom she says mira claudia tio fabian esta aqui uncle fabian he feels a twinge of shame like hello claudia uncle fabian wants to fuck mommy badly he kisses her that night fucking guero leaves them alone again in the living room to take a phone call and theyre standing by the fire and she smells like mimosa flowers and his heart feels like its going to explode and theyre looking at each other and then theyre kissing her lips are amazingly soft like overripe peaches he feels dizzy the kiss ends and they step back from each other amazed scared stimulated he walks to the other side of the room i didnt mean for that to happen she says neither did i but he did its the plan the plan that raul told him but fabian is certain that it came from adan and perhaps from miguel angel barrera himself and fabian is carrying out the plan so pretty soon theyre sneaking kisses embraces brushes of the hands significant glances its an insanely dangerous game insanely exciting flirting with sex and death because guero would surely kill them both if he ever found out i dont think so pilar tells fabian oh i think he would kill you but then i think he would yell and cry and forgive me she says it almost sadly she doesnt want to be forgiven she wants to burn nevertheless she says nothing can ever happen between us fabian agrees in his words in his head he is thinking yes it can yes it will its my job my task my assignment seduce gueros wife take her away with you he starts with the magic words what if the two most powerful words in any language what if wed met each other first what if we were free what if we could travel togetherparis rio rome what if we ran away what if we took enough money with us to start a new life what if what if what if theyre like two children playing a game what if these rocks were gold they start imagining the details of their escapewhen they would go how what they would take with them how could they get away without guero knowing what about his bodyguards where could they meet what about her children she wouldnt leave them behind could never leave them behind all this shared fantasy done in snatches of conversations moments stolen from gueroshes already unfaithful to guero in her mind and her heart and in the bedroomwhen hes on top of her shes thinking about fabian guero is so pleased with himself when she screams out her orgasm this is new this is fresh but shes thinking about fabian shes started stealing even that from him the infidelity is completeall that remain are the physical details possibility shifts to fantasy fantasy becomes speculation speculation turns to planning its delicious planning this new life they go after it in minute detail each of them a clotheshorse they spend entire precious minutes discussing what they will pack what they can buy there there being variously paris rome or rio or more serious details should we leave guero a note or just disappear should we go together or meet somewhere if we rendezvous where or maybe we can go separately on the same flight exchange meaningful looks across the aislea long sexually torturous overnight flight then put the children to bed and meet in his room in a paris hotel rabiar no i couldnt wait she tells him i will go to the washroom on the plane you will follow the door will be unlocked no they will meet in a bar in rio pretend they are strangers hell follow her into an alley shove her against a fence rabiar will you hurt me if you want yes then ill hurt you hes everything that guero isnt sophisticated handsome well dressed stylish sexy and charming so charming shes ready she asks him when soon he says i want to run away with you but but the terrible counterweight to what if the intrusion of reality in this case well need money he says i have some money but not enough to hide us for as long as well need to hide he knows this is delicate this is the fragile moment in which the bubble could burst it floats now on the light air of romance but the mundane gross financial details could pop it in a flash he puts on his face a mask of sensitivity mixed with a dash of shame and looks down at the ground as he says we will have to wait until i can make more money how long will that be she asks she sounds hurt disappointed on the verge of tears he has to be careful so careful not long he says a year maybe two thats too long im sorry what can i do he leaves the question in the air as if there is no other answer she provides the response that he wants and expects i have money no he says firmly never but two years its out of the question just as their flirting was once out of the question just as their kissing was out of the question just as their running away how much would we need she asks millions he says thats why it will take i can withdraw that much from the bank i couldnt youre just thinking of yourself she says your male pride your machismo how could you be so selfish and thats the key fabian thinks its a done deal now that hes flipped the equation now that his taking her money would be an act of generosity and unselfishness on his part now that he loves her so much he would sacrifice his pride his machismo you dont love me she pouts i love you more than life you dont love me enough to yes he says i do she throws her arms around him when he goes back to tijuana he finds raul and tells him its a done deal its taken months but the sharks about to feed its good timing raul thinks because its time to start the war with guero mendez pilar carefully folds and packs a little black dress along with black brassieres and panties and other lingerie fabian likes her in black she wants to please him she wants it to be perfect her first time with him pues a menos que la fantasia sea mejor que e actowell unless the fantasy is better than the actual fuck but she doesnt think it will be no man can talk the way he does use the words he uses have the ideas he has and not be able to back up at least some of them he makes her wet talking to herwhat will he do when he has her in his arms ill let him do anything he wants to me she thinks i want him to do anything he wants will you hurt me if you want yes then ill hurt you she hopes so she hopes he means it that he wont be intimidated by her beauty and lose his nerve about any of itbecause she wants a new life away from this sinaloan backwater with her husband and his hillbilly friends she wants a better life for her childrena good education some culture some sense that the world is wider and better than a grotesque fortress tucked away on the outskirts of an isolated mountain town and fabian has that sensetheyve talked about it hes talked to her about making friendships outside the narrow circle of narcotraficantes about creating relationships with bankers investors even artists and writers she wants that for herself she wants that for her children so when at breakfast guero had excused himself and fabian had leaned over and whispered today shed felt a thrill that fluttered her heart it was almost like a little orgasm today she whispered back guero is going out into the countryside fabian said to inspect his fields yes so when i go to the airport you will go with me ive booked us a flight to bogota and the children of course fabian said can you pack a few things quickly now she hears guero coming down the hall she slips the suitcase under the bed he sees the clothes scattered around what are you doing im thinking of getting rid of a few of these old things she says i will bring them to the church then go shopping he asks smiling teasing her he likes when she goes shopping likes it when she spends money he encourages it probably im going he says ill be gone all day i might even stay overnight she kisses him warmly i will miss you i will miss you he says maybe i will grab una nena to keep me warm i wish you would she thinks then you wouldnt come to our bed with such desperation but she says not you you are not one of those old gomeros and i love my wife and i love my husband has fabian left yet no i think hes packing ill go say goodbye to him and kiss the children arent they still alseep of course she says but they like to know that you kissed them before you left he reaches for her and kisses her again eres toda mi vida you are all my life as soon as he goes out she closes the door and gets the suitcase out from under the bed adan says goodbye to his family goes into glorias room and kisses her on the cheek the girl smiles despite everything she smiles adan thinks shes so cheerful so brave in the background the bird he brought her from guadalajara chirps have you given the bird a name he asks her gloria after yourself no she giggles gloria trevi ah youre going away arent you she asks yes papaaaa only for a week or so he says where a bunch of places he says costa rica maybe colombia why to look at coffee to buy he says for the restaurants cant you buy coffee here not good enough for our restaurants couldnt i come with you not this time he says maybe next time if there is a next time he thinks if everything goes right in badiraguato in culiacan and on the bridge over the rio magdalena where he is going to meet the orejuelas if everything goes well my love if not he has always made sure that lucia knows where the lifeinsurance policies are and how to access the bank accounts in the caymans the securities in safedeposit boxes the investment portfolios if things go badly on this trip if the orejuelas toss his body off the bridge then his wife and child will be taken care of for the rest of their lives so will nora hes left a bank account and instructions with his private banker if he doesnt come back from this trip nora will have sufficient funds to start a small business a new life what can i bring back for you he asks his daughter just come back she says the intuition of small children he thinks they read your mind and your heart with uncanny accuracy ill make it a surprise he says give papa a kiss he feels her dry lips on his cheek and then her thin arms around his neck in a lock that wont let go it breaks his heart he never wants to leave her and for a moment he considers not going just getting out of the pista secreta and running the restaurants but its much too late for thatthe war with guero is coming and if they dont kill him guero will kill them so he steels his heart breaks her grip and straightens up goodbye mi alma he says ill call you every day turns quickly so she wont see the tears in his eyes they would frighten her he walks out of her room and lucia is waiting in the living room with his suitcase and a jacket about a week he says well miss you ill miss you he kisses her on the cheek takes his jacket and walks to the door adan yes are you all right fine he says a little tired maybe you can sleep on the plane maybe he goes to open the door then turns around and says lucia you know i love you i love you too adan she says it like its an apology it sort of is an apology for not making love to him for making their bed a cold place for her helplessness to make it any different to tell him that it doesnt mean she doesnt still love him he smiles sadly and leaves on the way to the airport he phones nora to tell her he wont be seeing her this week maybe never he thinks as he hangs up it depends on whats happening in culiacan where the banks have just opened pilar withdraws seven million dollars from three different banks in culiacan two of the bank managers start to object and want to contact senor mendez firstto fabians horror one even picks up the phonebut pilars insistent informing the cowed managers that shes senora mendez not some housewife overspending her allowance the receiver is replaced on the hook she gets her money before they even get on the plane fabian has her wiretransfer two million to accounts set up in a dozen banks around the world now we can live fabian tells her he cant find us he cant find the money they bundle the kids into her car and drive toward the airport for a private flight to mexico city how did you arrange this pilar asks fabian i have influential friends fabian answers shes impressed gueritos too young to know whats happening of course but claudia wants to know where daddy is were playing a game with daddy pilar explains like hideandgoseek the girl accepts the explanation but pilar can see shes still concerned the drive to the airport is terrifying and exciting they are always looking behind them wondering if guero and his sicarios are coming then they are at the airport itself driving out onto the tarmac where the private plane is waiting sitting and waiting for permission to take off fabian looks out the window and sees guero and a handful of men roll up in two jeeps the bank manager must have phoned after all pilar is staring at him her eyes wide with terror and excitement guero jumps out of the jeep and pilar watches him argue with a security cop and then hes looking right at her through the little window of the plane hes pointing at the plane then fabian coolly leans over and kisses her on the lips and then leans toward the cockpit and snaps vamonos the plane starts rolling down the runway guero jumps back into the jeep and races down the runway after the jet but pilar feels the wheels lift off and theyre airborne and guero and the whole small world of culiacan get smaller pilar feels as if she could take fabian into the little bathroom on the plane and fuck him right there but the children are looking at her so she has to wait and the frustration and excitement only build they fly first to guadalajara to refuel then they fly to mexico city where they leave the private plane and get on a tourist flight to belize where she thinks surely they will stop and go to some resort on the beach and then she will get some release but in the small belize airport they change planes again and take another flight to san jose costa rica where she thinks surely they will stop for a day or so at least but then they check in for a flight to caracas but dont board it instead they get on another commercial flight to cali in colombia with different passports and false names its all so stimulating and exciting and when they finally get to cali fabian tells her that they are going to stay for a few days they take a taxi to the hotel internacional where fabian gets them two adjoining rooms under yet different names and she feels as if shes going to explode as they all sit in one room until the exhausted children fall asleep he takes her by the wrist and leads her into his room i want to take a shower she says no no not a word shes used to hearing he says get your clothes off now but he slaps her across the face then he sits in a chair in the corner and watches as she unbuttons her blouse and slides it off she kicks off her shoes and slides her pants down and stands there in her black lingerie off god his prick is pounding her white breasts against the black brassiere are tantalizing he wants to touch them caress her but he knows it isnt what she wants and he doesnt dare disappoint her she unhooks the bra and her breasts drop but just a little then she takes the panties off and looks at him shes blushing furiously as she asks now what on the bed he says on your hands and knees present yourself to me shes trembling as she climbs onto the bed and lowers her head to her hands are you wet for me he asks yes you want me to fuck you yes say please please not yet he takes his belt off grabs her hands lifts themgod her breasts are beautiful as they quiverwraps it around her wrists and then around the railing at the head of the bed now he has a handful of her hair jerking her head back arching her neck riding her like a horse whipping her rump racing her to a finish she loves the sharp sound of his slaps the sting she feels it deep inside her a throb pushing her orgasm out it hurts rabiar pilar is burning her skin is burning her ass is burning her pussy is burning as he strokes her spanks her fucks her she twists on the bed on her knees her wrists bound together tied to the head of the bed it hurts so good because shes waited so long months yes of the flirting then the fantasizing then the planning but also the excitement of the escape itself ah ah ah ah he hits her in rhythm with her grunts smack smack smack smack she moans voy a morirvoy a morir im going to come im going to die and yells voy a volar im flying exploding then she screams a long inchoate tremulous scream pilar comes out of the bathroom and sits on the bed asks him to zip the back of her dress he does her skin is beautiful her hair so beautiful he strokes her hair with the back of his hand and kisses her neck later mi amor she purrs the children are waiting in the car he strokes her neck again reaches around with his other hand and brushes her nipple she sighs and leans back soon she is on all fours again presenting waiting for him he makes her wait she loves him making her wait to come inside her he grabs her hair and pulls her head back then she feels the pain around her throat at first she thinks its another s ampm game him choking her but he doesnt stop and the pain is she twists she burns rabiar she struggles and her legs kick out involuntarily fabian hisses in her ear this is for don miguel angel bruja he sends you his love he squeezes and pulls until the wire slices through her throat then her vertebrae and then her head itself pops up before it falls facefirst on the floor with a hollow thump blood sprays the ceiling fabian picks the head up by its shiny black hair her lifeless eyes stare at him he puts it in a cooler locks it then puts the cooler inside a box that has already been addressed he wraps the box tightly with several layers of packing tape then he takes a shower her blood dances on his feet before spiraling down the drain he dries off puts on fresh clothes and carries the box out to the street where a car is waiting the children sit in the backseat fabian slides in with them and nods for manuel to drive where is mommy where is mommy claudia asks shes going to meet us there where claudia starts to cry a special place fabian says a surprise what is the surprise claudia asks seduced she stops crying if i told you it wouldnt be a surprise would it is the box a surprise too what box the box you put in the trunk claudia says i saw you no fabian says thats just something i have to mail he goes into the post office and hefts the box onto the counter its surprisingly heavy he thinks her head he remembers the thickness of her hair its heaviness in his hands as he would play with it stroke it part of his seduction she was marvelous in bed he thinks feelingto his slight horror considering what he has just done what hes about to doa frisson of sexual desire how do you want this sent the postal clerk asks overnight the clerk puts it on a scale and asks do you want it insured no its going to be expensive anyway the clerk says are you sure you dont want it sent priority it will be there in two or three days no it has to be there tomorrow fabian says a gift yes a gift a surprise i hope so fabian says he pays for the postage and goes back to the car claudia has gotten scared again in the interval of waiting i want mommy i am taking you to her fabian says the santa ysabel bridge spans a gorge of the same name through which seven hundred feet below the rio magdalena rushes over jagged rocks on its long tortured trip from its source in the cordillera occidental to the caribbean sea on the way it traverses most of central colombia passing near but not through the cities of cali and medellin adan can see why the orejuela brothers chose this placeit is isolated and from either end of the bridge you could detect an ambush from hundreds of yards away or i hope so anyway adan thinks the truth is that they could be cutting off the road behind me even now and i wouldnt know it but its a chance that has to be taken without a source of cocaine from the orejuelas the pasador cant hope to win a war against guero and the rest of the federacion a war which by now ought to have been irrevocably declared el tiburon should have already run off with pilar mendez convinced her to steal millions of dollars from her husband he should be showing up here anytime with the cash to seduce the orejuelas away from the federacion all part of tios plan to get his revenge on mendez by making him a cuckold then compounding the humiliation by having his wife provide the cash to wage the war against him or maybe fabian is hanging from a telephone pole with his mouth full of silver and the orejuelas are coming to assassinate me he hears the sound of another car coming up from behind him on the road bullets in the back he wonders or fabian with the money he turns around to see fabian martinez with a driver and in the backseat gueros children what the hell is that about adan gets out of his car and walks over asks fabian do you have the money fabian smiles his moviestar smile with a bonus he hands adan the suitcase with the five million wheres pilar adan asks on her way home fabian says with a twisted grin that gives adan the creeps she left without her children adan asks what are they doing here what im just following rauls instructions fabian says adan he points to the other side of the bridge where a black land rover is slowly rolling up wait here adan says he takes the suitcase and starts to walk across the bridge fabian hears the little girls voice ask is this where mommys meeting us yes fabian says where is she is she with those people claudia asks pointing to the car on the other side of the bridge from which the orejuelas are just now getting out i think so yes fabian says i want to go there you have to wait a few minutes fabian says i want to go now we have to talk with those men first adan walks toward the center of the bridge as agreed his legs feel wooden from fear if they have a sniper in the hills i am dead thats all he tells himself but they could have killed me anytime i was in colombia so they must want to hear what i have to say he gets to the middle of the bridge and waits as the orejuelas walk toward him two brothers manuel and gilberto short dark and squat they all shake hands and then adan asks shall we get to business its why were here gilberto says you asked for this meeting says manuel brusquely adan thinks rudely and he doesnt care so the dynamic appears to be that gilberto is leaning toward making the deal and manuel is resisting all right then lets get started i will be taking our pasador out of the federacion adan says i want to ensure that we will nevertheless have a relationship here in colombia our relationship is with abrego says manuel and the federacion just so adan says but for every kilo of your cocaine the federacion handles it handles five kilos from medellin he can see hes hit a chord especially with gilberto the brothers are jealous of their bigger medellin rivals and ambitious and with the american dea pounding so hard on the medellin cartel and its florida outlets there is opportunity here for the orejuelas to make a move gilberto asks and youre offering us an exclusive arrangement if you agree to allow me to handle your cocaine adan says we would handle only product from cali that would be a very generous offer manuel says except that don abrego would resent our keeping you in business and deny us his but gilberto is looking for an answer to that adan thinks hes tempted don abrego is the pastwere the future adan says thats hard to believe says manuel when the head of your pasador sits in prison it would appear that the powersthatbe in mexico think that abrego is their future and after him mendez well beat mendez what makes you think you can asks manuel you will have to fight mendez for it and abrego will line up behind mendez as will all the other pasadores and the federales truly no offense adan barrera but i think i am looking at a dead man standing here offering me an exclusive if i dump my business with the living to do business with the dead how much cocaine can you handle from your grave we are the barrera pasador adan says weve won before we will no manuel says again pardon me but you are not the barrera pasador anymore your uncle i agree could have beaten abrego and mendez and the whole mexican government but you are not your uncle you are very smart but brains alone are not enough how tough are you i will tell you the truth adanyou look soft to me i do not think that you are a hard enough man to do what you say you will do what you will have to do adan nods then asks permission to open the suitcase at his feet he gets their okay then bends over flips open the lid shows them the money inside and says five million of guero mendezs money we fucked his wife in the ass and made her give us his money now if you still think we cant beat him take this money shoot me toss my body off the bridge and keep collecting your tip money from the federacion if you decide that we can beat mendez then please accept this as our goodwill gesture and a down payment on the many millions were going to make together he puts a look of calm on his face but he can tell from their expressions that this could go either way so can fabian and el tiburons instructions in this case are clear orders from raul that came straight down from the legendary m vengan fabian says to the kids come on are we going to see mommy now claudia asks si fabian takes her hand and hefts guerito to his shoulder and starts walking back to the middle of the bridge mi esposa mi esposa linda gueros cries echo through the large empty house the servants are hiding the bodyguards outside are lying low as guero staggers through the house throws furniture smashes glass throws himself on the cowhide sofa and buries his face in a pillow as he sobs he has found her simple note i dont love you anymore i have left with fabian and taken the children they are all right his heart is broken hed do anything to get her back would take her back too and make it up to her he tells all this to the pillow then lifts his head and wails mi esposa mi esposa linda the bodyguards the dozen sicarios manning the estancia walls and gates can hear him from outside it spooks them and they were already on edge ever since the arrest of don miguel angel barrera knowing that a war might be coming certainly a shakeout and that is usually accompanied by the shedding of blood and now the jefe is in his house bawling like a woman for everyone to hear it is inquietanteunsettling and its been going on all day a fedex truck comes down the road a dozen aks train on it the guards stop the truck well short of the gate one holds a machine gun on the driver as the other looks in the back of the truck asks the shaken driver what do you want a package for senor mendez who from the driver points to the return address on the label his wife now the guard is worrieddon guero said he was not to be disturbed but if this is from senora mendez he had better take it in ill take it to him the guard says i have to have his signature the guard points the gun barrel at the drivers face and says i can sign for him yes certainly of course the guard signs carries the package to the house and rings the bell a maid comes to the door don guero is not to be a package from the senora federal express guero appears behind the maid his eyes are swollen his face red his nose running what is it he snaps goddamnit i said a package from the senora guero takes it and slams the door shut guero tears the box open after all it is from her so he rips the box open and inside is the little cooler he unlatches it and flips the lid open and sees her shiny black hair her dead eyes mouth open and in her teeth a card he screams and screams the panicked guards kick the door in burst into the room and there is el jefe standing back from a box screaming and screaming the guard who brought the package looks inside the box then leans over and vomits pilars severed head sits on a bed of dried blood her teeth clenched on a calling card two other guards take guero by the arms and try to pull him away but he digs in his feet and just keeps screaming the other guard wipes his mouth recovers himself and takes the note from pilars mouth the message makes no sense hola chupar the other guards try to lead guero to the sofa but he snatches the note reads it turns if possible even paler and then yells dios mio mis nenesdonde estan mis nenes oh my god my children where are my children donde esta mi madreyo quiero mi madre where is my mommy i want my mommy claudia howls because she doesnt see her mother on the bridge just a bunch of strange men staring at them guerito sees her panic and picks up her cry and claudia doesnt want to be held now she twists and fights in fabians arms and cries mi madremi madre but fabian keeps walking toward the center of the bridge adan sees him coming like a nightmare a vision from hell adan feels paralyzed his feet nailed to the wood of the bridge and he just stands there as fabian smiles at the orejuela brothers and says don miguel angel barrera assures you that his blood flows through the veins of his nephew adan believes in numbers in science in physics it is at this precise moment that he understands the nature of evil that evil has a momentum of its own which once started is impossible to stop its the law of physicsa body at rest tends to stay at rest a body set in motion tends to stay in motion unless something stops it and tios plan is as usual brilliant even in its total crackinspired depravity it is deadly accurate in its perception of individual human nature this is tios geniushe knows that a man who would never have the weakness to set a great evil into motion doesnt have the strength to stop it once its moving that the hardest thing in the world isnt to refrain from committing an evil its to stand up and stop one to put ones life in the way of a tidal wave because that is what it is adan thinks his mind whirling if i put a stop to this now it will show weakness to the orejuelasa weakness that will immediately or eventually prove fatal if i show the slightest disunity with fabian that too will guarantee our demise tios geniusputting me in exactly this position knowing that i have no real choice i want mama claudia screams shh fabian whispers i am taking you to her fabian looks to adan for a signal and adan knows that hes going to give it to him because i have a family to protect adan thinks and there is no other choice its mendezs family or mine had parada been there he would have phrased it differently he would have said that in the absence of god theres only nature and nature has its cruel laws that the first thing the new leaders do is kill the offspring of the old without god thats all there is survival well there is no god adan thinks he nods fabian throws the girl off the bridge her hair lofts up like futile wings and she plummets as fabian grabs the little boy and in one easy swing tosses him over the railing adan forces himself to look the childrens bodies plunge seven hundred feet then smash onto the rocks below then he looks at the orejuela brothers whose faces are white with shock gilbertos hand shakes as he shuts the suitcase picks it up and walks shakily back across the bridge below the rio magdalena washes away the bodies and the blood chapter nine days of the dead will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest henry ii san diego its the day of the dead big day inmexico the tradition goes back to aztec times and honors the goddess mictecacihuatl lady of the dead but the spanish priests cleaned it up and moved it from midsummer to autumn to make it coincide with all hallows eve and all souls day yeah okay art thinks the dominicans can call it what they wantits still about la muerte the mexicans they dont mind talking about death they have lots of names for itthe fancy lady the skinny the bony or just plain old la muerte they dont try to keep it at arms length theyre tight with death intimate with it they keep their dead close to them on el dia de los muertos the living go to visit the dead they cook elaborate dishes and take them to the cemeteries and sit down and share a nice meal with their dearly departed shit art thinks id like to share a nice meal with my living family they live in the same city occupy the same physical space and time and yet somehow were all on separate planes of existence hed signed the divorce papers shortly after getting word of the murders of pilar mendez and her two children a simple acknowledgment of an inevitable reality he wondered or a form of penance he knew that he shared some responsibility for the childrens deaths that hed helped to set that hideous train in motion the moment he whispered into tios ear the false information that guero mendez was the imaginary source chupar so when the word came through intelligence

he had rented an apartment in the rio district and went to see her there regularly uncharacteristically careless of adan picking an american woman for his piece of strange art thinks as he watches the woman come down the sidewalk with shopping bags in both hands not like adan at all really who had the reputationat least until recentlyof being a devoted family man but art can understand the temptation as he looks at nora she might be the most beautiful woman hes ever seen on the outside anyway he thinks reminding himself that this cunt fucks adan barrera professionally hed had a tail put on her three months ago when shed come back across the border so he had a name and an address and pretty soon he had something else haley saxon the dea had had the madam up for years so it turned out had the irs the san diego pd knew all about the white house of course but nobody had moved on it because haley saxons client list was a political hornets nest that nobody had the balls to stir up and now it turns out that adans segundera is one of haleys best earners shit art thinks if haley saxon were mary kay nora hayden would have her own fleet of pink cadillacs by now he waits until she gets a little closer then steps out of the car shows her his badge ms hayden we need to talk i dont think we do she has amazing blue eyes and her voice is cultured and confident he has to remind himself that

hes told me about you what he didnt tell me is how awful you are do whatever youre going to do mr keller nora says i dont care may i go for now she gets out of the car and walks back down the street her skirt swinging against her beautiful tanned legs looking art thinks as cool as if shed just had tea with a friend you fucking asshole he thinks you totally blew it but id love to know nora if you tell adan about our little chat mexico adan has spent the whole day at cemeteries he had nine graves to visit nine little shrines to build nine elaborate meals to lay out nine family members killed by guero mendez on a single night barely one month ago his men dressed in the black uniforms of the federales had taken them from their houses or kidnapped them off the streets in mexico city and guadalajara driven them to safe houses and tortured them then dumped their bodies on busy corners for the morning street sweepers to find two uncles an aunt and six cousinstwo of the latter women one of the female cousins was a lawyer working for the pasador but the others were uninvolved with the drug end of the family business their only connection was being related to miguel angel and adan and raul and that was enough well it was enough for pilar and guerito and claudia wasnt it adan thinks mendez didnt start this thing of killing families we did so it was expected mendezs bloody september by everyone in mexico who knew anything about the drug trade the local police barely investigated the murders what did they expect ran the general opinion they killed his wife and children and not only killed them but sent mendez his wifes head and a videotape of his children plummeting off a bridge it was too much even for mexico even for the narcotraficantesit put the barrera pasador beyond the pale as it were and if mendez retaliated by killing members of the barrera family well it was expected so adan had a busy day starting early in the morning with the mexico city graves then flying to guadalajara to attend to his duties there then a quick flight here to puerto vallarta where his brother raul was characteristically throwing a party cheer up raul tells adan when he arrives at the club its el dia de los muertos sure theyve taken some hits but theyve delivered some too maybe we should bring food to their graves too adan says shit wed go broke raul says to him feeding all the guys weve sent to the devil fuck themlet their families feed them the barreras v the world cali cocaine v medellin cocaine if adan hadnt made the deal with the orejuela brothers the barreras would be the recipients of the candy and flowers today but with the steady supply of product from cali they have the men and the money to fight the war and the battle for la plaza has been bloody but simple raul has presented the local dealers with a clean choice do you want to be a cocacola distributor or a pepsi distributor you have to choose you cant be both coke or pepsi ford or chevy hertz or avisits either one or the other alejandro cazares for instance had chosen coke the san diego realestate investor businessman and dope dealer had declared his loyalty to guero mendez and his body was found in his car off a dusty dirt street in san ysidro and billy brennan another san diego dealer was found with a bullet in his brain in a motel room in pacific beach the american cops were puzzled as to why each of these victims had a pepsi can stuck in his mouth guero mendez struck back of course eric mendoza and salvador marechal went with pepsi and their charred bodies were found in their stillsmoldering cars in a vacant lot in chula vista the barreras answered in kind and for a few weeks chula vista became a virtual parking lot for burning cars with burned bodies inside but the barreras were making their point were here pendejos guero is trying to run la plaza from culiacan but we are here were local we can reach right out and touch somebodyin baja or san diegoand if guero is so tough why cant he reach out for us in his own territory in tijuana why hasnt guero had us killed the answer is simple my friendsbecause he cant hes holed up in his mansion in culiacan and if you want to take his side go ahead but brothers hes there and were here gueros lack of action is a show of weakness not strength because the truth is that he is running out of resources he may have a firm grip on sinaloa but their beloved home state is landlocked without use of la plaza guero has to pay el verde to move drugs through sonora or pay abrego to move them through the gulf and you can bet those two greedy old bastards charge him plenty for every ounce of his product that passes through their territories no guero is almost finished and his slaughter of barrera uncles aunt and cousins was just the flopping of a fish on the deck its the day of the dead and adan and raul are still alive and that is something to celebrate which they do at their new disco in puerto vallarta guero mendez makes the pilgrimage to the jardines del valle cemetery in culiacan to an unmarked crypt with carved marble columns basrelief sculptures and a dome decorated with frescoes of two little angels inside are the tombs of his wife and children colored photographs locked in glass cases hang from the wall claudia and guerito his two angelitos pilar his esposa and querida seduced but still beloved guero has brought with him ofrenda a los muertos offerings to the dead for his angelitos he has papel picado tissue paper cut in the shapes of skeletons and skulls and little animals and cookies and candies shaped like skulls and inscribed with their names in frosting and toyslittle dolls for her little soldiers for him for pilar he has brought flowersthe traditional chrysanthemums marigolds and coxcombformed into crosses and wreaths and a coffin made from spun sugar and the little cookies made with amaranth seeds that she liked so much he kneels in front of the tombs and lays down his offerings then pours fresh water into three bowls so that they can wash their hands before the feast outside a small norteno band plays cheerful music under the watchful eye of a platoon of sicarios guero lays a clean hand towel beside each bowl then sets up an altar carefully arranging the votive candles and the dishes of rice and beans pollo in mole sauce candied pumpkins and yams then he lights a stick of campol incense and sits on the floor shares memories with them good memories of picnics swims in mountain lakes family games of futbol he speaks out loud hears their answers in his head a sweeter music than theyre playing outside soon i will join you he tells his wife and children not soon enough but soon first there is much work to be done first i must set a table for the barreras and load it with bitter fruit and candy skulls with each of their names miguel angel raul adan and send their souls to hell after all its the day of the dead the disco adan thinks is a monument to vulgarity raul has done la sirena up in an underwater theme a grotesque neon mermaid la sirena herself presides over the front entrance and when you come inside the interior walls are sculpted like coral reefs and underwater caves the entire left wall is one huge reef tank holding five hundred gallons of salt water the price of the glass wall made adan shudder not to mention the cost of the exotic tropical fishyellow blue and purple tangs at each a porcupine puffer fish at a clown trigger fish with its admittedly beautiful yellow and black spots then there were the expensive corals and of course raul had to have several kinds open brain coral mushroom coral flower coral and pumping venicia coral shaped like fingers reaching up from underwater like a drowned sailor and live rocks with calcified algae glowing purple in the lights eelsblackandwhite snowflake eels and blackstriped brown morayspeek their heads out from holes in the rock and the coral and crabs crawl across the tops of the rocks and shrimp float in the electrically created current the right side of the club is dominated by an actual waterfall that doesnt make any sense adan objected to his brother when it was under construction how can you have an underwater waterfall i just wanted one raul answered well that answers that adan thoughthe just wanted one and underneath the waterfall is a grotto with flat rocks that serve as beds for couples to lounge on and adan is just glad that for hygienic purposes the grotto is regularly sprayed by the waterfall the clubs tables are all twisted rusted metal the surfaces done in motherofpearl with seashells encrusted on them the dance floor is painted like an ocean bottom and the expensive lighting creates a blue ripple effect as if the dancers were swimming underwater the place cost a fortune you can build it adan had warned raul but it had better make money havent they all raul answered in all fairness this is true adan had to admit raul might have appalling taste but hes a genius at creating trendy nightclubs and restaurants profit centers in themselves and invaluable for laundering the narcodollars that now flow south from el norte like a deep green river the place is packed not only because it is el dia de los muertos but also because la sirena is a smash even in this highly competitive resort town and during the annual drunken orgy known as spring break the american college kids will flock to the club spending even more clean american dollars but tonight the crowd is mostly mexican mostly in fact friends and business associates of the barrera brothers here to celebrate with them there are a few american tourists who have found their way in and a handful of europeans as well but thats all right there will be no business conducted here tonight or any night for that matterthere is an unwritten rule that the legitimate businesses in the resort towns are strictly off limits for any narco activities no drug deals no meetings and above all no violence after narcotics tourism is the countrys biggest source of foreign currency so no one wants to scare away the americans british germans and japanese who leave their dollars pounds marks and yen in mazatlan puerto vallarta cabo san lucas and cozumel all the cartels own nightclubs restaurants discos and hotels in these towns so they have an interest to protect an interest that would be ill served by a tourist catching a stray bullet no one wants to pick up a newspaper and see headlines of a bloody shootout with photos of corpses lying in the street so the pasadores and the government all have a healthy agreement of the take it somewhere else boys variety theres just too much money being made to mess with you can play in these towns but you have to play nice and they are certainly playing tonight adan thinks as he watches fabian martinez dance with three or four blond german girls there is too much business to take care of the unceasing cycle of product going north and money coming south there are the constant business arrangements with the orejuelas then the actual movement of the cocaine from colombia to mexico then the endless challenge of getting it safely into the states and converting it to crack then selling it to the retailers collecting the money getting the cash back into mexico and cleaning it some of the money goes into fun but a lot of the money goes into bribes silver or lead plata o plomo one of the barrera lieutenants would simply go to the local police comandante or army commander with a bag full of cash and give him the choice in those exact words plata o plomo thats all that needed to be said the meaning was clearyou can get rich or you can get dead you choose if they chose rich it was adans business if they chose dead that was rauls business most people chose rich cono adan thinks most of the cops planned on getting rich in fact they had to buy their positions from their superiors or pay a monthly share of their mordida it was like a franchise operation burger king taco bell mcbribes easiest money in the world money for nothing just look the other way be someplace else see no evil hear no evil speak no evil and the monthly payment will be there in full and on time and the war adan reflects watching the partiers dance in the shimmering blue light has been a further boon for the cops and the army mendez pays his cops to bust our dope we pay our guys to bust mendezs dope its a good deal for everyone except the guy whose dope gets popped say the baja state police seize a million dollars of gueros cocaine we pay them a finders fee they get to be heroes in the papers and look like good guys to the yanquis and then after a decent interval they sell us that million bucks worth of blow for its a winwin deal and thats in mexico alone there are also us customs agents to pay to look the other way when cars full of coke or grass or heroin come through their stations a carload no matter whats in it and still theres no way to guarantee that your car is going to go through a clean checkpoint even though youve bought condo buildings whose top floors overlook the crossing stations and you have lookouts up there who are in radio contact with your drivers and try to steer them toward the right lanes but the customs agents are switched often and arbitrarily and other agents are monitoring radio bands so if you send a dozen cars at a time through the border crossings at san ysidro and otay mesa you expect nine or ten of them to get through there are bribes to city cops in san diego los angeles san bernardino you name it and to state police and sheriffs departments and secretaries and typists in the dea who can slip you info on what investigations are going on with what technology or even to that rare rare dea agent you could get on the arm but they are few and far between because between the dea and the mexican cartels there is a blood feud still from the killing of ernie hidalgo art keller sees to that and thank god for that adan thinks because while kellers revenge obsession might cost me money in the short run in the long run it makes me money and that is what the americans simply cannot seem to understandthat all they do is drive up the price and make us rich without them any bobo with an old truck or a leaky boat with an outboard motor could run drugs into el norte and then the price would not be worth the effort but as it is it takes millions of dollars to move the drugs and the prices are accordingly skyhigh the americans take a product that literally grows on trees and turn it into a valuable commodity without them cocaine and marijuana would be like oranges and instead of making billions smuggling it id be making pennies doing stoop labor in some california field picking it and the truly funny irony is that keller is himself another product because i make millions selling protection against him charging the independent contractors who want to move their product through la plaza thousands of dollars for the use of our cops soldiers customs agents coast guard surveillance equipment communications this is what mexican cops appreciate that american cops dont we are partners mi hermano arturo in the same enterprise comrades in the war on drugs we could not exist without each other adan watches as two nordiclooking young women stand under the waterfall letting the spray soak their thin tshirts to display their breasts to any and all admirers of which there are quite a few the disco music is pounding the dancing frenetic the drinking hard fast and constant its el dia de los muertos and most of the people in the crowd here tonight are old friends from culiacan or badiraguato and if youre a narco from sinaloa you have a lot of dead to remember there are a lot of ghosts at this party its been a bloody war but adan thinks hopefully it is almost over and we will get back to pure business because adan barrera has reinvented the drug business the traditional shape of any of the mexican pasadores was the pyramid similar to the sicilian mafia families there was a godfather a boss then captains then soldiers and every level kicked up to the next the lower levels made very little money unless they could build levels beneath them who would in turn kick up but make very little anybody but a fool could figure out the problem with the pyramidif you get in early youre gold if you get in late youre fucked all it did in adans analysis was create motivation to go out and start a new pyramid the pyramid was also too vulnerable to aggressive law enforcement all you had to do adan thought was look at what had happened to the american mafia to see that all you needed was one dedo one snitch one dissatisfied soldier at the lower levels and he could take the cops up and down the integrated pyramid structure every single one of the heads of new yorks five families was now in prison with their families going into serious and inevitable decline so adan tore down the pyramid and replaced it with a horizontal structure well almost horizontal his new organization had only two levels the barrera brothers on top everyone else underneath them but on the same level we want entrepreneurs not employees adan told raul employees cost money entrepreneurs make money the new structure created a growing pool of highly motivated richly rewarded independent businessmen who paid percent of their gross to the barreras and were happy to do it there was now only one level to kick up to and you ran your own business took your own risks reaped your own rewards and adan saw to it that the potential rewards were greater for the emerging entrepreneurs he rebuilt his baja cartel on that principal allowingno encouraginghis people to go into business for themselves lowering their taxes to percent giving lowinterest loans for startup capital providing them with access to financial servicesie moneylaunderingall in exchange for simple loyalty to the cartel twelve percent from many adan had explained to raul when first proposing the drastic tax reduction will be more than thirty percent from a few he had observed the lessons of the reagan revolution they could make more money by lowering taxes than by raising them because the lower taxes allowed more entrepreneurs to come into the business and make more money and pay more taxes raul is of the opinion that lead not a new business model is winning the war against mendez and in a narrow sense hes right but adan is convinced that the more powerful factor was the pure force of economicsthe barreras simply undersold guero mendez you can sell coke with a percent overhead or pepsi with a percent overheadyou choose an easy choice to makeyou can sell pepsi and make a lot of money or coke and make less money until raul kills you suddenly there were a lot of pepsi distributorships you would have to be a fool to choose the lead coke over the silver pepsi silver or lead the yin and yang of the new baja cartel deal with adan and get the silver or deal with raul and get the lead a structure that tipped the scales in baja against guero mendez he was simply too slow catching up and by the time he did he couldnt afford to lower his prices because he couldnt get enough cocaine through la plaza and had to pay out thirty points to move it through sonora or the gulf no raul later had to admit the percent deal had been an act of sheer genius its perfect for guys like fabian martinez and the rest of the juniors the rules were simple you would tell the barreras when you were bringing the product through what it was cocaine marijuana or heroin how much weight and what your prearranged sale price wasusually somewhere between and per kiloand what date you were planning on delivering it to the retailer in the states you then had fortyeight hours after that date to pay the barreras percent of the prearranged sale price the prearranged price was simply a guarantee on a bottomif you sold it for less you still owed the percentage on the quoted price if you sold it for more you owed the percentage on the higher price if you couldnt deliver the money within the two days you had better sit down with adan and arrange a payment plan or sit down with raul and silver or lead the percent was just for bringing the drugs through la plaza if you wanted to make your own arrangement with the local police federales or army comandante to guarantee the safety of your shipment fine but if it got busted you still owed the twelve points if you wanted the barreras to make those security arrangements that was also fine but it would cost youthe price of the mordida plus a handling fee but in that case the barreras guaranteed the safety of your shipment on the mexican side of the border if it was seized they would reimburse you for the wholesale cost of the shipment that is if it was cocaine for instance the barreras would pay you the purchase price you had negotiated with the orejuela cartel in cali not the retail price you expected to get in the states if you bought the barrera security package the safety of your shipment was absolutely guaranteed from the time it reached baja until the time it hit the border no other dealer would try to rip it off no bandits would try to hijack it raul and his sicarios saw to thatyou would have to be seriously insane to try to steal a shipment the safety of which was spoken for by raul barrera the barreras also offered financial services adan wanted to make it as easy as possible for as many people as possible to get into the business so the percent never had to be fronted you didnt have to pay it until after you had sold it it was always done on the come but the barreras went the extra stepthey would help you launder the money once you had sold your shipment and this was an increasingly profitable product for the barreras the going rate for money cleansing was percent but bribed bankers would give the barreras a volume price of percent so adan was making an additional percent on every customers dollar again you didnt have to launder your cash through the barrerasyou were an independent businessman you could do whatever you wanted but if you went somewhere else and got ripped off or cheated or if your money got seized at us customs on the way back through the border it was your own tough luck whereas the barreras guaranteed your money whatever you put in dirty you got back cleanwithin three working daysminus the percent and this has been adans baja revolutioncatching the drug business up with times miguel angel barrera dragged the drug business into the twentieth century is how one narcotraficante put it adan is leading it into the twentyfirst and beating guero mendez while were at it adan thinks if he cannot move his cocaine he cannot pay mordida if he cannot pay mordida he cannot move cocaine in the meantime we are building a network that is fast efficient and entrepreneurial using the newest and best technology and financial mechanisms life is good adan thinks on this day of the dead day of the dead callan thinks big deal like aint they all days of the dead hes knocking a few back at the bar of la sirena you want a challenge try getting a straightup whiskey at a mexican beach bar tell the guy you want a drink without a goddamn umbrella in it he looks at you like you ruined his fuckin day callan does it anyway yo viejo is it raining in here no then i dont need this do i and if i wanted fruit juice amigo id order fruit juice only juice i want is the juice of the barley irish vitamin c the old waters of life which is kind of funny callan thinks when you consider what i do for a living what ive always done basically cancel peoples reservations sorry sir youre checking out early yeah but yeah but nothin out of the pool it aint for the cimino family anymore but sal scachi is still calling the shots in a manner of speaking callan was chilling out down in costa rica waiting for the shit storm in new york to blow itself out when scachi came to see him how would you feel about going down to colombia hed asked callan to do what to hook up with something called mas was the answer muerte a secuestradoresdeath to kidnappers scachi explained that it started back in when the leftwing insurgent group m kidnapped the sister of colombian drug lord fabian ochoa and held her for ransom yeah that was a good business plan callan thought kidnapping a bosss sister like ochoa was going to pay right what the cocaine magnate did instead scachi said was he convened a meeting of associates and made them each cough up in cash and ten of their best gunmen do the maththats a war chest of four and a half million bucks and an army of over two thousand button men dig this scachi said these guys actually flew over a soccer stadium in a helicopter and dropped leaflets announcing what they were going to do which was basically rip through cali and medellin like rabid dogs on crack busted into homes dragged college kids right out of their classrooms shot some of them on the spot and took others away to safe houses for questioning ochoas sister was released unharmed whats all this to me callan asked scachi tells him in the colombian government struck a truce with the various leftist groups that formed an aboveground alliance called the union patriotica which won fourteen seats in parliament in the elections okay callan said not okay scachi answered these people are communists sean scachi launched into a fucking tirade the gist of which was that we fought the communists so the people could have democracy then the ungrateful motherfuckers turn around and vote for communists so what sal was saying callan guessed is that the people should have democracy just not that much democracy they got the absolute freedom to choose what we want them to mas is going to do something about it scachi was saying they could use a man with your talents maybe they could callan thought but they aint gettin a man with my talents i dont know what sals connection is to this mas but it aint nothin to me i think ill just go back to new york callan said after all johnny boy was firmly in charge of the family and johnny boy had no reason to give callan anything but love and safe harbor yeah you can do that scachi said except for there are about three thousand federal indictments waiting for you for what for what scachi said cocaine dealing extortion racketeering the word i get is they also like you for the big paulie thing they like you for the big paulie thing sal callan asks what are you saying i mean you put me there listen kid i can probably get this straightened out for you scachi says but it wouldnt hurt if you would you know help us out on this thing callan didnt ask how sal scachi could straighten out a federal beef by getting him to go down to colombia to hook up with a bunch of anticommunist cocaine vigilantes because there are some things you dont want to know he just took the plane ticket and the fresh passport flew to medellin and reported for work with mas death to kidnappers turned out to be death to winning union patriotica candidates six of them took bullets to the head instead of the oath of office days of the dead callan thinks now working on his drink days of the dead after that it was just on he remembers m retaliated by seizing the palace of justice and over a hundred people including several supreme court judges got killed in the fuckedup rescue attempt which is what you get callan thinks for using the cops and the army instead of professionals they used professionals though to hit the leader of the union patriotica callan didnt pull the trigger but he rode shotgun when they whacked jaime pardo leal it was a good hitclean efficient professional turned out though that was just the warmup the real killing started in the money behind a lot of it came from the man himself medellin cocaine lord pablo escobar at first callan couldnt figure why escobar and the other coke lords gave a rats ass about the politics but then he tripped to the fact that the cartel boys had put a lot of their coke money into real estate large cattle ranches that they didnt want to see broken up by some leftist landdistribution scheme callan got to know one of these ranches real well in the spring of mas moved him out to las tangas a large finca owned by a couple of brothers carlos and fidel cardona when they were still teenagers their father had been kidnapped and murdered by communist guerrillas so as much as you want to talk about politics and all that shit callan thought when he met them at their ranch its personal its always personal las tangas wasnt as much a ranch as it was a fucking fort callan saw some cattle out there but what he saw mostly were other killers like himself there were a lot of colombians cartel soldiers on loan but there were also south africans and rhodesians who had lost their own war and were looking to win this one then there were israelis lebanese russians irish and cubans it was a fucking olympic village for button men they trained hard too some guy rumored to be an israeli colonel came in with a bunch of fucking brits who were all exsas or claimed to be anyway as a good mick callan hated the brits and the sas but he had to admit that these limeys knew what they were doing callan was always pretty slick with a but there was a lot more to this kind of work and pretty soon callan was getting instruction on the use and handling of the m the ak the m machine gun and the barrettmodel sniper rifle he also trained in handtohand combathow to kill with a knife a garrote his hands and feet some of the permanent instructors were former us special forces guyssome of them operation phoenix vets from vietnam a lot of them were colombian army officers who spoke english like they were from mayberry usa it used to crack callan up whenever one of these uppercrust colombians would open his mouth and sound like some cracker then he found out that most of these guys had gotten their training at fort benning in georgia something called the school of the americas yeah what the fuck kind of school is that callan thought reading writing and whacking whatever they taught some nasty skills which the colombians were happy to pass on to the group that had become known as los tangueros there was a lot of ojt too onthejob training one day a squad of tangueros went out to ambush a group of guerrillas that had been operating in the area a local army officer had delivered photos of the six intended targets who lived in villages like your average campesinos when they werent out doing guerrillatype shit fidel cardona led the mission himself cardona had become kind of a kick calling himself rambo and pretty much dressing like the guy in the movie anyway they went out and set up an ambush on a dirt road these guys were supposed to be using the tangueros spread out in a perfect ushaped formation just the way theyd been taught callan didnt like it lying in the brush wearing cammies sweating in the heat im a city guy he thinks when did i join the fucking army truth is he was edgy not scared really more apprehensive not knowing what to expect hed never gone up against guerrillas before he thought that theyd probably be pretty good well trained know the terrain better and how to use it the guerrillas strolled right into the open top of the u they werent what callan was expecting hardened fighters in camouflage gear with aks these guys looked like farmers in old denim shirts and short campesino trousers and they didnt move like soldiers eitherspread out alert they were just walking up the road callan laid the sights of his galil rifle on the guy farthest to the left aimed a little low at the guys stomach in case the rifle kicked up also he didnt want to look at the guys face because the man had this baby face and he was talking to his friends and laughing like a guy does with his buddies at the end of a day of work so callan kept his eyes on the blue of the mans shirt because then it was like shooting this thing just like target shooting he waited for fidel to take the first shot and when he heard it he squeezed the trigger twice his man went down they all did the poor fuckers never saw it coming never knew what hit them there was just a volley of fire from the bushes beside the road and then there were six guerrillas down bleeding into the dirt they never even had time to pull their weapons callan forced himself to walk over to the man he had shot the guy was dead lying facedown in the road callan nudged the body over with his foot they had strict orders to pick up any guns except callan didnt find one all the guy was carrying was a machete the kind that the campesinos used to cut bananas off the trees callan looked around and saw that none of the guerrillas had guns that didnt bother fidel he walked around putting insurance shots into the backs of their heads then radioed back to las tangas pretty soon a truck rolled up with a pile of clothes like the communist guerrillas usually wore and fidel ordered his men to dress the corpses in the new clothes you gotta be fuckin kiddin me callan said rambo wasnt kidding he told callan to get busy callan got busy sitting on the side of the road i aint no fuckin undertaker is what he told fidel so callan sat and watched as the other tangueros changed the corpses clothes then snapped photos of the dead guerrillas fidel yapped at him all the way back i know what im doing fidel said i went to school yeah i went to school too callan told him they held the classes in hells kitchen but the guys i shot rambo callan added they usually had guns in their hands rambo must have bitched to scachi about him because sal showed up a few weeks later at the ranch to have a counseling session with callan whats your problem scachi asked him my problem is gunning down fuckin farmers callan said their hands were empty sal we aint making westerns here sal answered theres no code of honor what you want to hit them when theyre in the jungle with aks in their hands you feel better if you take casualties this is a motherfuckin war sparky yeah i get its a war scachi said youre getting paid arent you yeah callan thought im getting paid the eagle screams twice a month in cash and theyre treating you well scachi asked like fucking kings callan had to admit steaks every night if you wanted them free beer free whiskey free coke if that was your thing callan blew a little coke now and then but it didnt do it for him like the booze did a lot of the tangueros would snort a pile of coke then hit the whores that were brought in on weekends and fuck them all night callan went with the whores a couple of times a man has needs but thats about all it was just meeting a need these werent highclass call girls like at the white house eitherthese were mostly indian women brought in from the oil fields to the west they werent even women if you wanted to be honest about it they were mostly just girls in cheap dresses and heavy makeup first time he used one callan felt more sad than relieved afterward he went into a little cubicle in the back of their barracks bare plywood walls and a bed with a bare mattress she tried to talk sexy to him saying things she thought hed like to hear but he finally asked her to shut up and just fuck he lay there afterward thinking about the blond woman back in san diego nora was her name she was beautiful but that was a different life after scachis pep talk callan soldiered up and went on more missions los tangueros bushwhacked another six unarmed guerrillas on the banks of a river gunned down another halfdozen right in the town square of a local village fidel had a word for their activities limpieza he called it cleansing they were cleansing the area of guerrillas communists labor leaders agitatorsall the fucking garbage callan heard talk they werent the only ones doing the cleansing there were lots of other groups other ranches other training centers all over the country all the groups had nicknamesmuerte a revolucionarios alfa los tinados inside two years they killed over three thousand activists organizers candidates and guerrillas most of these killings took place in isolated rural villages especially in the medellin stronghold area in the magdalena valley where the entire male populations of villages would be herded together and machinegunned or chopped to pieces with machetes if bullets were deemed too expensive and there were a lot of people other than communists getting cleansedstreet kids homosexuals drug addicts winos one day the tangueros went out to cleanse some guerrillas who were on the move from one base of operation to another so callan and the others waited for this rural bus to come down the road stopped it and took everybody but the driver off fidel went through the passengers comparing their faces with photos he had in his hand then pulled five men from the group and had them taken into the ditch callan watched as the men dropped to their knees and started praying they didnt get much beyond nuestro padre before a bunch of tangueros sprayed them with bullets callan turned away only to see two of his other comrades chaining the bus driver to the steering wheel what the fuck are you doing callan yelled they siphoned gasoline from the fuel tank of the bus into a plastic water jug and then poured it on the driver and as he screamed for mercy fidel turned to the passengers and announced this is what you get for transporting guerrillas two of the tangueros held callan back as fidel tossed a match into the bus callan saw the drivers eyes heard his screams and watched the mans body twist and dance to the flames he never got the smell out of his nose sitting here now in this puerto vallarta bar he can smell the burning flesh aint enough scotch in the world to cleanse that smell that night callan hit the bottle hard got good and fuckin drunk and thought about picking up the old and putting a deuce into fidels face decided he wasnt ready to commit suicide and started packing instead one of the rhodesians stopped him you dont leave here on your feet the guy told him theyll kill you before you walk a klik the guys right i wouldnt make it a kilometer theres nothing you can do the rhodesian said its red mist whats red mist callan asked the guy looked at him weird and then just shrugged like if you dont know whats red mist callan asked scachi on sals next visit to las tangas to adjust callans evershittier attitude the fucking mick was just sitting in the barracks having long conversations with johnnie walker whered you hear of red mist scachi asked dont matter yeah well forget you heard it fuck that sal callan said im a part of somethin i want to know what it is no you dont scachi thought and even if you did i cant tell you red mist was the code name for the coordination of scores of operations to neutralize leftwing movements across latin america basically the phoenix program for south and central america half the time the individual operations didnt even know they were being coordinated as part of red mist but it was scachis role as john hobbss errand boy to make sure that intelligence was shared assets were distributed targets were hit and nobody stepped on anyone elses dick in the doing of it it wasnt an easy job but scachi was the perfect man for it green beret sometime cia asset made member of the mafia sal would just disappear on detached duty from the army and work as hobbss waterboy and there was a lot of water to be carried red mist encompassed literally hundreds of rightwing militias and their druglord sponsors a thousand army officers and a few hundred thousand troops dozens of separate intelligence agencies and police forces and the church sal scachi was a knight of malta and a member of opus dei the fervently rightwing anticommunist secret organization of bishops priests and committed laypeople such as sal the catholic church was at war with itself its conservative leadership in the vatican fighting the liberation theologistsleftwing often marxist priests and bishops on the ground in the third worldfor the soul of mother church herself the knights of malta and opus dei worked handinglove with the rightwing militias the army officers even the drug cartels when necessary and the blood flowed like wine at communion most of it paid for directly or indirectly with american dollars directly from american aid to the countries militaries whose officers made up the bulk of the death squads indirectly by americans buying drugs the dollars for which went to the cartels sponsoring the death squads billions of dollars in economic aid billions of dollars in dope money in el salvador rightwing death squads murdered leftwing politicians and labor organizers in on the campus of central american university in san salvador salvadoran army officers gunned down six jesuit priests a maid and her little girl with sniper rifles in that same year the united states government sent half a billion dollars in aid to the salvadoran government by the end of the s approximately people had been killed guatemala doubled that figure in the long war against the marxist rebels over people were killed and another were never found homeless kids were gunned down in the streets college students were murdered an american hotelier was beheaded a university professor was stabbed in the hall of her classroom building an american nun was raped killed and thrown onto the corpses of her companions through it all american soldiers provided training advice and equipment including the helicopters that flew the killers to the killing grounds by the end of the s us president george bush was so disgusted by the carnage that he finally cut off funds and armaments for the guatemalan military everywhere in latin america it was the samethe long shadow war between the haves and the havenots between the right wing and the marxists with the liberals caught deerintheheadlights between them always red mist was there john hobbs oversaw the operation sal scachi ran the daybyday liaising with army officers trained at the school of the americas at fort benning georgia providing training technical advice equipment intelligence lending assets to the latin american armed forces and militias one of these assets was sean callan the man is a fucking mess scachi thought looking at callanlong dirty hair his skin yellow from days of hard drinking not exactly the specimen of a warrior but looks are deceiving whatever callan isnt scachi thought he is talent and talents hard to come by so im taking you out of las tangas scachi said good i got other work for you no shit he did callan remembers luis carlos galan the liberal party presidential candidate who was miles ahead in the polls was taken off the count in the summer of bernardo jaramillo osa the leader of the up was shot to death as he got off a plane in bogota the following spring carlos pizarro ms candidate for president was gunned down just a few weeks later after that colombia was too hot for sean callan but guatemala wasnt neither was honduras nor was el salvador scachi moved him around like a knight in a chess set jumping him here jumping him there using him to take pieces off the board guadalupe salcedo hector oqueli carlos toledothen a dozen others callan started to lose track of the names he might not have known exactly what red mist really was but he sure as hell knew what it was to himblood a red mist filling his head until thats all he could see then scachi moved him to mexico what for callan asked chill you out for a while scachi answered just help provide a little protection for some people you remember the barrera brothers how couldnt he it was the cocaineforguns deal that had started all the shit back in got jimmy peaches sideways with big paulie which started his own strange trip yeah callan remembered them what about them theyre friends of ours scachi said friends of ours callan thought weird choice of words a phrase that made guys use only to describe other made guys to each other well i aint a made guy callan thought and a couple of mexican coke dealers sure arent so what the fuck theyre good people scachi explained they contribute to the effort yeah that makes them fucking angels callan thought but he went to mexico because where else was he going to go so now hes here at this beach resort for a day of the dead party decides to have a couple of pops because theyre in a safe place on a holy day so there aint going to be no problems even if there are he thinks im better a little drunk these days than totally sober he throws back the last of his drink then sees the big aquarium shatter and the water burst out and two people drop in that particular twisting way that people do only when theyve been shot callan drops behind the bar stool and pulls his there must be forty blackuniformed federales busting through the front door firing ms from the hip bullets strike the fake rock walls of the cave and its a good thing they are fake callan thinks because theyre absorbing the bullets instead of deflecting them back into the crowd then one of the federales unhooks a grenade from his shoulder strap callan yells get down as if anyone could hear or understand him then he pops two rounds into the federales head and the man drops before he can pull the pin and the grenade falls harmlessly to the floor but another federale flings another grenade and it hits near the dance floor and explodes in a discopyrotechnic flash and now several partyers go down screaming with pain as the shrapnel rips into their legs now people are ankledeep in bloody water and flopping fish and callan feels something hit his foot but it isnt a bullet its a blue tang fish pretty and electric indigo in the nightclub lights and he loses himself in a peaceful moment watching the fish and it is pandemonium now inside la sirena as the partiers scream and cry and try to push their way out but there is no way out because the federales are blocking the doors and shooting callans glad hes a little buzzed hes on alcoholirishhiredkiller autopilot his head is clear and cool and he knows now that the shooters arent federales this isnt a bust its a hit and if these guys are cops theyre offduty and picking up a little extra money for the upcoming holidays and he realizes quickly that no one is going to get out through the front doornot alive anywayand there must be a back exit so he lowers himself into the water and starts to crawl toward the back of the club its the wall of water that saves adans life it knocks him off his chair and sends him to the floor so the first round of gunfire and shrapnel passes over his head he starts to pick himself up but then instinct takes over as he feels bullets zinging over him and he sits back down looks stupidly at the bullets chopping into the expensive coral now dry and exposed behind the shattered aquarium then jumps as an agitated moray eel twists beside him he looks over to the other wall where behind the waterfall fabian martinez is trying to twist himself back into his pants as one of the german girls sitting on the rock shelf does the same and raul stands there with his pants around his ankles and a pistol in his hand and shoots back through the waterfall the faux federales cant see through the waterfall thats what saves raul who stands there blasting away with impunity until he runs out of ammo drops the gun and reaches down and pulls up his pants then grabs fabian by the shoulder and says come on we have to get out of here because the federales are pushing their way through the crowd now searching for the barrera brothers adan sees them coming and gets up to head for the back slips and falls gets back up again and when he does a federale points a rifle in his face and smiles and adan is dead except the federales smile disappears in a whirl of blood and adan feels someone grab his wrist and pull him down and then hes in the water on the floor facetoface with a yanqui who says get down asshole then callan starts shooting at the advancing federales with short efficient burstspoppop poppopknocking them down like floating ducks in a carnival game adan glances down at the dead federale and to his horror sees that the crabs have already scuttled over to feed at the gaping hole where the cops face used to be callan crawls forward and takes two grenades from the guys he just shot then quickly reloads bellycrawls back grabs adan and firing behind with the other hand pushes him toward the back my brother adan yells i have to find my brother down callan yells as a fresh burst of fire explodes toward them adan does go down as bullets punch him in the back of his right calf and send him sprawling facefirst into the water where he stupidly lies watching his own blood flow past his nose he cant seem to move now his brain is trying to tell him to get up but hes suddenly exhausted much too tired to move callan squats down hefts adan over his shoulder and staggers toward the door labeled banos hes almost there when raul takes the weight off him i got him raul says callan nods another barrera shooter has their backs firing behind him into the chaos of the club callan kicks the door open and finds himself in the relative quiet of a little hallway to the right is a door marked sirenas with a little silhouette of a mermaid the door to the left is marked poseidones with a silhouette of a man with long curly hair and a beard directly in front is the salida and raul makes straight for this exit callan screams no and pulls him away by the collar just in time because slugs come ripping through the open door just like he expected they would anyone who has the time and manpower to stage this kind of hit is going to place some shooters outside the back door so he yanks raul through the poseidones door the other shooter goes in behind him callan pulls the pin on one of the grenades and tosses it out the back door to discourage anyone from standing around there or coming in then he jumps into the mens room and closes the door behind him hears the grenade go off with a dull bass thump raul sits adan down on the toilet and the other shooter guards the door while callan examines adans wounded leg the bullets have passed clean through but theres no way of telling if theyve broken any bones or hit the femoral artery in which case adan is going to bleed to death before they can get him help the truth is that none of them are going to make it not if the shooters keep coming because theyre trapped fuck he thinks somehow i always knew id die in a shithouse then he looks around and there are no windows like youre supposed to have in american restrooms but there is directly above him a skylight a skylight in a mens room it had been another one of rauls style points i want the bathrooms to look like cruiseliner cabins turned sideways hed explained to adan when arguing for the skylights you know as if the ship was sunk so the skylight is in the shape of a porthole and the bathrooms are ornate and everything except the sink and the toilet is turned sideways which is just what you want callan thinks if youve been pounding margaritas and go to take a pissa seasick shitter he wonders how many college kids have staggered in here in pretty good shape and then puked it all up once they got sideways but he doesnt think about it for long because that fucking stupid porthole above them is the way out so he climbs up on the sink counter and opens the skylight he jumps gets a grip then pulls himself up and through and then hes on the roof and the air is salty and warm and then he sticks his head back down through the porthole skylight and says come on fabian jumps and pulls himself through the skylight then raul lifts adan up and callan and fabian pull him up onto the roof raul has a hard time squeezing himself through the small porthole but manages just in time as the federales kick open the door and spray the room with bullets then they rush in expecting to see dead bodies and screaming twisting wounded but they dont see any of that and theyre puzzled until one of them looks up and sees the open skylight and then he gets it but the next thing he sees is callans hand dropping a grenade and then the skylight closes and now there are dead and screaming twisting bodies in the mens room of la sirena callan leads the way across the roof to the back of the building theres only one federale guarding the alley in back now and callan dispatches him with two quick shots to the back of the head then he and raul carefully lower adan down to a waiting fabian then they take off trotting down the alley raul with adan slung over his shoulder toward the back street where callan shoots the window out of a ford explorer opens the door and takes about thirty seconds to hotwire the ignition ten minutes later theyre in the emergency room of our lady of guadalupe hospital where the registration nurses hear the name barrera and ask no questions adan is luckythe femur is chipped but not broken and the femoral artery is untouched raul is giving blood with one arm on the phone with the other and in minutes his sicarios are either rushing to the hospital or searching the neighborhood of la sirena for any of gueros boys who might be lingering they dont come back with any only the news that six of the partyers were killed and ten of the federales are either dead or wounded but mendezs gunmen have failed to kill the barrera brothers thanks to sean callan whatever you want adan tells him on this day of the dead you have only to ask whatever you want in this world the teenage girl makes him his own pan de muerto bread of the dead the traditional sugary sweet roll with a surprise hidden inside a treat which she knows don miguel angel barrera especially likes and looks forward to on this holiday and as its good luck for the person who takes the bite that has the surprise in it she makes one roll just for him to make sure that don miguel is the one who receives the surprise she wants everything just right for him on this special night so she dresses with special care a simple but elegant black dress black stockings and heels she applies her makeup slowly paying particular attention to the exact thickness of the mascara then brushes her long black hair until it shines she checks the effect in the mirror and what she sees pleases herher skin is smooth and pale her dark eyes are highlighted her hair falls softly on her shoulders she goes into the kitchen and places the special pan de muerto on a silver tray flanks it with amber candles lights them and goes into his diningroom cell he looks regal she thinks in a maroon smoking jacket over silk pajamas don miguels nephews make sure that their uncle has all the luxuries that he requires to make his existence in prison bearablegood clothing good food good wines and well her people whisper that adan barrera takes such good care of his uncle to assuage his own guilt because he prefers his uncle to linger in prison so the old man wont interfere with his leadership of the barrera pasador sharper tongues wag that adan actually set up his own uncle so that he could take over the girl doesnt know the truth behind any of this and doesnt care all she knows is that adan barrera rescued her from a future of misery in a mexico city brothel and chose her instead as his uncles companion the gossips would have it that she resembles a woman whom don miguel once loved which is my good fortune the girl thinks don miguels demands arent heavy she cooks for him launders his clothes accommodates his needs as a man true he beats her but not as often or as viciously as her own father and his sexual demands are not as frequent he beats her then screws her and if he cannot keep his floto hard he gets angry and beats her until he can do it there are worse lives she thinks and the money that adan barrera sends her is generous but not as generous as she puts the thought out of her head and presents don miguel with the pan de muerto her hands are shaking tio notices her small hands quiver as she lays the bread on the table in front of him and when he looks into her eyes theyre moist on the verge of tears is it sorrow he asks himself or fear and as he looks closely into her eyes she glances down at the pan de muerto and then back up at him and then he knows it is beautiful he says looking down at the sweet roll thank you is there a crack in her voice he wonders just the slightest hesitation please sit down he says standing and holding her chair out for her she sits down her hands gripping the edges of the chair please you have the first bite he says sitting back down oh no it is for you i insist i couldnt i insist its a command she cant disobey so she tears off a piece of the pan and lifts it to her lips or tries to anywayher hand shakes so badly that it has a hard time finding her mouth and try as she might to hold them back tears fill her eyes and then spill over and her mascara runs down her cheeks leaving black streaks on her face she looks up at him and sniffles i cant and yet you would have fed it to me she sniffs but little bubbles of snot run out of her nose he hands her a linen napkin wipe your nose he says she does then he says now you must eat the bread that you baked for me she blurts out please then she looks down are my nephews already dead tio wonders guero wouldnt dare attempt to assassinate me unless adan and raul especially were safely out of the picture so either they are already dead or will be soon or perhaps guero has botched that as well let us hope so he thinks and makes a mental note to contact his nephews at the first opportunity as soon as this triste business is concluded mendez offered you a fortune didnt he miguel angel asks the girl a new life for you for your whole family she nods you have younger sisters do you not tio asks your drunk of a father abuses them with mendezs money you could get them out make them a home yes i understand tio says she looks up at him hopefully eat he says it is a merciful death isnt it i know you wouldnt have wanted me to die slowly and in pain she balks at putting the bread in her mouth her hand trembles leaving little crumbs sticking to her bright red lipstick and now fat heavy tears plop onto the bread ruining the sugary frosting that she had so carefully applied eat she takes a bite of the bread but cant seem to swallow it so he pours a glass of red wine and puts it in her hand she sips it and that seems to help and she washes the bread down with it then takes another bite and another sip he leans across the table and strokes her hair with the back of his hand and softly murmurs i know i know as with his other hand he places another piece of the bread to her lips she opens her mouth and takes it on her tongue then a sip of wine and then the strychnine hits and her head snaps back her eyes open wide and her death rattle gurgles moistly between her parted lips he has her body thrown over the fence to the dogs parada lights a cigarette sucks on it as he bends over putting on his shoes and wonders why hes being awakened in the small hours of the morning and what is this urgent personal business that could not wait until the sun came up he tells his housekeeper to make the minister of education at home in the study and that hell be right down parada has known cerro for years he was bishop in culiacan when cerro was the sinaloa governor and even baptized two of the mans legitimate children and hadnt miguel angel barrera stood as godfather on both occasions parada asks himself certainly it was barrera who had come to him to make arrangements both spiritual and temporal for cerros illegitimate offspring when the governor had taken advantage of some young girl from one of the villages oh well at least they came to me as opposed to an abortionist and that is something in the mans favor but he thinks as he pulls an old wool sweater over his head if this is another teenage girl in an interesting circumstance i am prepared to be seriously annoyed cerro should know better at his age certainly he might have learned from experience if nothing else and in any case why does it have to be athe glances at the clockfour in the morning he rings for the housekeeper coffee please parada tells her for two in the study recently his relationship with cerro has been one of alternate arguing and cajoling begging and threatening as he has petitioned the minister of education for new schools books lunch programs and more teachers it has been a constant negotiation in which parada has tiptoed on the edge of blackmail once protesting to cerro that the rural villages were not going to be treated like bastard childrena remark that was apparently worth two primary schools and a dozen new teachers perhaps this is cerros revenge parada thinks as he goes downstairs but when he opens the door to his study and sees cerros face he knows its far more serious cerro gets right to it im dying of cancer parada is stunned i am terribly sorry to hear this is there nothing no there is no hope would you like for me to hear your confession i have a priest for that cerro says he hands parada the briefcase i brought you this cerro says i didnt know who else to bring it to parada opens it looks at the papers and the tapes and says i dont understand i have been a conspirator cerro says in a massive crime i cannot die i am afraid to die with this on my soul i need to at least try to make restitution certainly if you confess you will receive absolution parada answers but if this is all evidence of some sort why bring it to me why not to the attorney general or his voice is on those tapes well that would be a reason parada thinks cerro leans forward and whispers the attorney general the secretary of the interior the chairman of the pri the president all of them all of us good god parada thinks what is on these tapes he goes through a pack and a half listening to them lighting one cigarette from another he listens to the tapes and pores through the documents memos of meetings cerros notes names dates and places a fifteenyear record of corruptionno not just corruption that would be the sad norm and this is extraordinary more than extraordinarylanguage fails what they did in the simplest possible terms they sold the country to the narcotraficantes he wouldnt have believed it if he hadnt heard it himself tapes from a dinner million per plateto help elect this president the murders of election officials and the theft of the election itself the voices of the presidents brother and the attorney general planning these outrages and soliciting the narcos to pay for it all and to commit the murders and to torture and murder the american agent hidalgo and then there was operation cerberus the conspiracy to fund equip and train the contras through the sale of cocaine and operation red mist the rightwing murders funded in part by the drug cartels in colombia and mexico and supported by the pri small wonder cerro is afraid of hellhes helped to build it here and now i understand why he brought this evidence to me the voices on the tapes the names on the memosthe president his brother the secretary of state miguel angel barrera garcia abrego guero mendez adan barrera the literally scores of police army and intelligence officers pri officialsthere is no one in mexico who can or will act on this so cerro brings it to me wanting me to give it to whom he goes to light another cigarette but finds to his surprise that hes sick of smokinghis mouth tastes filthy he goes upstairs and brushes his teeth then takes an almost scalding shower and as he lets the water pound the back of his neck thinks that perhaps he should give this evidence to arthur keller hes maintained frequent correspondence with the american now unfortunately persona non grata in mexico and the man is still obsessed with bringing down the drug cartels but think it through he tells himself if you give this to arthur what will happen to it given the shocking revelation of operation cerberus and the cias complicity with the barreras in exchange for contra funding does arthur have the power to act on this or will it be suppressed by the current administration or any american administration as focused as they are on nafta nafta parada thinks with disgust the cliff we are marching toward in lockstep with the americans but there is hope presidential elections are coming up and the pris candidatewho will perforce winseems to be a good man luis donaldo colosio is a legitimate man of the left who will listen to reason parada has sat down with him and the man is sympathetic and if this stunning evidence that the dying cerro brought me can discredit the dinosaurs in the pri that might give colosio the leverage he needs to follow his true instincts should i give him the information no parada thinks colosio mustnt be seen to be going against his partythat would only rob him of the nomination so who parada wonders as he lathers his face and begins to shave has the autonomy the power the sheer moral force to bring to light the fact that the entire government of a country has auctioned itself to a cartel of drug merchants who the answer occurs to him suddenly its obvious he waits until a decent hour of the morning and then phones antonucci to tell him that he wants to relay important information to the pope the order of opus dei was founded in by a wealthy spanish lawyerturnedpriest named josemaria escriva who was concerned that the university of madrid had become a hotbed of leftwing radicalism he was so concerned that his new organization of catholic elite fought on the side of the fascists in the spanish civil war and spent the next thirty years helping to entrench general franco in power the idea was to recruit talented elite young lay conservatives who were headed into government the press and big business imbue them with traditional catholic valuesespecially anticommunismand send them out to do the churchs work in their chosen spheres salvatore scachispecial forces colonel cia asset knight of malta and made mafia wise guyis a triedandtrue member of opus dei he met all the requirementsattended mass daily made his confessions only to an opus dei priest and made regular retreats at opus dei facilities and hes been a good soldier hes fought the good fight against communism in vietnam cambodia and the golden triangle hes fought the war in mexico in central america through cerberus in south america through red mistall operations that the liberation theologist parada is now threatening to expose to the world now he sits in antonuccis office considering what to do about the information that cardinal juan parada wants to pass on to the vatican you say cerro went to see him scachi says to antonucci thats what parada told me cerro knows enough to bring down the entire government scachi says and then some we cant burden the holy father with this information antonucci says this pope has been a major supporter of opus dei even to the point of recently beatifying father escriva the first step toward canonization to force him to confront evidence of the orders involvement in some of the harsher actions against the communist world conspiracy would be at the very least embarrassing worse yet would be the scandal that would erupt against the present government just as negotiations are proceeding to return the church to full legal status in mexico no these revelations would scuttle the government and with it the negotiations and swing momentum toward the heretical liberation theologistsmany of them wellmeaning useful idiots who would help bring about communist rule its been the same story everywhere antonucci thinksstupid misled liberal priests help bring the communists to power then the reds slaughter the priests it was certainly true in spain which is why the blessed escriva founded the order in the first place as members of opus dei both antonucci and scachi are well versed in the concept of the greater good and for sal scachi the greater good of defeating communism outweighs the evil of corruption he also has something else on his mindthe nafta treaty still under debate in congress if paradas revelations were ever made public they would scuttle nafta and without nafta there will be no hope for the development of a mexican middle class which is the only longterm antidote for the poisonous spread of communism now antonucci says we have an opportunity here to do something great for the souls of the millions of faithfulto return the true church to the mexican people by earning the gratitude of the mexican government if we suppress this information just so but its not that simple scachi says parada apparently has certain knowledge which hell come forward with if he doesnt see antonucci gets up i must leave such worldly details to the lay brothers of the order i dont understand such things but scachi does adan lies in bed at rancho las bardas rauls large estanciacumfortress off the road between tijuana and tecate the ranchs main living compound composed of separate houses for adan and raul is surrounded by a tenfoot wall topped with razor wire and shards of broken glass bottles there are two gates each with massive steelreinforced doors spotlight towers are set in each corner manned by guards with aks m machine guns and chinese rocket launchers and to even reach the place you have to drive two long miles off the highway down a reddirt road but the chances are youre not even going to get on that road because the junction with the highway is guarded twentyfourseven by plainclothes baja state policemen so this is where the brothers came as soon as possible after the attack on the la sirena disco and now the place is on high alert guards patrol the walls night and day squads in jeeps patrol the surrounding countryside technicians electronically sweep the area for radio transmissions and cellphone calls and manuel sanchez sits outside adans bedroom window like a faithful dog were twins now adan thinks with our identical limps but mine is temporary and his is permanent and this is why i have kept the man employed all these years as a bodyguard since the bad old days of operation condor sanchez will not leave his postnot to eat not to sleep just props himself against the wall with his shotgun in his lap or occasionally gets up and limps back and forth along the wall i should have been there patron he told adan with tears streaming down his face i should have been with you your job is to protect my home and my family adan answered and you have never let me down nor is he likely to he wont leave adans window the cooks bring him plates of warm flour tortillas with refritas and peppers and bowls of hot albondigas and he sits outside the window eating but he will not leave don adan saved his life and his leg and don adan and his wife and daughter are inside that house and if gueros sicarios somehow get inside the compound they will have to come through manuel sanchez to get to them and no one is getting through manuel adans glad hes there if only to give lucia and gloria a feeling of security they were already put through an upsetting ordeal being woken in the middle of the night by the pasadors sicarios and hustled off to the countryside without even a chance to pack the upset had set off a major respiratory episode and a doctor had to be flown in blindfolded then driven out to the ranch to see the sick girl the expensive and delicate medical equipmentrespirators breathing tents humidifiersall had to be packed out of the house and moved in the middle of the night and even now weeks later gloria is still displaying symptoms and then when she had seen him limping in pain it was yet another shock and he had felt bad about lying to her telling her that he had been in a motorcycle accident and lying to her more telling her they were staying out in the country for a while because the air is better for her but shes not stupid adan knows she sees the towers the guns the guards and she will soon see through their explanation that the family is very wealthy and needs protection and then she will ask harder questions and get harder answers about what papa does for a living and will she understand adan wonders hes restless edgy tired of being a convalescent and be honest he tells himselfyou miss nora you miss her in your bed and at your table it would be good to talk with her about this whole situation hed managed to get a phone call off to her the day after the la sirena attack he knew that shed have seen it on tv or read about it in the papers and he wanted to tell her that he was all right that it would be a few weeks before he could see her again but more important that she should stay out of mexico until he tells her its safe shed responded just the way hed imagined she would just the way hed hoped she answered the phone on the first ring and he could feel her relief when she heard his voice then shed quickly started to joke with him telling him that if he let himself be lured by any siren other than her he got what he deserved call me shed said ill come running i wish i could he thinks as he painfully stretches his leg you dont know how much i wish i could hes tired of being in bed and sits up slowly swings his wounded leg out and gently eases himself to his feet he takes his cane and hobbles over to the window its a beautiful day the sun is bright and warm and the birds are warbling and its good to be alive and his leg is healing quickly and wellthere has been no infectionand soon he will be up and around which is a good thing because there is much to do and not a lot of time to do it the truth is that hes worried the attack on la sirena the fact that they used federale uniforms and identificationit must have cost hundreds of thousands in mordida and the fact that guero felt strong enough to violate the prohibition on violence in a resort town must mean that gueros business is healthier than they had thought but how adan wonders how is the man getting his product through la plaza which the barrera pasador has all but shut down to him and how has guero won the support of mexico city and its federales and has abrego aligned himself with guero would guero ever have launched the la sirena attack without the old mans approval and if that is the case abregos support would bring the presidents brother el bagman and the full weight of the federal government even in baja itself theres a civil war going on between the local copsthe barreras own the baja state police and guero owns the federales the tijuana city cops are more or less neutral but theres a new player in townthe special tactical group an elite group sort of like the untouchables run by none other than the incorruptible antonio ramos if he ever allies himself with the federales thank god theres an election coming up adan thinks adans people have made several discreet approaches to the pris handpicked candidate colosio only to be turned down flat but colosio at least gave assurances that he is antinarco across the boardwhen elected he will be coming after the barreras and mendez with equal vigor but in the meantime its us against the world adan thinks and this time the world wins callan dont like it one bit hes in the backseat of a stolen fireengine red suburbanthe vehicle of choice among the narcotraficante cowboyssitting beside raul barrera whos cruising around tijuana like hes the fucking mayor theyre rolling down boulevard diaz ordaz one of the busiest streets in the city he has a baja state police officer driving and another one in the front seat and hes tricked out in full sinaloa cowboy gear from the boots to the black pearlbutton shirt to the white cowboy hat this is no fucking way to fight a war callan thinks what these guys should be doing is what the old sicilians would dogo to the mattresses lay low pick your spots but this apparently aint the mexican way callan has learned no the mexican way is machogo out there and show the flag like raul wants to be seen so it aint no surprise to callan when two black suburbans filled with blackuniformed federales start to follow them down the boulevard which aint good news callan thinks uh raul i see them he tells the driver to take a right down a side street alongside a gigantic flea market gueros in the second black suburban he looks out and sees this yuppie fire engine take a right and in the backseat he thinks he sees raul barrera actually the first thing he sees is a clown a stupid laughing clowns face is painted on the wall of the enormous flea market which runs the length of two city blocks clowns got one of those big red noses and the white face and the wig and the whole clown nine yards and guero sort of blinks at it and then focuses on the guy in the backseat of the red suburban with california plates and it sure as hell looks like raul pull him over he tells his driver the lead black suburban pulls ahead and forces the red suburban to the curb gueros vehicle pulls up behind and wedges in the red suv oh fuck callan thinks as a comandante federale gets out of the lead car and comes toward them pointing his m two of his boys right behind him this aint no traffic ticket he slides a little lower in his seat gently pulls his from his hip and lays it under his left forearm we got it covered raul says callans not so sure because rifle barrels poke out of the windows of the two black suburbans like muskets out of wagons in one of them old westerns and callan figures if the cavalry dont ride in soon there aint gonna be much to bury here out on the old prairie fuckin mexico guero lowers the right back window rests his ak on the sill flicks the lever to bush rake and gets ready to hose raul the baja state cop driver rolls down his window and asks is there a problem yeah apparently there is because the comandante federale spots raul from the corner of his eye and starts to pull the trigger on his m callan shoots from his lap the two rounds smack the comandante in the forehead the m hits the pavement a moment before he does the two baja state cops in the front seat shoot right through their own windshield raul sits in the back zinging bullets past the ears of his two boys in the front and hes yelling and shooting because if this is the last arriba hes going out in style hes going out in a way that the narcocorridos will be singing about for years except he aint going out guero had spotted the bright red suburban but he didnt see the nondescript ford aerostar and the volkswagen jetta that were trailing it from a block behind and now those two stolen vehicles roar in and trap the federales fabian jumps out of the aerostar and rakes a federale across the chest with an ak burst the wounded federale tries to crawl for cover underneath the black suburban but one of his own boys sees how outgunned they are and makes a bid for survival by switching sides on the spot he raises his own m and as the man pleads for his life delivers the coup de grace through his partners upraised arms and into his face then looks to fabian for acceptance fabian puts two rounds into his head who needs a coward like that callan pulls raul down onto the seat and shouts we have to get you the fuck outta here callan opens the car door and rolls out onto the sidewalk he shoots from underneath the car at anything that has black pants on as raul climbs out over the top of them and then they start shooting their way out backing down the street toward the main boulevard its a major goat fuck callan thinks cops are roaring in from all compass points in cars on motorcycles and on foot federal cops state cops tijuana city cops and theyre not sure whos whoit is just a fucking freeforall everyones trying to figure out who to shoot at the same time theyre trying to work out how not to get shot fabians shooters at least know who theyre shooting at though as they methodically gun down the federales who pulled them over but those guys are tough theyre shooting back and there are bullets flying every which way and you have some moron across the street standing there with his sony mm trying to videotape the whole goddamn mess and through that grace given to idiots and drunks he lives through the whole tenminute gun battle but a lot of people dont three federales are dead and three others wounded two barrera sicariosincluding one baja state policemanhave checked out and two others are pretty badly shot up as are the seven bystanders who are down with gunshot wounds and in one of those surreal moments that seem to occur only in mexico you have the bishop of tijuana who just happened to be in the neighborhood going from body to body giving last rites to the dead and spiritual comfort to the living you got ambulances coming in and cop cars and television trucks you got everything except twenty midgets tumbling out of a little car the clown aint laughing anymore the smile has literally been blasted off his face his red nose is pockmarked with bullets and there are fresh holes drilled in the bottom inside corner of each pupil so hes looking down at the scene crosseyed gueros done a walkawayhe spent most of the firefight lying on the floor of his suburban and then he slid across to the opposite door and slunk away without anyone seeing him a lot of people see raul though he and callan are backing down the street shoulder to shoulder raul just blasting away with his ak callan firing precise twoshot groupings with his callan sees fabian jump in the aerostar and back it down the street even though the tires have been shot out hes driving it on its rimssparks are shooting outand he pulls up alongside callan and raul and yells get in okay with me callan thinks hes just in the fucking door when fabian hits the gas again and they are flying backwards down the street and then crashing into another fucking suburban that has blocked the intersection the car is filled with plainclothes detectives their ms leveled and ready callans relieved when raul drops his ak puts his hands up and smiles meanwhile ramos and his boys get there ready to kick ass except most of the ass either is already bleeding on the pavement or is long gone the whole street is buzzing like insects in ramos ear as he hears the rumor that the police have arrested one of the barreras it was adan no it was raul whichever the fuck barrera ramos thinks which cops arrested him and where did they take him it matters right because if it was the federales they probably took him to the dump to shoot him and if it was the baja state boys they probably took him to a safe house and if it was the city police ramos might still have a shot at bagging a barrera brother would be nice if it was adan a close second if its raul ramos is grabbing one eyewitness after another until a uniformed city officer comes up to him and tells him that city homicidesquad detectives collared one of the barreras and two other guys and drove off with them ramos races back to the precinct house cigar clamped in his mouth esposa at his hip he storms into the homicidesquad room just in time to see the back of rauls head disappearing out the back door ramos raises his gun to put a bullet in the back of that head but a homicide guy grabs the barrel take it easy the detective says who the fuck was that ramos asks who the fuck was who that guy who just gunned down a bunch of cops ramos says or dont you care about that apparently not because the homicide guys sort of bunch up in the doorway to let raul fabian and callan get away clean and if theyre ashamed of themselves ramos cant see it in their faces adan watches it on television the sinaloa swap meet is all over the news he hears reporters breathlessly report that hes been arrested or his brother has depending on which station he has on but all the channels are commenting that for a second time in a few weeks innocent citizens have been caught in the cross fire between rival drug gangs right in the heart of a major city and that something must be done to put an end to the violence between the rival baja cartels well something will soon adan thinks we were lucky to have survived the last two attacks but how long before our luck runs out the bottom line is were finished and when im dead guero will hunt down lucia and gloria and slaughter them unless i can findand stopthe source of gueros newfound power where is it coming from ramos and his troops are ripping up a warehouse near the border just on the mexican side the tip that led them there was a good one and theyre finding stacks of vacuumwrapped cocaine about a dozen of guero mendezs workers are tied up and ramos notices that theyre all sneaking glances at a forklift parked in one corner where are the keys he asks the warehouse manager top desk drawer ramos gets the keys hops onto the forklift and backs it up he can hardly believe what he sees the mouth of a tunnel are you shitting me ramos asks aloud he hops off the forklift grabs the manager and lifts him off his feet are there men down there he asks booby traps no if there are ill come back and kill you i swear are there lights down there si turn them on five minutes later ramos has esposa in one hand as he uses the other to climb down the ladder bolted to the side of the tunnels entrance sixtyfive feet deep the shaft is about six feet high and four feet wide with reinforced concrete floors and walls fluorescent light fixtures are attached to the ceiling an airconditioning system pumps fresh air down the length of the tunnel a narrow gauge track has been laid on the floor and carts have been set on the rails christ ramos thinks at least theres no locomotive yet he starts walking along the shaft north toward the united states then it occurs to him that he should probably contact someone on the other side before he crosses the border even underground he goes back to the surface and makes a few phone calls two hours later hes going down the ladder again with art keller right behind him and behind them a troop of the special tactical group and a flock of dea agents on the american side an army of dea ins atf fbi and customs agents are poised in the area across from the tunnel waiting to rush the exact location as soon as the tunnel party radios in unfuckingreal shag wallace says when they get down to the bottom someone dumped a lot of money into this someone ran a lot of money through it art answers he turns to ramos we know this was mendez not the barreras its gueros ramos says what someone show him a video of the great escape shag asks let me know when we cross the border ramos says to art id just be guessing art answers christ how far does this thing go fourteen hundred feet give or take is how they pace it out before they get to the next vertical shaft an iron ladder bolted to the concrete walls leads up to a bolted hatch art punches in on a gps system the troops will be rolling he looks up at the hatch so art says who wants to be the first to go through that were in your jurisdiction ramos answers art goes up the ladder with shag at his feet and they each balance with one hand on the rail as they twist open the hatch with the other it must take quite an operation art thinks to hoist the dope up from the tunnel shaft probably a chain of men stationed on various rungs of the ladder he wonders if they were planning to construct an elevator the hatch opens and light pours down the shaft art firms his grip on his pistol and hauls himself up chaos men are running around like cockroaches when the lights come on and the bluejacketed taskforce guys are sweeping them up putting them on the floor and securing their wrists behind their backs with plastic telephonecord ties its a cannery art notices there are three neat organized conveyor belts stacks of empty cans sealing machines labeling machines art reads one of the labels caliente chili peppers and indeed there are huge piles of red chili peppers ready to be fed onto the conveyor belts but there are also bricks of cocaine and art thinks the coke is meant to be handcanned russ dantzler comes up to him guero mendezthe willy wonka of nose candy who owns this building art asks you ready for this the fuentes brothers no kidding i shit you not three brothers foods art thinks well well wellthe fuentes family is a prominent fixture in the mexicanamerican community important businesspeople in southern california and major contributors to the democratic party the fuentes trucks go from the canneries and warehouses in san diego and los angeles to cities all over the country a readymade distribution system for guero mendezs cocaine genius isnt it dantzler says they bring the coke in through the tunnel can it as caliente chili peppers and ship it anywhere they want i wonder if they ever screw upi mean i wonder if someone in detroit ever goes to buy himself a can of peppers and ends up with twelve ounces of blow instead in which case give me a bowl of that chili you know what i mean so what do you want to do about the fuentes brothers bust them art says which is going to be interesting he thinks not only are the fuenteses major supporters of the democratic party theyre also big contributors to the presidential campaign of luis donaldo colosio it takes about thirtyseven seconds for the news to reach adan now we know how mendez has been getting his cocaine through la plaza adan thinks hes been going under it and now we also know the source of his power in mexico city hes bought the heir apparent colosio so thats that guero has bought himself los pinos and we are finished then the phone rings sal scachi wants to offer some help when he says what his offer entails adan instantly says no firmly unalterably absolutely the answer is no its unthinkable unless adan tells him what he wants in return the quid pro quo it takes days of covert negotiations but scachi finally agrees but adan has to act quickly thats fine adan thinks but well need people to do it kids thats what callan is looking atkids hes sitting in the basement of a house in guadalajara the place is a freaking armory theres hardware all over the place and not just the usual ars and aks either this is the heavy stuff machine guns grenade launchers kevlar body armor callan sits on a metal folding chair looking at a bunch of teenage chicano gangbangers from san diego as they watch raul barrera pin a photograph to a bulletin board memorize this face raul tells them its guero mendez the teenagers are rapt especially as raul slowly and dramatically takes bundles of cash out of a canvas bag and sets them on the table fifty thousand dollars american raul says in cash and its going to go to the first one of you who he pauses dramatically puts the kill shot into guero mendez theyre going on a guero hunt raul announces theyre going to form convoys of armored vehicles until they find mendez and then use their combined firepower to blow him to hell where he belongs any questions raul asks yeah a few callan thinks starting with how the hell you think youre going to take on gueros professional hitters with the kiddie corps here i mean is this what we got left this is the best that the barrera pasador with all its money and power can come up with a bunch of san dog gangbangers theyre a goddamn joke with tags like flaco dreamer poptop andhonest to christscooby doo fabian recruited them from the barrio says theyre stone killers claims theyve all made their bones yeah maybe callan thinks maybe they have but its a big jump from doing a driveby on some other banger smoking boo on his front porch to taking on a crew of professional killers a bunch of kids on a bigtime hit theyll be too busy pissing their pants and shooting each otherand hopefully not mewhen they panic and start blasting anything that flashes by their peripheral vision no callan still dont get itwhat the fuck raul is thinking about with the childrens crusade here all its going to be is one gigantic mess and callan is only hoping that a through the chaos he can find mendez and take him off the count and b he can do it before one of the kids guns him down by mistake then he remembers that he was just seventeen when he took out eddie friel back in the kitchen yeah but that was different you was different these kids just dont look like killers to me so thats a question he wants to ask raul are you drunk are you out of your fucking mind he doesnt ask that though he just settles for a more practical question how do we know callan asks that mendez is even in guadalajara because parada asked him to come because adan asked parada to ask him i want to stop the violence he tells his old priest thats easy parada answers stop it it isnt that easy adan argues thats why im asking for your help my help to do what make peace with guero adan knows that hes rung the bellhit the chord that no priest can resist certainly it presents parada with a difficult choice hes no starryeyed foolhe realizes that if against the odds he did succeed in brokering peace between the barreras and mendez he would also be fostering a more efficient environment in which to operate the drug cartels so in that sense he would be helping to perpetuate an evil which as a priest he has sworn not to do on the other hand he has also sworn to take every opportunity he can to mitigate evil and peace between the two warring cartels would prevent god only knows how many killings and if forced to choose between the evils of drug trafficking and murder he has to judge murder the heavier evil so he asks you want to sit down and talk with guero yes adan says but where guero wouldnt come to tijuana and i wont go to culiacan would you come to guadalajara parada asks if you guarantee my safety but would you guarantee gueros yes adan says but he wouldnt accept that guarantee any more than i would accept his thats not what im asking parada says impatiently im asking if you will promise not to attempt to harm guero in any way i swear on my soul your soul adan is blacker than hell one thing at a time father parada hears this if you can get a single shaft of light into the darkness sometimes it is a wedge that will spread until it illuminates the entire void if i didnt believe this he thinks as he contemplates the soul of this multiple murderer i couldnt get up in the morning so if this man is asking for this one shaft of light i can hardly refuse i will try adan he says it wont be easy he thinks as he hangs up if even half of what ive heard about the war between these men is true it will be virtually impossible to persuade guero to come and talk to adan barrera about peace then again perhaps he is also sick of killing and death it takes him three whole days just to get through to mendez parada contacts old friends in culiacan and puts out the word that he wants to talk with guero three days later guero calls parada doesnt waste time with preliminaries adan barrera wants to talk peace im not interested in peace you should be he killed my wife and children all the more reason guero doesnt quite see the logic of this but what he does see is an opportunity as parada presses on about a meeting in guadalajara in a public place with himself as a mediator and the entire moral weight of the church guaranteeing his safety mendez sees a chance to finally lure the barreras out of their baja fortress after all his best chance to kill them failed and now he is getting his ass kicked in san diego so he listens and as he listens to the priest rattle on about how his wife and children would have wanted it this way he works up a few crocodile tears and then in a choking voice agrees to come to the meeting i will try father he says quietly i will take a chance for peace can we pray together father can we pray over the phone and as parada asks jesus to help them find the light of peace guero is praying to santo jesus malverde for something different not to fuck it up this time they are going to royally fuck it up is what callan thinks watching this looney toon spectacular that raul is staging in the city of guadalajara its fucking ridiculous making a big show of riding around town in this convoy hoping to spot guero so they can line up like battleships off an island and blast him callans done bigtime hits this is a man who personally took out the heads of two of the five families and he tries to tell raul how it should be done you find out where hes going to be at a specific time then you get there first and set it up but raul wont listenhes bullheaded its almost like he wants this to be a fiasco he just smiles and tells callan chill out man and be ready when the shooting starts for a whole week the barrera forces cruise the city night and day searching for guero mendez and while theyre looking other men are listening raul has technicians stationed in another safe house using the most current hightech equipment to scan cellular calls trying to intercept messages that might be going back and forth between guero and his lieutenants gueros doing the same thing he has his own technogeeks in his own safe house monitoring the cellular traffic trying to get a fix on the barreras both sides are playing this game switching cell phones constantly moving safe houses patrolling the streets and the airwaves trying to find and kill each other with some kind of advantage before parada sets up the peace meeting which can only be a risky shootout and both sides are trying to get an edge on that trying to glean any intelligence that could give them an advantagewhat kind of car is the enemy driving how many men do they have in town who are they what kind of weapons are they carrying where are they staying and what route will they take and they have their spies out working trying to find out which cops are on which payroll when theyre on duty will there be federales around and if so where both sides are listening in on paradas office phones trying to get a fix on his schedule his plans anything that might provide a hint as to where he intends to hold the meeting and give them a head start on setting up an ambush but the cardinal is holding his cards close to his chest for that very reason and neither mendez nor the barreras can find out when or where the meeting is going to be one of rauls technogeeks does draw a bead on guero hes using a green buick the geek tells raul guero drives a buick raul asks with some disdain how do you know one of his drivers phoned a garage the geek explained wanted to know when the buick was going to be ready its a green buick what garage raul asks but by the time they get there the buicks been picked up so the search goes on night and day adan gets the call from parada tomorrow at twothirty at the hidalgo airport hotel parada tells him meet in the lobby adan already knew this having intercepted a call from the cardinals driver to his wife discussing the next days schedule and it just confirms what adan also already knewthat cardinal antonucci is flying in from mexico city at and parada is picking him up at the airport then theyll go to a private conference room upstairs for a meeting after which paradas driver will take antonucci back to the airport for his flight and parada will stay at the hotel for his peace summit with mendez and adan adan has known this all along but there was no point sharing any of it with raul until the last possible moment adan is staying in a different safe house than the rest of them and now he goes down into the basement where the real assassination squad is barracked these sicarios were flown in on separate flights over the course of the last few days quietly picked up at the airport and then sequestered in this basement meals have been brought in a few at a time from different restaurants or cooked in the kitchen upstairs and then brought down no one has gone cruising or nightclubbing its strictly professional a dozen jalisco state police uniforms are neatly folded on tables flak jackets and ars are neatly racked ive just confirmed everything adan tells fabian are your men ready yeah this has to go right it will adan nods and hands him a cell phone that he knows has been compromised fabian dials a number and then says its on be in place by onefortyfive then he hangs up guero gets the word ten minutes later hes already gotten the call from parada and now he knows that adan intends to ambush him as he drives into the airport i think well show up for the meeting a little early guero tells his head sicario and ambush the ambush he thinks raul gets the call from adan on a secure phone then goes down into the dormitory and wakes up the sleeping gangbangers its off he announces were going home tomorrow the kids are pissed disappointed their dreams of a cool k having just gone down the shitter they ask raul what happened i dont know raul says i guess he got word we were on his trail and ran back to culiacan dont worrytherell be other chances raul tries to make them feel better tell you what well leave early for our flightyou can go to the mall its a small consolation but its something the mall in downtown guadalajara is one of the largest in the world with the resilience of youth the boys start to talk about what theyll shop for at the mall raul takes fabian upstairs you know what to do raul asks him sure and youre good to do it im good he says raul finds callan in an upstairs bedroom were going back to tj tomorrow raul says callans relieved this whole thing has been so fuckedup raul gives him his airline ticket and the days schedule then tells him gueros going to try to hit us at the airport what do you mean he thinks were going there to make peace with him raul says he thinks were just protected by a bunch of kids hes going to gun us down he thinks right raul smiles and shakes his head we got you and we got a whole crew of sicarios wholl be dressed as jalisco state police well callan thinks at least that answers my question about why the barreras were using a crew of kids the kids are bait and so are you raul tells callan to keep his hand on his gun and his eyes open i always do callan thinks most of the dead guys he knows got that way because they didnt have their eyes open they got careless or they trusted somebody callan dont get careless and he dont trust nobody parada puts his faith in god gets up earlier than usual goes into the cathedral and says mass then he kneels at the altar and asks god to give him the strength and wisdom to do what he has to do this day prays that hes doing the right thing then ends with thy will be done he goes back to his residence and shaves again then chooses his clothes with more than particular care what he wears will send an instant message to antonucci and parada wants to send the right message in a strange way he harbors hope for reconciliation between himself and the church and why not if adan and guero can come together so can antonucci and parada and he is for the first time in a long time truly hopeful if this administration goes out and a better one comes in in this new environment perhaps the conservatives and liberation theologists can find a common ground work together again to seek justice on earth and the bliss of heaven he goes to light a cigarette then snuffs it out i should quit smoking he thinks if only to make nora happy and this is a good day to start a day of new beginnings he chooses a black soutane and drapes a large cross around his neck just religious enough he thinks to mollify antonucci but not so ceremonial that the nuncio will think hes gone completely conservative conciliatory but not obsequious he thinks pleased with his choice god would i like a cigarette he thinks hes nervous about his tasks todaydelivering cerros incriminating information to antonucci and then sitting down with adan and guero what can i say he thinks to effect a peace between the two of them how do you make peace between a man whose family has been killed and the man whoas rumor has it anywaykilled them well put your faith in god he will give you the words but it would still be comforting to smoke but im not going to and im going to drop a few pounds hes going to santa fe for a bishops conference in a month and plans to see nora there and it will be great fun he thinks to surprise her with a svelte smokefree me all right not svelte maybe but thinner he goes down to his office and occupies his mind with paperwork for a few hours then calls his driver and asks him to get the car ready then he goes to his safe and takes out the briefcase filled with cerros incriminating notes and tapes its time to go to the airport in tijuana father rivera prepares for a christening he puts on his robes blesses the holy water and carefully fills out the necessary paperwork on the bottom of the form he lists as godparents adan and lucia barrera when the new parents come with their blessed child rivera does something unusual he closes the doors of the church the barrera crew arrives at the guadalajara airport fresh from the mall theyre loaded down with shopping bags having basically tried to buy the freaking place raul had tossed the kids some bonus money to soothe their disappointment over the cancellation of the guero lottery and theyd done what kids do in a mall with cash in their pockets theyd spent it callans watching all this with disbelief flaco bought a chivas rayadas del guadalajara futbol jerseywhich hes wearing with the sales label still attached to the back collartwo pairs of nikes a new nintendo gameboy and half a dozen new games for it dreamer went strictly the clothes route got himself three new lids all of which he has jammed on his head at the same time a suede jacket and a new suithis first one evercarefully folded in a wardrobe bag scooby doo is glassyeyed from the video arcade hell callan thinks the little gluesniffer is usually glassyeyed anyway but now his pupils are glazed over from two solid hours of playing tomb raider and mortal kombat and assassin and now hes sipping the same giant slurpee hes been hitting on the whole ride over from the mall poptop is drunk while the others were shopping poptop went into a restaurant and hammered beers and by the time they caught up with him it was too late and it took flaco and dreamer and scooby to wrestle him back in the van to go to the airport and they had to stop three times on the way so poptop could throw up and now the little shit cant find his airline ticket so him and his buddies are digging through his backpack looking for it great callan thinks if were trying to convince guero mendez that were sitting ducks were doing a damn fine job of it what you got out there is a bunch of kids with stacks of luggage and shopping bags on the sidewalk outside the terminal and raul is trying to establish some kind of order and adan has just pulled up with a few of his people and it looks like nothing more than a high school field trip headed home on that last chaotic day and the boys are laughing and hollering at each other and raul is trying to figure out with the attendant at the outside counter whether they should check the bags at the curb or bring them inside and dreamer goes to find a couple of luggage carts and tells flaco to come with him to help and flacos yelling at poptop how could you lose your fucking ticket pendejo and poptop looks like hes going to puke again but what comes out of his mouth isnt puke its blood and then he crumples onto the curb callans already flat on the sidewalk tracking a green buick with gun barrels sticking out the side windows he pulls out his and fires two shots at the buick then he rolls behind another parked car just as a burst from an ak blasts the sidewalk in front of where he just was sending bullets bouncing off the concrete and into the terminal wall stupid fucking scooby doo is standing there sucking on his slurpee straw watching like its some video game with really radical graphics hes trying to remember if they ever left the mall and exactly which game this is but it must have cost a ton of tokens because its so lifelike callan dashes out from behind the relative safety of the van grabs scooby and throws him to the concrete and the slurpee spills all over the pavement and its a raspberry slurpee so its hard to tell it from poptops blood which is also spreading across the concrete raul fabian and adan drop black equipment bags to the ground and pull aks out of them then lift the rifles to their shoulders and start shooting at the buick the bullets bounce off the careven the windshieldso callan figures that the car is armored but he squeezes off two shots then drops down and can just see the opposite doors of the buick opening and guero and two other guys with rifles getting out and then they lean against the car and rest their aks on top and let loose callan goes into that zone where he cant hear anythingit is just perfect silence in his head as he sees guero takes careful aim at his head and is about to squeeze him out of the worldwhen a white car pulls right into the line of fire the driver seems oblivious to whats going on like hes happened upon some onlocation movie and is pissed off and determined to get to the airport anyway so the car pulls past the buick and over to the curb about twenty feet in front of it which really seems to get fabian going he spots the white marquis and makes for it running sideways past the buick blasting at it as he does and callan figures that fabian has the white car lamped for a new carload of gueros sicarios and fabian is fighting his way toward it so callan tries to lay down some cover fire but the white car is in the line of fire and he doesnt want to shoot just in case these are civilians and not more of gueros boys but now there are bullets hitting the buick from the other side and out of the corner of his eye callan can make out some of the fake jalisco cops training fire onto the car which forces guero and his hitters to squat down behind it so fabian survives his charge toward the white marquis parada doesnt even see him coming hes too focused on the scene of bloodshed playing out in front of him bodies are splayed all over the sidewalk some lying motionless others crawling on their stomachs dragging their legs behind them and parada cant tell if theyre wounded or dead or just trying to take cover from the bullets that are flying everywhere then he looks out the window and sees a young man lying on his back with bubbles of blood gurgling out of his mouth and his eyes open in pain and terror and parada knows this young man is dying so he starts to get out of the car to give him the last rites pablo his driver tries to grab him and hold him back but hes a small man and parada easily shrugs him off and yells get out of here but pablo wont leave him there so he huddles as far as he can under the steering wheel and puts his hands over his ears as parada opens the door and gets out just as fabian gets there and points his gun into the priests chest callan sees him you dumb fuck he thinks thats the wrong guy he watches as parada squeezes his large body out of the car straightens up and starts toward poptop and he watches as fabian steps in the way and raises his ak callan stands straight up and yells no leaps over the hood of the car and races toward fabian yelling fabian no thats not him fabian glances over at callan and as he does parada grabs the rifle and manages to turn the barrel down toward the ground and now fabian tries to lift it again and squeezes the trigger and the first shot hits parada in the ankle and the next one in the knee but the adrenaline is coursing through parada and he doesnt even feel it never mind let go of the gun because he wants to live feels it now more strongly more urgently than ever in his life feels that life is good the air is sweet and there is so much he still has to do wants to do wants to get to that dying young man and soothe his soul before he goes wants to listen to more jazz wants to see nora smile wants another cigarette another good meal wants to kneel in sweet soft prayer to his lord but not walk with him not yet too much to do so he fights holds on to the gun barrel with his whole life fabian lowers his head and lifts his foot and plants it right on the crucifix on paradas chest and kicks sending the priest sprawling back against the car and then fabian lifts the guns barrel again and sends fifteen bullets smashing into paradas chest parada feels his life draining out of him as his body slides down the side of the car callan kneels down by the dying priest the man looks up at him and mumbles something callan cant make out what callan asks what did you say i forgive you parada murmurs what god forgives you the priest starts to make the sign of the cross then his hand drops and his body jerks and hes gone callan kneels there looking down at the dead priest as fabian raises his rifle aims and deliberately puts two more shots into the side of paradas head blood sprays onto the white paint of the car and hunks of paradas white hair callan turns around and says he was already dead fabian ignores him reaches into the front seat of the car pulls out a briefcase and walks away with it callan sits down and cradles paradas shattered head in his arms and crying like a baby asks over and over again what did you say what did you say hes oblivious to the battle going on around him doesnt care adan does he doesnt see parada get killed hes a little busy completing the execution of guero mendez whos ducked behind the buick just realizing that he has fucked up two of his guys are already down and the car even though its armored is vibrating with the number of bullets hitting it and isnt going to hold up much longer a lot of the glass has finally shattered and the tires are shot out and its only a matter of time before the gas tank explodes hes badly outnumbered by the barrera hit squad disguised as jalisco cops and this whole kiddie brigade bullshit was just thatbullshit and now theyve got him on three sides and if they can make it around to the fourthbehind the buickits over hes dead and while hed be perfectly happy to go if he could take adan and raul with him its pretty clear now that isnt going to happen so the thing is to boogie the fuck out of there and try again another time but getting out isnt going to be easy he decides he has about one chance and he takes it he reaches into the backseat of the car and pulls out a teargas grenade and lofts it over the buick toward the barreras then yells to his surviving four men to make a break for it and they do running parallel to the terminal shooting as they go adans hit squad has a lot of hardware but gas masks they dont have and they start retching and coughing and adan feels like his eyes are on fire and struggles to stay on his feet then decides that because he cant see and there are bullets zipping around maybe that isnt such a good idea so he lets himself drop to his knees raul doesnt eyes on fire nose burning he charges toward the fleeing mendez group shooting from the hip one of bursts takes mendezs chief sicario in the spine and drops him but raul watches in frustration as mendez makes it to a parked taxi throws the driver out on the pavement and gets behind the wheel waiting just long enough for his three surviving tiros to jump in before he peels out raul fires at the car but cant hit the wheels and guero speeds out of the parking lot ducking low his head just high enough to see as the jalisco cops who werent hit by the tear gas fire away at the rapidly disappearing taxi son of a fucking bitch raul yells he turns to his right and sees callan sitting there holding paradas body in his arms raul thinks that callan has been hit the man is crying and theres blood all over him and whatever else raul is hes not ungrateful he remembers his debts so he squats down to pick callan up come on raul yells we have to get you out of here callan doesnt answer raul smacks him on the back of the head with his gun butt hauls him to his feet and pulls him toward the terminal yelling as he does come on everyone we have a plane to catch out on the tarmac aeromexico flight to tijuana is already fifteen minutes late taking off but the flight waits the jalisco cops peel off their uniforms to reveal civilian clothing underneath toss their guns on the sidewalk and calmly walk toward the departure gate then the barreras and the surviving gangbangers and the professional hit squad enter the terminal they have to step over bodies to get therenot only poptops and mendezs two shooters but also six bystanders hit in the cross fire the terminal is bedlam people crying and screaming medical personnel trying to sort out the wounded and cardinal antonucci standing in the middle of all this shouting calm down calm down whats happened will someone tell me whats happened hes afraid to go out and see for himself he has a sick sinking feeling in his stomach and it isnt fair that he is in this position all scachi had asked him to do was to meet with parada that was all and now there is this scene and he feels a shamed relief when a young man strolls by him and answers his question we gassed guero mendez dreamer tells him el tiburon gassed mendez the barrera group walks calmly down the passageway toward their flight and lines up to hand the gate attendant their tickets just like they would for any normal old flight the attendant takes the tickets and hands them back their boarding passes and then they walk up the gangway and get on the plane adan barrera is still carrying his equipment bag with the ak in it but its just like any carryon especially as hes in first class the only problem is when raul gets to the gate with the unconscious callan draped over his shoulder the attendants voice shakes as she says he cant get on like that he has a ticket raul says but first class raul says he hands her their tickets and walks right past her up the gangway finds callans assigned seat and dumps him in it then covers up his bloodsoaked shirt with a blanket and says to the shocked flight attendant too much partying adan sits down next to fabian who looks at the pilot and asks what are you waiting for the pilot closes the cabin door behind him when the plane lands theyre immediately met by airport police and escorted through a back entrance into waiting cars and raul issues one order scatter callan dont need to be told that he gets dropped off at his house where he stays long enough to shower change out of his bloody clothes pick up his money and go takes a taxi to the border crossing at san ysidro and walks over the bridge back into the united states just another drunk gringo coming back from a bender on avenida revolucion hes been gone nine years now hes back in the country where as sean callan hes wanted for conspiracy to distribute narcotics racketeering extortion and murder he doesnt care hed rather take his chances here than spend another minute in mexico so he walks over the border and gets on the bright red trolley and rides it all the way into downtown san diego it takes him about an hour and a half to find a gun shop on the corner of fourth and j and buy a in the back room without showing any papers then he finds a liquor store and buys a bottle of scotch then walks over to an sro hotel and takes a room for a week locks himself in his room and starts drinking i forgive you is what the priest had said god forgives you noras in her bedroom when she hears the news shes reading with cnn on for background noise when her ear catches the words when we come back the tragic death of mexicos highestranking cleric her heart stops and theres a pounding in her head and she hits the speed dial for juans number as she sits through the endless commercialshoping praying that hell answer the phone that its not him that hell pick up the phoneplease god dont let it be himbut when the news comes back on theres an old posed photo of him on one half of the screen and the scene from the airport on the other and she sees him lying on the pavement and she doesnt scream her mouth opens but no sound comes out on a normal day the cross of squares in guadalajara is filled with tourists lovers and locals out for a midday stroll on a normal day the walls of the cathedral are lined with stands where hawkers sell crosses rosary cards plaster models of saints and milagros tiny clay sculptures of knees elbows and other body parts that people who feel theyve been cured by prayer leave in the cathedral as a memorial but this isnt a normal day today is the funeral mass for cardinal parada and now the twin yellowtiled steeples of the cathedral loom over a plaza crowded with thousands of mourners lined up in a serpentine formation standing for hours to walk past the coffin of the martyred cardinal to pay their respects theyve come from all over mexico many are the sophisticated tapatios in expensive suits and stylish if subdued dresses others have come from the countryside campesinos in freshly cleaned white shirts and frocks others have made the trip from culiacan and badiraguato and these men wear cowboy garb and many of them were christened by parada received their first communion from him were married by him watched their parents be buried by him when he was still just a rural priest then there are the government bureaucrats in gray and black suits and priests and bishops in their clerical uniforms and hundreds of nuns in the varied habits of their particular orders on a normal day the plaza is alive with soundthe rapidfire chatter of mexican conversation the shouts of hawkers the music from busking mariachi groupsbut today the plaza is strangely silent all that can be heard are the murmurs of prayers and darker mutterings about conspiracies because few in the crowd believe what is now the governments explanation of paradas death that he was a victim of mistaken identity that the barreras sicarios mistook parada for guero mendez but the talk of conspiracy is subdued today is a day of mourning and the thousands who wait patiently in the serpentine line and then move into the cathedral do so mostly in silence or in quiet prayer art keller is one of them the more he learns about father juans death the more troubled he is about it parada was riding in a white marquis mendez in a green buick parada was wearing a black sourtane with a prominent pectoral cross now missing mendez was garbed in full sinaloa cowboy chic how could anyone mistake a sixtytwoyearold whitehaired man wearing a soutane and a crucifix for a blond guy wearing narcocowboy gear at pointblank range how could an experienced killer like fabian martinez do that why was an airplane waiting how could adan and raul and all their hitters get on board how could they get off in tijuana and get escorted right out of the airport and why even though dozens of witnesses described a man identical to adan barrera at the airport and on the plane did a father rivera in tijuanathe barreras family priestcome forward to announce that adan barrera was the godfather at a christening performed at the exact time that parada was gunned down the priest even displayed the baptismal records with adans name and signature and who was the mysterious yanqui a dozen witnesses saw cradling paradas body who was carried on the plane with the barreras and has since dropped out of sight art says a quick prayerthere are people in line behind himand finds a seat in the crowded cathedral the funeral mass is long and moving person after person stands up to speak about what father juan had done in their lives and the sound of weeping fills the large space the atmosphere is quiet mournful respectful subdued until the president gets up to speak he had to be there of course the president and the entire cabinet and a score of other government officials and as he gets up and walks to the pulpit an expectant silence falls over the crowd and el presidente clears his throat and begins a criminal act has taken the life of a good clean and generous man and thats as far as he gets because someone in the crowd shouts justicia justice and then someone else picks it up and then another and within seconds thousands of people in the cathedral and then thousands more outside start to chant justicia justicia justicia and el presidente steps back from the microphone with an understanding smile as he waits for the chant to stop but it doesnt stop justicia justicia justicia it just gets louder justicia justicia justicia and the secret police start to get nervous whispering to each other in their little microphones and earpieces but its hard to hear over the chant of justicia justicia justicia which builds and builds until two of the police nervously hustle el presidente away from the microphone and out a side door of the cathedral and into his armored limousine but the shouts follow him as his car pulls out of the plaza justicia justicia justicia most of the government men are gone by the time parada is interred in the cathedral art hadnt joined in the chanting but sat there in amazement as the people in that church declared that theyd had enough of the corruption and faced the powerful leader of their country and demanded justice and he thought well youll get it if i have anything to do with it now he gets up to stand in line to file past the casket he carefully maneuvers his place in line nora haydens blond hair is covered with a black shawl her body draped in a black dress even with all that shes still beautiful he kneels beside her puts his hands up in prayer and whispers pray for his soul and sleep with his killer she doesnt answer how can you live with yourself art says then gets up he walks away from her soft crying by morning the national commander of the entire mjfp general rodolfo leon is flying to tijuana with fifty specially selected elite agents and by afternoon theyve broken into heavily armed combatready squads of six officers each sweeping the streets of colonia chapultepec in armored suburbans and dodge rams by evening theyve smashed into six barrera safe houses including rauls personal residence on caco sur where they find a cache of aks pistols fragmentation grenades and two thousand rounds of ammunition in the enormous garage they find six armorplated black suburbans by the end of the week theyve arrested twentyfive barrera associates seized over eighty houses warehouses and ranches belonging to either the barreras or guero mendez and arrested ten of the airport security police who escorted the barreras off flight in guadalajara a squad of real jalisco state police stumbles on a pickup truck full of fake jalisco police and a chase through the city ends with two of the fake cops being trapped inside a house and shooting it out with over a hundred jalisco cops all night and into the morning when one is killed and the other surrenders but not before theyve killed two of the real police and wounded the commander of the state police force the following morning el presidente goes in front of the cameras to declare his determination to crush the drug cartels once and for all and to announce that theyve just exposed and fired and will criminally charge over seventy corrupt mjfp officers and he offers a million reward for information leading to the capture of adan and raul barrera and guero mendez all of whom are still on the loose whereabouts unknown because even with the army the federales and every state police force scouring the country they cant find guero raul or adan because they arent there gueros across the border in guatemala and the barreras have also crossed the border into the united states theyre living in la jolla fabian finds flaco and dreamer living under the laurel street bridge in balboa park the cops couldnt find them but fabian hit the barrio and people told him stuff they werent going to tell the cops they tell him because they know if they stone the cops the cops might harass them and shit but if they stone fabian hell fucking kill their asses and that is the cold truth so flaco and dreamer are dozing one night under the bridge when flaco feels a shoe dig into his ribs and he jumps thinking its a cop or a fag but its fabian so he looks up at fabian with big eyes because hes halfafraid the tiro is going to put a bullet into him but fabian smiles and says hermanitos its time to show you have heart and he thumps his chest with the inside of his fist what you want us to do flaco asks adan is reaching out to you fabian answers he wants you to go back to mexico he explains how the barreras are taking all the heat from the death of that priest how the federales are putting pressure on them busting their safe houses arresting people and how its not going to settle down until they get someone who was involved in the shooting you go down and get yourselves arrested fabian says and you tell them the truthwe were going after guero mendez he ambushed us instead and fabian mistook parada for guero and shot him by accident nobody ever meant for parada to get hurt one of those things i dont know man dreamer says look fabian answers youre kids and you didnt do the shooting youll only get a few years and while youre in your families will be taken care of like royalty and when you get out youve had the appreciation and respect of adan barrera in the bank earning interest for you flaco your mother is a maid in a motel right yeah not anymore she isnt fabian says if you show heart i dont know dreamer says mexican cops tell you what fabian says that reward for guero that fifty thousand you two split it tell us who to bring it to and its done both boys say they want the money to go to their mothers as they get near the border flacos legs are shaking so hard hes afraid that fabian can see them his knees are literally knocking together and he cant seem to stop them and his eyes are filled with tears and he cant stop the tears from spilling over hes ashamed even though he can hear dreamer sniffling in the backseat when they get near the crossing fabian pulls over to let them out you got heart he tells them youre warriors they make it through immigration and customs with no problem and start walking south into the city they get about two blocks when searchlights hit them in the face blinding them and the federales are yelling and telling them to get their hands up and flaco throws his hands up high then a cop grabs him throws him to the ground and cuffs his hands tight behind his back so flacos lying there in the dirt his back arched painfully because his arms are pulled back so hard but then that pain dont seem like nothing because the federale spits on his face then kicks him hard right in the ear with the toe of his combat boot and flaco feels like his eardrum has just exploded pain goes off like fireworks inside flacos head then from a long way away he hears a voice tell him its just the beginning mi hijo were just getting started noras phone rings and she picks it up its adan i want to see you go to hell it was an accident he says a mistake give me a chance to explain it to you please she wants to hang up detests herself for not hanging up but she doesnt hang up instead she agrees to meet him that night on the beach at la jolla shores by lifeguard tower under the dim light of the tower he sees her coming she looks like shes alone you know i put my life in your hands he says if you called the police he was your priest she says your friend my friend how could you he shakes his head i wasnt even there i was at a christening in tijuana it was an accident a cross fire thats not what the police are saying mendez owns the police i hate you adan dont say that please he looks so sad she thinks lonely desperate she wants to believe him swear she says swear to me youre telling the truth i swear it on your daughters life he cant bear losing her he nods i swear she reaches her arms out and he holds her god adan im so miserable i know i loved him i know adan says so did i and the sad thing is he thinks thats the truth they must be at a dump because flaco smells garbage and it must be morning because he can feel faint sunlight on his face even through the black hood one of his eardrums is ruptured but he can hear dreamer pleading please please no no please a gunshot explodes and flaco dont hear dreamer no more then flaco feels a gun barrel brush the side of his head by his good ear it makes little circles like its holder wants to make sure flaco knows what it is then he hears the hammer click back flaco screams a dry click flaco loses it his bladder lets go and he feels the hot urine run down his leg and his knees give out and he crumbles to the ground squirming and twisting like a worm trying to get away from the gun barrel at his head and then he hears the hammer go back and another dry click and then a voice says maybe the next one little pendejo eh click flaco messes his pants the federales whoop and holler god what a stink what you been eating mierdita flaco hears the hammer click back again the gun roars the bullet plows into the dirt by his ear pick him up the voice says but the federales balk at touching the filthy kid they finally hit on a solutionthey take the hood off dreamer and the gag out of his mouth and make him pull off flacos soiled pants and underwear and they give him a wet rag to wipe the shit off his friend flaco murmurs to him im sorry sorry its okay then they put both of them into the back of the van and take them back to their cell throw them on the bare concrete floor slam the door shut and actually leave them alone for a while the boys lie on the floor and cry an hour later a federale comes back in and flaco starts to tremble uncontrollably but the federale just tosses them each a pad of paper and a pencil and tells them to start writing their stories hit the papers the next morning confirmation of what the mjfp thought had happened in the parada casethe cardinal was the victim of mistaken identity killed because american gang members mistook him for guero mendez el presidente gets back on television with general leon at his side to announce that this news only strengthens his administrations resolve to wage a merciless war against the drug cartels they will not stop until these thugs are punished and the narcotraficantes are destroyed flacos tongue lolls lazily from his mouth his face is dark blue he hangs by the neck from the steam pipe that runs across the ceiling in his cell dreamer dangles next to him the coroner returns with a verdict of double suicide the young men couldnt live with the guilt of killing cardinal parada the coroner never deals with the unexplained blunttrauma blows on the backs of their heads san diego art waits on the american side of the border the terrain looks strangely green through the nightvision scopes its a strange piece of ground anyway he thinks nomansland the desolate stretch of dusty hills and deep canyons that lies between tijuana and san diego every night a weird game is played out here just before dusk the wouldbe mojados gather above the dry drainage canal that runs along the border waiting for darkness as if on a signal they all rush across at once its a numbers gamethe illegals know that the border patrol can stop only so many so the rest will get through to find the subminimum wage jobs picking fruit washing dishes working on farms but this nights mad scramble is already over and art has made sure that the border patrol has been cleared from this sector a defector is coming over from the other side and even though hes going to be a guest of the united states government he cant come across at any of the regular stations it would be too dangerousthe barreras have spotters who watch the checkpoints and art cant take the chance that his man might be spotted he checks his watch and doesnt like what he sees its and his man is ten minutes late it could just be the difficulty of negotiating the treacherous terrain at night his guy could be lost in one of the numerous box canyons or come up the wrong ridge or stop kidding yourself he says ramos is with him and ramos knows this territory like its his backyard which it pretty much is maybe ramos didnt get to him and the guy decided to keep his lot in with the barreras maybe he just chickened out changed his mind or maybe ramos didnt get to him first and hes lying in a ditch somewhere with a bullet in the back of his head or more likely shot in the mouth as informers usually are just then he sees a flashlight blink three times he blinks his own twice flips the safety of his service revolver off and walks down into the canyon the flashlight in one hand the gun in the other in a minute he can make out two figures one tall and thick the other shorter and much thinner the priest looks miserable hes not wearing a soutane or collar but a hooded nike sweatshirt jeans and running shoes which are art thinks appropriate he looks cold and scared father rivera art asks rivera nods ramos slaps him on the back cheer up father you made a good choice the barreras would have killed you sooner or later or at least thats what theyd wanted him to believe it was ramos at arts urging who had made the approach found the priest out on his morning jog trotted beside him and asked him if he liked the smell of fresh air and wanted to breathe more then showed him photos of some of the men raul had tortured to death and added cheerfully that they would probably just shoot him being a priest and all but they cant let you live padre ramos had told him you know too much you miserable lying asslicking excuse for a holy man i can save you though ramos added when the man started to cry but it has to be soontonightand youll have to trust me hes right art says now he nods to ramos and if a mans eyes can actually smirk ramos are smirking adios viejo ramos says to art adios my old friend art takes rivera by the wrist and gently walks him back toward his vehicle the priest allows himself to be led like a child chalino guzman aka el verde patron of the sonora cartel arrives at his favorite restaurant in ciudad juarez for breakfast he comes here every morning to have his huevos rancheros with flour tortillas and if it werent for the distinctive green lizardskin boots youd think he was just another drycountry farmer scraping out a living from the hard sunbaked red soil but the waiters know better they usher him to his regular table on the patio and bring him his coffee and morning newspaper and they take thermoses of hot coffee out to his sicarios who sit in parked cars in front of the restaurant just across the border is the texas town of el paso through which el verde ships tons of cocaine marijuana and even a little heroin now he sits down and looks at the newspaper he cant read but he likes pretending that he can and anyway he enjoys looking at the pictures he glances over the top of the paper and watches one of his sicarios walk up to a ford bronco parked out in front to tell it to move along el verde is a trifle annoyedmost of the locals know the rules this time of the morning this must be an outoftowner he thinks as the sicario taps on the window then the bomb goes off and rips el verde to pieces don francisco uzuetaaka garcia abrego head of the gulf cartel and patron of the federacionrides a palomino stallion at the head of the parade in the annual festival of his small village of coquimatlan he has the stallion in full parade trot its hooves clapping on the cobblestones of the narrow street and hes decked out in full vaquero costume as befits the patron of the village he sweeps his bejeweled sombrero in acknowledgment of the cheers and well they should cheerdon francisco built the village clinic the school the playground he even paid to aircondition the new police station so now he smiles at the people and graciously accepts their gratitude and love he recognizes individuals in the crowd and makes a special point to wave to children he doesnt see the barrel of the m machine gun as it pokes out of a secondstory window the first short burst of caliber bullets takes the smile along with the rest of his face the second burst rips his chest open the palomino whinnies in terror rears up and starts to buck abregos dead hand still clutches the reins mario aburto a twentythreeyearold mechanic stands in the large crowd that day in the poor neighborhood of lomas taurinas near the tijuana airport lomas taurinas is a squatters colony of improvised shacks and huts hidden in a ravine of the bare muddy mountains that flank the east side of tijuana in lomas taurinas when youre not choking on dust youre slipping in the mud that pours down from the eroded hills sometimes taking the shacks with it until recently running water meant that you built your shack over one of the thousands of rivuletswater runs literally through your housebut the colonia recently received piped water and electricty as a reward for its loyalty to the pri but still much of the muddy ground is an open sewer and slowflowing garbage dump luis donaldo colosio is flanked by fifteen plainclothes soldiers from the elite estado mayor the presidential bodyguards a special squad of extijuana cops hired to provide security for the local campaign stops are interspersed in the crowd the candidate speaks from the bed of a pickup truck parked in a sort of natural amphitheater at the bottom of the ravine ramos watches from the slope his stg stationed at various points around the bowl of the amphitheater its a difficult taskthe crowd is large and raucous and flowing like mud the people had mobbed colosios red chevy blazer as it made slow progress up the one street into the neighborhood and now ramos is worried that the same thing will happen when colosio goes to leave it will be a goat fuck he says to himself but colosio doesnt get back in his car when the speech ends instead he decides to walk to swim among the people as he puts it hes going to do what ramos yells into his radio at general reyes the commander of the army guard hes going to walk thats crazy its what he wants if he does that ramos says we cant protect him reyes is a member of the mexican general staff and secondincommand of the presidential bodyguard hes not going to take orders from some grimy tijuana cop its not your job to protect him he sniffs its ours colosio overhears the exchange since when he asks do i need protection from the people ramos watches helplessly as colosio dives into the sea of people heads up heads up he radios his men but he knows theres little any of them can do although his men are fine marksmen they can barely even see colosio as he bobs in and out of the crowd never mind get a shot at a potential assassin not only can they not see they can barely hear as speakers mounted on a truck start to blare the local baja cumbia music so ramos doesnt hear the shot he just barely sees mario aburto push his way through the bodyguards grab colosios right shoulder press the pistol to the right side of his head and pull the trigger ramos starts to fight his way down as chaos erupts some people in the crowd grab aburto and start to beat him general reyes takes the fallen colosio in his arms and starts to carry him to a car one of his men a plainclothes major grabs aburto by the shirt collar and pulls him through the crowd blood spatters on the majors collar as someone hits aburto in the head with a rock but now the estado mayor squad forms around the major like football linemen around a runner bulldozes through the mob and shoves the assassin into a black suburban as ramos makes his way toward the suburban he sees that an ambulance has managed to drive in and he sees reyes and the emts lift colosio into the back thats when ramos sees the second wound in colosios left sidethe man was shot not once but twice the ambulance howls and takes off the black suburban starts to do the same but ramos raises esposa and points it right at the army major sitting in the front seat tijuana police ramos yells identify yourself estado mayor get out of our way the major yells back he pulls his pistol its a bad idea twelve stg rifles are aimed at his head ramos approaches the car from the passenger side now he can see the alleged assassin on the floor of the backseat between three plainclothes soldiers who are shoving him down and beating him ramos looks at the major in the front seat open the door im getting in the hell you are i want that man to arrive at the police station alive its none of your goddamn business get out of our way ramos turns to his men if the car moves kill them he lifts esposa and with the butt smashes through the passenger window as the major ducks ramos reaches in unlocks the door opens it and gets in now he has esposas barrel pointed at the majors stomach the major has his pistol pointed at ramos face what the major asks do you think im jack ruby im just making sure youre not i want this man to make it to the station alive were taking him to federal police headquarters the major says as long as he gets there alive ramos repeats the major lowers his pistol and tells his driver lets go a crowd arrives at tijuana general before colosios ambulance does the weeping praying people have gathered on the front steps shouting colosios name and holding up his picture the ambulance brings colosio around the back and into a waiting operating room a helicopter has landed on the street its rotors spinning ready to fly the wounded man to a special trauma center across the border in san diego it never makes the trip colosio is already dead bobby its too much like bobby art thinks the lone gunmanthe alienated isolated nut the two wounds one in the right side the other on the left how did this aburto kid do that art asks shag he fires from pointblank range into the right side of colosios head then shoots him again in the left side of his stomach how just like rfk shag answers the victim spins when the first bullet hits shag demonstrates snapping his head back and rotating to the left as he falls to the floor that would work art says except the trajectory of the bullets have them coming from opposite directions oh here we go okay art says we bust gueros tunnel and its connected to the fuentes brothers who are big supporters of colosio then colosio comes to tijuana the barreras turf and gets killed call me crazy shag i dont think youre crazy shag says but i think you have this barrera obsession ever since he stops stares at the desk art finishes the thought for him ever since they killed ernie yeah and you dont i do shag says i want to get them all the barreras and mendez but boss at a certain level i mean at some point you have to let this go hes right art thinks of course hes right and id like to let it go but wanting to and doing are two very different things and letting go of this barrera obsession as shag puts it is something i just cant do im telling you he says when all this shakes out were going to find out that the barreras were behind this no doubt in my mind guero mendez lies on a gurney at a private hospital where three of the best plastic surgeons in mexico are getting ready to give him a new face a new face he thinks dyed hair a new name and i can resume my war against the barreras a war he will certainly win with the new president on his side he settles back on his pillow as the nurse preps him are you ready to go to sleep she asks he nods ready to go to sleep and wake up a new man she takes a syringe removes the little rubber cap and places the needle against a vein in his arm then pushes the plunger on the syringe she strokes his face as the drug starts to take effect then says softly colosio is dead what did you say i have a message from adan barrerayour man colosio is dead guero tries to get up but his body wont obey his mind this is called dormicum the nurse says a massive dosecall it a lethal injection when your eyes close this time theyll never open again he tries to scream but no sound comes out of his mouth he fights to stay awake but he can feel it slipping away from himhis consciousness his life he struggles against the restraints tries to get a hand free to rip off the mask and scream for help but his muscles wont respond even his neck wont turn to shake his head no no no as he feels his life draining out of him as if from a tremendous distance he hears the nurse say the barreras say to rot in hell two guards roll a laundry cart full of clean sheets and blankets up to miguel angel barreras suite of cells in almoloya prison tio climbs in and the guards throw a sheet over him and roll him out of the building across the yards and out the gate that simple that easy as promised miguel angel climbs out of the cart and walks to a waiting van twelve hours later hes living in retirement in venezuela three days before christmas adan kneels before cardinal antonucci in his private study in mexico city the most wanted man in mexico listens to the papal nuncio chant in latin absolution for him and raul for their unintentional role in the accidental killing of cardinal juan ocampo parada antonucci doesnt give them absolution for the murders of el verde abrego colosio and mendez adan thinks but the government has in advanceit was all part of the quid pro quo for killing parada if i kill your enemy adan had insisted you must let me kill mine so its done adan thinks mendez is dead the war is over tio has been whisked out of prison and i am the new patron the mexican government has just restored the holy roman catholic church to full legal status a briefcase full of incriminating information has passed from adan barrera to certain government ministers adan leaves the room with an officially shinyclean new soul quid pro quo new years eve nora comes home from a dinner with haley saxon she left even before they popped the corks on the champagne shes just not in a party mood the holidays have been depressing it was her first christmas in nine years that she didnt spend with juan she slips the key into her door and opens it and as she steps inside a hand clamps over her mouth she digs into her purse and fumbles for the pepper spray but the bag is knocked out of her hand im not going to hurt you art says dont scream he slowly takes his hand off her mouth she turns and slaps him across the face then says im calling the police i am the police im calling the real police she walks to her phone and starts to dial he says you have the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you in a she puts the phone down thats better what do you want i want you to see something you have no idea how many times ive heard that he takes a videocassette from

them and i look pretty good on tape she opens an armoire and shows him the tv and vcr whatever turns you on he pops in the tape and says sit down im fine thanks i said sit down oh its the forceful thing she sits on the sofa happy now turned on watch shes smirking as the tape starts to run but she stops as the image of a young priest comes on the screen hes sitting in a metal folding chair behind a metal table a bar is displayed on the bottom of the screen giving the date and time whos this she asks father esteban rivera keller answers adans parish priest she hears arts voice in the background asking questions feels her heart drop as she listens may do you remember where you were yes you were performing a christening is that right yes in your church in tijuana yes take a look at

day no i dont but we do dont we art says to nora he gets up pops the tape out of the machine and puts it back in his pocket happy new year ms hayden she doesnt look up as he leaves new years day art wakes up to the sound of the television and a wicked hangover i must have left the damn thing on last night he thinks he shuts it off goes into the bathroom takes a couple of aspirin and chugs a large glass of water then he goes into the kitchen and puts on a pot of coffee he opens the door to the hallway while it brews and picks up his newspaper takes the paper and the coffee to the table in the living space of the sterile condo and sits down its a clear winter day outside and he can see san diego harbor just a few blocks away and beyond that mexico good riddance to he thinks a bastard of a year may be better more guests at the gathering of the dead last night the old regulars and now father juan mowed down in the cross fire i created trying to make peace in the war i started he brought people with him too kids two sd gangbangers children of my own old barrio they all came to see the old year out quite a party he looks at the front page of the paper and notes without much interest that nafta goes into effect today well congratulations everybody he thinks free trade shall bloom factories shall spring up like mushrooms just across the border and underpaid mexican labor shall make our tennis shoes our designer clothes our refrigerators and handy household appliances at prices we can afford we shall all be fat and happy and whats one dead priest compared to that well im glad you all have your treaty he thinks but i sure as hell didnt sign it chapter ten the golden west all the federales say they could have had him any day they only let him go so long out of kindness i suppose townes van zandtpancho and lefty san diego the sunlight is filthy filtered through a smudgy window and dirty broken venetian blinds it creeps into callans room like a noxious gas sick and yellow sick and yellow also describes callansick yellow sweaty rank he lies twisted in the unchangedforweeks sheets his pores trying unsuccessfully to sweat out the alcohol dried saliva caked at the edges of his halfopen mouth his brain trying feverishly to sort out the bits and pieces of nightmares from the emerging waking reality the weak sun hits his eyelids and they open another day in paradise fuck actually hes almost glad to be awakethe dreams were bad made worse by booze he halfexpects to see blood in the bedhis dreams are incarnadine blood flows through them like a river connecting one nightmare to another not that reality is much better he blinks a few times assures himself that he is awake and slowly swings his legs aching from the lacticacid buildup to the floor he sits there for a second considers lying back down then reaches for a pack of cigarettes on the bedside table he pops a cig in his mouth finds his lighter and shakes the flame to the tip of the cigarette a deep inhale a wracking cough and he feels a little better what he needs now is a drink an eyeopener he looks down and sees the empty pint of seagrams at his feet hells fuckand its happening more and more these days more and more my aching ass he thinks its happening every night now youre finishing the whole bottle and leaving nothing for morning not the thinnest ray of amberliquid sunshine which means youll have to get up get up and get dressed and go out to get a drink used to bedoesnt seem like that long agohed wake up with a hangover and what hed want was a cup of coffee in the earlier days of those earlier days hed go out to the little diner on fourth avenue and get that first headacherelieving cup and maybe ease into some breakfastsome greasy potatoes eggs and toast the special then he stopped eating breakfastthe coffee was all he could handleand then somewhere in there somewhere along the slow drifting river trip that is an extended bender it became not coffee he wanted in the first awful hour of the morning but more liquor so now he gets to his feet his knees creak his back hurts from sleeping so long in one position he shuffles into the bathroom a sink toilet and shower crammed into what had once been a closet a thin insufficient lip of metal separates the shower from the floor so in the days when he was still taking regular showers and he pays a considerable extra amount each week for the private bathroom because he didnt want to share the common one down the hall with the babbling psychos the old syphilis cases the drunken old queens the water always overflowed onto the old stained tile floor or sprayed through the thin ripped plastic shower curtain with the faded peace flowers on it he doesnt take many showers now he thinks about it but it just seems like too much work and anyway the shampoo bottle is almost empty the remaining shampoo dried up and stuck to the bottom of the bottle and its too much mental effort to go into longs drugs and buy another and he dont like being around that many peoplenot that many civilians anyway a thin sliver of soap survives on the shower floor and another shrinking bar of strongsmelling antiseptic soapprovided by the hotel along with the thin towelsits on the sink he splashes some water on his face he dont look in the mirror but it stares back at him his face is puffy and jaundiced his shoulderlength hair long and greasy his beard matted im starting to look callan thinks like every other wino junkie and drunk in the lamp well shit why not except that i can go to the atm and always get money out i am like every other wino junkie and drunk in the lamp he brushes his teeth that much he does he cant stand the stalewhiskeyandpuke taste in his mouthit makes him want to puke more so he brushes his teeth and takes a piss he dont have to get dressedhes already dressed in what he passed out in black jeans and a black tshirt but he does have get his shoes on which means sitting back on the bed and bending over and by the time he finishes tying his black chuck taylor hightops no socks he almost feels like going back to bed but its eleven in the morning time to get going get that drink he reaches under the pillow finds his pistol sticks it in the back of his waistband under the oversized untucked tshirt finds his key and walks out the door the hallway stinks mostly of lysol which the management pours around like fucking napalm to try to kill the stubborn scents of urine vomit shit and dying old man kill the germs anyway its a constant losing battlewhich is what this place is anyway callan thinks as he presses the button for the single cranky elevatora constant losing battle which is why you chose it to live in place to finally lose your own constant losing battle the golden west hotel sro single room occupancy shit right out the last stop before the sheet of cardboard on the street or the coroners slab because the golden west hotel converts welfare checks social insecurity checks unemployment checks disability checks directly into room rent but once the checks run out youre shit right out sorry pops hit the street the cardboard the slab some of the lucky ones die in their rooms they havent paid their rent or the smell of the decomposition seeps under their door and finally overpowers the lysol and a reluctant desk clerk puts a handkerchief over his nose and turns the passkey then the call is made and the ambulance makes its slow accustomed trip to the hotel and another old guy is taken out on a gurney for the last ride his sun at last setting over the golden west its not all old winos the occasional eurotourist accidentally finds his way here lured by the bargain price in otherwise expensivesan diego stays his week and checks out or the young american kid who thinks hes the next jack kerouac or the new tom waits is attracted by the downandout seedinessuntil his backpack gets stolen from his room with his discman and all his money or he gets mugged in the street outside or one of the colorful oldtimers tries to grope his joint in the common bathroom then the wouldbe dharma bum calls mommy and she phones her credit card to the front desk to get sonny boy out of there but he has seen a part ofamerica he wouldnt have seen otherwise but mostly its old drunks and ancient psychotics gathered like crows in the torn chairs in front of the television set in the lobby babbling their own dialogue arguing over the channel there have been stabbings actual fatalities over the rockford files or gilligansisland shit there have been stabbings over ginger versus mary ann or just mumbling internal monologues from real or imagined scenes playing out in their own brains constant losing battles callan doesnt have to live here he has money he could live better but he chooses this place call it penance purgatory anything you wantthis is the place where he conducts his long selfpunishment pounds the booze in slowly fatal amounts lethal selfinjection sweats the night sweats pukes blood screams his dreams dies every night starts again in the morning i forgive you god forgives you why did the old priest have to say that after the fuckedup shootout inguadalajara callan made his way tosan diego checked into the golden west and started drinking a year and a half later hes still here this is a setting for selfhatred he likes it here the elevator arrives complaining like a tired old roomservice waiter callan cranks the door open and hits the button below the faded l the grilledoor shuts celllike and the elevator grinds its way down callans relieved that hes its sole occupantno french tourist jamming it up with duffel bags no outtofindamerica college kid whapping him with his backpack no smelly old drunk with bo shit callan thinks im the smelly drunk with bo doesnt care the desk clerk likes callan nothing not to likethe strange young for the golden west guy pays in cash in advance hes quiet and doesnt complain and there was that one night when he was standing there waiting for his key and this mugger pulled a knife on the clerk and this guy looks over and then just dropped him drunk as a lord and he just dropped the mugger with one punch then politely asked for his key again so the clerk likes callan sure the man is always drunk but hes a quiet drunk who dont cause no trouble and thats all you can ask for so he says hi when callan drops off his key and callan mumbles hi back and heads out the door the sun hits him like a punch in the chest dimness to sunlight just like that blinded he stands and squints for a moment he never gets used to thisthey never had sun like this back innew york seems like its always sunny in fuckingsan diego sun diego they oughta call it hed give his left nut for one rainy day he adjusts his eyes to the light and walks into the gaslamp district it used to be a tawdry dangerous neighborhood filled with strip joints porno places and srosyour typical downtown in decline then the shabby hotels started to yield to condos as the process of gentrification set in and it became hip and trendy to live in the lamp so you have an upscale restaurant sitting next to a porn shop a hip club across from an sro a condo building with a coffee shop on its ground floor playing neighbor to a derelict building with winos in the basement and junkies on the roof gentrification is winning of course it ismoney always wins and the lamp is starting to become a yuppie theme park a few of the sros hold on a couple of porn shops a small handful of the seedier bars but the process is irreversible as the chains start to move inthe starbucks the gaps the edwards cinemas the lamp starts to look pretty much like everywhere else and the holdout porn places alkiebars and sro hotels resemble aboriginal indians drunkenly loitering in the parking lot of american commerce callan aint thinking about any of this hes just thinking about getting that drink and his feet carry him into one of the old survivors a dark narrow bar he doesnt know the name ofthe sign faded long agowedged between the last of the neighborhood laundromats and an art gallery its dark like all bars should be this is a serious drinkers barno amateurs or dilettantes need applyand there are a dozen or so drinkers mostly male staggered around the bar and in the booths along the opposite wall people dont come in here to socialize or talk sports or politics or to sample fine whiskeys they come in here to get drunk and stay drunk for as long as their money and their livers last a few of them glance up resentfully as callan opens the door and lets a wedge of sunshine break into the darkness the door closes quickly enough though and they all go back to staring at their drinks as callan walks in takes a stool at the bar and orders well not all of them theres one guy at the end of the bar who keeps glancing surreptitiously over his whiskey a little guy an old guy with a cherubs face and a full head of perfectly silver hair he looks a little like a leprechaun perched on a toadstool instead of a bar stool and his eyes blink in surprise as he recognizes the man who just came into the bar sat down and ordered two beers and a whiskey chaser its been twenty years since hes last seen this man twenty years ago in the liffey pub in hells kitchen when this mana boy then reallypulled a gun from the small of his back and put two bullets into eddie the butcher friel mickey even remembers the music that was playing remembers that he had loaded the jukebox with replays of moon river because he wanted to hear the song as many times as he could before starting on his next prison stretch remembers telling this manno its clearly him even down to the small bulge in the back where he still carries a pistolto go toss the gun in the hudson river mickey never saw the boy again not until this moment but he heard the rest of the story about how this boywhat is his namewent on to overthrow matty sheehan and become one of the kings of hells kitchen how he and his friend made peace with the cimino family and became hit men for big paulie calabrese and howif the rumors were truehe had gunned down big paulie outside sparks steak house just before christmas callan the old man thinks sean callan well i recognize you sean callan but you dont seem to know me which is good which is good mickey haggerty finishes his drink climbs off his stool and slips outside to a phone booth he knows someone wholl be very interested to learn that sean callan is at a bar in the gaslamp must be the dts callan reaches for his gun anyway but its gotta be the dtshere at lastbecause there aint no other explanation for big peaches and obop standing over his bed in the golden west hotel pointing their guns at him he can see the bullets in their chambers shiny and lethal pretty and silver reflected from the light of the street lamp outside the fake gaslamp that the broken venetian blind cant block out the red neon from the porn shop across the street flashes like an alarm too late if this aint the dts im already dead callan thinks but he starts to pull the gun out from under his pillow anyway take them with him dont you dumb fucking mick he hears a voice growl callans hand freezes is this a drunk dream or reality are big peaches and obop really standing in his room with their guns trained on him and if they was going to shoot why dont they shoot they say if you die in your dreams you die in your life but sometimes its hard to tell the difference between dead and alive last thing he remembers is pounding beers and whiskeys at the bar now he wakes up comes to and he might be dead or he might be alive or is he back in the kitchen and the last nine years were a dream big peaches laughs what are you some fucking hippie now all that hair the beard hes on a binge obop says an irish sabbatical you got that little popgun under that pillow dont you peaches says i

honest to god you should see him on those rollerblades people like run out of the way its like some japanese horror movie wopzilla they hear peaches say come in the kitchen see what the cat dragged in

valachi put johnny boy in prison for life and then some not that life is going to be longword is johnny boy has throat cancer its good though that peaches flipped because callan dont have to worry about him calling sal scachi who cant be happy that callan has gone off the reservation callan knows too much about scachis workall that red mist shitto be out there in the wind so its a good thing that him and peaches are disconnected little peaches turns to his brother are you feeding this guy yes im feeding him not this grapefruit shit little peaches says jesus christ get him some sausiche a

have to listen to him whine about his figure youre fat jimmy youre a fat greasy guinea get over it they go out on the patio because peaches thinks callan should get some sun actually peaches thinks that peaches should get some sun but he doesnt want to seem selfish its peaches opinion that theres no reason to live in san diego if youre not going to go sit in the sun every chance you get so he leans back in the chaise opens up his robe and starts to slather his body with bain de soleil you dont want to fuck with skin cancer he says mickey sure doesnt now he puts on his yankees cap and sits under the patio umbrella peaches opens a chilled can of peaches and scoops a few into his mouth callan watches a drop of the juice plop on his fat chest then merge with the sweat and suntan lotion and run down his belly anyway its good you showed up peaches says whys that how would you like peaches says to do a crime where the victims cant go to the cops sounds okay sounds okay peaches asks sounds like heaven to me he lays it out for callan drugs go northmexico to the states money goes souththe states to mexico they just put the bonessix sometimes seven figuresinto cars and drive it across the border into mexico peaches says or not little peaches adds theyve done three of these jobs already and now they got word that a narco safe house in anaheim is bursting with cash and has to make the trip south they got the address they got names they got the make of the car and the license plate they even got an idea about when the couriers are going to make the run where are you getting the info callan asks a guy peaches answers callan figured it was a guy you dont need to know peaches says he takes thirty points its like being back in the dope business except better obop says we get the profits but we never have to touch the stuff its just basic honest crime peaches says stick em up give me the money the way the good lord meant it to be mickey says so callan little peaches says you in i dunno callan answers whose money are we taking the barreras peaches answers with this sly questioning look in his eye asking is that a problem i dont know callan thinks is it the barreras are as dangerous as sharks not people you fuck with thoughtlessly thats one thing also theyre friends of oursaccording to sal scachi anywayso thats another thing but they murdered that priest straight up that was a hit not an accident a stonepro killer like fabian el motherfucking tiburon dont shoot nobody at pointblank range on accident it just dont happen callan dont know why they killed the priest he just knows that they did and they made me part of it he thinks so theres gotta be payback for that yeah callan says im in the west side gang is back together again obop watches the car pull out of the driveway its three in the morning and hes tucked down in his own rig half a block away he has an important job to do follow the courier car without getting spotted and confirm that it goes onto the he punches a number into his cell phone and says its on how many guys three two in front one in back he hangs up waits a few seconds then eases out as per plan little peaches calls peaches who calls callan who calls mickey they start the chronometers on their watches and wait for the next call mickey has it timed of course the average drive time from the driveway to the onramp of the sixpointfive minutes so they know within a minute or so when they should get the next call if they get the call the plan is in place if they dont theyre going to have to improvise and no one wants that so its a tense six minutes especially for obop hes the one doing the work right now the one who can fuck it all up if he gets himself spotted who has to stay where he can see them but they dont see him he lays off at varying distances a block two blocks he gives a leftturn signal and flips his headlights off for a second so he looks like a different car when he turns them back on obop works it while little peaches sits sweating an hour and a half south on the for three minutes four big peaches is in a booth at dennys off the highway just a little north of little peaches hes scarfing down a cheese omelet home fries toast and coffee mickey dont like them eating before a joba full stomach complicates things if you get shotbut peaches is like fuck that he dont want to jinx himself by taking precautions about what if he gets shot he polishes off the greasy potatoes takes two rolaids out of his pocket and chews on them while he looks at the sports section five minutes callan tries not to look at his watch hes lying on the bed in a motel room at the ortega highway exit off the got hbo on and hes watching some movie he dont even know what it is no point in him sitting out there on a bike in the cold if the couriers get on the therell be plenty of time looking at his watch aint gonna change anything its just gonna make him nervous but after what seems to be about ten minutes he gives in and looks five and a half minutes mickey dont look at his watch the call will come when it comes hes sitting in a car parked at the oceanside transportation center he smokes a cigarette and goes through in his head what happens if the couriers dont take the then what they should do is call it off wait for the next time but peaches aint gonna let them do that so theyll have to scramble try to guess the route from the info that obops giving them and find a way to get ahead of the courier car and then figure out a place to take them down cowboyandindian stuff he dont like it but he wont look at his watch six minutes little peaches is about to yank a million in cash on the line and the phone rings were good he hears obop say he presses the restart button on his watch one hour and twentyeight minutes is the average drive time from the onramp to this exit then he calls peaches who picks the phone up without taking his eyes off the paper were good peaches checks his watch calls callan and orders a piece of cherry pie callan gets the call coordinates his watch phones mickey then gets up and takes a long hot shower theres no hurry and he wants to be loose and relaxed so he stands in there awhile and lets the steaming water pound his shoulders and the back of his neck he can feel the adrenaline start to build but he dont want it to get too high too soon so he makes himself take the time to shave slowly and carefully and he feels good when he notices that his hand isnt shaking he also takes his time dressing slowly puts on black jeans a black tshirt and a black sweatshirt black socks black biker boots a kevlar vest then the black leather jacket tight black gloves he heads out he paid in cash the night before and signed in with a fake name so he just leaves the key in the room and locks the door behind him obops job is easier now not easy but easier as he can lay back a good distance from the courier car and get closer only as they get near offramps he has to make sure that they dont throw a curve and exit onto the or the or laguna beach road or the ortega highway but it seems like peaches hunch was right these guys are headed straight up the guttheyre staying on the main road all the way down to mexico so obop eases back and now he can talk on the phone without fear of getting spotted so he fills little peaches in on the details blue bmw uz three guys briefcases in the trunk this last bit aint great news as it causes an extra step once theyve taken the car down but of course mickey made them practice this option so obop aint too worried about it mickey worries thats what mickey does he worries and waits until the amtrak window opens then he goes in and pays cash for a oneway fare to san diego then he walks over to the greyhound station and buys a ticket to chula vista then he goes back to his car and waits and worries theyve practiced this dozens of times but he still worries too many variables too many what ifs what if theres a traffic jam what if theres a state trooper parked nearby what if theres a backup car and we dont see it what if someone gets shot what if what if what if if my aunt had balls shed be my uncle is what peaches had said to all these worries now he finishes his pie has another cup of coffee leaves cash for the bill and tip the tip just the right amountnot too small not too large he dont want to be remembered for any reason and goes out to his car takes the gun out of the glove compartment holds it low in his lap and checks the load all the bullets are still there like he thought theyd be but its a habit a reflex peaches has this horror of going to pull the trigger someday and hearing the dry click of an empty chamber he straps the gun into his ankle holster and likes its comfortable weight as he starts the car and steps on the gas pedal now theyre all in place little peaches off calafia road peaches on the ortega highway exit callan on his bike waiting at the beach cities exit in dana point mickey at the oceanside transportation center obop on the following the courier car all in place waiting for the stagecoach which rolls right into the ambush obop gets on the phone one halfmile out little peaches sees the car come past lowers his binoculars hits the cell phone now callan pulls out onto the highway im on peaches got it mickey starts a new chrono callan sees the car in his rearview mirror and slows down a little and lets it pass him no one in the car gives him so much as a glance a lone biker headed south in the predawn darkness its twenty minutes to the empty stretch at pendleton where he wants to do it so he drops back a little but keeps the cars taillights in sight the commuter traffic is headed mostly north not south and the few cars that are headed their way will thin out even more as they leave the southernmost orange county town of san clemente they pass basilone road then the famous surfing beaches called trestles then the two domes of the san onofre nuclear generating station then the border patrol checkpoint that blocks off the northbound lanes of the and then it gets empty and quiet nothing on their right except sand dunes and ocean which are now beginning to emerge in the faint light as the rays of the sun start to appear on the left over black mountain which dominates the camp pendleton landscape callan has a mike and a headset inside his motorcycle helmet he utters a single word go mickey answers go callan twists the accelerator leans forward to cut down the wind resistance and speeds toward the courier car pulls beside almost exactly where hed plannedon the long straightaway just short of the long right curve that sweeps toward the ocean the driver sees him at the last possible second callan sees his eyes widen in surprise and then the car lurches forward as the driver steps on the gas hes not worried about getting stopped by a cop now hes worried about getting killed and the beamer surges ahead momentarily this is why they got the harley right this is why they bought the hog basically an engine with two wheels and a seat attached to it the fucking harley aint gonna lose to no yuppiemobile and it sure aint gonna lose to no yuppiemobile with two million dollars in cash for the taking so when the beamer hits seventy callan hits seventy when it hits eighty callan hits eighty ninety ninety when it slides into the far right lane callan slides with it back left back left back right back right beamer hits the hundred mph mark callan hits the century mark and now he lets his adrenaline loose its pumping through his veins like fuel through the bikes engine bike engine rider adrenaline singing now sailing flying callan is in the zone nowpure adrenaline speed rush as he pulls even with the beamer and the driver yanks the steering wheel to the left to try to ram him and almost does and callan has to pull out and he almost loses it almost loses it at one hundred per which would send him spinning out on the concrete where hed be just a smear of blood and tissue but he rights the bike and pulls it behind the beamer which now has a tenyard lead and then the back window opens and a mac peeks out and starts shooting like a tail gunner but maybe peaches was righteven in a car you cant hit shit at that speed and anyway callan is leaning left and right swaying the bike back and forth and the guys in the beamer figure that aint gonna work and they got a better chance with the gas pedal so they push it the beamer hits and pulls ahead even the harley aint gonna catch it which is why callan hit it where he didbecause the straightaway ends in that gigantic sharp outside curve that the beamer isnt going to handle at eighty never mind a buck ten thats the fucking thing about physicsits uncompromising so either the driver slows down and lets the shooter on the bike catch him or he goes flying off the road like a jet on a carrier deck only this jet cant fly he decides to take his chances with the shooter wrong choice callan slides to the left his foot nearly scraping the concrete he comes out of the top side of the curve even with the drivers window and the driver freaks when he sees the come up near his face callan fires one shot to spiderweb the window then pop pop always two shots right together because the second shot automatically corrects the first not that it needs to in this instance both shots go dead center the two rounds are zipping around in the guys brain like the balls in a pinball machine thats why the is callans weapon of choice its not powerful enough to blast a round through a skull instead it sends the bullet bouncing around inside the brainpan frantically looking for an exit lighting all the lights and then putting them out game over no bonus play the beamer whips into serial s and then goes off the road stays on its feet thoughfine german engineeringbut the two passengers are still in shock from whiplash as callan pulls the bike over and pop pop pop pop callan pulls back onto the highway three seconds later little peaches pulls in behind the beamer gets out of his car with a shotgun in his left hand just in case walks up and opens the drivers door leans across the dead driver and takes the keys from the ignition walks to the back of the car takes the briefcases from the trunk gets back into his car and pulls out there must be a dozen cars spread out on the highway that see pieces of this scene but none of them stop or pull over because little peaches is in a california highway patrol car and a chp uniform so they have to figure he has it under control he does gets back in the cruiser and calmly drives south he aint worried about getting stopped by a real cop because moments before right by mickeys clock big peaches hit a switch on a radiocontrol transmitter and in a vacant lot a halfblock away an old dodge van went up like an octogenarians birthday cake and as big peaches pulls out for his next task he already hears the sirens screeching in his direction he drives to the parking lot of a municipal golf course in north oceanside and is sitting there when little peaches pulls in little peaches takes the briefcases gets out of the fake cop car and gets in with peaches as little peaches struggles out of his cops uniform they drive toward the oceanside transportation center obop has passed the crashed beamer so he knows that at least part of the job has gone off so he drives to the highway exit theres a small dirt lot inside the cloverleaf and thats where callan has pulled off he leaves the harley and gets in with obop they drive toward the transport center where mickeys waiting in his car eyes on his watch waiting the clocks running down either the jobs gone okay or his friends are hurt dead arrested then he sees little peaches pull into the parking lot they sit in the car until the train is announced and they can see it down the track coming up from san diego then they get out of their car wearing conservative suits each carrying a briefcase and a cardboard cup of coffee and an overnight bag slung over his shoulder looking just like any other businessmen rushing to catch the train for a meeting in la mickey slips them their tickets as they walk past the car they board moments before their trains pull out and this is why they picked the oceanside transportation centerbecause as the amtrak train pulls up from the south the local commuter train pulls out on a different track headed south peaches takes one briefcase and gets on the labound train his brother takes the other case and heads south for san diego as the trains depart the platforms callan and obop pull into the parking lot and get out of the car their hair is cut short marinestyle and theyre wearing the kind of bad clothes that marines wear when theyre offduty they sling their duffel bags over their shoulders walk past mickeys car and get their tickets and then walk over to the side of the transport station where the buses are parked just two more marines out of pendleton on leave obop gets on a bus bound for escondido callan on one headed for hemet peaches has a ticket for la but he doesnt take the whole ride a few minutes south of the santa ana station he goes into the lavatory and changes his clothes from the business geeks suit into california casual and he doesnt come out until the train pulls into the station then he gets off at santa ana and checks into a motel little peaches does a similar routine only southbound getting off in the funky surfing town of encinitas and checking into one of those old roadside cottage motels across the pch from the beach mickey he just drives back to his hotel he hasnt been close to the action and if the cops want to track him down and ask him any questions hes got nothing to say anyway he does his thirtyfive per downtown and goes back to bed for a nap callan and obop take their full rides obop to a notell motel next to a porn shop so hes happy and has things to do while hes lying low he checks in then walks over and buys twenty bucks worth of tokens and spends most of the afternoon pumping the coins into the video machines sitting on his bus callan tries to forget about having just killed three men but he cant he dont feel his usual nothin he feels something he cant put a name to i forgive you god forgives you cant get that shit out of his head he gets off his bus and checks into a motel the room aint much but it does have cable callan flops on the bed and watches movies on the television the room smells of disinfectant but it beats the golden west the plan is to chill out for a few days then if everything is cooland theres no reason it shouldnt betheyre going to meet up at the sea lodge in la jolla chill out on the beach for a few days call in some broads peaches actually says broads from haley saxon have a party callan remembers the girl he saw there nora remembers how much he wanted that girl and how big peaches took her away from him he remembers how beautiful she was and thinking that if he could somehow touch that beauty it would make his own life less ugly but that was a long time ago a lot of bloods flowed under the bridge since then and its not possible that the girl nora is still in that house is it he dont want to ask though three days later peaches is on the phone like hes ordering chinese food whaddya want a blonde a brunette how about a black chick theyre all hanging out in peaches room even though they all have adjoining rooms right on the beach its actually pretty cool callan thinksyou step right out of your room and youre on the beach and hes getting off on watching the sun set over the ocean while peaches is on the phone ordering pussy whatever he tells peaches and a whatever peaches says into the phone and then he chases them out because hes got business to do they dont need to be a part of take a swim take a shower have some dinner get ready for the broads peaches business arrives about an hour later after its dark they dont talk a lot peaches just hands him a suitcase containing three hundred large in cash as his share for the information art keller takes the money and leaves simple as that haley saxon has some business too she decides on the five girls shes going to send to the sea lodge then gets on the horn to raul barrera some wise guys from the old days are in town throwing around a lot of cash and guess who they are you remember jimmy peaches well he suddenly came into a lot of money raul is very interested and sure haley knows exactly where they are just leave my girls out of it callan lies in bed watching the girl get dressed shes pretty really prettylong red hair nice rack nice assbut she wasnt her she got his rocks off though gave him his moneys worth gave him head then climbed on top of him and rode him until he came now she stands in the bathroom fixing her makeup and she sees him in the mirror looking at her we can go again if you want she says im good when she leaves he wraps a towel around himself and goes out onto the little terrace watches the small waves break silver in the moonlight a nicelooking sportsfishing boat sits about a hundred yards out its lights glowing golden it would be just goddamn tranquil callan thinks if i couldnt hear big peaches going at it in the next room still going at it fucking peaches never changespulled his i like your girl better routine again except this time it was his brother little peaches didnt carehed already sent his girl to his room and he just said take her so they switched women and rooms and thats why callan has to listen to big peaches huffing and puffing like an asthmatic bull they find little peaches body in the morning mickey knocks at callans door and when callan answers it mickey just grabs him and pulls him into big peaches room and theres little peaches tied to a chair with his hands in his pockets except his hands arent attached to his arms theyre severed the carpet is soaked in blood a washcloth is stuffed in little peaches mouth and his eyes are bulging you dont got to be sherlock holmes to figure out they chopped off his hands and left him to bleed out callan can hear big peaches in the bathroom crying and throwing up obop sits on the bed holding his head in his hands the money is gone of course whats in the closet instead is a note keep your hands in your own pockets the barreras peaches comes out of the bathroom his fat face is red and streaked with tears little bubbles of snot pop out of his nostrils we cant just leave him he cries we got to jimmy callan says ill get em peaches says last thing i do ill pay these bastards back they dont pack or nothing just get into their separate vehicles and go callan drives all the way up past san francisco then finds a little motel near the beach and holes up raul barrera has his money back although its three hundred thousand light raul knows that money went to whoever gave the piccone brothers the tip butand give little peaches credit the man was toughhe never told them who it was claimed he didnt know callan goes into the basement in seaside california he finds one of them old cabinstyle motels not far from the beach and pays in cash he doesnt go out much at all the first few days then he starts taking long walks on the beach where the surf whispers to him rhythmically i forgive you god chapter eleven sleeping beauty his wonder was to find unwakened eve with tresses discomposed and glowing cheek as through unquiet rest john milton paradiselost rancho las bardas baja mexico march nora sleeps with the lord of the skies thats adans new sobriquet among the narcocognescentiel senor de los cielos the lord of the skies and if hes the lord nora is his lady their relationship is in the open now shes almost always with him the narcos have tagged nora with intentional irony la guera the blonde adan barreras goldenhaired lady his mistress his adviser guero was laid to rest in guamuchilito the whole village attended the funeral so did adan and nora he in a black suit she in a black dress and veil they walked in the cortege behind the flowerstrewn hearse a mariachi band played lachrymose corridos in praise of the deceased as the procession marched from the church guero built past the clinic and the soccer field he paid for toward the mausoleum that held the remains of his wife and children people wept freely ran up to the open casket and threw flowers on gueros body his face in death was handsome composed almost serene his blond hair was combed neatly straight back and he was dressed in an expensive charcoalgray suit and conservative red tie instead of the black narcocowboy garb hed favored in life there were sicarios everywhere both adans men and gueros veteranos but the guns were hidden under shirts and jackets out of respect for the occasion and although adans men kept a sharp lookout no one was too worried about the threat of an assassination the war was over adan barrera was the winner and moreover he was behaving with admirable respect and dignity it was nora who had suggested not only that should he allow guero to be buried in his hometown with his family but that they attend the funeral not just publicly but prominently it was nora who urged him to make large cash gifts to the local church the local school and the clinic nora who led him into donating all the money for a new community center to be named after the late hector guero mendez salazar nora who persuaded him to send emissaries in advance to assure gueros sicarios and cops that the war was over that no vengeance would be sought for past deeds and that operations would continue as before with the same personnel in place so adan marched in the funeral procession like a conquering lord but a conquering lord who held the olive branch in one hand adan walked into the little tomb and again at noras urging knelt beneath the little dome that held the pictures of pilar claudia and guerito and prayed to god for their souls he lit a candle for each of them then bowed his head and prayed in deep piety the shabby little piece of theater wasnt lost on the people outside they understood itthey were used to death and murder and in a strange way reconciliation by the time adan emerged from the mausoleum they seemed to have almost forgotten that he was the one whod filled it with bodies in the first place the memories were buried with guero in his tomb this was a repeat of the process adan and nora had gone through for the funerals of el verde and garcia abrego and everywhere they went it was the same with nora at his side adan endowed schools clinics playgroundsall in the names of the deceased privately he met with the dead mens former associates and offered them an extension of the baja revolutionpeace amnesty protection and a lowered rate of taxation the word had gone outyou could meet with adan or you could meet with raul the wise majority met with adan the foolish few had funerals of their own the federacion was back with adan as its patron peace reigned and with it prosperity the new mexican president took office on december the very next day two brokerage houses controlled by the federacion started to buy up tesobonosgovernment bonds the next week the drug cartels withdrew their capital from the mexican national bank forcing the new president to devalue the peso by percent then the federacion cashed in its tesobonos and collapsed the mexican economy feliz navidad as christmas presents to themselves the federacion bought up property businesses raw real estate and pesos and put them under the tree and waited the mexican government didnt have the cash to honor the outstanding tesobonos in fact it was about billion short capital was flying out of the country faster than preachers from a raided cathouse the country ofmexico was days away from declaring bankruptcy when the american cavalry rode in with billion in loans to prop up the mexican economy the american president had no choice he and every congressman on the hill were getting frantic phone calls from major campaign contributors at citicorp and they came up with that billion like it was lunch money the new mexican president had to literally invite the narco lords back into the country with their millions of narcodollars to reinvigorate the economy to pay back the loan and the narcos now had billions more dollars than they did before the peso crisis because in the time between cashing in the pesos for dollars and the american bailout they used the dollars to buy devalued pesos which in turn rose again when the americans issued the massive loan what the federacion basically did was buy the country sell it back high buy it again low then reinvest in it and watch the investments grow adan graciously accepted el presidentes invitation but the price he demanded for bringing his narcodollars back into the country was a favorable trade environment meaning that el presidente could shoot his mouth off all he wanted about breaking the backs of the drug cartels but hed better not do anything about it he could talk the talk but he couldnt walk the walk because that stroll would be right off the gangplank the americans knew it they gave el presidente a list of pri bigwigs who were on the federacions payroll and suddenly three of these guys were appointed state governors another one became the transportation secretary and another guy who made the list was appointed the drug czar himselfthe head of the national institute to combat drugs it was back to business as usual better than usual because one thing adan did with his windfall profits from the peso crisis was start buying boeing s within two years he has twentythree of them a fleet of jet aircraft larger than that of mostthird world countries he loads them full of cocaine incali and flies them to civilian airports military airstrips and even highways that are closed down and guarded by the army until the plane is safely offloaded the coke is packed into refrigerator trucks and driven to warehouses near the border where its broken down into smaller units and loaded into trucks and cars that are works of innovative genius a whole new industry has been created in baja of chop artists who refit vehicles with hidden compartments called stash holds they have false roofs fake floors and phony bumpers that are hollowed out and filled with dope as in any industry specialists have developedyou have guys who are known as great choppers and others who are sanders and painters you have some guys who do things with bondo that a venetian plasterer could only dream of once the cars are prepared theyre driven across the border into theunited states and delivered to safe houses usually insan diego orlos angeles then earmarked for various destinations la seattle chicago detroit cleveland philadelphia newark new york andboston the dope also goes by sea its delivered from its landing in mexico to towns on the baja coast where its vacuumwrapped and then loaded into private and commercial fishing boats which cruise up the coast to the waters off california and dump the dope into the water where it floats until its picked up by speedboats or sometimes even scuba divers who take it to shore and drive it to the safe houses it also goes by foot lowerend smugglers simply stuff it into packs and send it on the backs of mujados or coyotes who make the run across the border in the hope of making a fortunesay for delivering it to a prearranged point somewhere in the countryside east ofsan diego some of this countryside is remote desert or high mountains and its not unusual for the border patrol to find the corpse of a mujado who died from dehydration in the desert or exposure in the mountains because he wasnt carrying the water or blankets that might have saved his life but was humping a load of dope instead the dope goes north and the money comes south and both legs of this roundtrip are a lot easier because border security has been relaxed by nafta which assures among other things a smooth flow of traffic betweenmexico and theunited states and with it a smooth flow of drug traffic and the traffic is more profitable than ever because adan uses his new power to leverage a better deal with the colombians which is basically well buy your cocaine wholesale and do the retail ourselves thank you no more akilo delivery charge were in business for ourselves the north american free drug trade agreement adan thinks god bless free trade adans making the old mexican trampoline look like a little kid bouncing on his bed hey why bounce when you can fly and adan can fly hes the lord of the skies not that life has returned to the status quo ante bellum it hasnt ever the realist adan knows that nothing can be the same after the murder of parada technically hes still a wanted man their new friends in los pinos have put a million reward on the barrera brothers the american fbi has put them on the most wanted list their photos hang on walls at border checkpoints and government offices its a sham of course all lip service to the americans mexican law enforcement is no more trying to hunt down the barreras than its trying to shut down the drug trade as a whole still the barreras cant rub it in their faces cant show them up thats the unspoken understanding so the old days are overno more parties at big restaurants no more discos racetracks ringside seats at big boxing matches the barreras have to give the government plausible deniability allow them to shrug their shoulders to the americans and claim that they would gladly arrest the barreras if only they knew where to find them so adan doesnt live in the big house in colonia hipodromo anymore doesnt go to his restaurants doesnt sit in a back booth doing the figures on his yellow manuscript pads he doesnt miss the house he doesnt miss the restaurants but he does miss his daughter lucia and gloria are living back in america in the quiet san diego suburb of bonita gloria goes to a local catholic school lucia attends a new church once a week a barrera courier car meets her in a stripmall parking lot and gives her a briefcase with cash once a month lucia brings gloria down to baja to see her father they meet at remote lodges in the country or at a picnic spot by the side of the road near tecate adan lives for these visits gloria is twelve now and shes starting to understand why her father cant live with them why he cant cross the border into the united states he tries to explain to her that hes been falsely accused of many things that the americans take all the sins of the world and load them onto the backs of the barreras but mostly they talk about more mundane thingshow shes doing in school what music she likes to listen to movies shes seen who her friends are and what they do together shes getting bigger of course but as she grows so does her deformity and the progress of the disease tends to accelerate in adolescence the growth on her neck pulls her already heavy head down and to the left and makes it increasingly difficult for her to speak properly some of the kids at schoolit is a cliche he thinks that children are crueltease her call her the elephant girl he knows it hurts her but she appears to shrug it off theyre idiots she tells him dont worry i have my friends but he does worryfrets about her health chides himself that he cant be with her more agonizes about her longterm prognosis he fights back tears when each visit comes to an end as gloria sits in the car adan argues with lucia trying to convince her to come back to mexico but she wont consider it i wont live like a fugitive she tells him besides that she says shes afraid in mexico afraid of another war afraid for herself and for her daughter these are reasons enough but adan knows the real reasonshe has contempt for him now shes ashamed of him of what he does for a living of what hes done for that living she wants to keep it as far away from herself as possible be a soccer mom take care of their fragile daughter in the peace and tranquility of an american suburban life but she still takes the money adan thinks she never sends the courier car back he tries not to be bitter about it nora helps you have to understand how she feels nora tells him she wants a normal life for her daughter its tough on you but you have to understand how she feels its odd adan thinks the mistress taking the side of the wife but he respects her for it shes told him many times that if he can get his family back together he should and that she would fade into the background but nora is the comfort of his life when hes being honest with himself he has to acknowledge that the bright side to his estrangement with his wife is that its left him free to be with nora no the lord of the skies is flying high until the supply of cocaine starts to dry up it doesnt happen suddenly its gradual like a slow drought its the fucking american dea first they busted up the medellin cartel fidel rambo cardona turned on his old friend pablo escobar and helped the americans track him down and kill him then they went after cali they picked off the orejuela brothers as they were returning from a meeting in cancun with adan both the medellin and cali cartels fractured into small piecesthe baby bells adan dubbed them it only makes sense adan thinksa natural evolution in the face of ceaseless american pressure those who survive will be those who can stay small and low fly as it were under the american radar it makes sense but it also makes adans business more complicated and difficultinstead of dealing with one or two large entities he now has to juggle dozens if not scores of small cells and even individual entrepreneurs and with the demise of the vertically integrated cartels adan can no longer rely on the smooth and timely delivery of quality product say what you will about a monopoly adan thinks its efficient it can deliver what it promises where and when it says it will unlike the baby bells with whom the prompt delivery of a quality product has become the exception rather than the rule so the production end of adans cocaine business is getting shaky and this vibrates all the way down the line from the wholesalers to whom the barreras provided transportation and protection to the new retail markets in los angeles chicago and new york that adan took over after the orejuelas arrest increasingly he has empty boeing sexpensive to buy maintain and staffsitting on airstrips in colombia waiting for cocaine thats too often late or doesnt show up at all or when it does get there isnt of the promised quality and potency so the customers on the street complain to the retailers who complain to the wholesalers who politely complain to the barreras then the flow of cocaine all but stops the flood becomes a stream then a trickle then a drip then adan finds out why las fuerzas armadas revolucionarias de colombia aka farc the oldest and largest surviving marxist insurgency movement in latin america farc controls the remote southwestern area of colombia along the critical borders with the cocaineproducing countries of peru and ecuador from its stronghold there in the northwestern reaches of the amazon jungle farc has waged a thirtyyearlong guerrilla war against the colombian government the nations wealthy landowners and the oil interests that operate from the petroleumrich coastal districts and farcs power is growing just last month its guerrillas launched a daring attack on an army outpost in the town of las delicias using mortars and highexplosive charges it took the fort killed sixty soldiers and captured the rest farc cut off the critical highway connecting the southwestern districts to the rest of the country and not only does farc control the cocainesmuggling routes from peru and ecuador it also has within its territory the putumayo district thick jungle and amazonian rain forest and now also an important area for growing the coca plant a domestic supply of coca was long a dream of the giant cartels and they put millions of dollars of capital into coca plantations in the area but just as their labors were coming to fruition as it were the cartels went out of business leaving behind the chaotic baby bells and some hectares under cultivation and more being planted every day what sinaloa was to the poppy putumayo is to the coca leafthe source the wellspring the headwaters from which the drug traffic flows farc cut it off then reached out to him to offer to negotiate and i will have to do just that adan thinks now as he looks at nora lying beside him she wakes up to see adan looking at her nora smiles kisses him softly and says id like to go for a walk ill come with you they put on robes and step outside manuel is there manuel is always there she thinks adan has had a house built for him on the grounds its a small simple house built in the sinaloan campesino fashion except that adan had the builder put it up in slightly outsized dimensions to allow for manuels stiff dragging leg had special furniture built to make it easier for him to get up and down and a little jacuzzi put in the back to ease the aches in his leg which get worse with age manuel doesnt like to use it because he thinks it costs too much money to heat it so adan has a servant go over every night and turn it on manuel gets up from a bench and follows them his right leg dragging at a discreet distance he follows with his distinctive limp to nora he is almost a caricature an ak slung over his shoulder a double loop of bandoliers over his shoulders like an oldtime bandito a pistol holstered at each hip a huge knife tucked into his belt all hes missing she thinks are the big sombrero and the drooping mustache a maid comes scurrying out with a tray two coffees white and sweet for him black no sugar for her adan thanks the maid and she hurries back into the kitchen she doesnt look at nora afraid that the gringas eyes will bewitch hers the way they did the patrons it is the talk of the kitchenlook into the eyes of this bruja and you will come under her spell it was difficult at first the staffs passive hostility and rauls active disapproval adans brother thought it was fine to have mistresses but not to bring them into the family home she heard the brothers quarrel about it and offered to leave but adan wouldnt hear of it now theyve settled into a quiet domestic routine which includes this morning walk the compound is beautiful nora loves it especially in the morning before the sun reduces all the shapes to silhouettes and bleaches out all the colors they start their stroll in the orchard because adan knows that she loves the acrid smell of the fruit treesorange and lemon and grapefruitand the sweet smell of the mimosas and jacarandas their blossoms dropping from their branches like lavender tears they walk past the neatly ordered flower gardensday lilies calla lilies poppiesand into the rose garden she looks at the flowers glistening with water listens to the rhythmic shoopshoopshoop of the sprinkler system that sprays all the flowers before the sun makes watering an exercise in instant evaporation adan shoos a peacock away from the garden indeed the compound is alive with birds peacocks pheasants guinea fowl one morning when adan was away she went out early on her own and there was a peacock perched on the edge of the central fountain it looked at her and spread its tail and it was a marvelous sight all the colors spread out against the light khaki sand other birds are in the trees an amazing assortment of finchesadan tries in vain to teach her their proper names but she knows them only by colors gold and yellow purple and red the warblers and the lazuli bunting and the incredible western tanager that looks to her like a flying sunset and the hummingbirds special flowers have been planted and sugarwater feeders hung to attract the hummingbirdsannas and costas and blackchinned as adan has tried to distinguish them for her she knows them only as dazzling flights of jeweled colors and that she would miss them very much if they no longer came to visit you want to see the animals he says of course adan is a practical hardworking man and cant quite bring himself to approve of the time and money raul devotes to the menagerie its just another entertainment for raul a sop to his ego that he has an ocelot two kinds of camels a cheetah a pair of lions a leopard two giraffes a herd of rare deer but no white tiger raul sold it to some collector in los angeles and the idiot tried to drive it across the border and got busted had to pay a big fine and the tiger was confiscated it lives in the san diego zoo now the whale he owned became a movie star they busted out the amusement park for every penny it was worth then burned it down and the whale ended up in a series of hit films so the whale did pretty well for itself although adan hasnt seen it in any new movies lately so adan and nora walk through the private zoo in the morning and one of the keepers is always ready with food for nora to feed the giraffes she loves their grace their long necks and the way they walk she gets down from the little platform they use to feed the giraffes picks up her coffee cup and moves ahead of adan another keeper opens a gate to let her into the deer pen and hands her a plastic cup full of food good morning tomas senora the deer crowd around her nuzzling her robe pushing their noses out to get at the food nora and adan have breakfast on the east terrace to catch the sun she has grapefruit and coffee thats allgrapefruit fresh from the orchard picked literally moments before it is served to her and coffee he eats like one of rauls lions an enormous plate of huevos con machaca with chunks of yellowtail and strands of hot chorizo a stack of warm corn tortillas at noras insistence a bowl of fruit and a small bowl of fresh salsathe scent of its tomatoes and cilantro makes her mouth water but she sticks with the slimming grapefruit he notices it has no fat he says the tortilla id eat with it does you have a few pounds to give youre so gallant he smiles and goes back to his newspaper knowing that he wont convince her shes almost as obsessed with her body as he is as soon as he showers and goes into his office for a day of work shell spend the whole morning in the gym he put in a stereo system and a television because she likes noise when she works out and the gym has two of everythingtwo reclining cycles two treadmills two universal weight machines two sets of free weightsalthough she can rarely persuade him to work out with her on alternate days she runs on the long dirt road that winds up to the compound which caused some complaint among the security staff until adan found two sicarios who liked to run then she complained about it said it made her selfconscious to have the men following her but on this issue he put his foot down and there was no argument so when she runs two bodyguards trot behind her at his specific instructions they alternate running and trotting he doesnt want them both out of breath at the same time if it comes to shooting he wants at least one of them to have a steady hand and they have been told if anything happens to her its both your lives her afternoons are long and slow because he works through lunch she dines alone then she may take a short siesta stretching out on the chaise under the umbrella avoiding the sun for the same reason she spends most of the midafternoon indoors reading magazines and books idly watching mexican television basically waiting for adan to show up before having a late dinner now he says i have to go away on a business trip i may be gone awhile where are you going he shakes his head colombia farc wants to negotiate ill come with you its too dangerous she tells him that she understands shell go to san diego while hes gonedo some shopping see a few movies catch up with haley but ill miss you she says ill miss you too lets go back to bed she fucks him with demonic energy grips him with her pussy holds him tightly with her legs and feels him spurt deep inside her strokes his hair as he rests his face on her breasts and says i love you tienes mi alma en tus manos you have my soul in your hands putumayo colombia adan sits in the back of a jeep bouncing slowly over a muddy rutted road cut through the amazonian jungle of southwestern colombia the air around him is hot and fetid and he swats at the flies and mosquitoes that swarm around his head its already been a difficult trip he rejected the idea of simply flying in on one of his s no one can know that adan is going to meet with tirofio the commander of farc anyway the flight would have been too dangerous if the american cia or dea intercepted the flight plan the results would have been disastrous and besides there are things that tirofio wants adan to see en route so adan first boarded a private sportsfishing yacht out of cabo then transferred to an old fishing boat for the long slow trip for a landing on the southern colombian coast at the mouth of the coqueta river this was the most dangerous part of the trip because the coastline is under control of the government and patrolled by the private militias hired by the oil companies to guard their drills and derricks from the fishing boat adan climbed into a small singleengine skiff they went into the river at night guided by the flames shooting out of the refinery towers like the signal fires of hell the river mouth was silty and polluted the air thick and dirty they slipped up the river past the oilcompany properties wrapped in tenfoothigh barbedwire fences with guard towers at the corners it took them two days to get up the river dodging army patrols and private security squads finally hed got into the rain forest and now he gets to make the rest of the trip by jeep their route takes them past the coca fields and for the first time adan sees the origins of the product that has made him millions well sometimes he does other times he sees dead and wilted fields poisoned by the helicopters that spray defoliants the chemicals arent particularthey kill the coca plants but they also kill the beans the tomatoes the vegetables poison the water and the air adan walks through deserted villages that look like museum exhibitsperfect anthropological exhibits of a colombian village except no ones living there theyve fled the defoliants theyve fled the army theyve fled farc theyve fled the war other villages they pass have simply been burned out charred circles on the ground mark where huts once stood the army his guide explains they burn the villages they think are in league with farc and farc burns the villages they think are in line with the army adan thinks they finally reach tirofios camp tirofios camouflageclad guerrillas wear berets and carry aks a surprising number of them are womenadan notices one particularly striking amazon with long black hair flowing from beneath her beret she meets his stare with one of her own one of those whatareyoulookingat glares that makes him turn his glance away everywhere he looks he sees something going onsquads of guerrillas are training others are cleaning weapons doing laundry cooking policing the campand all the activity seems organized the camp itself is large and orderlyneat rows of olivegreen tents are set up under camouflage netting several kitchens have been constructed under thatched ramadas he sees what appear to be a hospital tent and a dispensary they even walk past a tent that houses a library of sorts this is not a gang of bandits on the run adan thinks its a wellorganized force in control of its territory the camouflage netsto disguise against airplane surveillanceare the only concession to a sense of danger the escort leads adan to what looks like a headquarters area the tents are larger with canvas sunroofs attached to create porches underneath which are washbasins and chairs and tables made from roughhewn lumber a moment later the escort comes back out with an older stocky man dressed in olivegreen camouflage and a black beret tirofio has a face like a frog adan thinks fatter than one expects from a guerrilla with deep pouches under his eyes heavy jowls and a wide mouth bent into what seems to be a permanent frown his cheekbones are high and sharp his eyes narrow his arched eyebrows silver nevertheless he looks younger than his almost seventy years he walks toward adan with vigor and strengththere is no shakiness in his short heavy legs tirofio looks at adan for a moment sizing him up then points toward a thatched ramada under which are a table and some chairs he sits down and gestures for adan to do the same without any introduction he says i know that you help to support operation red mist its not political adan says its just business you know that i could hold you for ransom tirofio says or i could have you killed right now and you know adan says that you would outlive me by perhaps a week tirofio nods so what do we have to talk about adan asks tirofio pulls a cigarette from his shirt pocket and offers one to adan when adan shakes his head tirofio shrugs and lights the cigarette then takes a long drag and asks when were you born nineteen fiftythree i started fighting in tirofio says during a period they now call la violencia have you heard of that no tirofio nods i was a woodcutter living in a small village in those days i had no politics left wing right wingit made no difference to the wood i had to cut i was up in the hills one morning cutting wood when the local rightwing militia came into our village rounded up all the men tied their elbows behind their backs and cut their throats left them bleeding to death like pigs in the village square while they raped their wives and daughters do you know why they did that adan shakes his head because the villagers had allowed a leftwing group to dig a well for them tirofio says that morning i came back to find the bodies lying in the dust my neighbors my friends my family i walked back into the hills this time to join the guerrillas why do i tell you this story because you may say you have no politics but the day you see your friends and family lying in the dirt you will have politics adan says theres money and the lack of money and theres power and the lack of power and thats all there is you see tirofio smiles you are half a marxist already what do you want from me guns tirofio has twelve thousand fighters and plans to have thirty thousand more but he has only eight thousand rifles adan barrera has money and airplanes if his planes can fly the cocaine out they can fly the guns back in so if i want to protect my cocaine source adan realizes i will have to do what this old warrior wants i will have to get him guns to protect his territory from the rightwing militias and the army and yes the americans it is a practical necessity but there is also a sweet measure of revenge in it so he says do you have an arrangement in mind tirofio does keep it simple he says one kilo equals one rifle for every rifle adan flies in farc will allow one kilo of cocaine to be sold from its territory at a price discounted to reflect the cost of the weapon thats for a standard riflethe ak is the weapon of choice but the american m or m is also acceptable as farc can get the right ammo from captured army troops or rightwing militias for other weaponsand tirofio desperately covets shoulderheld rocket launchersthey will allow a kilo and a half or even two kilos adan accepts without negotiating somehow he feels it would be unseemly to bargain almost unpatriotic besides this deal will work ifand its a big ifhe can get his hands on enough guns so thats it then adan says we have a deal tirofio shakes his hand one day you will come to see that everything is politics and you will act from your heart instead of your pocket on that day tirofio tells him you will find your soul nora lays out clothes on the bed of their suite at a small hotel in puerto vallartashirts and suits she bought for adan in la jolla you like i like youve hardly looked at them nora says im sorry dont be sorry she says she walks over and puts her arms around him just tell me whats on your mind she listens attentively as adan describes the logistical challenge he faces where to get the quantity of military weapons he needs to fulfill his end of the deal with tirofio its relatively easy to get a few weapons here and therethe united states is basically one big gun martbut the thousands of rifles hell need over the next few months thats something even the american black market cant provide and yet the guns will have to come through america not mexico as crazy as the yanquis are about drugs coming across their border the mexicans are even more fanatic about guns as much as washington complains about narcotics coming across from mexico los pinos answers with complaints about guns coming in from the united states its a constant irritant in the relations between the two countries that the mexicans seem to feel that firearms are more dangerous than dope they dont understand why it is that in america you will get a longer jail sentence for dealing a little marijuana than you will for selling a lot of guns no the mexican government is sensitive about guns as befits a country beset with a history of revolutions even more so now with the insurgency in chiapas as adan tells nora there is no way that he can import such a large amount of weaponry directly into mexico even if he can find a supplier the guns will have to come into the states then be smuggled by reverse route through baja loaded on a and flown to colombia can you even get that many guns nora asks i have to adan says where hong kong the first glimpse of hong kong is always startling first there is the endless flight across the pacific with nothing but hours of blue water beneath then suddenly the island pops up a swatch of emerald green with tall towers glistening in the sun and the dramatic hills behind hes never been there before she has several times and points out landmarks through the window hong kong itself victoria peak kowloon the harbor they check in to the peninsula hotel this is her idea to stay on the mainland in kowloon rather than in one of the modern businessmens hotels on the island itself she likes the colonial charm of the peninsula thinks that hell like it too and besides kowloon is a far more interesting neighborhood especially at night he does like the hotelits oldstyle elegance appeals to him they sit on the old veranda now enclosed in glass with its view of the harbor and the ferry landing and have a full english tea she orders while they wait for their suite to be ready this she says is where the old opium lords used to hang out is that right he asks he has very little knowledge of history even of the drug trade sure she says thats how the brits got hong kong in the first place they took it in the opium war the opium war back in the s nora explains the british went to war against the chinese to force them to allow the opium trade youre kidding no nora says as part of the peace treaty the british opium traders got to sell their product in china and the british crown got hong kong for a colony so theyd have a port to keep the opium safe the army and navy actually protected the dope nothing changes adan says then how do you know all these things i read nora says anyway i thought you might get a kick out of being here he does he sits back sips his darjeeling lathers his scone with clotted cream and jam and feels as if hes one in a continuum of a long tradition when they get to their room he collapses on the bed you dont want to go to sleep she tells him youll never get over the jet lag i cant stay awake he murmurs i can keep you awake oh yeah oh yeah afterward they shower and she tells him that she has the rest of the day and the evening planned if hell put himself in her hands didnt i just do that he asks and did you enjoy it that was me screaming timings critical she says as he shaves hurry up he hurries up this is one of my favorite things in the world to do she says as they walk down to the star ferry landing she buys their tickets and they wait for a few minutes then board the ferry she chooses seats on the port side of the old fireenginered boat with the best view of downtown hong kong as they cross to the island all around them fishing boats speedboats junks and sampans ply the harbor when they land she hustles him out of the terminal whats the rush he asks as she grabs him by the elbow and pushes him ahead youll see youll see come on she leads him down garden road to the base of victoria peak where they hop the tram the tram a funicular rattles up the steep grade its like an amusementpark ride adan says they get to the observatory just before the sun sets this is what she wants him to see they stand on the terrace as the sky grows pink and then red and then fades to darkness and the citys lights come on like a spray of diamonds against a black satin pillow ive never seen anything like this adan says i thought youd like it she answers he turns and kisses her i love you he says i love you too they meet the chinese the next afternoon as arranged a motor launch picks up nora and adan in kowloon harbor and takes them out into the bay where they transfer to a waiting junk on which they make the long trip to silver mine bay on the east side of lantau island here the junk disappears into a fleet of thousands of other junks and sampans on which the boat people live their junk wends its way among the maze of docks wharves and anchored boats before pulling alongside a large sampan the captain sets a plank between his boat and the sampan and nora and adan cross over three men sit at a small table under the archshaped canopy that shelters the middle part of the boat they get up when they see adan and nora come on board two of the men are older one of them nora immediately sees has the squared shoulders and rigid posture of a military officer the other is more casual and a little stoopedhes the businessman the third is a young man who is clearly nervous in the presence of highranking superiors this nora thinks must be the translator the young man introduces himself in english as mr yu and nora translates this into spanish even though adan knows more than enough english to understand basic conversation but it gives her a pretext for being here and shes dressed for the role in a plain gray business suit with a highcollared ivory blouse and some simple jewelry still her beauty is not lost on the officer mr li who bows when introduced or on the businessman mr chen who smiles and all but kisses her hand the introductions having been performed they sit down for tea and business frustrating to adan the first part of the business is seemingly endless small talk and pleasantries made all the more tedious by the double layer of translation from mandarin to english then english to spanish then back again hed like to cut to the chase but nora has warned him that this is a necessary part of doing business in china and that hed be considered a rude and therefore untrustworthy partner if he were to truncate the process so he sits and smiles through the discussion of how beautiful hong kong is then of the beauty of mexico of how wonderful its food of how lovely and intelligent the mexican people are then nora praises the quality of the tea and mr li responds that it is unworthy garbage then nora says that she wishes she could get some garbage like this in tijuana and mr li offers to send her some if she insists despite the fact that it is unworthy of her and so on and so forth until mr lia highranking general in the peoples liberation armygives a barely perceptible nod to young mr yu who then starts in on the real business of the day an arms purchase this goes through the layers of translation even though li speaks more than passable english but the translation process gives him time to think and confer with chen an officer of goscothe guangdong overseas shipping companyand besides it preserves the happy fiction that this stunning woman is a translator and not barreras mistress as is common knowledge in diplomatic circles in mexico city it has taken time to set up this meeting time and delicate overtures and the chinese have done their homework they know that the drug dealer has a relationship with a famous courtesan who is if anything as smart and aggressive a businessperson as is her lover so li listens patiently as yu speaks to the woman and the woman speaks to barrera even though they all know already that he is here to buy guns that they wish to sell otherwise he would not be here at all what kind of armaments rifles aks you call them goat horns thats rather good how many do you wish to purchase a small order at first maybe a couple of thousand li is stunned by the size of the demand and impressed that barreraor maybe it was the womantook the care to phrase it as a small order which gives them much face which i will now lose if i cannot fill such a small order good also how they dangled the at first as bait letting me know that if i can satisfy this gigantic order there will be even more li turns back to adan we dont usually deal in such small numbers we know youre doing us a favor perhaps we could make it worth your while if we were to purchase some heavier armaments as well say some kpg rocket launchers rocket launchers are you expecting a war nora answers the peaceloving chinese people know that one purchases arms not so much to fight a war but to prevent the necessity of fighting one sun tzu wrote invincibility depends on oneself the enemys vulnerability on him nora had put the long hours on the airplane to good use li is impressed of course li says given the modest volume we would not be able to offer the same price as we can for larger orders adan answers given as this order is just the beginning of what we hope will be a long business relationship we were hoping that as a goodfaith gesture you will offer us a price that will allow us to come to you for future needs are you saying you cannot pay full price no im saying i wont pay full price adans done his homework too knows that the pla is as much a business as it is a national defense force and that they are under great pressure from beijing to produce revenue they need this deal as much as i do he thinks maybe more and the size of the order is nothing to sneeze at nothing at all so you are going to give me my price general especially if of course adan adds we would pay in american dollars cash because the pla is not only under pressure to produce revenue its under pressure to produce foreign currency and fast and they dont want any unstable mexican pesos especially in the form of paper they want the long yanqui green adan likes the cycle american dollars to china for guns guns to colombia for cocaine cocaine to the united states for american dollars works for me works for the chinese too they spend the next three hours haggling over the detailsprices delivery dates the general wants this deal so does the businessman so does beijing gosco is not only building facilities in san pedro and long beach its also building them in panama and buying up huge tracts of land along the canal which not only splits the american fleet in half but also sits astride the two emerging leftwing insurgencies in central americathe farc war in colombia and the burgeoning zapatista insurrection in southern mexico keep the americans busy in their own hemisphere for a change let them become more concerned about the straits of panama than the straits of socalled taiwan no this arrangement with the barrera cartel can only increase chinese influence in the americans backyard keep them busy putting out communist brushfires and also force them to spend resources on their war on drugs a bottle of wine is procured and a toast made to friendship wan swei nora says ten thousand years in six weeks time a shipment of two thousand aks and six dozen grenade launchers with sufficient ammunition will be shipped from guangzhou on a gosco freighter san diego a week after returning from hong kong nora crosses the border at tecate then takes the long backcountry drive through the desert and into san diego she checks into the valencia hotel and gets a suite with a view of la jolla cove and the ocean haley meets her and they have dinner at top of the cove business is good haley tells her nora goes to bed early and gets up early she changes into sweats and takes a long jog around la jolla cove on the path that skirts the cliffs overlooking the ocean she comes back tired and sweaty orders her grapefruit and black coffee from room service and showers while she waits for her breakfast to be delivered then she dresses and goes shopping in la jolla village all the trendy shops are within walking distance and she has a handful of bags before she hits her favorite boutique where she selects three dresses and takes them into the changing room a few minutes later she comes out with two of the dresses lays them on the counter and says ill take these ive left the red one in the dressing room ill hang it up the owner says nora thanks her smiles and walks back out into the gorgeously sunny la jolla afternoon she decides on french cuisine for lunch and has no trouble getting a table at the brasserie she kills the rest of the afternoon with a movie and a long nap she gets up orders some consomme for dinner then puts on one of her new black dresses and does her hair and makeup art keller parks three blocks away from the white house and walks the rest of the way hes lonely he has his work and little else cassie is eighteen now soon to graduate from parkman michael is sixteen a freshman at the bishops school art goes to cassies volleyball matches and michaels swim meets and he takes the kids out afterward if they dont already have plans with their friends they have awkward onceamonth weekends at his downtown condohe makes extravagant efforts to entertain them but they mostly just hang around the complex pool with the other visitation daddies and their kids and his own kids increasingly resent the mandated visits which interfere with their own social lives art understands and usually lets them cancel with a fakecheery next time he doesnt date hes had a few shortterm relationships with a couple of divorced womenconvenience fucks scheduled between the demands of busy careers and the single parenthood of teenage kidsbut they were more sad than satisfying and pretty soon he quit trying so most nights he keeps company with the dead theyre never too busy and theres no lack of them ernie hidalgo pilar talavera and her two kids juan parada all collateral casualties in arts private war with the barreras they visit him at night they chat with him they ask him if it was worth it at least for now the answer is no arts losing the war the barrera cartel now makes a profit of approximately million a week fully one half of the cocaine and a third of the heroin that hits american streets comes through the baja cartel virtually all the methamphetamine west of the mississippi originates with barrera adans power is unchallenged in mexico hes put his uncles federacion together again and he is the undisputed patron none of the other cartels can touch his influence furthermore barrera has established his own cocaine supply in colombia hes independent of cali or medellin the barrera drug operation is selfsustaining from the coca plant to the corner from the poppy flower to the shooting gallery from the sinsemilla seed to the brick that hits the streets from the base ephedrine to the rock of crystal meth the baja cartel is a vertically integrated polydrug operation and none of the above takes into account his legitimate businesses barrera money is heavily invested in the maquiladoras along the border in real estate throughout mexicoespecially in the resort towns of puerto vallarta and cabo san lucasand the southwest united states and in banking including several banks and credit unions in the states the cartels financial mechanisms are fully enmeshed with those of mexicos wealthiest and most powerful business concerns now art reaches the front door of the white house and rings the bell haley saxon comes into the foyer to meet him smiles professionally and hands him the key to a room upstairs noras sitting on the bed she looks stunning in her black dress are you okay he asks the red dress was her signal that she had to see him personally for over two years now shes been leaving him messages in dead drops all over the city it was nora who gave him the details of the orejuela brothers meeting with adan the info that allowed the dea to arrest them as they flew back to colombia nora who has given him a rundown on the new organization of the federacion nora who has provided him with hundreds of pieces of intelligence from which hes been able to glean a thousand more thanks mostly to her he has an organizational chart of the barrera organization in baja and in california delivery routes safe houses couriers when drugs were coming in money going out who killed whom and why shes risked her life to bring him this information on her shopping trips to san diego and los angeles on her visits to spas on any trip that she takes outside of mexico and without adan the method they use is surprisingly simple the fact is that the drug cartels have a bigger budget and therefore better technology than art does and they dont have the constitutional restrictions so the only way to beat the barreras superiority in hightech is to go lowtech nora simply sits in her hotel room writes down her information and mails it to art at a post office box that he established under a false name no cell phones no internet just the good ol us mail unless there was an emergency then she would leave the red dress in the changing room the boutique owner was looking at a possession rap that could have sent her to prison for five years instead she agreed to do this favor for the border lord im fine nora says but shes angry no angry doesnt describe it she thinks as she looks at art keller you said that with my help you would take adan down quickly but its been two and a half years two and a half years of pretending to love adan barrera of taking a man i loathe inside me feeling him in my mouth my pussy my ass and pretending to love it pretending to love this monster who killed the man i really loved and then guiding him molding him helping him to get the power to commit more of his filth you dont know what its likehow could youto wake up in the morning with that beside you to crawl between his legs to open yours to scream your phony orgasms to smile and laugh and share talk and meals all the time living a nightmare waiting for you to act and so far what have you done besides the orejuela arrest nothing hes been sitting on this information for two and a half years waiting for the right moment to act now art says this is too risky i can trust haley she says i want you to take some action now adans still untouchable i dont want to she tells him about adans deal with farc and the chinese art looks at her with awe he knew she was smarthes been tracking her as shes helped to steer adan through the shoalsbut he didnt know that she was this perceptive shes thought it through damn right i have nora thinks shes been reading men all her life she sees the change come over his face his eyes are lit with excitement every man has his own turnon shes seen them all and now she sees kellers revenge same as mine because adan has made a serious mistake hes doing the one thing that could bring him down and we both know it who else knows about the arms shipment he asks adan raul and fabian martinez she says and me now you art shakes his head if i act on this theyll know it was you you cant go back im going back nora says we know san pedro and gosco but we dont know which ship which pier and even if you can get that information art thinks making the bust is the same as killing you when hes about to leave she asks do you want to fuck me art for the sake of realism of course his loneliness is palpable she thinks so easy to touch she opens her legs ever so slightly he hesitates its a small measure of revenge for leaving her asleep for so long but it feels good and she says i was joking art he gets it payback he knows that leaving an undercover in place for as long as he has is unconscionable six months is a long time a year is the max they just cant last that longtheir nerves unravel they get burned the information they provide gets tracked back to them the clock just runs out and nora hayden isnt a professional strictly speaking she isnt even an undercover but a confidential informant it doesnt mattershes been under deep cover and shes been under for too long but i couldnt have used any of the information she gave me in mexico because barrera is under mexican protection and i couldnt have used any of her intelligence inside the states because it might have compromised her before we could take adan down once and for all the frustration has been awful nora has given him enough intelligence to virtually destroy the barrera organization in one overnight coup and he hasnt been able to use it all he could do was wait and hope that the lord of the skies flew too close to the sun and now he has its time to pull the trigger on him and time to get nora out i could just arrest her now he thinks god knows there are enough pretexts arrest her compromise her and then she could never go back get her a new identity and a new life but he doesnt because he still needs her close to adan for just a little while longer he knows hes stretching her string to the breaking point but he lets her walk out of the room i need proof john hobbs says solid tangible evidence to show the mexican government before he can even think about prodding them to launch an offensive against adan barrera i have a source art says hobbs nodsyes go on art answers i cant reveal it hobbs smiles arent you the same man who rather famously created a source that didnt actually exist and now keller with his wellknown barrera obsession comes forward with a story about adan barrera making a deal with farc to import chinese arms in exchange for cocaine something that would get the cia solidly on board in his war against the barreras its a bit too convenient art gets that im the boy who cried wolf what kind of proof he asks the arms shipment would do nicely for example but thats the dilemma art thinks busting the arms shipment would expose exactly what im trying to protect if i could get hobbs to pressure mexico city into launching a preemptive strike against barrera now thered be no need to put nora in jeopardy but to get them to launch the strike i have to produce the arms shipment and the only person who can get me that is nora but if she does it shes probably dead come on john he says you could mask this from the chinese side intercepts of maritime radio signals internet traffic satellite intelligencejust say you have a source in beijing you want me to compromise valuable sources in asia to protect some drug dealer that you flipped please but he is tempted the zapatistas in chiapas are more active than ever their ranks reportedly swelled by recent refugees from neighboring guatemala so the potential exists there for a communist insurgency that could spread regionally and a new leftwing insurgent group the epr the ejercito popular revolucionario the popular revolutionary army emerged back in june at a memorial service for peasants in guerrero killed by rightwing militias then just weeks ago epr launched simultaneous attacks against police posts in guerrero tabasco puebla and mexico itself killing sixteen police officers and wounding another twentythree the vietcong started smaller than that hobbs thinks he offered his mexican intelligence counterparts assistance against the epr but the mexicans ever sensitive about yanqui neoimperialist interference declined stupidly hobbs thinks because it takes only a quick glimpse at the map to see that the communist insurgency is spreading north from chiapas fueled by the economic devastation of the peso crisis and the dislocations caused by nafta implementation mexico is teetering on the brink of revolution and everyone but the ostriches in state know it even defense acknowledges the possibilityhobbs has just finished reading the topsecret contingency plans for a us invasion of mexico in the event of a total social and economic breakdown god one castro in cuba is enoughcan you imagine a comandante zero ruling from los pinos a marxist government sharing a twothousandmile border with the united states and every state along that border soon to have a hispanic majority but god wouldnt the mexicans hemorrhage cats if they ever got wind of that report no the mexicans can accept american military aide only through the veil of the war on drugs not unlike the american congress hobbs thinks the vietnam syndrome prevents congress from authorizing a penny to wage covert wars against communists but theyll always open the vault to fight the drug war so you dont go to capitol hill to tell them youre helping your allies and neighbors defend themselves against marxist guerrillas no you send your supporters in the dea to ask for money to keep drugs out of the hands of americas young people so congress would never authorize nor would the mexicans openly accept the offer of seventyfive huey helicopters and a dozen c airplanes to fight the zapatistas and epr but congress has funded the same package to help the mexicans suppress the drug traffickers and the equipment will be quietly transferred to the mexican army for use in chiapas and guerrero and now you have the patron of the federacion providing weapons to communist insurgents in colombia that would get the mexicans solidly on board art plays his last card so youre just going to let a shipment of arms go through to communist insurgents in colombia not to mention the increase of chinese influence in panama no hobbs says calmly you are screw you john art says if this goes down the cia gets nothing i dont share intel assets credit nothing give me the source arthur art stares at him then get me the guns hobbs says but i cant art thinks not until nora tells me where they are mexico theres a meeting going on at rancho las bardas too between adan raul and fabian and nora adan insisted that she be included the fact is that they wouldnt have the deal in place without her it doesnt sit well with raul since when do our baturras know our business he asks fabian she should stay in the bedroom where she belongs let her open her legs not her mouth fabian chuckles hed like to open la gueras legs and her mouth shes the most delectable piece of chocho hes ever seen youre wasting yourself with a wimp like adan he thinks come to me tragona ill make you scream nora sees the look on his face and thinks try it asshole adan would have you skinned alive and roasted over a slow fire and id bring the marshmallows the chinese want cash on delivery and will accept no other form of payment not a wire transfer or a series of laundered payments through shell companies they insist that the payment be absolutely untraceable and the only way to do that is a handtohand cash transferral and they want nora to make it its a guarantee for them adan sending his beloved mistress absolutely not adan and raul say simultaneously albeit for completely different reasons you first nora says to raul you and adan havent exactly kept your relationship under wraps raul says the dea probably has more photographs of you than they do of me if you are arrested you have a lot of information inside that pretty head and motivation to give it up what would they arrest me for sleeping with your brother nora asks she turns to adan your turn its too dangerous he says if anything went wrong youd be looking at life in prison then lets make sure nothing goes wrong she says she lays out her casei go back and forth across the border all the time im an american citizen with an address in san diego im an attractive blonde and can flirt my way through any checkpoint and most important its what the chinese want why raul asks suddenly why would you take the risk because she says smiling in return youll make me rich she waits as her answer just hangs there finally adan says i want the best chopartist in baja maximum security at both sides of the border fabian get our best people in california to make the actual pickup i want you there personally if anything happens to her i hold you both responsible he gets up and walks out nora just sits and smiles raul follows adan out into the garden what are you thinking about hermano he asks whats to stop her from turning on us whats to stop her from just taking the money and never looking back shes a whore for gods sake adan whirls around and grabs him by the front of his shirt youre my brother and i love you raul but if you ever talk about her that way again well split the pasador and go our separate ways now please just do your job as nora waits in the line at the san ysidro border crossing bajas best chopartist sits in a chair on the tenth floor of an apartment building overlooking the checkpoint hes a little nervous because hes been asked to guarantee his workif the car gets busted going across the border raul barrera is going to put a bullet in the back of his head just so you have a rooting interest raul said he doesnt know where the car is going he doesnt know whos taking it there but he does know that its unusual for cash to be heading north across the border instead of coming south hes built stashholds all over the nondescript toyota camry and that little baby is loaded down with millions of american dollars he only hopes that the border patrol doesnt decide to weigh the car so does nora shes not too concerned about a visual search or even dogs because the pooches have been trained to sniff for drugs not cash even so the bundles of hundreddollar bills have been soaked in lemon juice to neutralize any smell and the car itself is freshits never been used to carry dope so there cant be any residual scent there is residue of sand however carefully left on the driversside floor and in the backseat with some damp towels a hooded sweatshirt and a pair of old flipflops the wait at the border today is over an hour and a half which is a pain in the ass but adan insisted that she cross on a late sunday afternoon when the crossing is the busiest jammed up with thousands of americans returning home from weekends at the cheap resorts in ensenada and rosarita so she has ample time to work her way over into the third lane where the border patrol agent coming on duty is on the barrera payroll it hasnt been left to chance though raul stands at the window of the apartment and peers out through binoculars there are three apartment towers overlooking the border from the mexican side and the barreras own all three now raul watches his paid border patrol agent take his position and look up toward the apartment tower raul punches digits into his pager noras pager beeps and she looks to see the numbers on the little display screenthe narcocode for all clear she nods to the driver in the ford explorer in front of her the man is looking into his rearview mirror and now he turns right into the third lane setting a pick for nora to turn behind him the jeep cherokee behind her does the same thing making space for her horns honk middle fingers are raised but nora is going to get into that third lane now all she has to do is wait and fend off the squadrons of vendors who walk up and down the line of cars hawking sombreros milagros styrofoam jigsawpuzzle maps of mexico sodas tacos burritos tshirts baseball caps just about anything you can think of to the bored people waiting to cross the border wait is one long narrow openair marketplace and she buys a cheap gaudy sombrero a poncho and a my girlfriend went to tijuana and all i got was this lousy tshirt to fortify her tourist profile and also because she always feels bad for the street vendors especially the kids shes three cars away from the checkpoint when raul looks through his binocs and yells fuck the chopartist jumps up from his chair what theyre switching look raul peers down a border patrol supervisor is rotating the agents into different lines its a common practice but the timing is awfully close to be just coincidence do they know something the chopartist asks should we abort too late raul answers she cant turn around sweat pops on the chopartists forehead nora sees the agent being changed out and thinks please god no not now when im so close she feels her heart start to race and makes a deliberate effort to breathe deeply and slow it down border agents are trained to look for signs of anxiety she tells herself and you want to be just one more blond chick coming back from a hardpartying weekend in mexico the ford explorer pulls up to the checkpoint its chockfullochicanos as fabian had put it again part of the plan the agent will spend a lot of time checking this car out and be more likely to give her just a cursory look sure enough the agent is asking a lot of questions walking around the explorer looking in the windows checking ids the golden retriever comes out and scurries around the vehicle sniffing happily and wagging its tail its good that its taking time nora thinks its part of the plan but its also excruciating finally the explorer clears the checkpoint and nora pulls up she pushes her sunglasses up on her forehead to give the agent the full benefit of her blue eyes but she doesnt say hello or start the conversationthe agents look for people who are overly friendly or eager id the agent asks she shows him her california drivers license but has her passport in plain sight in the passenger seat the agent notices what were you doing in mexico ms hayden i came down for the weekend she says you know some sun the beach a few margaritas where did you stay at the hotel rosarita she has receipts matching her visa card in her purse the agent nods do they know you took their towels oops are you bringing anything back into the country just this stuff she says the agent looks at the tourist shit she bought in line this is the critical moment hes going to wave her through or search the car a little more or pull her off into the inspection lane options one and two are acceptable but option three could be a disaster and rauls holding his breath as he watches the agent lean through the window and look into the backseat nora just smiles taps her foot and hums along with the classicrock station on the radio the agent leans back out drugs what the agent smiles welcome back ms hayden shes through raul says the chopartist says he needs to take a piss dont get too relaxed raul yells to him she still has to get through san onofre the phone rings on art kellers desk keller shes in art stays on the line to get the make of the car a description and the licenseplate number then he phones the border patrol station at san onofre adan gets a similar call in his office shes through raul says adan feels better but hes still worried she still has to get through the checkpoint at san onofre and thats his fearthe san onofre checkpoint sits on an empty stretch of route just north of the marine base at pendleton and the area is rife with electronic surveillance and radio jammers if the dea were going to grab her they would grab her there far from the barrera lookout towers or any possible help in tijuana its entirely possible that nora is driving straight into an ambush at san onofre nora drives north on the the major northsouth arterial that runs the length of california like a spine she drives past downtown san diego past the airport and seaworld past the big mormon temple that looks like its made from spun sugar and would melt in the rain she drives past the exit to la jolla past the racetrack at del mar and speeds past downtown oceanside before she finally pulls over at a rest stop just south of the marine base at camp pendleton she gets out and locks the car she cant see the barrera sicarios who are parked nearby but she knows theyre in one car or another or maybe several to guard her vehicle while she uses the bathroom its highly doubtful that anyone is going to steal a used toyota camry but nobodys taking the chance with several million dollars in cash in the car she uses the toilet then goes to a sink to wash her hands and freshens her makeup the cleaning lady waits patiently while she finishes nora smiles thanks her and gives her a dollar bill before going back out she buys a diet pepsi from a vending machine gets back in the car and starts driving north she loves this stretch of highway that runs through the marine base because once you get past the barracks its mostly empty just the range of hills to the east and to the west nothing but the lanes of southbound traffic and then blue pacific shes been through the san onofre checkpoint hundreds of timesmost southern californians have if they make the trip from san diego up to orange county its always been kind of a joke she thinks as the traffic in front of her slows a border checkpoint seventy miles from the border but the fact is that many illegals are on their way to the los angeles metro area and most of them use the so maybe it makes sense what usually happens is that you get to the checkpoint tap your brakes and if youre white the border patrol agent waves you through with a bored sweep of the hand thats what usually happens she thinks as she stops about a dozen cars before the checkpoint and thats what shes expecting except this time the border patrol guy signals her to stop art looks at his watchagain it should be going down now he knows when she crossed the border when she hit the rest stop if she didnt turn around somewhere if she didnt get hinky and change her mind if if if adan paces the office he also has a timetable in mind and nora should be calling in soon she wouldnt risk a call near the surveillance at pendleton and theres nothing for her to say until shes through san onofre but she should be through by now she should be in san clemente she should be the agent signals for her to roll down the window another agent walks over to the passenger side she rolls that window down too then looks at the agent beside her gives him her best beautiful look and asks is there something wrong do you have id on you sure she digs through her handbag for her wallet then holds the wallet open for the agent to see her license as she does the agent on the passenger side pushes the tracking device between the headrest and the seat as he leans in to examine the back the first agent takes a long time looking at the license then says sorry for the inconvenience maam and waves her through art grabs the phone before the first ring stops done he hangs up and blows out a long breath of relief he has the aerial surveillance in place now a mix of militaryaircraft traffic helicopters and private planes and can track her all the way and when she meets with the chinese well be there nora waits until shes in san clemente before she picks up the cell phone and punches in the number in tijuana when fabian answers she says im through and hangs up now its just a matter of driving north until the chinese give them a time and location for the meeting so thats what she does she just drives adan gets the call from raul that nora is through the san onofre checkpoint and goes outside for a walk now its just a matter of waiting yeah he thinks just waiting fabian has trucks standing by in los angeles waiting to take delivery of the arms and drive them to the border at an isolated spot in the desert where theyll be transferred to different trucks driven to several different airstrips and then flown to colombia its all in placebut first nora has to make that first allimportant transaction with the chinese and before she can do that the chinese have to tell them where and when art also has men standing bysquadrons of heavily armed dea agents federal marshals fbiholed up in san pedro waiting for the word the san pedro harbor is huge and the gosco facilities there are enormousrow after row of cargo warehouses so they have to know specifically which one to hit its a tricky operation because they have to lay off until the deal is in place but then get in there quickly arts in a helicopter now watching an electronic map of orange county and a red blinking light that represents nora he debates with himself put a ground unit on her now or wait he decides to wait as she takes the north exit off the and heads for san pedro no surprises there but he is surprised when the blinking red light gets off the at macarthur boulevard in irvine and turns west what the fuck is she doing art says out loud he tells the pilot pull in on her the pilot shakes his head cant airtraffic control then art gets what the fuck shes doing goddamnit he calls for ground units to hustle to john wayne airport but the map tells him that there are five potential exits out of the airport and hell be lucky to cover even one of them she gets off macarthur at the airport exit and pulls in to the parking structure arts helicopter hovers over the north of the airport its his best hope that she pulled into the airport to block audio surveillance is getting the location in san pedro and will shortly pull back onto the highway or art thinks shes taking millions of dollars in cash and getting on an airplane he watches the screen but the blinking red light is just gone nora gets on the cell phone im here she says raul gives her an address in nearby costa mesa about two miles away she pulls out of the structure and turns west on macarthur away from the then turns onto bear street into the nondescript flat gridiron of costa mesa she finds it a small garage on a street full of small warehouses a man with a mac machine pistol slung over his arm opens the door and she pulls in the door closes behind her and then its like the formula race she once went to with a clienta crew of men instantly jump the car with power tools take it apart and put the money into halliburton briefcases and then into the trunk of a black lexus this she thinks would be the moment for a ripoff but none of these men are even tempted theyre all illegals with family back in baja and they know that barrera sicarios are parked in front of their homes with orders to kill everyone inside if the money and the courier dont leave that garage quickly and safely nora watches them work with the smooth silent efficiency of a firstclass pit crew the only sound is the whine of power drills and it takes only thirteen minutes to disassemble the car and reload the money in the lexus the man with the machine pistol hands her a new cell phone she calls raul done give me a color blue she says any other color would mean that shes being held against her will go she gets into the lexus the garage door opens and she pulls out gets back on bear and ten minutes later shes back on the heading toward san pedro she drives right under a traffic helicopter circling the area art stares at the empty screen nora hayden he finally admits to himself is in the wind she knows it she gets it shes driving north into god knows what and now shes doing it alone which is nothing new for noraexcept for her too few years with parada shes been doing it alone her whole life but she doesnt know how shes supposed to get this done now or whats going to happen the easiest thing in the world would be to just take the money and keep going but that wont get her what she wants its nighttime as she passes through carson its naturalgas drills burning like signal towers in some sort of industrial version of hell working the plan she gets off this time at the lax exit and calls in they have the place for the meet an aarco gas station heading west on the exit on the way to san pedro give me a color blue go for a second she thinks about just using the cell and calling keller on the hotline number he gave her but then the number would show up on phone records and besides the car might be bugged so she just drives to the gas station and pulls up by the pump a car flashes its lights she pulls over by a row of phone booths god does anyone use pay phones anymore she wonders and sits there while an asian man with a small briefcase in his hand gets out of the other car and walks over to the passenger side of her car she unlocks the door and he gets in hes a young man probably midtwenties dressed in the black suit white shirt and black tie that seem to be a uniform for young asian businessmen these days im mr lee he says yeah im ms smith im sorry lee says but please turn around and put your hands on the door she does it and he frisks her for wires then he opens the briefcase takes out a small electronic sweeper and checks the car for bugs satisfied its clean he says you will forgive me i hope no problem lets drive where to ill tell you as we go he gives her directions and they head for the harbor art has the gosco harbor facility under surveillance its his last best shot a dea agent sits high atop a gigantic crane his powerful nightvision glasses trained on the gosco entrance and he sees the black lexus coming down the street vehicle approaching can you id the driver art asks negative tinted windows it could be anyone art thinks it could be nora it could be a gosco manager coming to check on a warehouse it could be a john finding a dark spot for a quick blow job stay on it he doesnt want to be on the horn too much if this is really going down the narcos will have audio sweepers going and even though his transmissions are encrypted the sad fact is that the narcos have a bigger budget and better technology so now he sits in the back of a hippie van three miles from the harbor and waits its all he can do nora drives down a street between two rows of gosco warehouses that run perpendicular to their two loading wharves two huge gosco freighters are pulled up at the wharves sparks fly from welders doing repairs on the ships and forklifts scurry back and forth between the wharf and the warehouses she keeps driving until theyre in a quieter area a warehouse door opens and lee directs her inside i lost them the agent says to art they went into a warehouse which goddamn warehouse could be one of three the agent answers d or art consults a plan of the gosco facility he can have teams at the location inside ten minutes and cut the group of warehouses off from two sides he switches channels and says all units prepare to move in five mr lee is polite he gets out comes around and opens the car door for nora she gets out and looks around her if theres a huge shipment of weapons in here its cleverly disguised as a whole bunch of empty shelves and a black lexus identical to the one she drove in she looks at lee and raises her eyebrows do you have the money he asks she opens the trunk then the briefcases lee flips through the stacks of used bills then closes everything up again your turn nora says well wait he says for what to see if the police arrive this wasnt part of the plan nora says it wasnt part of your plan lee says they stare at each other for a few long moments this she says is really boring she gets back in the car and sits down thinking please god dont let keller come blasting through that door shag wallaces voice comes across the radio on your signal boss art tightens his kevlar vest flips the safety of his m off takes a deep breath and says go roger that hold he yells into the mike it comes from his gutsomethings wrong here somethings hinky theyve been too careful too cute or maybe im just getting chicken in my old age but he says stand down fifteen minutes twenty half an hour nora reaches for her phone what are you doing lee asks calling my people nora says theyre going to be wondering what the hell happened to me he hands her his own phone use this one why security she shrugs and takes the phone where are we dont send them here lee says why not he has a little selfsatisfied smile on his face noras seen it on men a thousand times usually after one of her spectacular fake orgasms the merchandise isnt here where is it now that no police have arrived at this location he feels its safe to tell her the real one besides he has adan barreras mistress as insurance long beach the new gosco facility at long beach harbor he tells her pier row d building she calls raul and gives him the information when she hangs up she says to lee we have to call our boss and get the okay for this change of plans art keller is sweating bricks if that was nora who went into the warehouse shes been there for over half an hour and nothings happened no one has gone in or come out no trucks have arrived somethings gone wrong all units stand by he says were going on my signal then his cell phone rings lee listens anxiously as nora tells adan barrera all about how they took her to an empty building and put a gun to her head as a test and how the guns are really at long beach pier row d building pier row d building art keller says you got it nora says she hangs up and hands the phone back to lee lets get going she says he shakes his head were staying here i dont understand she understands when he takes a from beneath his black suit jacket and lays it on his lap when the transaction is safely completed he says i will take the car with the money and you will take the other car and drive away but if something unfortunate should occur long beach art thinks fucking long beach we have to get down there before barreras trucks can get there and load up he gets on the radio and tells his people to scramble we have to move this goddamn army down to long beach and do it in a hurry fabian martinez is thinking pretty much the same thing he has a freaking convoy on the road now three semis painted as calexico produce company that he had ready to go to san pedro and now they have to roll down the to freaking long beach pain in the ass he sits in the passenger seat of the lead truck with a mac under his coat just in case two of his best men are in a scout car about half a mile ahead theyll go in first and if they spot anything that shouldnt be there theyll send him a beeper message to get the fuck out its cold for a southern california night even in march and he pulls his collar up around his neck and tells the driver to turn on the fucking heat nora sits in the front seat of the lexus and waits do you mind if i turn on the radio she asks lee doesnt mind racing down to long beach art reformulates his plan what goddamn plan he thinks thats the problem he had a tactical plan for the raid in san pedro but now its just going to be a makeitupasyougo cavalry charge into god knows what and that makes him very goddamn nervous the best thing to do would be to let the barrera trucks make the pickup and hit them on the road but he has to make sure that nora is all right so the bust has to be at the warehouse and now it just has to be smashandgrab go in fast go in hard all the agents have been briefedthey all know that the border lord wants la guera bad and he wants her alive because she can be pressured into giving up her boyfriend they know that art thinks but will they remember it in the chaos of a raid especially if the barrera people decide to shoot it out it has all the potential for a majorleague goat fuck and nora could end up dead he radios back to shag again to make sure he understands fabians scout cars dont see anything they dont like and they give him the signal its one in the morning and the long beach complex is busy with trucks loading freight which is very good fabian thinks whats three more he finds pier then row d then building an enormous quonset hut like all the rest he hops out of the truck and knocks on the office door he stands outside stamping his feet as two chinese men inspect his trucksthe cabs and the trailers then the big metal door of the building slides open fabian climbs back into the cab of the lead truck and leads them in nora startles when lees cell phone rings she sees lees hand tighten on the pistol grip as he answers it she sucks in a deep breath and readies herself to make a grab at his wrist as he hangs up turns to her and says your people are there everythings okay good she says lets get going he shakes his head not yet fabian stands talking with the chinese guy in charge you got your money yes where is she in another location the man says as soon as this transaction is safely concluded she will rejoin you fabian doesnt like it not because he cares about nora haydenother than wanting to fuck her in half he wouldnt care if she did get smackedbut because adan does care and is holding him responsible for noras safety and these slants are holding her hostage not good at all so he says get her on the line lee hands nora the phone they want to speak to you nora takes the phone give me a color fabian says red fabian gives the chinese guy back his phone then takes his mac from his jacket and sticks it in the guys face call your boy back he says tell him its cool guns appear from everywhere all fabians men pull and all the chinese guys except most of the chinese are up in catwalks aiming down so they have a tactical advantage its your basic stalemate which disappears when the office door blows in its just chaos arts the first through the door with a phalanx of agents behind him he throws the switch and the metal cargo door opens again to reveal another platoon of dea fbi and atf a whole lethal alphabet soup with automatic rifles shotguns kevlar vests and bulletresistant visors nightlights shining from the tops of their helmets the agents are yelling at the top of their lungs freeze dea get down get down fbi drop your weapons weapons clatter on the metal catwalks and the concrete floor fabian thinks about trying to shoot it out but quickly sees that its futile lets his mac slide to the floor and puts his hands up art looks around for nora its hard to spot anything in the chaos with men running other men hitting the floor agents grabbing people and throwing them down he looks for her blond hair and doesnt see it so he screams into his radio mike go hoping shag can hear him over the cacophony praying its not too late beside him a chinese guy is yelling into a cell phone art grabs him by the collar throws him down and kicks the phone from his hand lee hears his boss screaming over the phone nora sees his eyes widen and then the gun comes up pointed straight at her forehead she screams over the dull thump of an explosion blood and bone spray against the passenger window lees body slumps back into the seat and nora turns to see the swat sniper standing in the doorway the door hanging crooked off its blown hinges shes still screaming as shag wallace slowly approaches the car opens her door and gently takes her by the elbow its all right hes saying youre all right come on now we have to get you out of here he takes her out of the car walks her outside and puts her in the front seat of his own car wait here for a minute shag goes back into the warehouse gets into the front seat of the lexus and takes the from lees dead hand then he holds it a few inches away from lees forehead aims it at the entry wounds and pulls the trigger he wipes the gun and goes out to his car sits next to nora and tells her to hold the for a second numb with shock she does what he says then he takes the gun back and says heres your story things went sick and wrong he was going to shoot you you grabbed the gun you fought you won do you understand that she nods she thinks she understands shes not sure her hands wont stop shaking are you okay shag asks look its all right if youre not if you want to stop this right now just say the word well understand have they arrested adan she asks not yet shag answers she shakes her head art kneels on fabians neck and attaches the plastic telephone ties to his wrists it was that cunt wasnt it fabian asks art kneels down a little harder as he recites fabians rights fucking right im going to want a lawyer fabian says art hauls him to his feet shoves him into one of the dea vans and walks over to inspect the two cargo containerstwenty feet long eight feet wide and eight feet highfilled with crates his men take them out and bust them open chinesemade akstwo thousand of themspill out of the boxes in pieces barrels magazines stocks other tools include two dozen chinese kpg rocket launchers which are considered especially valuable because they are handheld two thousand rifles equals two thousand kilos of cocaine art thinks god only knows how many kilos you get passed through for the rocket launchers which are capable of shooting down helicopters next they find six truckloads of m rifles converted ms the standard army carbine the difference between the original and the m is that the latter can be flipped to full automatic by a single switch he also finds a few laws the american version of the kpg not as effective against choppers but very good against armored vehicles all of them perfect weapons for a guerrilla war and worth thousands of kilos of coke its the largest arms bust in history but hes not done all of this is worthless if it doesnt lead to the demise of adan barrera whatever the cost if adan slips the noose the only chance of finding him again is through nora you have a plan in place to extract her but plans have a way of going wrong she wanted to go back in he tells himself you gave her the option of calling it quits and she made up her own mind shes an adult she can make her own choices yeah keep telling yourself that nora drives the new lexus down the highway to the first exit pulls into a gas station goes into the ladies room and throws up when her stomach is empty she gets back in the car and drives to the santa ana train station dumps the car in the parking lot goes inside to a phone booth shuts the door and calls adan the crying is no problem the tears come easily as she chokes back sobs and says something went wrong i dont know he was going to kill me i come back the police are probably looking for me its too soon he says dump the car get on the train go to san ysidro walk across the pedestrian bridge adan im scared its okay he says go to the city place wait there ill be in touch she knows what he means its a code they worked out a long time ago for just such an emergency as this the city place is a condo they keep in colonia hipodromo in tijuana i love you she says i love you too she gets on the next southbound train to san diego plans have a way of going wrong in this case the mechanics back in costa mesa are working on the trickedout little toyota camry to get it ready for another run and they find something interesting jammed between the seat and the headrest on the passenger side some sort of electronic device the crew chief makes a phone call nora gets off the train in san diego and grabs the trolley down to san ysidro gets off climbs the steps to the pedestrian bridge and walks across the border chapter twelve slipping into darkness slippin into darkness when i heard my mother say you been slippin into darkness oh oh oh pretty soon youre going to pay warslippin into darkness tijuana nora haydens in the wind thats the simple brutal truth that arts trying to deal with ernie hidalgo all over again source chupar redux these are the scariest times in the life of any person who handles undercovers the missed checkin the nonsignal the silence its the silence that will make your stomach churn your teeth grind your jaws clench the silence that will slowly extinguish the low flame of false hope the dead silence as you launch one radar ping after another into the dark into the depth and then wait for that returning ping and wait and wait and get only silence she was supposed to have gone to the condo in colonia hipodromo to meet adan but she never showed up and neither did the lord of the skies antonio ramos did in forcetwo platoons of his special troopers in armored cars sealed off the entire block and hit the condo like it wasnormandybeach only it was empty no adan barrera no nora now ramos is tearing baja to pieces looking for the barrera brothers hes been waiting for this call for years convinced by john hobbs that adan barrera is dealing arms to leftwing insurgents inchiapas and elsewhere mexico city has taken the leash off ramos and he goes at it like a pit bull on steroids a week into the operation hes hit seven safe houses already all in the exclusive neighborhoods of colonia chapultepec colonia hipodromo and colonia cacho for an entire week ramos troopers storm through tijuanas wealthy neighborhoods in armored trucks and humvees and theyre none too gentle about it blowing off expensive doors with explosive charges ransacking homes blocking traffic and disrupting businesses for hours its almost as if ramos wants to alienate the citys elite who indeed are torn between blaming ramos or the barreras for all the trouble which of course has been a centerpiece of adan barreras longterm strategy for yearsto become so enmeshed with the baja upper crust that an attack on him is an attack on them and they do scream tomexico city that ramos is out of control over the top that hes trampling on their civil rights ramos doesnt care iftijuana s upper crust hates his guts he hates them too thinks that they sold whatever souls they had to the barrera brotherstaking them into society into their homes allowing their sons and nephews to dabble in the drug tradein exchange for cheap thrills by association and quick easy money they acted ramos thinks like a gaggle of narcogroupies treating the barrera scum like celebrities rock musicians movie stars and he tells them so when they come to complain look ramos tells the city fathers the narcotraficantes murdered a catholic cardinal and you welcomed them home they gunned down federales on the streets in rush hour and you protected them they murdered your own chief of police and you did nothing about it so dont come to me and complainyou brought this on yourselves ramos gets on television and calls the city out he looks straight into the camera and announces that within fourteen days hes going to have adan and raul barrera behind bars and their organization on the old ash heap of history he stands beside stacks of captured weapons and piles of seized drugs and names namesadan raul and fabianand goes on to name the scions of several prominenttijuana families as juniors and promises to put them in jail as well then he announces that hes fired five dozen baja federales for lacking the moral qualifications to be policemen saying it is a shame on the nation that in baja many of the police officers are not the enemies of the barrera cartel but their servants im not going away he says im taking on the barreraswho will stand with me well not too many people one young prosecutor a state investigator and ramos own menand thats about it art understands why the people oftijuana arent flocking to ramos banner theyre scared and why shouldnt they be two months ago a baja cop who exposed the names of crooked cops in the state police was found by the side of the road in a canvas bag every bone in his body had been brokenone of raul barreras trademark executions just three weeks ago another prosecutor who had been investigating the barreras was shot to death as he took his morning jog on the track of the city university the gunmen had yet to be apprehended and the warden oftijuana s prison was killed in a driveby shooting as he went out onto his porch to get his morning newspaper the word on the street is that he had offended a barrera associate who is incarcerated in his facility no the barreras might be on the run right now but that doesnt mean their reign of terror is over and people arent going to stick their necks out until they see the two barrera brothers on slabs the fact is art thinks a week into the operation that we havent produced the people of baja know that we took a swing at the barreras heads and missed raul is still at large adan is still at large and nora well the fact that adan didnt walk into the trap in colonia hipodromo probably means that her cover was blown art still holds on to hope but as the days go by in silence he has to acknowledge the probability that he will have to search for her decomposed body so arts not in a good mood when he goes into the interview room in the federal lockup in downtownsan diego to have a chat with fabian martinez aka el tiburon the little punk doesnt look so stylish now in his federal orange jumpsuit handcuffed and in ankle bracelets but he retains his smirk as hes led in and plopped into a folding chair across the metal table from art you went to catholic school didnt you art begins augustine fabian answers right here in san dog so you know the difference between purgatory and hell art says refresh my memory sure art says basically theyre both painful but your time in purgatory eventually ends whereas hell lasts forever im here to offer you the choice between hell and purgatory im listening art lays it out for him how the weapons charge alone gets him thirtytolife in federal prison not to mention the drug trafficking charges each of which carries fifteentolife so thats hell on the other hand if fabian becomes a government witness he spends a few years painfully testifying against his old friends followed by a short stretch in prison then a new name and a new life and thats purgatory in the first place fabian answers i didnt know anything about those guns i was there to pick up produce in the second place what trafficking charges how did drugs get into this i have a witness art says that puts you at the center of a major narcotics network fabian in fact i kind of like you for kingpin status unless you have someone else in mind youre bluffing hey art says if you want to pay thirtytolife to see that card call me but basically youre in a bidding war with my other witness and whoever gives me a better shot at barrera wins i want a lawyer good art thinks and i want you to have one but he says no you dont fabian a lawyer is just going to tell you to shut up and land you in prison for the rest of your life i want a lawyer so no deal no deal art says i need to read you your rights you already read them fabian says slumping in his chair hes bored now he wants to go back to his cell and read magazines oh that was on the weapons charge art says i have to do it all over again on the murder thing fabian sits straight up what murder thing im arresting you for the murder of juan parada art says weve had a sealed indictment since you have the right to remain silent anything you say you dont have jurisdiction fabian says on a killing that happened inmexico art leans over the table paradas parents were wetbacks he was born outsidelaredo texas so hes an american citizen just like you and that gives me jurisdiction hey maybe well try you intexas the governor there really likes to hand out lethal injections see you in court asshole now go talk to your lawyer walk right into the shit if adan had driven to his rendezvous with nora in colonia hipodromo the police would probably have nabbed him but he walked the cops would never expect adan barrera to be on foot so when he saw the police vehicles start to pour into the neighborhood he simply turned around and walked out strolled down the sidewalk right past the roadblocks that had been set up in the streets it hasnt been that easy since hes been chased out of two more safe houses getting warnings from raul just in time and now hes in a safe house in the rio district wondering when the storm troopers are going to come smashing in there and the worst part is the communicationsor the lack of them most of his cell phones arent encrypted so he is reluctant to use them and the ones that are might have been compromised so even if the police couldnt decipher what he was saying they could still get a fix on his location just through the signal so he doesnt know whos been arrested what houses have been hit what was found in those houses he doesnt know who is conducting the raids how long they are going to last where they are going to hit whether they know where he is what really concerns adan is that the raids came without warning not a word not a whisper from his wellpaid friends inmexico city and that scares him because if the pri politicians have turned on him they must be very scared and they must know that if they strike at the barrera head they dont dare miss which makes them dangerous they have to take me down he thought they have to kill me so hes taking protective measures first he distributes most of his cell phones to his men who disperse throughout the city and the state with the instructions to make calls and then dump the phones sure enough ramos starts getting reports that adan barrera is in hipodromo chapultepec rosarito ensenada tecate even across the border in san diego chula vista otay mesa raul goes to radio shack buys more phones and starts working them reaching out and touching cops on the payrollbaja federales baja state police tijuana municipal cops the news isnt good the state and local cops who do answer their phones dont know shitnobodys told them anything but the one thing they can say is that this is a federal effort its got nothing to do with them and the local federales off the hook raul tells adan now theyve moved againgetting out of the safe house in the rio district just ten minutes before the police hit it theyre in a condo in colonia cacho hoping to be able to hole up there for at least a few hours until they can find out what the fuck is going on but the local police arent going to be any help theyre not answering their phones raul says get them at home adan snaps theyre not answering there either adan grabs a new phone and dials longdistance to mexico city nobodys home none of his connections in pri are available to take a phone call but if hed like to leave a number theyd be happy to return its the gun deal adan thinks fucking art keller has put together the guns and farc and used it to make mexico city react he feels like he wants to throw up there were only four people in mexico who knew about the arrangement with tirofiome raul fabian and nora nora is missing she never showed up at colonia hipodromo but the police did she got there before me he thinks she got swept up in the raid and the police have her on ice somewhere raul gets hold of a laptop and then forces one of their resident computer geeks to come to this safe house and the geek manages to get out encrypted email messages to their network of computers an encryption of the geeks own designhe was paid in the high six figuresso dense that even the dea hasnt been able to crack it this is what its come to adan thinks launching electronic messages into space so they sit and watch for armored cars rolling up the street as they sit and watch the computer screen for messages within an hour raul manages to summon a few sicarios and a couple of clean work cars that cant be connected to the cartel he also sets up a series of watching and listening posts to monitor the whereabouts of the police when the sun sets adan dressed as a laborer gets into the back of an dodge dart with raul in the front are a heavily armed driver and another sicario the car makes its way through the hazardous maze that tijuana has become the scouts and listening posts electronically clearing paths until adan finally makes his way out of the city and to rancho las bardas there he and raul take a breath and try to figure things out ramos helps the barreras turn on the evening news and there he is at a press conference announcing that hes going to shut down the baja cartel within two weeks that explains why we didnt get a warning adan says that explains some of it says raul ramos has a virtual road map through the cartel locations of safe houses names of associates where did he get his information its fabian adan says hes giving everything up raul is incredulous its not fabian its your beloved nora i dont believe that adan says you dont want to believe it raul says he tells adan about finding the tracking device in the car that could have been fabian too adan says the police had an ambush set up at your little love nest raul yells did fabian know about that who knew about the arms deal you me fabian and nora well it wasnt me i dont think it was you fabians in an american prison so we dont even know where she is adan says then a horrible thought occurs to him he looks up at raul who has pulled the blind aside and is looking out the window raul did you do something to her raul doesnt answer adan jumps out of his chair raul did you do something to her he grabs raul by the shirt raul flicks him off easily and pushes him onto the bed he says what if i did i want to see her i dont think thats a good idea youre in charge now your obsession with that cunt has fucked up our business meaning yes brother until you come to your senses im in charge i want to see her i am not going to let you become another tio el chocho raul thinks the downfall of barrera men wasnt it tios obsession with young pussy that brought about his downfall first with pilar and then with that other cunt whose name i cant even remember miguel angel barrera mthe man who built the federacion the smartest toughest most levelheaded man ive ever known except his brain shut down over some piece of ass and it did him in and adan has inherited the same disease hell adan could have all the pussy he wants but he has to have that one he could have had mistress after mistress as long as he was discreet about it and didnt embarrass his wife but not adanno he falls in love with this whore and is seen everywhere in public with her giving art keller the perfect target and now look at us adan stares at the floor is she alive raul doesnt answer raul just tell me if shes alive a guard bursts through the door go he yells go the animals in the menagerie scream as ramos and his men come over the wall ramos shoulders the grenade launcher aims and pulls the trigger one of the guard towers explodes in a flash of yellow light he reloads aims again and theres another flash he looks down and two deer are dashing themselves against the fence trying to get out he jumps into the pen and opens the door the two animals dash out into the night birds are screeching and squawking monkeys chattering madly and ramos remembers hearing rumors that raul has a couple of lions out here and then he hears their growls and it sounds just like it does in the movies and then he forgets about that because theres return fire coming in theyd come in by airplane after dark a risky lightsout landing on an old drugrunning strip then done a night march across the desert and a long crawl for the last thousand yards to avoid the barreras patrol jeeps and now were in it ramos thinks he nestles his cheek into esposas comfortable old stock squeezes off two rounds gets up and moves forward knowing that his men are laying cover fire for him then he drops and lays down cover for the men who leapfrog ahead of him and this is the way they move forward toward rauls house one of his men gets hit in front of him is moving forward and then jumps like an antelope when he gets hit ramos crawls forward to help him but the mans face is half blown away and hes past help ramos removes the ammo clips from the mans belt and rolls away as a burst of bullets stitches after him the fire is coming from the roof of a low building and ramos comes out of his roll into a kneeling position flicks the rifle to bushrake and strings the clip out along the roof line then he feels two hard thuds in his chest realizes hes been hit in the kevlar vest unhooks a grenade from his belt and lofts it onto the roof theres a thud then a flash and two bodies in the air and the fire from that building stops but not the fire from the house red telltale muzzle flashes blaze from windows roofs and doorways ramos keeps a close eye on the doors because apparently theyve caught a few of rauls men inside the house and theyll be trying to get out to outflank their attackers sure enough one of the mercenaries fires a clip from the doorway then makes his break ramos two shots take him in the stomach and he tumbles into the dirt and starts to scream one of his mates comes out to drag him back in but gets hit half a dozen times himself and balls up by his buddys feet get the cars ramos yells there are vehicles everywhereland rovers the narcofavorite suburban a few mercedeses ramos doesnt want any of the narcosespecially raulto make it into one of the cars and drive away and now after a hail of bullets none of these vehicles is going anywhere theyre all sitting on flat tires and shattered glass then a gas tank or two goes up and a couple of them are on fire then things get weird because someone has the brilliant idea that it would be a good diversionary tactic to open all the cages and now there are animals running around all over the place running wild in all directions panicked by the noise and the flames and the bullets whistling through the air and ramos blinks as a condenado giraffe runs in front of him then two zebras and antelope are zigzagging back and forth across the yard and ramos thinks about the lions again and decides that this is going to be a very stupid way to die as he picks himself up and moves toward the house and ducks as some huge bird swoops low over his head and now the narcos bust out of the house and it is just the ok corral out there flickering silver moonlit images of men animals weaponsmen standing running shooting falling ducking it looks like some weird dream but the bullets and death and pain are real as ramos stands and snaps a shot here then moves around some kind of wild donkey thats braying in terror and then theres a narco to his left then to his rightno thats one of his menand bullets are zipping gun muzzles blazing men yelling and animals screaming ramos pops off two shots and another narco falls and then ramos seesor thinks he sees anywaythe tall form of raul running firing pistols from his hips and ramos gets a momentary aim on his legs but raul disappears ramos runs toward where he saw him and then dives for the ground as he sees a narco raise his gun and ramos fires from his back and the man flies backward and hits the ground himself a little cloud of dust poofing up against the moonlight the barreras are gone as the firefight dies downramos selects the word dies intentionally because many of rauls mercenaries are dead or at least downhe goes from corpse to corpse wounded to wounded prisoner to prisoner looking for raul rancho las bardas is a mess the main house looks like a gigantic folkart colander cars are on fire rare birds perch in tree limbs and some of the animals have actually crept back into their cages where they cower and whimper ramos sees a tall body lying by the fence on a bed of matilija poppies the white blossoms flecked red with blood keeping esposa trained on the body ramos kicks it over onto its back its not raul ramos is furious we know he thinks that raul was herewe heard him and i saw him or thought i did anyway maybe i didnt maybe the cell phone calls were fake to throw us off the trail and the brothers are sitting on the beach in costa rica or honduras laughing at us over cold beers maybe they werent here at all then he spots it the trapdoor is covered with dirt and a little brush but he can make out the rectangular shape on the ground looking closer he can see the footprints you can run raul but you cant fly but a tunnel thats very good he bends over and sees that the trapdoor has been opened recently theres a narrow line at its edge where the dirt has fallen through he tosses the brush aside and feels for the concave handle digs his hand in and lifts the trapdoor he hears the tiny click and sees the explosive charge but its too late me jodi i fucked myself the explosion blows him to pieces the silence that was once ominous is now funereal art has tried everything he can think of to find nora hobbs has turned over all his resources even though art has refused to divulge the identity of his source so art has had the benefit of satellite photographs listening posts internet sweeps they all turn up nothing his options are limitedhe cant launch an ernie hidalgolike search for her because that would blow her cover and kill her if shes not already dead and now he doesnt have ramos waging his relentless campaign it doesnt look good boss shag says whens our next satellite sweep fortyfive minutes weather permitting theyll get images of rancho las bardas the barreras compound in the desert theyve had five of them already and theyve shown nothing a few servants but no one who looks like adan or raul and certainly no one who looks like nora and no movement either no new vehicles no fresh tire tracks nothing coming in or going out the same is the case with the other barrera ranches and safe houses that ramos hadnt yet hit no people no movement no cell phone chatter christ art thinks barrera has to be running out of places but so are we let me know he says he has a meeting with mexicos new drug czar general augusto rebollo ostensibly the purpose of the meeting is for rebollo to brief him on the ongoing operations against the barrera cartel as part of their recently rediscovered bilateralism the only problem is that rebollo doesnt really know much about the operation ramos was keeping his activities close to his vest and all rebollo can really do is get on television look fierce and determined and announce his total support for everything that the deceased hero ramos has done even if he doesnt know what that is but the truth is that the support is wavering mexico city is getting more nervous as days go by and the barreras are still on the loose the longer this war goes on the more nervous they get and theyre looking as john hobbs carefully explains to art before they go into the meeting for a reason for optimism in short rebollo purrs in his meeting with art his green army uniform pressed and neat as a pin it is obvious that his dea colleagues have an inside source of information as to the working of the barrera cartel and in the spirit of cooperation his own office could be of much more assistance in the common struggle against drugs and terrorism if senor keller would share this source he smiles at art hobbs smiles at art all the bureaucrats in the room smile at art no he says he can see tijuana from the picture windows of this office tower shes out there somewhere rebollos smile has faded he looks offended hobbs says arthur no let him work a little harder for it the meeting ends unhappily art goes back to the war room the satellite photos of rancho las bardas should be in anything he asks shag shag shakes his head shit theyve gone under boss shag says no cell traffic email nothing art looks at him the old cowboys face is weathered and lined and he wears bifocals now christ have i aged as much as he has art wonders two old drug warriors what are the new guys calling us jurassic narcs and shags older than i amhes looking at retirement soon hell call his kid art says suddenly what the daughter gloria art says adans wife and the girl live in san diego shag winces they both know that involving an innocent family is against the unspoken rules that govern the war between the narcos and themselves art knows what hes thinking fuck it he says lucia barrera knows what her husband does shes no innocent the little girl is ernies kids live in san diego too art answers except they never see their daddy set up a wiretap boss no judge in the world arts stare cuts him off raul barrera isnt happy either they pay rebollo a month and for that kind of money he should be able to come through for them but he didnt shut down antonio ramos before the attack on rancho las bardas and now he cant confirm that nora hayden was the source of their troubles something that raul needs to know badly and in a hurry hes holding his own brother virtual prisoner in this safe house and if the soplon wasnt his brothers mistress theres going to be hell to pay so when raul gets the message from rebollogee sorryhe sends word back the word is simpledo better because if youre no use to us theres no loss in putting out the word that youre on the payroll then you can be sorry in prison rebollo gets the word fabian martinez huddles with his lawyer and gets right down to business he knows the sop in drug busts the cartel sends an attorney and you tell the attorney what if any information you gave up that way it can usually be fixed before any harm is done i didnt give them anything he says the attorney nods they have an informant fabian continues then drops his voice to a whisper its adans baturra nora jesus are you sure it can only be her fabian says you have to get me bail man im going crazy in this place a weapons charge like that fabian its going to be tough fuck the weapons he tells the lawyer about the murder charge thats messed up the lawyer thinks unless fabian martinez makes a deal hes looking at a long time in jail shes not exactly a prisoner but shes not free to go nora doesnt even know where she is except that its somewhere along bajas eastern coast the cottage they keep her in is made of the same red stone as the beach around it it has a thatched roof made of palm fronds and heavy wooden doors it isnt airconditioned but the thick stone walls keep it cool inside the cottage has three roomsa small bedroom a bathroom and a front room facing the sea that is a living room combined with an open kitchen electricity runs from a generator that hums noisily outside so she has electric lights hot running water and a flush toilet she can choose between a hot shower and a hot bath theres even a satellite dish outside but the television has been removed and there is no radio the clocks have also been taken away and they confiscated her watch when they brought her in there is a little cd player but no cds they want me alone with my silence she thinks in a world with no time and truly she has started to lose track of the days since raul picked her up in colonia hipodromo and told her to get into the car that all hell had broken loose and hed take her to adan she didnt trust him but she didnt have a choice and he was even apologetic when he explained that for her own protection shed have to be blindfolded she knows they pulled south out of tijuana she knows they drove on the fairly smooth ensenada highway for quite a while but then the road got bumpy and then it got worse and she could feel that they were slowly going uphill rumbling along a rocky road in fourwheel drive and then she could smell the ocean it was dark by the time they walked her inside and took off the blindfold wheres adan she asked raul hell be here when soon raul said relax get some sleep youve been through a lot he handed her a sleeping pill a tuinol i dont need that no take it you need sleep he stood there while she took it and she did sleep hard and woke up in the morning a little groggy and with cottonmouth she thought that she was on the beach somewhere south of ensenada until the sun came up on the wrong side of the world and she worked out that she was on the inland side when daylight came she recognized the distinctive bright green water of the sea of cortez from the bedroom window she could make out a larger house just up the hill and see that the entire area looked like a moonscape of red stone a little while later a young woman walked down from the larger house with a tray of breakfastcoffee grapefruit and some warm flour tortillas and a spoon nora noticed no knife no fork a glass of water with another tuinol she resisted taking it until her nerves got the better of her then she swallowed it and it did make her feel better she napped the rest of the morning and woke up only when the same girl brought her a tray of lunchfreshly grilled yellowtail tuna steamed vegetables more tortillas more tuinol they woke her out of a deep sleep in the middle of the night and started asking her questions her interrogator a small man with an accent that wasnt quite mexican was gentle polite and persistent what happened the night of the arms arrest where did you go who did you see who did you talk to your shopping trips to san diegowhat did you do what did you buy who did you see arthur keller do you know him does that name mean anything to you were you ever arrested for prostitution drug charges incometax evasion she asked her own questions in response what are you talking about why are you asking me this stuff who are you anyway where is adan does he know youre bothering me can i go back to sleep now they let her go back to sleep woke her fifteen minutes later and told her it was the next night she knew better barely but pretended to believe them as the interrogator asked her the same set of questions over and over again until she got indignant and said i want to go back to sleep i want to see adan and i want another tuinol you can have one in a little while the interrogator told her he switched tactics tell me about the day of the arms bust please take me through it minute by minute you got in the car and and and and she climbed back on the bed put her head under the pillow and told him to shut up and go away shes tired he offered her another pill and she took it they let her sleep for twentyfour hours and then started again questions questions questions tell me about this tell me about that art keller shag wallace art keller tell me about shooting the chinese man what did you do how did it feel where did you grab the gun by the barrel the handle talk to me about keller how long have you known him did he approach you or did you approach him she answered what are you talking about because she knew if she gave him an answer she was going to mess up in the fog of barbiturates fatigue fear confusion disorientation she understood what they were doing there was just nothing she could do to stop it he never touched her never threatened her and that gave her hope because she knew it meant that they werent sure it was her if they were sure they would torture her for the information or just kill her the soft interrogation meant that they had their doubts and it meant something else that adan was still on her side theyre not hurting me she thought because they still have adan to worry about so she held out gave evasive confused answers outright denials indignant counterassaults but shes wearing down its getting to her breakfast didnt come one morningshe asked for it and the girl looked confused and said that shed just served it but she hadnt i know thator do i nora wondered and then there were two lunches back to back and then more sleep and then another tuinol now she wanders around outside the cottage the doors arent locked and nobody stops her the compound is flanked by the sea on one side and endless desert on the other three if she tried to walk out she would die of thirst or exposure she walks down to the ocean and goes in up to her ankles the water is warm and feels nice the sun sets behind her back adan watches her from his bedroom window in the house up the hill he is a prisoner in the room guarded by a rotation of sicarios whose loyalty is to raul they take turns outside the door round the clock and adan figures there must be at least twenty of them on the grounds he stands and watches her wade into the water she wears an offwhite sundress and a floppy white hat to keep the sun off her skin her hair hangs loose on her bare shoulders was it you he wonders did you betray me no he decides i cant let myself believe that raul sure believes it even though days of interrogation have failed to prove it its a soft interrogation his brother has assured him she hasnt been touched never mind hurt shed better not be adan has told him one bruise one scar one scream of pain and i will find a way to have you killed brother or no brother and if shes the soplon raul asked then adan thinks as he watches her sit down at the edge of the water that is different that is a different thing altogether he and raul have come to an understanding if nora is not the traitor then raul will step back down and adan will resume his position as patron thats the understanding adan thinks but experience tells him that no one who has assumed power ever gives it back again not willingly anyway not easily and maybe that would be for the good he thinks let raul have the pasador cash out take nora and go somewhere for a quiet life shes always wanted to live in paris why not and the other half of the equation if it turns out that nora betrayed them for whatever reason then rauls little coup becomes permanent and nora he doesnt want to think about it the example of pilar talavera is vivid in his mind if it comes to that ill do it myself he thinks its funny how you can still love someone who betrayed you ill walk her down to the ocean let her watch the last rays of the sun fade on the water it will be quick and painless then if it werent for gloria id put the pistol in my own mouth children bind us to this life dont they especially this child so fragile and needy and she must be worrying herself to death adan thinks the news from tijuana has surely hit the san diego papers and even though lucia will try to shield her from it gloria will worry until she hears from me he takes another long look at nora then walks away from the window and bangs on the door the guard opens it get me a cell phone adan orders raul said i dont give a rats ass what raul said pendejo adan snaps i am still the patron and if i tell you to get me something then you go get it he gets the phone boss yeah heartbeat shag hands art the headset patched into the tap on lucia barreras phone he hears lucias voice adan hows gloria shes worried let me speak to her where are you can i speak with her a long pause then glorias voice papa how are you baby ive been worried about you im okay dont worry art hears the girl crying where are you the newspaper said the newspaper makes things up im fine can i come see you not quite yet darling soon listen tell mommy to give you a big kiss from me okay okay bye baby i love you i love you papa art looks to shag its going to take a little while boss it takes an hour but it feels like five as the electronic data are sent to nsa and analyzed then they have an answer the call came from a cell phone we already knew that art thinks so they cant provide an address but they can specify the nearest transmittal tower san felipe on the east coast of baja straight south from mexicali a sixtymile radius from the tower art already has the map spread out on the table san felipe is a small town maybe twenty thousand people a lot of them american snowbirds theres not much down there except the town a lot of desert and a string of fishing camps to the north and south even with a sixtymile radius its the cliched needle in the haystack and adan may have traveled to get into cell phone range and may even now be rushing back out but it gives us a target area art thinks some hope the call didnt come from the town shag says how do you know that listen to the tape again they rerun it and in the background art can hear a faint hum with rhythmic pulses he looks at shag puzzled youre a city boy arent you shag asks i grew up on a ranch thats a generator youre hearing theyre off the power grid art calls for a satellite sweep but its night and they wont have the images for hours the interrogator picks up the pace he wakes nora out of a deep tuinol slumber sits her in a chair and sticks the tracking device in her face whats this i dunno yes you do he insists you put it there what where what time is it i wanna go back he shakes her its the first time hes touched her its also the first time he yells listen ive been very nice to you so far but im losing my patience with you if you dont start to cooperate im going to hurt you very badly now tell me who gave you this to put in the car she stares at the little device for a long time as if its some object from a distant past she holds it between her thumb and forefinger and turns it around examining it from different angles then she holds it up to the lamp and looks at it more closely she turns back to her interrogator and says ive never seen this before then hes in her face screaming she doesnt even understand what hes saying but hes yellingflecks of spit hit her faceand shaking her back and forth and when he finally lets her go she just slumps in the chair exhausted im so tired she says i know you are he says all softness and sympathy now this can all be over very soon you know then can i sleep oh yes arts sitting there when the photos come across the computer screen his eyes stinging from fatigue he wakes shag whos sleeping tilted back in his chair with his boots up on his desk they pore over the photos starting with a large weathersatellite image of the entire san felipe area they cross off the section that is on the power grid then start working their way through the enlarged vectors north and south of town they rule out the inland areas no water supply few passable roads and the few roads that do snake their way through the rocky desert would allow the barreras only one avenue of escape and they would be unlikely to place themselves in that trap so they concentrate on the coast itself to the east of the range of low mountains and the main road which runs parallel to the coast with spur roads going east to the fishing camps and other small settlements on the beach the coast north of san felipe is a popular spot for offroaders and is pretty crowded with tourist fishing and rv camps so they dont give it much play the immediate coast south of the town is similar but then the road gets considerably worse and civilization becomes sparse until you get closer to the little fishing village of puertocitos but theres a tenkilometer stretch between the two townsstarting about forty clicks south of san felipewhere there are no camps just a few isolated beach houses the range is consistent with the strength of adans cell phone signal bps so thats where they concentrate their efforts its a perfect spot art thinks there are only a few access roadsmore like fourwheeler tracksand the barreras doubtless have lookouts posted on those roads and in san felipe and puertocitos as well they would spot every single vehicle that came down the road never mind the kind of armed convoy it would take to launch a raid the barreras would be long goneby road or by boatbefore we could get close but you cant think about that now first find the target then worry about how to take it out a dozen houses are set on the isolated stretch of coast a few sit on the beach itself but most are up on the low ridge above three are plainly unoccupied there are no vehicles or recent tire tracks among the remaining nine its hard to choose they all look normalfrom space anywayalthough art is hardpressed to determine what abnormal would be in this case all of them appear to have been built on lots cleared from the rocks and agave brush most of them are plain rectangular structures with either thatched or composite roofs most of them then he spots the anomaly he almost misses it but something catches his eye something not quite right zoom in on that he says what shag asks he doesnt see anything where art is pointing but rock and brush that is a shadow made by some rocks indistinguishable from the millions of others but the shadowthe shadow is an even line thats a structure art says they download the frame and enlarge it its grainy hard to tell but examined under a magnifying glass there is depth there are we looking at a square rock art asks or a square building with a rock roof who puts a stone roof on a house shag asks someone who wants it to blend in art answers they zoom back out and now they start to spot other tooregular shadows and pieces of brush that have even lines its difficult at first but then a picture starts to emerge of two structuresone smaller than the otherand shapes that could disguise vehicles underneath they coordinate the frame onto the large map the house sits off a track that turns off from the main road such as it is fortyeight kilometers south of san felipe five hours later a fishing boat beats its way up from puertocitos through a heavy headwind it anchors two hundred yards from shore puts out its lines and waits for dusk then one of the fishermen stretches out flat on the deck and trains an infrared telescope on the beach in front of two stone houses he spots a woman in a white dress walking unsteadily down to the water she has long blond hair art hangs up the phone drops his head into his hands and sighs when he looks up again he has a smile on his face we got her dont you mean him boss shag asks lets not lose focus here getting barrera is the point isnt it fabian martinez is still in his cell but hes feeling a little better about life in general hed had a good meeting with his attorney who had assured him that he didnt have to worry about the drug chargesthe governments witness was not going to appear and certain people had been given information about the soplon the arms charge is still a problem but the attorney has a genius idea about that too well see if we can get you extradited to mexico he said on the parada murder are you kidding me first of all the lawyer said mexico doesnt have a death penalty second it will take years to bring you to trial and in the meantime he let it hang fabian knew what he meant in the meantime things will get fixed technicalities will emerge prosecutors will lose enthusiasm judges will get vacation ranchos so fabian lies back on his mattress and thinks hes in pretty good shape fuck you kellerwithout nora youve got nothing and fuck you la guera i hope youre having a nice evening they wont let her sleep when she first got there they wouldnt let her do anything but sleep and now they wont let her shut her eyes she can sit down but if she starts to doze they pick her up and make her stand she aches every part of herher feet her legs her back her head her eyes worst of all her eyes they burn they throb they feel raw shed give anything to lie down and close her eyes or sit or standjust close her eyes but they wont let her and they wont give her any tuinol she doesnt want it she needs it she has an awful pinsandneedles feeling in her skin and her hands wont stop quivering add to that the slamming headache and the nausea and just one she whines you want things but you dont want to give anything the interrogator says i dont have anything to give her legs feel like wood i disagree the interrogator says then he starts in again about arthur keller the dea the tracking device her trips to san diego they know nora thinks they already know so why not just tell them what they already know just tell them and let them do what theyre going to do but whatever it is i can get some sleep adan isnt coming keller isnt comingjust tell them something if i tell you about san diego will you let me sleep she asks the interrogator agrees he takes her through it step by step shag wallace finally leaves the office gets in his fiveyearold buick and drives to a parking lot outside the ames supermarket in national city he waits there for twenty minutes before a lincoln navigator pulls into the lot slowly cruises around then pulls up beside him a man gets out of the lincoln and into the buick with shag he sets the briefcase on his lap the latches open with a metallic snap then he turns the briefcase so that shag can see the stack of wrapped bills inside are police pensions any better in america than they are in mexico the man asks not much shag says three hundred thousand dollars the man says shag hesitates take it the man says its not as if youre giving information to the narcos after all this is from one cop to another general rebollo needs to know shag blows a long breath then he tells the man what he wants to know we need some proof the man says shag takes the proof from his jacket pocket and hands it over then he takes the three hundred thousand dollars a south wind blows up the baja peninsula pushing warmer air and a layer of clouds over the sea of cortez with no more satellite photos arts latest intelligence is now eighteen hours old and a lot could have happened in those hoursthe barreras could have left nora could be dead the cloud cover shows no sign of breaking up so the intelligence is only going to get older so what he has is what hes going to get and he has to act on it quickly or not at all but how ramos the one cop in mexico he could trust is dead the head of the ncid is on the barreras payroll and los pinos is backpedaling on the campaign against the barreras in six gears of reverse art has only one choice and he hates it he meets john hobbs on shelter island the sailing boat marina in the middle of san diego harbor they meet at night across from humphreys by the bay and walk along the narrow stretch of park that flanks the water on the way out to the point you know what youre asking me to do hobbs says yeah i do art thinks hobbs tells him anyway launch an illegal strike on the sovereign territory of a friendly country it violates about every international law i can think of plus a few hundred national laws and could triggeryoull forgive the unhappy phrasea major diplomatic crisis with a neighboring state its our last chance at the barreras art argues we stopped the chinese shipment this one art says you think adan will quit if we dont get him now hell set up the armsfordrugs deal and farc will be fully equipped inside six months hobbs is silent art walks beside him trying to read his thoughts listening to the sound of the water as it laps on the rocks beside them in the distance the lights of tijuana sparkle and wink art feels like he cant breathe if hobbs doesnt go for this nora hayden is dead and the barreras win finally hobbs says i couldnt use any of our normal assets well have to outsource this doubleblind thank you god art says to himself and arthur hobbs adds turning to him this cant be a bag job we could never explain to the mexicans how we got the barreras into custody this will not be a law enforcement operation it will be a covert intelligence action this will not be an arrest it will be an extreme sanction are you all right with that art nods i need to hear you say it hobbs insists its a sanction art says thats what i want so far so good art thinks but he knows john hobbs wont walk away from this without extracting his price it doesnt take long and i need to know your source hobbs says of course art tells him callan walks from the beach back toward the cottage hes renting its a cool foggy day on the nocal coast and he likes it that way it feels good he opens the door to the cottage pulls his and points it eeeeezy sal says were good are we you walked off the reservation sean sal says you should have talked to me first youd have let me go with the right precautions yeah sal says what about the hit on the barreras old news so were good callan says not lowering his aim thanks for telling me now leave i got a job offer for you pass callan says i dont do that kind of work anymore thats okay scachi tells him because were not talking about taking any lives this time were talking about saving one they decide to go in from the water art and sal pore over detailed area maps and decide its the only way to get in quickly a fishing boat will go up from the south at night and theyll embark on zodiacs and land on the beach now its a matter of time and tide the sea of cortez has extreme tidesthe low tide can ebb hundreds of yards and that distance would make a quick raid impossible they cant get across hundreds of yards of open beach even at night theyd be spotted and mowed down before they got near the houses so the window for a successful raid is narrowit has to be night and high tide we have to go between nine and ninetwenty sal says tonight its too soon art thinks and maybe too late nora talks all about her last visit to san diego how she went shopping what she bought where she stayed how she had lunch with haley a nap a run dinner what did you do that night hung out in the room ordered dinner watched tv you were in la jolla and you just watched tv why just felt like it being by myself hanging out vegging out in front of the tube what did you watch she knows shes going down the slippery slope she knows it but theres nothing she can do about it thats the nature of slippery slopes isnt it she thinks what i really did that night was go to the white house and meet with keller but i cant say that can i so i dunno i dont remember it wasnt that long ago dumb stuff you know some dumb movie maybe i fell asleep payperview hbo she cant remember if the valencia has payperview movies or hbo or anything shes not sure she ever even turned the tv on there but if i say i watched a pay movie then that would show up my bill wouldnt it she thinks so she says i think it was hbo or showtime one of those the interrogator senses that hes moving in on the kill shes an amateur a professional liar is vague about everything i dont rememberit might have been this it might have been that but this woman had been certain and detailed about everything that shed done up until her account of the evening when she became uncertain and evasive a professional liar knows that the key is not to make his lies look like the truth but to make his truth look like lies well her truth looks like truth and her lies but you dont remember what the movie was i was you know channel surfing channel surfing yeah what did you have for dinner fish i usually have fish watching your weight of course ill be back in a bit while im gone please think about what movie you watched can i sleep if you sleep you cant think can you but i cant think if i dont sleep nora worries thats the problem i cant think of any more lies i cant keep them straight im not even sure myself what happened and didnt what movie did i watch what movie is this how does it end if you can remember what you watched that night ill let you sleep he knows the process when put under enough pressure the mind will create an answer it doesnt matter if its fact or fantasy in this case he just wants her to commit to an answer in exchange for sleep the womans mind will recall the information it might even seem real to her if it turns out to be so fine but if it turns out to be false she will have given him the crack from which everything else will splinter she will fall apart and then we will have the truth shes lying the interrogator tells raul making things up how can you tell body language the interrogator says vague answers if i put her on a polygraph and ask her about that particular evening she fails do i have enough to convince adan raul wonders so that i can dispatch this lying bitch without starting a civil war with my brother first fabian sends a message through his lawyer saying that the woman is the soplon now the interrogator is on the edge of catching her in a lie but do i wait for rebollo to get us a definitive answer if he can get us an answer how long before you break her raul asks the interrogator looks at his watch its five oclock now he says eightthirty nine at the latest now the clouds are on our side art thinks as the fishing boat cuts through the choppy water he listens to the rhythmic slapping of the hull against the small waves that break against the bow the bad weather that had obscured their intelligencegathering operations is now working for them hiding them from the view of spotters on the coast as well as other boats some of them doubtless loaded with barrera security he looks at the men sitting silently on the deck their eyes shine bright against their blackened faces smoking has been forbidden but most of the men have unlit cigarettes playing nervously in their lips others chew gum a few talk quietly but most just sit and stare out at the gray fog glimmering under the moonlight the men wear kevlar vests over black jumpsuits and each man is his own arsenal carrying either a mac or an m a pistol on one side of his belt and a wicked flat palmleafkilling blade on the other the vests are festooned with grenades so these are the outside resources art thinks where the fuck did scachi get them callan knows its oldfuckinghome week sitting here with the red mist boys some of them his old bunkmates from las tangas waiting to do what they do interdict the terrorists arms supply at its source was the way scachi had put it three zodiac boats covered with canvas tarps are lashed to the deck there will be eight men to a boat and theyll land fifty yards apart the men in the two northernmost boats will head toward the larger house the crew of the third boat will make for the smaller cottage whether or not we get there is a good question callan thinks if the barreras have been tipped off well be walking into a cross fire coming from stone houses pinned down on a bare beach with no cover but the fog the beach will be littered with bodies but they wont stay there sals been clear about the spec no one is to be left behind dead or alive or anywhere in between theyre getting back on the boat callan glances over at the pile of cinder blocks on the aft deck headstones sal called them burial at sea we aint leaving no bodies in mexico far as the world is concerned this was a hit carried out by a rival narco looking to take advantage of the barreras current difficulties if you get capturedand dont get capturedthats what you tell them no matter what they do to you better idea swallow your gun we aint the marineswe wont be coming to get you art goes below the strong smell of diesel fuel makes his stomach lurch or maybe its nerves art thinks scachis drinking a cup of coffee like old times huh arthur almost hey arthur you dont want this to happen say the word i want it to happen you got thirty minutes on that beach sal says in thirty minutes were back on the boat and heading out last thing we need is to get stopped by a mexican patrol boat i got it art says how long until we get there scachi kicks the question to the boats captain two hours art checks his watch theyll hit the beach around nine nora makes her mistake at she starts to fall asleep standing up but they shake her and walk her around the room then they sit her down again as the interrogator comes in and asks do you remember what you watched that night yes because i have to get some sleep have to sleep if i can sleep i can think and i can think my way out of this so give him something a little something buy some sleep buy some time very good what amistad the movie about slaves thats right go ahead and ask me about it she thinks ive seen it i remember it i can talk about it ask me your questions fuck you there are no network movies on a weeknight so it must have been payperview or hbo or some other no i checked your hotel has only hbo and payperview oh so which was it how the hell should i know nora thinks hbo the interrogator shakes his head sadly like a teacher whose student has disappointed him nora that hotel does not get hbo but you just said i was testing you then it must have been payperview was it yes i remember now it was payperview because i can remember looking at that little card they put on top of the television and wondering if the staff thought i was ordering porn yes thats right and i what nora i have copies of your bill you didnt order a movie i didnt no now why dont you tell me what you were really doing that night nora i did tell you you lied to me nora im very disappointed im just confused im so tired if you let me get some sleep the only reason to lie is to cover something up what are you covering up nora what did you really do that night she puts her face in her hands and sobs she hasnt cried since juan died and it feels good its a relief you were somewhere else that night werent you she nods youve been lying all this time she nods again can i sleep now please give her some tuinol the interrogator says and get raul adans door opens raul comes in and hands him a pistol can you do this brother she feels a hand on her shoulder thinks its a dream at first then opens her eyes and sees adan standing over her my love he says lets go for a walk now he nods he looks so serious she thinks so serious he helps her get out of bed im a mess she says she is her hair is disheveled and her face is puffy from the drugs it occurs to him that hes never seen her without makeup you always look lovely he answers here put a sweater on its chillyi dont want you to get sick she walks out with him into the silver mist shes groggy and has a hard time getting her footing on the large pebbles of the beach he holds her by the elbow and gently walks her away from the cottage toward the waters edge raul watches from the window he saw adan and his woman leave the stone cottage and walk into the dark now hes lost sight of them in the fog can he do it raul wonders can he put the barrel to the back of that pretty blond head and pull the trigger does it matter if he doesnt i will and either way i am the new patron and the new patron will run things differently than the old one adan has gotten soft always the little accountantgood with the numbers not so good with the blood a loud knock at the door interrupts his thoughts what he snaps one of his men comes in hes out of breath as if hes run up the stairs the soplon he says we just got word from rebollo he got it straight from the dea guy wallace its nora the man shakes his head no patron its fabian the messenger lays out the evidencethe sealed murder indictment the threat of capital punishment then the smoking gun copies of deposit slips deposits made by keller in fabians name in banks in costa rica the caymans and even switzerland hundreds of thousands of dollarsprofits from the tombes pulled off by the piccone brothers they made him a deal the man says plata o plomo he took the silver lets sit down adan says he helps nora down and sits beside her she says im cold he puts his arm around her do you remember that night in hong kong he asks when you took me up to victoria peak lets imagine were there id like that look out there he says can you imagine the lights adan are you crying he slowly pulls the pistol from its place at the small of his back kiss me adan says he turns her chin to him and kisses her softly on the lips as he eases the gun barrel behind her head you were the sonrisa de mi alma he whispers into her lips as he pulls the hammer back the smile of my soul brother im sorry by the time the information reached me it was too late such a tragedy but we will avenge ourselves on fabian you can be sure of that raul rehearses his lines deal with la guera now fabian later he thinks it will destroy adan killing this woman he wont be able to resume control of the pasador hes your brother esta chingada he thinks its fucked he pushes the messenger aside and runs down the stairs and outside into the night yelling adan adan adan hears the shouts muffled in the fog he hears the footsteps running on the stones coming closer he tightens his finger on the trigger and thinks i cant let it be him over his shoulder he can see rauls tall form loping toward them like a ghost in the mist i have to do it do it art jumps out of the boat before it reaches the beach he stumbles through the ankledeep surf trips and falls facefirst onto the beach he gets up and crouches down low as he moves up the slope and then he sees raul barrera running toward adan and nora its a long shot a hundred yards at least and art hasnt fired an m in anger since vietnam he raises the rifle to his shoulder presses the nightscope to his eye leads raul by a few feet and squeezes the trigger the bullet takes raul in midstride square in the stomach art sees him tumble roll and then start to crawl forward then the night lights up raul crumples to the ground rolling in agony on the rocks shrieking in pain adan runs to him drops to his knees and tries to hold him but raul is too strong his pain is too strong and he writhes out of adans grasp dios mio adan yells his hands are drenched in blood the front of his shirt and his pants are soaked with blood its hot adan raul groans it wasnt her it was fabian then he howls to god dios miodios miomadre de dios adan tries to clear his head the worlds exploding around him gunfire everywhere and the sound of footsteps running toward them on the rocks then rauls bodyguards are there some firing behind them others trying to lift raul off the ground get a car adan yells bring it here raul were going to get you to the hospital dont move me we have to they start to drag him up the beach away from the attack adan grabs nora by the arms and starts to pull her up come on a grenade lands a few feet away and bowls them both over nora lies on the rocks concussed blood flowing from her nose adan is screaming something but she cant hear a thing manuel is pulling him away adans screaming and trying to pull his way back to her but the campesino is too strong for him two sicarios try to grab her but two short bursts of gunfire cut them down theres another flash of light and then darkness art sees raul and adan being dragged up the hill toward some land rovers at the top of the hill near the main house he heads for them bullets stitch around his feet a slight man with rimless glasses comes out the front door of the cottage and starts to run up the hill but a short burst of bullets catches him as he runs and he flies backwards like a silentmovie comic slipping on a banana peel the door slams shut behind him and gunfire starts to blaze from the windows art drops to the ground and crawls toward nora callan moves beside him rolls shoots in bursts of two and then rolls again then callan yells behind him rounds a second later a grenade whooshes through a window of the cottage and explodes the shooting from the cottage stops raul shrieks with agony as his men lift him into the backseat adan gets in from the other side and cradles his brothers head in his lap raul grasps his hand and whimpers manuel jumps behind the wheel rauls men try to stop him but adan yells i want manuel and they let him go the car starts up the beach every bump a jolt of agony for raul adan feels as if his brothers grip is going to crush the bones in his hand but he doesnt care he strokes rauls hair and tells him to hold on everything is going to be okay agua raul mumbles adan finds a plastic bottle of drinking water in the seat pouch twists off the cap and holds the bottle to rauls mouth raul gulps it down and adan feels the water pour onto his own shoes adan turns and looks back down the slope he sees noras limp body nora he screams then to manuel we have to go back manuel isnt having any of it he has the car in first gear fourwheel drive and is moving slowly up the hill another rover falling in behind the sicarios pouring cover fire out the back tracer rounds arc through the night like lethal fireflies a rocketpropelled grenade hits the car behind adans and explodes sending shards of heated metal spinning into the air the driver tumbles from the car in flames and twirls like festival fireworks in the night another body slumps out the open side of the car and sizzles on the rocks manuel hits the accelerator and raul screams art sees one of the rovers go up tries to peer through the flames and sees the lead rover chugging up the slope goddamn it he yells he turns to callan and orders stay with her he shifts noras dead weight onto callan and starts running toward the escaping land rover rounds from the main house buzz around his head like mosquitoes he puts his head down and keeps moving past the burning rover and its charred bodies toward the other rover thats struggling up the slope in front of him adan sees him twists around and tries to get his pistol in position to get a shot but every muscle he moves sends raul into a fresh paroxysm of pain he sees keller still running bring his rifle to his shoulder adan shoots both men miss the rover crests the ridge it slips into its downhill slide and raul screams adan holds him tight as the vehicle picks up speed art stands on the edge of the ridge hes hunched over catching his breath as he watches the rover rumble away from him he takes three deep gasping breaths raises his rifle to his shoulder and sights in on the back left windshield where he last saw adan he takes a long breath then squeezes the trigger on the exhale the car keeps moving away art trots back toward the main house scachis men go about their jobs in a workmanlike unhurried fashion one squad lays down cover fire in short disciplined bursts while the other squad moves forward then they exchange roles three rotations of this tactic get one of the men to the side of the house he presses flat against its stone walls as the others pour fire through the windows then on a signal they stop shooting and scachis guy attaches a charge to the door and throws himself to the ground as the door splinters the other mercenaries jump in three quick bursts of gunfire and then silence art goes in its a charnel house a madhouse blood everywhere dead and wounded bodies scachis mercenaries moving efficiently to dispatch the sicarios who linger between worlds three dead sicarios are sprawled on the floor of the front room one of them lies facedown with two entry wounds in the back of his head art steps over him to get into the bedroom there are eleven more bodies one wounded man his shoulder a splotch of red sits against the wall with his legs splayed in front of him scachi walks up to the wounded man and swings his foot like hes trying to make a fiftyyard field goal against the wind his boot hits the mans balls with a solid thump start talking art says the sicario does adan and raul were here so was la guera and raul was badly hurt gutshot well thats happy news anyway scachi says he does the same calculation that art doesif raul barrera has been shot in the belly he isnt going to make it hes as good as deadbetter in fact we can catch them art tells scachi theyre on the road not far ahead catch them with what scachi asks you bring a jeep he looks at his watch then yells ten minutes we have to go after them art yells no time the man keeps spewing informationthe barrera brothers left in the land rover headed for san felipe to get help for raul scachi believes him take him outside and shoot him he orders art doesnt blink everyone knew the rules going in the land rover rattles over the busted road raul screams adan doesnt know what to do if he tells manuel to slow down raul will certainly bleed out before they can get him help if he tells manuel to speed up rauls suffering is even worse the left front tire drops into a wash and raul shrieks por favor hermano he murmurs when he catches his breath please brother what brother raul looks up at him you know he turns his eyes to the pistol at his hip no raul youre going to make it i cant stand it anymore raul gasps please adan i cant im begging adan looks at manuel the old bodyguard shakes his head hes not going to make it stop the car adan orders he takes the pistol from rauls belt opens the car door then gently slides out from under his brothers head and lays it back on the seat the desert air is pungent with sage and hermosillo adan lifts the pistol and points it at the top of rauls head thank you brother raul whispers adan pulls the trigger twice art follows scachi out onto the beach where sal makes the sign of the cross over two dead mercenaries good men he says to art two of the other mercenaries carry the bodies back onto the zodiacs art trots up the beach back to where he left nora he stops when he sees callan walking toward him carrying nora over his shoulder her blond hair hanging down around her limp arms art helps him heft her dead weight into the boat adan doesnt go to san felipe but instead to a small fishing camp the owner knows who he is but feigns ignorance which is the smart thing to do he rents them two cabins in the back one for adan the other for the driver manuel knows what to do without being told he parks the land rover right next to his cabin and carries rauls body inside and into the bathroom he lays the corpse in the bathtub then goes out to get a knife like the fishermen use he comes back in and butchers rauls body severing his hands arms feet legs and finally his head its a shame that they cannot give him the funeral he deserves but no one can know that raul barrera is dead the rumors will start of course but as long as there is a chance that the barrera pasadors enforcer is still alive no one will dare make a move against them once they know hes dead the gates will be open and enemies will flood in to take their revenge against adan manuel takes a scaling knife and carefully strips the skin off rauls severed fingertips then washes the skin down the bathtub drain then he puts the body parts in plastic shopping bags and rinses out the bathtub he carries the bags out to a small motorboat fills them with the lead shot fishermen use to weigh down skein nets and takes the boat deep into the gulf then every two or three hundred yards he drops one of the bags into the water each time he does he says a quick prayer addressing both the virgin mary and santo jesus malverde adan stands in the shower and cries his tears swirl down the drain with the dirty water art and shag go to the cemetery and leave flowers at ernies grave only one left art says to his headstone just one left then they drive down to la jolla shores and watch the sun go down from the bar at the sea lodge art lifts his beer and says to nora hayden to nora hayden they touch glasses and silently watch the sun go down over the ocean in a ball of flame that turns to a fiery gold on the water fabian swaggers out of the federal court building in san diego the federal judge has agreed to extradite him to mexico hes still in his orange jumpsuit his wrists shackled to his waist his ankles chained but still he manages to swagger and flash his dropdeadkiller moviestar smile at art keller ill be out in a month loser he says as he passes art and steps into the waiting van i know you will art thinks for a second he considers trying to stop him then thinks fuck it general rebollo personally takes custody of fabian martinez in the car on the way to the arraignment he tells fabian dont worry about anything but try not to be arrogant plead not guilty and keep your mouth shut did they take care of la guera shes dead his parents are at the courthouse his mother sobs and holds him his father shakes his hand an hour later for a halfmillion dollars in assurance and as much in private payoff the judge releases junior numero uno to his parents recognizance they want to get him out of sight and out of tijuana so they take him to his uncles compound in the country outside ensenada near the little village of el sauzal he gets up early the next morning to take a piss he gets out of bed really a mattress set out on the terrace and walks downstairs to the bathroom hes sleeping out there because all the bedrooms in his uncles estancia are filled with relatives and because its cooler out there at night with the breeze off the pacific and its quieterhe cant hear bawling babies or arguments or lovemaking or snoring or any of the other sounds that come with a large extended family reunion the sun is just up and already its hot outside its going to be another long hot day here in el sauzal another baking boring ensenada day full of nosy brothers and their imperious wives and their bratty children and his uncle who thinks hes a cowboy trying to get him on a horse he gets downstairs and something is wrong at first he cant put his finger on it and then he does its not something thats there its something that isnt smoke there should be smoke from the servants quarters outside the gates of the main house the sun is up and the women should already be making tortillas and the smoke should be rising above the compound walls but it isnt and thats odd is it some sort of holiday he wonders a feast day cant be because his uncle would have been planning for it his sistersinlaw arguing obsessively about some detail of menu or table setting and he would already have been assigned his proper tedious role in the arrangements so why arent the servants up then he sees why federales coming through the gate there must be a dozen of them in their distinctive black jackets and ball caps and fabian thinks oh fuck this is it and he remembers what adan always told him to do and he throws his hands up and knows this is going to be a major hassle but nothing that cant be fixed but then he sees that the lead federale is dragging one leg behind him its manuel sanchez no fabian mumbles no no no no he should have shot himself but they grab him up before he can find a gun and force him to watch what they do to his family then they tie him to a chair and one of the bigger men stands behind him and grabs him by his thick black hair so he cant move his head even when manuel shows him the knife this is for raul manuel says he makes short sharp cuts along the top of fabians forehead then grabs each strip of skin and peels it down fabians feet pound the stone floor as manuel skins his face leaving the strips hanging against his chest like the peels of a banana manuel waits until the feet stop and then shoots him in the mouth the baby is dead in his mothers arms art can tell from the way the bodies lieher on top the baby beneath herthat she tried to shield her child its my fault art thinks i brought this on these people im sorry art thinks i am so so sorry bending over the mother and child art makes the sign of the cross and whispers in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti el poder del perro he hears one of the mexican cops murmur the power of the dog chapter thirteen the lives of ghosts when youre headin for the border lord youre bound to cross the line kris kristoffersonborder lord putumayo district colombia art walks into the ruined coca field and plucks a brown wilted leaf from its stem dead plants or dead people he thinks im a farmer in fields of the dead the barren crop i cultivate with only a scythe my landscape of devastation arts incolombia on an informationgathering mission for the vertical committee to make sure the dea and cia are singing to congress from the same hymnal the two agencies and the white house are trying to whip up congressional support for plancolombia a billion aid package tocolombia to destroy the cocaine trade at its source the coca fields in the jungles of the putumayo district of southerncolombia the aid package calls for more money for defoliants more money for airplanes more money for helicopters they took one of those helicopters fromcartagena down to the town ofpuerto asis on theputumayoriver hard by the border withecuador art wandered down to the river a muddy brown ribbon running through the intense almost suffocating green of the jungle and stood above a rickety dock where long narrow canoesthe principal means of transportation in an area with few roadsare loaded with plantains and bundles of firewood javier his escort a young soldier of the twentyfourth brigade hustled down the bank to get him christ art thought the kid cant be more than sixteen years old you cant cross the river javier told him art wasnt thinking of going across but he asked why not javier pointed across the river to the southern bank thats puerto vega farc owns it it was clear that javier was anxious to get away from the riverbank so art walked back with him to safe territory the government controls puerto asis and the north bank of the river around the town but just west of here even on the north side is the farccontrolled town ofpuerto caicedo but puerto asis is auc country art knows all about the autodefensas unidas de colombia the united selfdefense forces of colombia was started by the old mas cocaine lord fidel cardona aka rambo cardona used to operate a rightwing death squad from his las tangas ranch in northerncolombia back in the days when everything was fat and happy in the medellin cartel then cardona turned against pablo escobar and helped the cia track him down a deed for which all his cocaine crimes were forgiven cardona took his shiny new soul and went into politics fulltime auc used to operate just in the northern part of the country its move into theputumayo district is a recent development but when it came in it came in strong and art sees evidence of that everywhere he saw the rightwing paramilitaries all over puerto asiswith their camouflage fatigues and red berets cruising in pickup trucks stopping peasants and searching them or just brandishing their ms and machetes sending a message to the campesinos art thought this is auc turf and we can do what we want with you javier was hustling him to a convoy of army vehicles on the main street art could see john hobbs standing by one of the jeeps tapping his foot impatiently we need a military escort to go out into the countryside art thought we need to hurry senor javier said sure art said i just need something to drink the heat was oppressive arts shirt was already soaked with sweat the soldier led him to a little streetside stand where art got two cans of warm coke one for himself and one for the soldier the stands owner an old lady asked him something in a rapid local dialect that art didnt understand she wants to know how you want to pay javier explained in cash or cocaine what cocaine is like money here the soldier explained the locals carry little bags of powder the way you would carry change most people pay with cocaine buying a soda with cocaine art thought as he pulled some rumpled wet bills from his pocket coke for cokeyeah were winning the war on drugs here he handed the soldier one of the sodas and then joined the tour now he stands in a ruined coca field and rubs the surface of a leaf with his thumb its sticky and he turns to the monsanto representative whos hovering around him like a mosquito and asks are you mixing cosmoflux with the roundup roundup ultra is the trade name for the defoliant glyphosate which the colombian army with american advisers sprays from lowflying airplanes protected by helicopter cover the more things change art thinks firstvietnam then sinaloa nowputumayo well yes it makes it stick to the plants better the monsanto rep says yeah but it also increases the toxic risk to people isnt that right wellin large amounts maybe the flack says but were using small dosages of roundup here and the cosmoflux makes the small amount a lot more effective a lot more bang for your buck what amounts are they using here the monsanto guy doesnt know but art wont quit until he gets the answer he holds the whole junket up while they stop one of the pilots open up his tank and find out after tenacious questioning and some browbeating of the guys who load the tanks art finds that theyre using five liters per acre the monsanto literature recommends a liter per acre as the maximum safe dosage five times the safe dosage art asks john hobbs five times well look into ithobbs says the man has aged i guess i have too art thinks buthobbs looks ancient his white hair is finer his skin almost translucent his blue eyes still sharp even though its plain that they can see the approach of sunset and hes wearing a jacket even though theyre in the jungle and its sweltering hes perpetually cold art thinks in the way that only the old and the dying are no art says ill look into it five times the recommended dose of glyphosate and youre mixing in cosmoflux what are you trying to poison here a crop or a whole environment because he has his suspicions that hes not looking at ground zero in the war on drugs so much as hes looking at ground zero in the war against communist guerrillaswho live hide and fight in the jungle so if you defoliate the jungle as his hosts show him their successes thousands of acres of wilted coca plants art peppers them with endless aggravating questions does it kill just coca or does it poison other crops as well does it kill food cropsbeans bananas maize yucca no well what am i looking at in that field it looks like it was maize to me isnt corn the mainstay of the local diet what do they eat after their food crops are destroyed because this isnt sinaloa art thinks there arent any drug lords who own thousands of acres here most of the cocaine is grown by small campesinos who plant an acre or two at most farc taxes them in its territory auc taxes them on the land it controls where the campesinos have it the worst of course is on territory that both sides actively claimthere they pay double the taxes on the cocaine they harvest as he watches the planes spray he asks how high are they flying a hundred feet even monsantos own specs say that spraying from anything higher than ten feet isnt recommended doesnt that increase the risk of drift onto other crops theres a stiff breeze todayarent your defoliants being blown all over the place youre way off basehobbs tells him am i art asks i want you to get a biochemist out here and test the water in a dozen village wells he makes them take him to a refugee camp where the campesinos have gone to flee the fumigation its little more than a clearing in the jungle with hastily built cinderblock buildings and tinroof shacks he demands to be taken to the clinic where a missionary doctor shows him the kids with exactly the symptoms he was afraid hed seechronic diarrhea skin rashes respiratory problems onepointseven billion dollars to poison kids art askshobbs as they get back into the jeep were in a warhobbs says this is no time to go wobbly arthur its your war too may i remind you that this is the cocaine that empowered such men as adan barerra that money from this cocaine bought the bullets used at el sauzal i dont need a reminder art thinks and who knows where adan is now six months after the raid in baja and the subsequent massacre at el sauzal adan is still in the wind theus government put a million reward on his head but so far no one has stepped forward to collect who wants money youd never live to collect an hours drive later they come to a village thats totally abandoned not a person a pig a chicken a dog nothing all the huts look untouched save for a larger buildingthe communal storage bin by the looks of itwhich has been totally gutted with flame from the inside a ghost town where are the people art asks javier the boy shrugs art asks the officer in charge disappeared he answers they must have run from farc run where now the officer shrugs they spend the night at a small army base north of town after a dinner of steaks grilled over a petrolfueled fire art excuses himself from the party to get a little sleep then slips off to take a look around the base youve been on one firebase youve been on them all art thinks theyre pretty much the same vietnam or colombiaa clearing hacked out of the bush and leveled then enclosed with barbed wire then the perimeter around the base cleared to provide a field of fire this base is roughly bisected art finds out as he prowls around most of it is twentyfourth brigade but he comes to a gate that separates the main part of the base from what appears to be a section reserved for auc he walks along the high barbedwire fence and looks through its a training campart can make out the shooting range and the straw dummies hanging from trees for handtohand practice theyre at it now sneaking up behind the straw dummies with knives as if taking out enemy sentries art watches for a while then goes back to his quarters a small room at the end of one of the barracks buildings near the perimeter the room has a window open but screened with mosquito netting a cot a lamp run off the generator and thankfully an electric fan art sits down on the cot and leans over sweat drips off his nose onto the concrete floor jesus art thinks me and the auc were the same guy he lies down on the bed but cant sleep its hours later when he hears a soft knock outside on the edge of the window its the young soldier javier art goes to the window what is it would you come with me where would you come with me javier repeats you asked where the people went yeah red mist javier says art slips his shoes back on and climbs out through the window he ducks low behind javier and the two of them sneak along the perimeter ducking the searchlight until they come to a small gate the guard sees javier and lets them through they bellycrawl across the fire range and into the bush art follows the kid along a narrow trail that leads down toward the river this is stupid art thinks this is beyond stupid javier could be leading you into a trap he can see the headlines now dea boss kidnapped by farc but he keeps following the kid theres something he has to find out a canoe is waiting on the riverbank javier jumps in and beckons art to do the same were crossing the river art asks javier nods and waves for him to hurry art gets in it takes only a few minutes for them to row across they land the canoe and art helps javier drag it onto the shore when he straightens he sees four masked men with guns standing there take him javier says you little fuck art says but the men dont grab him just gesture for him to follow them west along the bank of the river its a hard sloghe keeps tripping on branches and thick vinesbut finally they arrive at a small clearing and there under the moonlight he sees where the people went headless bodies are washed up on the shore like fish waiting to be cleaned other decapitated trunks are stuck on branches that overhang the river schools of tiny fish are feeding on their bare feet farther up on shore severed heads have been neatly lined up and someone has closed their eyes the guerrillas did this art asks one of the masked men shakes his head then tells him the story auc went to the village yesterday shot the young men and raped the women then they locked most of the survivors inside the villages barn set it on fire and made the rest watch and listen then they took these people to a bridge over the putumayo beheaded them with chain saws and threw their heads and bodies in the river to drift downstream as a warning to the villages below we came to you javier says because we thought that if you could see the truth you would go home and tell it the people in americaif they knew the truth they would not send their money and their soldiers to do this what do you mean our soldiers art asks the auc here the masked man says were trained by your special forces the man gestures to the corpses and says in perfect english your tax dollars at work art says nothing on the trip back theres nothing to say until he gets back to the base and finds hobbs room and bangs on the door the old man is befuddled sleepy he has a thin white robe wrapped around him and looks like a patient in a hospital arthur what time is it good lord where have you been red mist what are you talking about hobbs asked are you drunk but art can see in his eyes that the man knows exactly what hes talking about do you have an op in colombia called red mist no dont you fucking lie to me art says its the phoenix program isnt it for latin america get off the grassy knoll arthur are we training auc art asks thats on a needtoknow basis i need to know he tells hobbs what he saw on the river hobbs opens a plastic bottle of water on his little side table pours himself a glass and drinks it down art watches his hand tremble as he does it then hobbs says youre very foolish arthur and surprisingly naive for a man of your experience obviously farc committed that atrocity to blame it on auc and further alienate the local population and arouse international sympathy it was a common ploy with the vietcong back in the red mist johnwhat is it you should damn well know arthur hobbs snapped you used it on your little incursion into mexico recently in the eyes of the law youre a mass murderer youre as deeply into this as any of us art sits on the bed and slumps over its true he thinks from that moment when we last stood in an army camp in a jungle and i sold my soul to you for revenge when i lied and covered up when i came to you for help in killing adan barrera he feels hobbs sit down beside him the man weighs practically nothing hes like a dead dry leaf dont think about straying off the reservation hobbs says art nods i expect your full support on plan colombia youll get it john art goes back to his room he peels down to his underwear fixes himself a scotch sits on the bed and sweats the fan wheezes in its losing battle against the heat but its trying art thinks its fighting the good fight im just a shill for a covert war the war on drugs ive fought it my whole goddamn life and for what billions of dollars trying unsuccessfully to keep drugs out of the worlds most porous border onetenth of the antidrug budget going into education and treatment ninetenths of those billions into interdiction and not enough money from anywhere going into the root causes of the drug problem itself and the billions spent keeping drug offenders locked up in prison the cells now so crowded we have to give early release to murderers not to mention the fact that twothirds of all the nondrug offenses in america are committed by people high on dope or alcohol and our solutions are the same futile nonsolutionsbuild more prisons hire more police spend more and more billions of dollars not curing the symptoms while we ignore the disease most people in my area who want to kick drugs cant afford to get into a treatment program unless they have bluechip health insurance which most of them dont and theres a sixmonthtotwoyear waiting list to get a bed in a subsidized treatment program were spending almost billion poisoning cocaine crops and kids over here while theres no money at home to help someone who wants to get off drugs its insanity art cant decide whether the war on drugs is an obscene absurdity or an absurd obscenity in either case its a tragic bloody farce emphasis on the bloody so much blood so many bodies so many more night visitors the usual guests plus the dead of el sauzal now the ghosts of the rio putumayo the room is getting crowded he gets up and walks to the window to try to get a breath of fresh air moonlight reflects off a rifle barrel art drops to the floor machinegun fire rips the mosquito netting to shreds shatters the window frame pockmarks the wall above arts bed he presses himself to the floor and hears the wailing of an alarm horn the sound of boots running rifles cocked shouting confusion his door bursts open and the officer in charge comes in with his pistol drawn are you hurt senor keller i dont think so dont worry well get them twenty minutes later art sits with hobbs in the mess tent drinking coffee letting his nerves come down from the adrenaline high are you still so fond of the humanitarian agrarian reformers of farc hobbs asks dryly a little while later the officer comes back with three of his soldiers and tosses a young manscared shaking and obviously beatenat arts feet art looks down at the kidhe could be javiers twin brother shit art thinks he could be my kid this is one of them the officer says then kicks the kid in the face the others got away art says dont tell him what you told me the officer says his boot pushing the kids face into the floor tell him the kid starts talking hes not a guerrilla hes not from farc they wouldnt dare attack an army base we were just trying to make the money the kid says what money art asks the kid tells him adan barrera will pay over million to the person who kills arthur keller farc and barrera hobbs says same thing arts not so sure hes only sure that either he will kill adan or adan will kill him and those are the only two ways this thing can end sinaloa mexico san diego california adan also lives with ghosts his brothers ghost for instance protects him most of mexico believes that it was raul who conducted the massacre at el sauzal that the rumors of his death are a screen to protect him from the police and most of mexico is too scared of him to make a move against either barrera brother but what adan feels is the pain of his brothers death and rage that it was art keller who killed him so his brother deserves vengeance and his ghost cannot be laid to rest until adan has settled with keller so theres the ghost of raul and then theres noras ghost when they told him that she was dead he couldnt believe it at first wouldnt believe it then they showed him the obituary the americans claiming that she was killed in a car accident driving home from ensenada her body brought back to california for burial a closed casket to disguise the fact that they murdered her that keller had murdered her adan gave her a proper funeral in badiraguato a cross with her photo was carried through the village while musicians sang corridos to her courage and beauty he built a tomb of the finest marble with the inscription tienes mi alma en tus manos you have my soul in your hands he has a mass said for her every day and money appears daily at the shrine of santo jesus malverde in her name and every day flowers appear on her grave in la jolla cemetery a standing order placed with a mexican florist who knows only that he must bring the best and that the bill will be paid it makes adan feel a little better but he wont be satisfied until he has avenged her hes put out a million reward for the person who kills art keller adding the extra hundred thousand so that the bounty is higher than the one the united states is offering for him its a foolish indulgence he knows but a matter of pride it doesnt matter he has the money adan has spent the past six months patiently and painstakingly reconstructing his entire organization the irony is after all the events of last year that hes richer and more powerful than ever all his communications are on the net now scrambled and encoded with technology that even the americans cant crack he sends out orders through the net checks his accounts on the net sells his product on the net and gets paid on the net he moves his money in the blink of an electronic eye launders it literally faster than the speed of sound without ever touching a dollar bill or a peso he can and does kill over the net he just types a message and sends it and someone leaves the physical world theres no need to show up anywhere in real space or time anymore in fact it would be a foolish indulgence ive become a ghost myself he thinks existing only in cyberspace he physically lives in a modest house outside badiraguato its good to be back in sinaloa back in the countryside among the campesinos the fields have finally recovered from operation condorthe soil is refreshed and revitalized and the poppies bloom in splendid shades of red orange and yellow which is a good thing because heroin is back to hell with the colombians and farc and the chinese and all of that the cocaine market is in sharp decline anyway good old mexican mud is in demand again in the states and the poppies are weeping once more this time with joy the days of the gomeros are back and i am the patron he has a quiet life up early in the morning to a cafe con leche that his old abuela housekeeper has made for him and then hes on the computer to check his investments to oversee the business to give orders then he has a lunch of cold meats and fruit and goes to the screenedin balcony upstairs for a short siesta then he gets up and takes a walk along the old dirt road that runs outside the house manuel walks with him still on guard as if there were any real danger certainly manuel is happy to be back in sinaloa with his family and his friends although he still insists on living in the little casita behind the main house after his walk adan goes back to the computer and works until dinnertime and then he might drink a beer or two and watch a futbol or boxing match on television some evenings he will sit out on the lawn and the sound of guitars will drift down to him from the village on still nights he can make out the words theyre singing of the exploits of raul and the treachery of el tiburon and how adan barrera outfoxed the federales and the yanquis and will never be caught he goes to bed early its a quiet life a good life and it would be a perfect life if it were not for the ghosts rauls ghost noras ghost the ghosts of an estranged family he now communicates with gloria only over the net it is the only secure way but it pains him that his daughter is now only a configuration of electronic dots on a screen they echat almost every night though and she sends him pictures but it is hard not seeing her or hearing her voiceterrible reallyand he blames keller for this as well in truth there are other ghosts they come when he lies down and shuts his eyes he sees the faces of gueros children sees them plunging down onto the rocks he hears their voices in the wind no one he thinks sings songs about that no one puts that moment to music nor do they sing of el sauzal but those ghosts come too and father juan he comes most of all gently chiding but theres nothing i can do about that ghost he thinks i have to focus on what i can do what i have to do kill art keller hes busy planning that and running his business when the world comes crashing down around him he sits down at the computer to get his message from gloria but its not his daughter online saying hi its his wife and if an instant message could scream this one would adangloria had a stroke shes at scripps mercy hospital my god what happened uncommon but by no means rare for someone with her condition the pressure on the carotid artery simply became too much lucia had gone into her bedroom and found gloria unconscious the etechs were unable to revive her shes on life support tests are being run but the prognosis isnt hopeful absent a miracle lucia will soon have to make a very difficult decision dont take her off life support adan dont theres no hope even if she does make it they say shed be a dont say it youre not here ive talked to my priest he says its morally acceptable to i dont care what a priest says adan ill be there tonight tomorrow morning at the latest she wont know you adan she wouldnt know if you were here or not ill know all right adan ill wait for you well make the decision together twelve hours later adan waits in the penthouse of the apartment building overlooking the border crossing at san ysidro he peers through a pair of nightscope binoculars waiting for two things to come togetherthe bribed guard on the mexican side has to come on duty at the same time as the bribed agent on the american side its supposed to happen at ten but if it doesnt hes going to make the run anyway he just hopes it happens it will make it easier still hes not taking any chances he doesnt have to he has to get to that hospital so he waits for the change of shifts at the border stations and then the phone rings the single number appears on the little screen go two minutes later hes downstairs in the parking structure standing outside a lincoln navigator stolen that morning in rosarito and fitted out with clean plates a nervous young man holds the back door open for him he cant be more than twentytwo or twentythree adan thinks and his hand is trembling and moist with sweat and for a second adan wonders if its just because the kid is nervous or because this is a trap and he says you realize that if you betray me your whole family will die yes adan gets in the back where another young man probably the drivers brother removes the cushion off the backseat to reveal a box adan gets in lies down fits the breathing apparatus over his nose and mouth and starts to take in oxygen as the seat is replaced over him he lies in the dark and hears the whine of the electric screwdriver as it replaces the screws adan is locked inside the box its too much like a coffin he fights off the initial panic of claustrophobia and forces himself to breathe slowly and steadily you cant waste air hyperventilating he tells himself the radio stations list the current wait at the border as fortyfive minutes but that estimate could be wrong and they will still have to drive a few minutes beyond that to find a place isolated enough to stop and get him out and thats if everything goes well thats if this isnt a trap all theyd have to do he thinks to collect a huge reward is to drive you straight to a police station guess what we have in the box or worse they could be in the employ of one of your enemies and then all theyd have to do is drive to an isolated desert canyon and leave the truck there leave you to suffocate or bake in tomorrows sun or just stick a rag in the gas tank light it and dont think that way he tells himself just think that it will go as alltoohastily planned that these boys are loyal really theres been too little time for them to plan a betrayal that youll breeze through the bribed border checks and that in three hours or so youll be holding glorias hand and maybe her eyes will flutter open maybe there will be a miracle so he slows his breathing and waits time passes slowly in a coffin lots of time to think about a dying daughter children plunging from a bridge hell a lot of time to think then he hears muffled voicesthe border patrol agent asking questions how long have you been in mexico why did you go down are you bringing anything back do you mind if i look in the back adan hears the car door open and then close theyre moving again adan can tell by the subtle shift inside the box maybe its his imagination or maybe the air actually is suddenly a little cooler inside the fetid container and he literally breathes a bit easier as the car speeds up then it slows again and hes getting knocked around inside the box on the apparently bumpy road and then the car comes to a stop adan clutches the pistola in the waistband of his pants and waits if theyve betrayed him this might be the moment when the box lid will come open and men with pistols or machine guns will be standing over him waiting to blast away or he thinks with a shudder they might just never open the box or they might light a match then he hears the electric whine of the screwdriver the lid is lifted off and the young driver stands there smiling at him adan rips the breathing apparatus off his nose and takes the proffered hand as the kid helps him out of the box he stands stiffly in the dust of the dirt road and sees a white lexus parked to the side another smiling kid his neck festooned with gang tattoos hands him a set of keys you start it adan says you go turn the key you go up in a ball of flame and jagged metal when the bomb goes off beneath you the kid turns pale but nods gets into the lexus and starts it up the motor purrs the gangbanger gets out of the car and giggles adan gets in where are we they tell him give him directions to get off this dirt road and onto the freeway fifty minutes later he pulls into the hospitals parking lot adan crosses the parking lot imagining dozens of eyes on him no one appears from a car no men in blue windbreakers with dea on them come yelling and screaming and telling him to hit the ground there is only the sad eerie quiet of a hospital parking lot he crosses to the entrance goes inside and finds that his daughters room is on the eighth floor the elevator doors slide open lucia sits on a bench in the hallway hunched over tears streaming down her face he puts his arms around her am i too late unable to speak she shakes her head i want to see her adan says he opens the door to his daughters room and goes inside art keller sticks a gun in his face hello adan my daughter shes fine adan feels something sharp stick through his shirt and sting him in the back then the world goes black art and shag put adans unconscious body on a gurney and take him down to the morgue put him in a body bag strap him back on the gurney and roll him out to a van painted with hidalgo funeral home fortyfive minutes later theyre at a secure location it was relatively easy to force lucia to betray her husband and maybe the lousiest thing art had ever done in his life theyd been on her for months keeping the house under surveillance the land line tapped the cell phone monitored trying to break the cybercode that sent messages back and forth between adan barrera and his daughter art had to appreciate the irony that it was numbers that eventually gave them the key lucias bank accounts no matter how they laundered their money lucia couldnt account for her assets end of story she didnt work but had a lifestyle that showed considerable income art had approached her and pointed this out when she came out of a gourmet deli near their home in an expensive part of rancho bernardo shes still an attractive woman art thought when he watched her come out rolling a grocery cart in front of her her body trim from her threetimesaweek pilates class her hair coiffed and skillfully tinted in shades of amber at jose eber up at la costa mrs barrera she looked startled then almost tired i use my maiden name she said looking at the badge he proffered i know nothing about my husbands business or his whereabouts now please excuse me i have to pick up my daughter from shes an honorroll student right art asked smiling despite feeling like a piece of shit glee club honors english and math let me ask you a question hows she going to fare with you in prison he laid it out for her right there in the stripmall parking lot at the very least she goes for incometax evasion but the worstcase scenarioand i think i can make it stick art addedis that she gets nailed with receiving narcotics money which puts her in the thirtytolife ballpark ill take your house your cars your bank accounts art said youll be in a federal lockup and gloria will be on welfare you think medicaid will take care of her health needs she can stand in line at the walkin clinic see the very best doctors attaboy art he thought use a terminally ill kid as leverage he made himself remember the babys corpse at el sauzal gripped in his dead mothers arms she reaches into her purse for her phone im calling my lawyer have him meet you at the federal jail downtown art said because thats where were going listen i can send someone over to school to pick up gloria explain that moms in jail theyll take her to the polaski center shell make a lot of nice new friends there you are the lowest form of human life no art said im the second lowest you married the lowest you still take his money you dont care where it comes from would you like to see some photos of how adan makes his childsupport payments i have some in my car lucia starts to cry my daughter is very ill she has many health issues that she couldnt stand to be without her mother art said i understand he let her think about it for a minute or so knowing the decision she had to make she dried her eyes what she asked do you want me to do now art finishes typing something into his laptop computer and looks down at adan who is handcuffed to a bed adan opens his eyes comes to and realizes that hes not going to wake up from this nightmare when adan recognizes art he says im surprised im still alive me too why didnt you kill me because im tired of all the killing art says to himself i am sick to my soul of all the blood but he answers i have better plans for you let me tell you about the federal prison in marion illinois youll spend twentythree hours a day alone in an eightbyseven cell that you cant even see out of youll get one hour a day to walk back and forth alone between two cinderblock walls topped with razor wire and a tantalizing slice of blue sky youll get two tenminute showers a week youll get your crappy meals pushed to you through a slot youll lie on a metal rack with a thin blanket and the lights will be on twentyfourseven youll squat like an animal over an open toilet with no seat and smell your own shit and piss and i wont push for the death penalty ill push for life without parole youre what midforties i hope you have a long life adan starts to laugh now youre going to play by the rules art youre going to take me into court good luck viejo you dont have any witnesses he laughs and laughs and laughs feeling only a little disconcerted when art starts to laugh with him then art sets the computer in front of adan flips the screen open and presses a couple of keys surprise motherfucker adan looks into the screen and sees a ghost nora sits in a chair looking impatiently at a magazine then she looks at her watch frowns and then looks back at the magazine live feed art says then shuts the screen you think she wont flip on you art asks adan you think she wont testify against you because she loves you so much you think shes going to spend the rest of her life in the hole so that you can walk id trade my life for hers yeah youre so fucking noble art can feel adan thinking that little computer inside his head whirring reconfiguring the new situation coming up with a solution we can make a deal adan says you have nothing to deal with art says thats the problem with being at the top adanyou cant trade up you got nothing to trade red mist what red mist adan says you dont know no americans never do its not just the drugs you buy that are soaked in blood its your oil your coffee your security the only difference between you and me is that i acknowledge what i do adan had made copies of the contents of paradas briefcase of course he did only an idiot wouldnt have the information is in a safedeposit box in grand cayman and contains evidence that could bring down two governments it details operation cerberus and the federacions cooperation with the americans in the contra drugsforarms operation it talks about operation red mist about how mexico city washington and the drug cartels sponsored assassinations of leftwing figures in latin america theres evidence of the assassinations of two officials to fix the mexican presidential elections and proof of mexico citys active partnership with the federacion thats in the briefcase he has more inside his headspecifically knowledge of the colosio assassination as well as kellers perjury to the congressional committee investigating cerberus so maybe keller will have him put away for life and maybe he wont adan lays out the deal if they dont reach a satisfactory arrangement within thirtysix hours hell have a package of tapes and documents delivered to the senate subcommittee i may wind up in a federal prison adan says but we might be cell mates nothing to trade up adan thinks how about the government of the united states what do you want art asks a new life for me and for nora art looks at him for a long time adan smiles like the proverbial cat then art says go fuck yourself hes glad that adan has the evidence hes glad it will come out its time to eat truth like bitter dirt you think im afraid of prison adan where the hell do you think i am now nora sets the magazine down and paces around the room shes done a lot of that over the past few months first when they were weaning her off the drugs then after she felt better out of sheer tedium shes told them she wanted to leave a hundred times a hundred times brown eyes has given her the same answer its not safe yet what im a prisoner youre not a prisoner then i want to leave its not safe yet his were the first eyes shed seen when she came to that horrible night back on the sea of cortez she was lying in the bottom of a small boat and she opened her eyes and saw his brown eyes staring down at her not cold like a lot of men have stared at her not filled with desire but with concern a pair of brown eyes she was coming back to life she had started to say something but he shook his head and put his finger to his lips like he was hushing a small child she tried to move but couldntshe was wrapped in something warm and tight like a sleeping bag that was a little too small then he gently brushed the palm of his hand over her eyes as if he were telling her to go back to sleep and she did even now her memories of that night are vague shes heard people on goofy talk shows tell about alien abductions and it was sort of like that without the probes or the medical experiments she does remember being stuck with a needle though and wrapped in this thing like a bag and she doesnt recall being scared when they zipped it closed over her head because there was a little black screen over her face and she could breathe all right she remembers being placed on another boat a bigger one then onto an airplane and then there was another needle and when she woke up she was in this room and he was there im here to keep you safe was about all hed say he wouldnt even tell her his name so she just started calling him brown eyes later that first day he put her on the phone with art keller its just for a little while keller reassured her wheres adan she asked we missed him keller said we got raul though were pretty sure hes dead and so are you keller added he explained the whole ruse to her even though they had set up fabian martinez as the soplon it was still better if everyone especially adan thought that she had died otherwise adan would never stop trying to get her back or alternatively to have her killed well put out the word you died in a car accident keller said adan will know that you were killed in the raid of course and read the news as a coverup and thats all right too it was weird when brown eyes brought in her obituary to show her it was brief listed her profession as an event planner and gave a few details of the funeralcalling hours all that shit she wondered who attended her father probably no doubt stoned her mother of course and haley and that was probably about it a little while turns into a long while keller calls in about once a week saying that he was still working on getting adan saying that hed like to come see her but it wouldnt be safe the mantra nora thinks it wouldnt be safe for her to go for a walk it wouldnt be safe for her to go shopping to a movie to resume any kind of life anytime she asks brown eyes about any of this the answer is always the same he looks at her with those puppydog eyes and says it wouldnt be safe just let me know what you need brown eyes tells her ill get it for you it becomes one of her few sources of entertainment sending brown eyes out on increasingly complicated shopping missions she gives him detailed requests for hardtofind expensive cosmetics very particular instructions as to the particular shade of blouse she needs fussy impossibleforamantounderstand requests for designer clothes from her favorite shops he does it all except for her request for a dress from her favorite boutique in la jolla keller says i cant go there he says apologetically it wouldnt be safe she says then for revenge she sends him out to buy feminine products and lingerie she hears him kickstart his motorcycle and roar off and she spends the hours that he is gone enjoying the thought of him stumbling redfaced through victorias secret and having to ask a saleslady for help but she doesnt really like it when hes gone because it leaves her alone with the weird trio of the other bodyguards she goes along with the silly charade that she doesnt know their names although she can hear them talking to one another from her room the old man mickey is sweet enough and brings her cups of tea obop the one with the kinky red hair is just strange but looks at her as if he wants to fuck her which shes used to its the other one who really disturbs herthe fat one who incessantly eats peaches straight from the can big peaches jimmy piccone they pretend not to remember each other but i remember you she thinks my first professional fuck she remembers his brutality his sheer ugliness that he used her so that she felt like a rag that he jerked off into she remembers that night well so she remembers callan it took her a while especially as she was still so whackedout when they first brought her here but it was callanbrown eyeswho eased her off the pills gave her ice chips to suck on when she was so thirsty but was still throwing up everything stroked her hair while she hunched over the john talked bullshit to her during the bad insomniac hours played cards with her all night sometimes cajoled her into eating again made her dry toast and chicken broth and made a special trip out to get her tapioca pudding just because she mentioned that it sounded good it was when she had pretty much detoxed and was feeling better that she remembered where shed seen him before my debut as a hooker she thinks my comingout party to be introduced to john society he was the one i wanted for my first she remembers because he looked gentle and sweet and i liked his brown eyes i remember you she said when he came into the room with her lunch a banana and some wheat toast he looked surprised said shyly i remember you too that was a long time ago a long time a lots happened since then yeah so although it was boring in her confinement as she came to call it she was really doing all right they got her a television and a radio and a walkman a collection of cds and a whole bunch of books and magazines and they even created a little outdoor workout area for her callan and mickey putting up a wooden fence even though there wasnt another house around for miles then going out and getting her a treadmill and a stationary bicycle so she could exercise and read and watch tv and she was really doing all right until the night she settled into bed and pbs came on with a special hour about the war on drugs and she saw footage of the massacre at el sauzal she felt the breath catch in her throat as the narrator speculated that the entire family of fabian martinezel tiburonhad been executed in reprisal for his becoming an informer to the dea her entire body trembled as she saw the footage of the corpses splayed around the courtyard she made callan get keller on the phone right then why didnt you tell me she screamed into the phone i thought it better that you didnt know you shouldnt have done it she cried you shouldnt have done it she went into a tailspin after that a lieinbed fetalposition notgetup noteat depression nineteen lives she brooded women children a baby for me her bodyguards were terrified callan would come into her room and sit at the foot of her bed like a dog not talking or anything just sitting as if he could protect her from the pain that was slicing her up from the inside but he couldnt do anything nobody could she would just lie there then one day callan looking very serious handed her the phone and it was keller and he said simply we got him john hobbs and sal scachi also react to the news of adans capture i really thought that arthur would simply kill him hobbs says it would have been simpler now we have a problem scachi says we do indeed hobbs says this has become something of a mess we need to start cleaning it up adan barrera dead is one thing adan barrera alive and talking particularly in court is another and arthur keller its difficult to know whats on his mind these days no its prudent to make other arrangements john hobbs gets on the phone to do just that he makes a call to venezuela sal scachi goes to clean things up the teakettle whistles harsh loud will you shut that fucking thing off peaches yells you and your fucking tea mickey

whats going on she asks he doesnt answer just pulls her into the main room the fuck you doing peaches asks leaving peaches reaches for the pistol tucked in his jacket pocket uhuhn callan says peaches thinks better of it obop whines callan what are you doing he starts to ease his hand toward a shotgun lying on the old couch dont make me hurt you stevie callan says that would be too bad seeing as how all this all this started with him trying to save obops life i dont wanna hurt you obop obviously decides he dont want to be hurt either because his hand stays where it is have you considered this carefully mickey asks him no callan thinks i aint considered nothing carefully only that im not letting anybody kill this woman he keeps himself in front of her and backs out the door his gun trained on his old crew i see any of you i kill you hop on he tells her he gets on the bike hold on to my waist callan says good thing she does because he rabbitstarts the bike and it shoots like a missile out of there sending up a thick cloud of dust behind it she holds on tighter when he steers onto a dirt track up a steep hill the back wheel fishtailing around in the soft dirt he stops the bike at the top of the hill a shallow dusty patch stripped bare by the fierce santa ana winds around it nothing but thick chapparal he says hold on then she feels herself falling plunging down the hill in a freefall gunshots chase them callan ignores them concentrates on driving the bike past the shack past some cars past the men who scramble behind the cars then reach for guns then duck as the lead splatters into glass but she can barely see any of this its a blur and she can hardly hear the shots the bullets zipping past her ears the startled shouts all she can really see now is the back of his helmet as she lays her head into his shoulder and holds on its as if shes in a wind tunnel the force of the wind trying to rip her off the back of the bike theyre going so fast so fast so fast down this dirt road its dark now blackness closing in around her in this tunnel of speed shes knows now theyre running for their lives racing toward their lives throwing fate to the wind faith to the wind her faith on the back of this madman driving the rough dirt road rattling her bouncing her suddenly theyre in the air airborne airborn hurled at this speed into the night sky by a small bump shes flying flying with him the stars the stars are beautiful theyre going to crash theyre going to die their blood will pool on this dirt road their common blood she can feel her blood pumping she can feel his their blood coursing as it soars through the night sky then they land the bike tipping over out of control into a long skid she holds on tight she doesnt want to die alone she wants to die with him in this long slide to death this long slow fast slide to oblivion a moment of agony then nothing then nothingness then peace she always thought you flew to heaven but you fall fall fall falling she holds him hugs him embraces him dont let me die alone i dont want to die alone and then he rights the bike theyre up again racing the air is cool around her ears the leather warm against her skin against her face he takes a deep gulp of the cold air and she swears she hears herself laugh over the engines thunderor is that her heartbut she hears herself laugh and hears him laugh and then its suddenly smooth under the wheels smooth and black as they hit asphalt beautiful slick black american road american highway the highway lights are golden in the night jimmy peaches steps out onto the porch got himself a freshly opened can of doles and a spoon and theres a pretty sliver of a silver moon out and its a good time to think maybe this is what callan had in mind the whole time the scheming irish fuck or maybe he and the chick were planning it together all them times he was bringing her cups of tea just like callan always the lone wolf sal aint gonna be happy called with his instructionsim coming for a meeting i want to make sure everyone is there well scachi will hunt callan down and teach him a lesson about fucking his friends he digs the spoon into the can a slice of peach somersaults into the air juice splatters on peaches chest he looks down surprised that its golden red the color of a fiery sunset he didnt know they made those kind of peaches his chest feels all sticky and warm and he wonders why the sun is setting twice tonight the next round smacks him squarely in his broad forehead obop sees this as he looks out the window through the little octagonal wire screen his mouth gapes into a perfect o as he sees peaches brains jet out the back of his head and hit the cabin wall and thats all he sees as a bullet zips into his open mouth and explodes in his cerebral cortex mickey sees him melt like spring snow and puts the kettle on the water is just starting to roil at the bottom of the kettle when scachi and two shooters come in the door their rifles leveled at him sal mickey i was just having tea mickey says sal nods the kettle whistles mickey pours the water into the chipped mug and dips the tea bag a few times the bowl rattles as he spoons in some sugar and a little milk and then the spoon knocks against the side of the mug as his shaking hand stirs the tea he lifts the mug to his mouth and takes a sip then he smilesits good and its hotand nods to sal scachi takes him out quick and clean then steps over his body to go into the bedroom shes not there and wheres callan his harleys gone fuck callans taken the woman and is doing a solo scachi thinks and now im going to have to track him down but first theres cleanup to be done within a couple of hours his men have set up a meth lab in the cabin they drag peaches body back in and pour hydriodic acid around inside then walk back to the facing hillside and shoot an incendiary round through the window the firefighters are lucky that nighttheres little wind and the fire from the methlab explosion burns only about twelve acres of some old grass and chapparal up the hill thats not so bad in fact its good to have a fire like that every once in a while burns off the old grass so the new grass can grow in its place chapter fourteen pastoral love is all we have the only way that each can help the other euripides orestes san diegocounty they get up early and ride therell be people looking for us callan tells her no kidding nora thinks when they finally stopped driving last night and pulled over shed demanded to know just what the hell was going on they were going to kill you callan answered he found them a cheap motel a little ways off the highway and grabbed a few hours sleep he shakes her awake at four and tells her they need to get going but the bed is so nice and warm she pulls the blanket up over her mouth and settles in for just a few more minutes anyway hes taking a showerthrough the cheap paneled walls she can hear the water running ill get up she thinks when i hear the water stop next thing she knows his hand is on her shoulder nudging her awake again we gotta get going she gets up finds her sweater and jeans where she tossed them over the rooms one chair and puts them on im going to need some new clothes well get you some he looks at her sitting on the bed and cant believe shes really with him cant believe what he did doesnt know what the consequences will be doesnt care shes so beautiful even looking tired and rumpled in clothes that do smell but they smell like her she finishes tying a shoe looks up and catches him looking its always cold at four in the morning can be the middle of summer in the middle of the amazon jungleif you just got out of bed at four in the morning its still cold he sees her shivering and gives her his leather jacket what about you she asks im okay she takes the jacket its too big but she wraps the sleeves around her and the old jacket is soft and warm and it feels as if his arms are holding her like they held her last night men have given her diamond necklaces versace dresses furs none of them ever felt as good as that jacket she climbs on the back of the bike and then has to push the sleeves up so she can hold on to him they head east on interstate there are mostly just truck drivers on the road and a few old pickups full of mojado fieldworkers headed for the farms out by brawley callan drives until he sees a turnoff for something called sunrise highway sounds about right he thinks and turns north onto that the road climbs in sharp switchbacks up the steep southern slope ofmountlaguna past the little town ofdescanso then runs along the top of the mountain ridge with deep pine forest to their left side and hundreds of feet below the ridge to their right a desert and the sunrise is spectacular they stop at a pulloff and watch the sun come up over the desert floor lighting it in tones changing from red to orange and then into the subtle panoply of desert brownstan beige dun and of course sand then they get back on the bike and ride some more along the mountaintop as the forest gives way to chaparral and then to long stretches of grasslands and then they come to the edge of a lake near the junction with highway callan turns south on and they drive around the edge of the lake until they come to a little restaurant sitting right by the water he pulls up in front they go inside the place is pretty quieta few fishermen a couple of men who look like ranchers and who glance up from their plates as callan and nora come in they pick a table by the window with a view of the small lake callan orders two fried eggs bacon and hash browns nora orders tea and dry toast eat some real food callan says im not hungry suit yourself she doesnt touch the tea or the toast when callans done wolfing down his eggs they go outside and take a walk along the lakeshore so what are we doing nora asks taking a walk beside a lake im serious so am i he says there are pine trees on the other side of the lake their needles shimmer in the breeze which kicks up little whitecaps on the water theyre going to be looking for me you want them to find you callan asks no she says not for a while anyway the way i feel he says i just want to live for a while you know i dont know how all this is going to turn out but i just want to live for a while are you good with that yeah she answers yeah im real good with that he does want to take some precautions though well have to get rid of the bike he says theyll be looking for it and it sticks out too much they find a new vehicle a few miles south on an old farmhouse sits down in a bowl off to the east of the highway one of those classic whitetrash front yards with old cars and old car parts scattered around outside an old barn and a few dilapidated shacks that might have once been chicken coops callan steers down the dirt road and stops the bike outside the barn inside of which a guy in the inevitable ball cap is working on a mustang hes tall skinny maybe fifty years old although its hard to tell under the cap callan looks at the mustang what do you want for it nothin the guy says aint sellin this one sellin any of them the guy points to a limegreen grand am sitting outside the passengerside door dont open from the outside you gotta open it from the inside they walk over to the car but does the engine run callan asks oh yeah the engine runs real good callan gets in and turns the key the engine comes to life like snow white after the kiss how much callan asks i dunno eleven hundred pink slip pink slip registration plates all that callan walks back to the bike takes twenty hundreddollar bills out of the sidesaddle and hands them to the guy a thousand for the car the rest for forgetting you ever saw us the guy takes the money hey anytime you dont want me to see you come back callan gives nora the keys follow me she follows him north on to julian where they turn east on down the long curving grade to the desert across a long flat stretch until he finally pulls off on a dirt road and stops about a halfmile from where the road stops at the mouth of a canyon this should do he says when she gets out of the car meaning that the fire wont spread here in the sand and there probably wont be anyone around to notice the smoke he siphons some gas from his spare tank then pours it over the harley you want to say goodbye he asks her goodbye he tosses the match they watch the bike burn a viking funeral she says except were not in it he walks back to the grand am gets in the drivers seat and slides over to open the door for her where do you want to go somewhere nice somewhere quiet he thinks about it if anyone does discover the bikes skeleton and connects it to us theyll probably think we headed east across the desert to catch a flight somewhere from tucson or phoenix or maybe las vegas so when they get back to the highway he backtracks west where are we going nora asks she doesnt really care shes just curious which is a good thing because he answers i dont know he doesnt either he doesnt have anything in mind except to drive enjoy the scenery enjoy being with her they climb back up the same road they came down into the mountains to the little town of julian they drive right throughthey dont want to be around other peopleand then the road starts heading down again as the terrain slopes toward the coastal plain to the west and the land flattens into broad fields and apple orchards and horse ranches and then they go down a long hill from which they can see a beautiful valley below in the middle of the valley theres a crossroads with one highway going north and another going west there are a few buildings scattered around the junctiona post office a market a diner a bakery an unlikely art gallery on the north side an old general store and a few white cottages on the south side and beyond that theres nothing on any side just the road cutting through the broad grassland with cattle grazing on it and she says this is beautiful he pulls off on the gravel driveway beside the cabins goes into the old general store which now sells books and gardening stuff and comes out a few minutes later with a key we got one for a month he says unless you hate it then we can get our money back and go someplace else it has a small front room with an old sofa and a couple of chairs and a table and a small kitchen with a gas stove and an old refrigerator and a sink with wooden cupboards above it a single door leads to the tiny bedroom which has an even tinier bathroomshower no bathin back were not going to lose each other in this place she thinks hes still standing tentatively in the front doorway its fine with me she says how about you its good its fine he lets the door shut behind him were the kellys by the way im tom youre jean im jean kelly i didnt think of that after she showers and gets dressed they drive the four miles back up the hill to julian to shop for clothes the one main street is flanked mostly by little restaurants selling the apple pie that is the local specialty but there are a few boutiques where she buys a couple of casual dresses and a sweater but they buy most of their clothes at the hardware store which sells denim shirts jeans socks and underwear down the street nora finds a bookstore that sells used paperbacks and she buys copies of anna karenina middlemarch the eustace diamonds and a couple of nora roberts romancesguilty pleasures then they drive back down to the market across the highway from their cottage and buy groceriesbread milk coffee tea raisin bran his favorite grapenuts hers bacon eggs sourdough bread a couple of steaks some chicken potatoes rice asparagus green beans tomatoes grapefruit brown rice an apple pie some red wine and some beerand sundriespaper towels dish detergent toilet paper deodorant toothpaste and toothbrushes soap shampoo a razor and blades shaving cream a haircolor kit and a pair of scissors theyve agreed to take some precautionsnot to run but not to be needlessly foolhardy either so the harley had to go and so does her shoulderlength hair because while callans looks are pretty ordinary hers arent and the first thing their pursuers will ask people is if theyve noticed a strikingly beautiful blond woman im not so beautiful anymore she tells him yeah you are so back at the cottage she cuts her hair short looks in the mirror when shes finished and says joan of arc i like it liar but when she looks in the mirror she kind of likes it too even more so after she dyes it red well she thinks itll be easier to take care of anyway so here i am short short red hair a denim shirt and jeans whod have thought it your turn she says snapping the scissors get outta here it needs cutting anyway she says you got that s look going on come on just let me trim it no chicken thats me guys have paid a lot of money to have me do this cut their hair youre kiddin hey its a big world out there tommy your hands are shaking then youd better hold still he lets her cut it sits perfectly still on the chair looking at her image and his as she stands behind him and snips away brown locks of his hair falling first on his shoulders and then on the floor she finishes and they look at themselves in the mirror i dont recognize us she says do you no he thinks i dont that evening he makes chicken broth for her and steak and potatoes for himself and they sit down at the table and eat and watch television and when the news comes on about a meth lab blowing up and bodies found he dont say nothin to her about it because its clear she dont know he tries to feel bad about peaches and obop but he cant them two ushered too many people into the next world and you had to know it was always gonna end that way for them like its gonna end for me he feels bad about mickey though but the news also means that scachi is tracking them down she has a rough nightshe cant sleep and she doesnt want to see whats on the inside of her eyes he gets thathe owns a lot of the same pictures only maybe im more hardened to them he thinks so he lies behind her and holds her and tells her irish stories he remembers from when he was a kid well he sort of remembers them and he makes up what he dont which isnt too hard because you just got to talk about fairies and leprechauns and shit like that fairy tales and fables she finally nods off about four in the morning and he sleeps too with his hand gripped on the under the pillow she wakes up hungry no shit callan thinks and they walk across the highway to the restaurant and she orders a cheese omelet with link sausages on the side and rye toast with lots of butter the waitress asks you want american cheese cheddar or jack yes she eats like the condemned the woman sucks down that omelet as if its her last meal as if theyre waiting outside to walk her that last mile down to old sparky callan suppresses a smile as he watches her wield her fork like its a weaponthose link sausages dont have a chanceand he doesnt tell her about the small smear of butter at the corner of her mouth didnt like it he asks it was wonderful get another one no cinnamon roll okay they were baked fresh this morning the waitress says as she sets down the huge pastry and two forks nora goes outside and comes back with the san diego uniontribune and scans the personal ads kim from her sister family emergency looking for you everywhere urgent you contact with a phone number typical keller she thinks covering all the bases just in case as is the case im a free agent on the run of my own free will so arthur wants me to come in im not coming arthur not just yet if you want me youll have to find me hes trying arts troops are out in force at airports train stations bus stations shipping ports they check passenger manifests reservations passport control hobbs guys check immigration records in france england and brazil they know theyre on a fools errand but by the end of the week one thing seems certain nora hayden hasnt left the countryat least not on her own passport nor has she used any of her credit cards or her cell phone tried to get a job been stopped for a traffic offense or put her social security number down to rent an apartment art puts the heat on haley saxon and has her threatened with everything from violating the mann act and running a disorderly house to being an accessory to attempted murder so he believes her when she swears she hasnt heard from nora and will call him the instant she does neither his listening posts on the border nor hobbs across it pick up a trail not her talking not anyone talking about her art drags an accident reconstruction guy out to measure the depth of callans motorcycle tracks and the guy does some mojo with the dirt and tells art that there were definitely two people on that bike and that he hopes the passenger was holding on tight because it was moving fast callan couldnt have taken her all that far art reasons he couldnt have taken a prisoner on a plane a train or a bus and there are so many places a prisoner could get off the back of a bikeat a gas station a red light a junction so art narrows the search to within one gas tanks radius of the junction of the dirt road and i look for a harleydavidson electra glide he finds it a border patrol helicopter flying over anzaborrego looking for mojados spots the scorch mark and lands to investigate it the report comes to art right awayhis guys are monitoring all the bp radio traffic so he has a guy out there two hours later in the company of a harley dealer who has a methpossession rap hanging over him dude looks at the charred remains of the hog and almost tearfully confirms that its the same model theyre looking for why would anyone do something like this he moans you dont have to be sherlock holmesshit you dont even have to be larry holmesto see that a car followed the bike in there someone got out of the car and then everyone took off in the car again and went back onto the highway so the reconstructionist goes out again measures the depth of the tire tracks and the width between tires takes a cast of the tire marks plays in the dirt for a while and tells art that hes looking for a smallersize twodoor sedan with an automatic transmission and old firestones on it something else a border patrol guy tells him the passenger door doesnt work how the hell do you know that art asks border patrol agents are experts at cutting sign that is reading tracks especially in the desert the footprints outside the passenger door the agent tells him she stepped backward to let the door open how do you know its a she his man asks these marks are from a womans shoes the agent says the same woman was driving the car she got out the drivers side walked over to where the guy was standing stood and watched see how the heel is heavier where she stood for a few minutes then she walked around to the passenger side and he walked around to the drivers side and let her in can you tell what kind of shoes the woman was wearing me no the agent says but ill bet youve got guys who can yes he does and the guys on a chopper heading out there within half an hour he takes a cast of the shoe and takes it back to the lab four hours later he calls art with the results its her shes with callan apparently of her own free will which boggles arts mind what are we looking at here he wonders an advanced case of stockholm syndrome or something else and while the good news is that shes alive at least as of a couple of days ago the bad news is that callan has broken through the radius of containment he was in a car headed east with a prisoner who at least appears to be cooperative so now he could be anywhere and nora with him let me take it from here sal scachi says to art i know the guy i can deal with him if i find him the guy killed three of his old partners and kidnapped a woman and you can deal with him art asks him we go back scachi says art reluctantly agrees it makes sensescachi does have a prior relationship with callan and art cant pursue this much further without drawing attention and he needs nora back they all do they cant make the deal with adan barrera without her their days have settled into a pleasant routine nora and callan get up early and have breakfast sometimes at home sometimes at the place across the highway he usually goes the highcholesterol route and she usually has unadorned oatmeal and dry toast because the place doesnt serve fruit for breakfast except at sunday brunch they dont talk much during breakfast neither of them is a big talker early in the morning instead of conversing they swap sections of the newspaper after breakfast they usually take a drive they know its not the smartest thing to dothe smart thing would be to park that car behind the cottage and leave it therebut theyre still in their fatalistic mindset and they like taking the drives hes found a lake seven miles north on highway a beautiful drive through oakstudded grasslands and rolling hills big ranches on the west side of the road the kumeyaay reservation on the other then the hills give way to a broad flat plain of grazing land with hills in the background to the south the palomar observatory sits like a giant golf ball on top of the highest summit and a big lake in the middle it isnt much of a lake as lakes gojust a large oval of water sitting in the middle of a larger plainbut its a lake and they can walk around its south end and she enjoys that and theres usually a large herd of blackandwhite holstein cattle grazing on the east side of the lake and she likes looking at them so sometimes they drive up to the lake and walk around other times they drive into the high desert out past ranchita to culp valley where huge round boulders are scattered around as if a giant had suddenly walked away from his game of marbles and never came back to reclaim them or sometimes they drive just up the hill to inaja peak where they park and climb up the short trail to the lookout point from which you can see all the mountain ranges and to the south mexico then they come home and fix lunchhe has a turkey or ham sandwich she has some fruit she bought at the marketand they take a long siesta she never realized until now how tired shes been how flatout tired and how much she must need sleep because her body seems to crave it easily falling asleep anytime she lays her head down after their siesta they usually just hang out either in the front room or if its warm out on the small porch she reads her books and he listens to the radio and looks at magazines late in the afternoon they walk over to the market to buy food for supper she likes shopping for one meal at a time because it reminds her of paris and she quizzes the guy behind the meat counter about whats good that day cooking is ninety percent shopping she tells callan okay he thinks she enjoys the shopping and the cooking more than the eating because shell spend twenty minutes picking out the best cut of steak and then will eat maybe two bites of it or three bites if its chicken or fish and shes incredibly fussy about the vegetables which she does eat massive quantities of and while she buys potatoes for him i know youre irish she makes brown rice for herself they cook dinner together its become a ritual he really enjoys shuffling around each other in the tiny kitchen chopping vegetables peeling potatoes heating oil sauteing the meat or boiling the pasta and talking they talk about bullshitabout movies about new york about sports she tells him a little bit about her childhood he tells her a little about his but they leave out the heavy shit she tells him about parisabout the food the markets the cafes the river the light they dont talk about the future they dont even talk about the present what the hell theyre doing who they even are what they are to each other they havent made love or even kissed and neither one knows if thats a yet or what it is she just knows that hes the second man in her whole life who doesnt want to just fuck her and maybe the first man she might really want he just knows that hes with her and its enough enough just to live scachis driving sunrise highway when he spots ita rundown farm that looks like a usedcar lot what the fuck scachi thinks and pulls in your typical goober in the seedgrain cap ambles over help you maybe scachi says you sell these heaps i just like to work on them bud says but scachi sees the flicker of alarm cross the guys eyes and plays a hunch you sell one a while back the passenger door dont work buds eyes pop wide like those suckers in the tv ads for the psychic friends network like how did you know that who are you bud asks whatever he paid you to keep your mouth shut scachi says im the guy whos going to pay you more to open it up again alternatively ill seize your house your land all your cars and your autographed picture of richard petty and then put you in prison until the chargers win the super bowl which is like forever he takes out his money clip and starts peeling off bills say when are you a cop and then some scachi says still peeling out bills we there yet fifteen hundred bucks close youre one of them sly goobers arent you scachi says taking advantage of the city slicker sixteen hundred and thats as big as the carrot gets my friend and you dont want to see the stick an eightyfive grand am bud says shoving the money into his pocket lime green plates adm scachi nods im going to tell you pretty much what the other guy told youanyone asks i wasnt here you didnt see me heres the differenceyou sell me to the highest bidder he pulls out a revolver ill come back stick this up your ass and pull the trigger until its empty do we have an understanding here yes good scachi says putting the gun away he gets back in his car and drives off callan and nora go to a church theyre taking one of their afternoon drives and pull off highway at the kumeyaay reservation to the old santa ysabel mission its a small church little more than a chapel built in the classic california mission style you wanna go in callan asks id like to they walk up to a small abstract statue beside the church its labeled the angel of the lost bells and a plaque beside it tells the story of how the missions bells were stolen back in the s and how the parishioners still pray for their safe return so that the church will regain its voice someone stole the freaking church bells callan asks himself typical people cant leave nothin alone they go inside the church the whitewashed adobe walls stand in stark contrast to the dark handhewn wooden beams that support the peaked ceiling incongruous but inexpensive pine paneling lines the lower half of the walls beneath stainedglass windows with depictions of saints and the stations of the cross the oaken pews look new the altar is colorfully decorated in the mexican style with brightly painted statues of mary and the saints its bittersweet to hershe hasnt stepped foot in a church since juans funeral and this reminds her of him they stand in front of the altar together she says i want to light a candle he goes with her and they kneel together in front of the votive candles a statue of the baby jesus stands behind the candle and behind that is a painting of a beautiful young kumeyaay woman looking reverentially up to heaven nora lights a candle bows her head and silently prays he kneels waiting for her to finish and looks at the mural that takes up the whole righthand wall behind the altar its a vivid painting of christ on the cross with the two thieves nailed up beside him nora takes a long time when theyre outside she says i feel better you prayed for a long time she tells him about juan parada about their friendship and her love for him how it was the murder of parada that led her to betray adan i hate adan she says i want to see him in hell callan dont say nothing theyre back in the car maybe ten minutes when she says sean i have to go back why to testify against adan she says he killed juan callan gets it he hates hearing it but he gets it he still tries to talk her out if it scachi and them i dont think they want you to testify i think they want to kill you sean i have to go back he nods ill take you to keller tomorrow tomorrow that night they lie in bed in the dark listening to the sound of crickets outside and to each others breathing in the distance a pack of coyotes launches into a cacophony of yips and howls and then its quiet again callan says i was there where when they killed parada he says i was part of it he feels her body tense beside him her breathing stops then she says for gods sake why its ten fifteen minutes before he says a word then he starts with being seventeen years old in the liffey pub and pulling the trigger on eddie friel he talks for hours murmuring softly into the warmth of her neck and tells her about the men he killed he tells her about the murders he did in new york colombia peru honduras el salvador mexico when he gets to that day at the guadalajara airport he says i didnt know it was supposed to be him i tried to stop it but i was too late he died in my arms nora he said he forgave me but you dont he shakes his head im guilty as hell for him for all of them hes surprised when he feels her arms wrap around him and pull him tight his tears fall on her neck when he stops crying she says when i was fourteen she tells him about all the men the johns the jobs the parties all the men she took in her mouth her ass herself she looks into his eyes for the revulsion she expects to see but she doesnt find it then she tells him about how she loved parada and how she wanted revenge and how she went with adan and how it led to so much killing and how it hurts their faces are close their lips almost touching she takes his hand and puts it under her denim shirt and on her breast his eyes open he looks surprised but she nods and he brushes her nipple with his palm and she feels it get hard and it feels good and when he lowers his mouth to her breast and licks and sucks its like she blossoms in his mouth and she feels herself getting soft and moist hes hard she reaches down and opens his jeans and feels him and his moan vibrates on her breast she frees his cock from his pants and strokes him and he tentatively unzips her pants and reaches in and touches her pussy with one finger and she says its good so he dips his finger into her wetness then rubs it gently on her bud and feels it swell and get hard and after a while her back arches and she groans and cries and he slides his mouth down and sucks her and licks her like hes healing a wound and her body tightens and arches and she grips his hand as she comes and he strokes her neck and her hair and says its okay its okay and when she stops crying she bends down to take his cock in her mouth but he says i want to be inside you is that okay and she says yes and he asks again is that okay and she says i want you in me she lies back and takes his cock and guides it to her and he gently pushes and she wraps her legs around him and pushes him in harder and then hes all the way in and he looks down at her beautiful face and her beautiful eyes and shes smiling and he says god that is so beautiful and she nods and tilts her hips up to take him deeper and he feels this sweet place inside her and he slides out and then back in again and she is all sweet slippery heat to him she is shimmering silvery wet she strokes his back his ass his legs and moans so good so good and he reaches for that spot with his cock and touches it and theres sweat on her lips and he licks it off sweat on her neck and he licks it off he feels the sweat running between her breasts onto his chest from her thighs onto his thighs a sweet sticky wetness between her thighs shes wrapped around him so tight he says im going to come and she says yes baby come in me come in me come in me and he pushes into her as deep as he can and holds himself there and then he feels her pussy squeeze him

that with him on top of her he gets up early while shes still asleep and goes into town to get groceries so that he can wake her up with the smell of blueberry pancakes coffee and bacon when he comes back shes gone the crossing this train carries saints and sinners this train carries losers and winners this train carries whores and gamblers this train carries lost souls traditional san diego a rt meets hobbs at the organ pavilion in balboa park rows and rows of white metal chairs in a broad semicircle inside the amphitheater slant down toward the stage hobbs sits reading a book in the secondtolast row sal scachi sits above him two seats to the left its warm out the beginning of spring art sits down next to hobbs any news on nora hayden art asks weve known each other a long time arthur hobbs says a lot of water has gone under the bridge what are you telling me john oh christ is she dead im sorry arthur hobbs says i cant let you take adan barrera to trial you will hand him

barrera pasador will do no further business with farc assurances art asks from adan barrera no hobbs says calmly from miguel angel barrera art cant say anything hobbs can this was all getting out of hand arthur serious men had to step in before it got any worse serious men you and tio he was appalled at his nephews dalliance with terrorists hobbs says would have put a quick stop to it had he known about it he knows about it now this is a good solution arthur adan barrera could be an invaluable source of intelligence if given reason to cooperate its bullshit art knows theyre terrified of what adan might say on the stand with good reason i wouldnt take his deal but they will theyve already figured it out theyll give him a new face a new identity a new life the hell they will you cant have him hobbss voice has some anger in it as he says may i remind you that we are in a war on terrorism art tilts his face toward the sun and enjoys its heat on his skin he says a war on terrorism a war on communism a war on drugs theres always a war on something that is the human condition im afraid not for me not anymore art says im out of it he gets up it has to end art says it has to end somewhere hobbs says may i further remind you that well be pulling your fat out of the fire as well your sanctimonious air of moral superiority is frankly unbearable and insupportable i might add you have been complicit in art holds his hand up he already offered me the deal i turned him down im going to take adan barrera to the da and let justice take its course then im going to tell everything about what happened in condor about cerberus about red mist hobbs goes pale you will not do that arthur watch me if hobbs looked pale before he looks ghostly now i thought you were a patriot i am art starts to walk away it really is springthe gardens in the park are exploding with new color and the air is warm with just enough of a residual trace of winter to still be refreshing he looks down at the amphitheater where little knots of schoolkids on field trips are gathered around their teachers and young couples sit over sandwiches and tourists with cameras draped around their necks study maps of the park and point and old people walk slowly enjoying the air and the new warmth of spring just then an airliner flies low overhead to land at san diegos short airstrip and the noise is deafening and he can just hear john hobbs say nora hayden what we have her hobbs says well trade her art turns around you couldnt save ernie hidalgo hobbs says you can save nora hayden its very easybring me barrera otherwise he doesnt need to finish the threat theyll put a bullet in her head the cabrillo bridge hobbs says midnight is melodramatic lets say three am after the homosexual assignations are concluded but before the jogging commences you bring barrera from the west side well bring ms hayden from the east and arthur if you still feel this pathetic urge to confess everything may i suggest you go to a priest if you think that anyone else will believe or even care about your truth you are sadly deluded hobbs goes back to serenely reading his book behind dark shades scachi stares off into infinite space art walks away you want me to set it up scachi asks hobbs nods its sad art keller is a good man but its axiomatic and true that good men have to die in war art goes back to the secure location where he has adan you got your deal art says one last job is what scachi tells callan yeah its always one last job but you got no choice but to believe him callan thinks as he walks through balboa park do it or theyll kill her he buys a ticket for a production of harold pinters betrayal at the old globe at intermission he steps outside to grab a smoke and walks around the back of the theater to an alley between it and the zoological hospital he walks down the alley to a chainlink fence under some eucalyptus trees on the slope overlooking the highway and to the left cabrillo bridge hes shielded from view by the back of the theater on one side and the back of the hospital on the other and some storage trailers below the hospital mask him from the highway he takes out the detached rifle scope and sights in on scachi standing on the bridge smoking a cigar the range is miles itll be an easy shot even at night he goes back and sits through the rest of the play art stands on the front step and rings the doorbell althea looks great surprised to see him but great arthur may i come in of course she leads him to a sofa in the living room and sits beside him this could have been my home art thinks should have been my home except that i threw it away to chase something not worth catching i threw you away too he thinks looking at althea some few women get prettier with age her laugh and smile lines complement her even the worry lines are lovely he notices that shes had some highlights put in her hair shes wearing a black blouse over jeans and a gold chain around her neck art remembers that he gave her the chain but cant recall whether it was for her birthday or valentines day it might have been christmas he thinks michaels not home im afraid she says he went to the movies with some friends ill catch him next time art are you okay she asks suddenly looking concerned youre not sick or im fine because you look a long time ago he said you wanted me to tell the truth do you remember that she nods i wish to hell i had art says i wish i hadnt thrown you away maybe its not too late no he thinks its way too late he gets up from the couch i better be going it was good to see you you too she hugs him at the door kisses him on the cheek take care of yourself art okay sure he goes out the door art he turns around im sorry its okay he thinks i really only came to say goodbye he knows that hes walking into an ambush that theyre going to kill him and nora on the cabrillo bridge they dont have a choice nora gets into the backseat with john hobbs hes very courtly to heran old gentleman wearing a suit with a white shirt and a bow tie and an overcoat even though the night is warm she looks beautiful tonight and she knows it shes dyed her hair back to blond and they bought her a black dress that fits like a sheath she wears diamond earrings and a diamond choker and heels her makeup is perfect her eyes large her lips glistening red she feels like a whore you play the part she thinks you dress the part hobbs goes over everything with her again but she already understands it sal scachi laid it all out for her all she has to do is meet adan in the middle of the bridge and walk back to the car with him then shes free to go and so is sean callan new identities and new lives hes waiting for her back at the safe house a hostage to her fulfilling her part of the deal they neednt have bothered she thinks ive done my bit so far whats a few more seconds of pretended love the only thing that bothers her is that adans going to get away with all of it the cia as these men doubtless are will keep him and hold him and take good care of him and hell never be punished for juans murder its wrong and she hates it but shell do it for sean and juan will understand wont you she thinks sending the thought to heaven tell me that you understand tell me you want me to do this tell me you forgive me for the sins ive committed and for the one im about to commit sal scachi looks at her in the rearview mirror and winks he can easily understand how a man could become obsessed with her even callans in love with her now and sean callan is the coldest motherfucker who ever walked well i hope you got her on your mind tonight callan id prefer you a little distracted because im the one whos got to pop a cap in you its too bad sonny boy but you gotta go cant take the risk of you ever running your mouth about this its all been set up a drug shootout on the bridge tonight then the media starts the official public mourning for the hero art keller and a day or so later they break the story that he was a dirty cop on the barrera payroll who got greedy and got his shot by one of barreras hitmen the notorious sean callan you do get a new identity tonight sean boy this time you die for real john hobbs inhales the womans perfume old men he thinks take their fading pleasures where they can in days past quite past he might have tried to seduce her if indeed one can be said to seduce a prostitute now alas all he requires of her is for her to fulfill her obligation bring adan barrera peacefully into our hands hobbs has no qualms about it none of the regret that he feels for the unfortunate but necessary sanction of arthur keller ah well the next world is perfect this one considerably less so he inhales the womans perfume art drives his own car to the rendezvous adan sits beside him his hands cuffed in front of him theres no traffic on the streets at quarter to three in the morning art takes harbor drive because he likes to see the sailboats and the moon shining on the water and the downtown skyline adan sits quietly with a selfsatisfied smirk on his face you know something adan art asks youre the reason i hope theres a hell dont think this is over adan says i still owe you for raul art pulls over gets out yanks adan out of the car and pushes him down on his knees art draws the from his holster and enjoys the look of fear that comes into adans eyes he raises the gun then smashes it into adans face the first blow cuts the cheek under his left eye raising an ugly bleeding welt the second one breaks his nose the third one splits his upper lip and breaks two teeth adan topples over with a groan spitting blood out of his broken mouth thats just so you know im serious art says fuck with me and i swear to god ill beat you to death you understand me adan nods who approached you about setting up parada nobody it was an yeah it was an accident art thinks and it was an accident that tio walked out of prison an accident that antonucci gave you absolution everything was a fucking accident art jerks him up by the hair and smashes the gun butt against his ear who approached you to set up parada what the hell adan thinks it doesnt matter now it was scachi he says art nods thats what i thought he tells himself thats what i thought why he knew it all adan says just like me he knew about cerberus yes how about red mist that too art hauls him back up marches him to the car and shoves him back in its time to go to the bridge callan gets in position he takes the heavy sniper rifle from its bag then attaches the tripod and the infrared scope and screws on the silencer he lies down in the dead grass and sights in on the bridge there aint gonna be nothing to it as soon as keller hands barrera over sal will look up and nod and callan will take out keller then just walk away sal will swing by pick him up on park boulevard and take him to nora get their new passports go to la get on a plane to paris a new life he settles in and gets himself ready to kill art keller operation red mist comes home the cabrillo bridge spans highway where it bisects balboa park art parks the car just to the west by the bowling green where the old people come dressed all in white to play their slow game in the afternoon sun he opens the car door and pulls adan out by the elbow shows him the holstered on his hip and says please make a run for it then he pushes adan out on the west end of the bridge and they start walking east toward the main part of balboa park the stone of the bridge glows softly gold under the amber lanterns to his right art sees the downtown office towers and the huge red neon sign that reads hotel cortez which dominates the skyline beyond that are the harbor and the ocean and the coronado bridge rising up like a dream from its base in chicano park in barrio logan where he grew up to his left is the chasm of palm canyon the redwoods and star pines looming above the west side of the highway behind him the san diego zoo to the northeast straight ahead is balboa park with the california tower rising above two tall palm trees like the top of a wedding cake the bridge itself runs into the prado the long broad walkway between the museums and gardens and at the end of the prado a tower of water shoots into the night sky from the balboa plaza hes taken this walk many times so they killed father juan as part of red mist art thinks and hobbs ordered it for the first time in a long time art has perfect clarity he sees it all now callan sights in on kellers forehead then his chest then his forehead again make it a head shot scachi had told him the narcos shoot turncoats in the head art sees headlights swirl ahead of them as a car turns in the big circle in the middle of the prado and then comes toward them the car a black lincoln stops at the east end of the bridge art sees scachi get out and open the back door hobbs gets out slowly leaning heavily on his cane even as scachi steadies him then scachi walks around the back of the car and opens the other door and nora gets out of the car gracefully like a woman whos used to having doors opened for her he feels adans arm tense then someone else gets out of the car and he blinks the man has aged his hair is silver now and so is his mustache hes thinner but he still carries himself like an old world gentleman ever gallant tio takes nora by the arm adan sees her and smiles she looks lovely all the more so in the soft light its as if shes gained her vitality back her femininity he tries to run to her but art holds him back it doesnt really matter though because shes coming to him dont get too close is what callans thinking as nora crosses the bridge just get barrera and walk back to the car she dont know whats going to happen theres no reason to let her know he hopes shes back in the car by the time he has to pull the trigger she dont need no more blood splattered on her they meet just west of the middle of the bridge scachi walks ahead of the rest comes up to art and says no offense arthur i need your weapon art slides his jacket back and scachi takes his and tucks it into his own belt then he turns art around makes him lean against the bridge railing and frisks him finding nothing he waves for the others to come ahead art watches tio come toward him with nora on his arm like hes walking her down the aisle art thinks hobbs lags behind tio looks at adans bleeding broken face and says to art you havent changed any mi sobrino i should have put one in your head when i had the chance you should have tio agrees but you didnt what are you doing here i came so my nephew would know he was being delivered to safety tio says and not to be murdered it looks as if im just in time he hugs adan both hands behind his head being careful not to get blood on his suit mi sobrino adan what have they done to you tio its good to see you take the handcuffs off him please tio says art steps behind adan takes the cuffs off and nudges him forward hobbs looks at art and says youre a man of your word arthur youre a man of honor art shakes his head not really no he grabs hobbs and spins the old man in front of him as a shield his left hand at hobbs neck the other behind his head one twist will kill him scachi pulls his gun but is afraid to shoot put the guns down sal or ill break his fucking neck you do and ill kill you okay sal lays his gun on the bridge now mine sal lays kellers down beside his then he looks up at the ridge behind keller and nods callan sees it he puts the crosshairs squarely on the back of kellers head and takes a deep breath change your life art says nora toss one gun over the bridge and give the other to me adan laughs until nora goes and throws one of the guns over what are you doing adan yells she looks him square in the eye i was the soplon adan it was always me adans head snaps back i loved you you killed the man i loved nora says and i never loved you she hands art the gun sal looks over his shoulder and yells shoot art spins to face the shooter scachi pulls a second gun from his waistband and trains it on arts back callan puts the bullet square into scachis head sal drops from the scopes sight tio dives and grabs scachis gun art turns tio raises the gun art puts two shots into his chest tios hand reflexively pulls the trigger the bullet goes through hobbs hip and into arts leg they both go down hobbs pulls himself up grabs his cane and starts to stagger away on the bridge wobbling crazily like a bad stage drunk callan lays his sights on the mans frail chest blood blossoms on hobbs back his cane clatters on the stone adan crawls to tio he takes the gun from his uncles hand callan tries to get a shot but noras in the way art struggles to his knees sees adan kneeling by tio adans gun goes off once twice both bullets zinging past art dizzy he aims his own gun and fires the bullet smacks into tios dead body adan shoots again arts head snaps back a ribbon of blood swirls in the air and he falls back into the bridge railing his gun dropping to the highway below adan turns his gun on nora get down callan yells nora drops to the ground so does adan he drops to his stomach and crawls along the bridge firing behind him as he goes callan cant get a shot through the railings cant even see adan now he drops his rifle and runs toward the bridge adan gets up and runs the pain is ferocious blood flows from the deep cut on arts forehead into his eyes so that he can barely see he sways and fights the tunnel vision thats shrinking his brain threatening to black him out he looks up and can just make out the form of adan running away adan looks like hes running in a fun house with the floor slanting this way and that art struggles to his feet falls then gets up again then he starts to run adan can hear the footsteps chasing him keep running he tells himself he knows he doesnt have to make it across the border he just has to get into the barrio and knock on the right door and the doors will open for adan barrera and close for art keller so he runs down the prado empty now in the small hours of the morning the museum buildings looming like the walls of a lost city around him if he can make it off the prado and onto park boulevard hell be all right therell be a thousand places he can duck into darkness then work his way into the barrio he sees the fountain maybe fifty yards in front of him marking the end of the prado its light shining on the tower of silver water art sees it too knows what it means adan gets past that and hes gone probably for good the twentyeighth street boys will hide him get him back across the border he forces his legs to move faster even though every fall of his foot sends a jolt of pain burning through his leg he hears sirens in the distance and wonders if theyre real or in his head adan hears them too and keeps running a few more yards and hell be gone he turns to see where keller is art jumps takes adan high around the shoulders and drives him over the fountains low wall and into the water adan gets up and jams his hand into arts face clawing at his eyes arts head explodes in pain but he has a grip on adans shirt and wont let go just hold on art tells himself just hold on adans shirt rips free and he starts to pull away art throws himself blindly desperately and feels adans body land under him and hears adan grunt as the air is blown out of his lungs blood rises in the water where adan struck his head art grabs him by his hair and forces his head under the water he lifts him up hears him gasp and then pushes him down again screaming over the sound of the fountains cascade this is for ernie motherfucker this is for pilar mendez and her children this is for ramos he holds him down loving the feel of the mans legs kicking helplessly beneath him loving the feel of his body quivering his suffering his dying this is for el sauzal art presses down harder adan bucks beneath him his back arching like its going to snap art doesnt see thathe sees a baby dead in his mothers arms he feels the power of the dog this is for father juan art yells he jerks adans head up and out of the water the two men kneel in the water gasping for air their blood swirling around them water pouring down over their heads art sees red lights flashing then cops walking up on them their guns out he keeps one hand on adans neck and throws the other in the air dont shoot dont shoot he yells im a cop this is my prisoner this is my prisoner in the distance as if in a long tunnel he sees nora and callan walking toward him then he falls back into the water it feels cool and clean epilogue an undisclosed location may the poppies are in bloom bright orange bright red art waters them carefully and savors the irony they didnt put him in prison the judge having decided that the former border lord wouldnt have lasted a day in any federal institution so its been a series of safe houses between rounds of testimony seemingly endless sessions before endless committees then back to another refuge where hes relatively safe hes been at this one for three months now and soon it will be time to move again but he takes it a day at a time and today is sunny and warm and hes enjoying the garden in the enclosed courtyard he enjoys the solitude yoyo he thinks as he sets down the watering can sits on the little bench and leans back against the adobe wall but not really you have your ghosts nora is gone now she finished testifying and faded into her new life art likes to think that shes with callan who likewise disappeared its a pleasant thought adan is serving twelve consecutive life sentences in a federal hole also a pleasant thought art got to sit in the courtroom and watch him be led away in cuffs and ankle chains as adan shouted back to tell him that the bounty on his head was still good and who knows art thinks maybe someone will collect the drugs stopped flowing out of mexico for about fifteen minutes after adans downfall then new kids on the block stepped up to take his place there are more drugs coming into the country than ever based on arts testimony congress launched an intensive investigation into operation cerberus and red mist and promised action so far nothing has been done the government spends billions of dollars a year in aid to colombia for drug interdiction most of it goes for helicopters to fight the insurgents the war drags on the murder of cardinal juan parada is still officially ruled an unfortunate accident art supposes he should be bitter sometimes he tries to be but it feels like a slightly ridiculous parody of a former life and he drops it althie and the kidshell he thinks they arent kids anymoreare coming for a quick visit this afternoon and he wants to be cheerful he doesnt know yet what will happen how long he will have to spend in this limbo whether hell ever get out he accepts it as penance he still doesnt know if he believes in god but he has hope of a god and maybe thats the best we can do in this world he thinks as he gets up to resume watering the flowerstend to the garden and maintain the hope of a god against all evidence to the contrary he watches the water bead silver on the petals and mutters a snatch of an odd prayer he once heard which he doesnt quite understand but that nevertheless sticks in his head deliver my soul from the sword my love from the power of the dog
