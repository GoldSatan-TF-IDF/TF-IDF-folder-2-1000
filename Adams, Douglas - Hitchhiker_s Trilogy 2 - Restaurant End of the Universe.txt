the restaurant at the end of the universe copyright by douglas adams to jane and james with many thanks to geoffrey perkins for achieving the improbable to paddy kingsland lisa braun and alick hale munro for helping him to john lloyd for his help with the original milliways script to simon brett for starting the whole thing off to the paul simon album one trick pony which i played incessantly while writing this book five years is far too long and with very special thanks to jacqui graham for infinite patience kindness and food in adversity introduction there is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable another introduction there is another theory which states that this has already happened the story so far in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move many races believe that it was created by some sort of god though the jatravartid people of viltvodle vi believe that the entire universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the great green arkleseizure the jatravartids who live in perpetual fear of the time they call the coming of the great white handkerchief are small blue creatures with more than fifty arms each who are therefore unique in being the only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel however the great green arkleseizure theory is not widely accepted outside viltvodle vi and so the universe being the puzzling place it is other explanations are constantly being sought for instance a race of hyperintelligent pandimensional beings once built themselves a gigantic supercomputer called deep thought to calculate once and for all the answer to the ultimate question of life the universe and everything for seven and a half million years deep thought computed and calculated and in the end announced that the answer was in fact fortytwo and so another even bigger computer had to be built to find out what the actual question was and this computer which was called the earth was so large that it was frequently mistaken for a planet especially by the strange apelike beings who roamed its surface totally unaware that they were simply part of a gigantic computer program and this is very odd because without that fairly simple and obvious piece of knowledge nothing that ever happened on the earth could possibly make the slightest bit of sense sadly however just before the critical moment of readout the earth was unexpectedly demolished by the vogons to make way so they claimed for a new hyperspace bypass and so all hope of discovering a meaning for life was lost for ever or so it would seem two of the strange apelike creatures survived arthur dent escaped at the very last moment because an old friend of his ford prefect suddenly turned out to be from a small planet in the vicinity of betelgeuse and not from guildford as he had hitherto claimed and more to the point he knew how to hitch rides on flying saucers tricia mcmillian or trillian had skipped the planet six months earlier with zaphod beeblebrox the then president of the galaxy two survivors they are all that remains of the greatest experiment ever conducted to find the ultimate question and the ultimate answer of life the universe and everything and less than half a million miles from where their starship is drifting lazily through the inky blackness of space a vogon ship is moving slowly towards them section like all vogon ships it looked as if it had been not so much designed as congealed the unpleasant yellow lumps and edifices which protuded from it at unsightly angles would have disfigured the looks of most ships but in this case that was sadly impossible uglier things have been spotted in the skies but not by reliable witnesses in fact to see anything much uglier than a vogon ship you would have to go inside and look at a vogon if you are wise however this is precisely what you will avoid doing because the average vogon will not think twice before doing something so pointlessly hideous to you that you will wish you had never been born or that the vogon had never been born in fact the average vogon probably wouldnt even think once they are simpleminded thickwilled slugbrained creatures and thinking is not really something they are cut out for anatomical analysis of the vogon reveals that its brain was originally a badly deformed misplaced and dyspeptic liver the fairest thing you can say about them then is that they know what they like and what they like generally involves hurting people and wherever possible getting very angry one thing they dont like is leaving a job unfinished particularly this vogon and particularly for various reasons this job this vogon was captain prostetnic vogon jeltz of the galactic hyperspace planning council and he was it who had had the job of demolishing the socalled planet earth he heaved his monumentally vile body round in his illfitting slimy seat and stared at the monitor screen on which the starship heart of gold was being systematically scanned it mattered little to him that the heart of gold with its infinite improbability drive was the most beautiful and revolutionary ship ever built aesthetics and technology were closed books to him and had he had his way burnt and buried books as well it mattered even less to him that zaphod beeblebrox was aboard zaphod beeblebrox was now the expresident of the galaxy and though every police force in the galaxy was currently pursuing both him and this ship he had stolen the vogon was not interested he had other fish to fry it has been said that vogons are not above a little bribery and corruption in the same way that the sea is not above the clouds and this was certainly true in his case when he heard the words integrity or moral rectitude he reached for his dictionary and when he heard the chink of ready money in large quantities he reached for the rule book and threw it away in seeking so implacably the destruction of the earth and all that therein lay he was moving somewhat above and beyond the call of his professional duty there was even some doubt as to whether the said bypass was actually going to be built but the matter had been glossed over he grunted a repellent grunt of satisfaction computer he croaked get me my brain care specialist on the line within a few seconds the face of gag halfrunt appeared on the screen smiling the smile of a man who knew he was ten light years away from the vogon face he was looking at mixed up somewhere in the smile was a glint of irony too though the vogon persistently referred to him as my private brain care specialist there was not a lot of brain to take care of and it was in fact halfrunt who was employing the vogon he was paying him an awful lot of money to do some very dirty work as one of the galaxys most prominent and successful psychiatrists he and a consortium of his colleagues were quite prepared to spend an awful lot of money when it seemed that the entire future of psychiatry might be at stake well he said hello my captain of vogons prostetnic and how are we feeling today the vogon captain told him that in the last few hours he had wiped out nearly half his crew in a disciplinary exercise halfrunts smile did not flicker for an instant well he said i think this is perfectly normal behaviour for a vogon you know the natural and healthy channelling of the aggressive instincts into acts of senseless violence that rumbled the vogon is what you always say well again said halfrunt i think that this is perfectly normal behaviour for a psychiatrist good we are clearly both very well adjusted in our mental attitudes today now tell me what news of the mission we have located the ship wonderful said halfrunt wonderful and the occupants the earthman is there excellent and a female from the same planet they are the last good good beamed halfrunt who else the man prefect yes and zaphod beeblebrox for an instant halfrunts smile flickered ah yes he said i had been expecting this it is most regrettable a personal friend inquired the vogon who had heard the expression somewhere once and decided to try it out ah no said halfrunt in my profession you know we do not make personal friends ah grunted the vogon professional detachment no said halfrunt cheerfully we just dont have the knack he paused his mouth continued to smile but his eyes frowned slightly but beeblebrox you know he said he is one of my most profitable clients he had personality problems beyond the dreams of analysts he toyed with this thought a little before reluctantly dismissing it still he said you are ready for your task yes good destroy the ship immediately what about beeblebrox well said halfrunt brightly zaphods just this guy you know he vanished from the screen the vogon captain pressed a communicator button which connected him with the remains of his crew attack he said at that precise moment zaphod beeblebrox was in his cabin swearing very loudly two hours ago he had said that they would go for a quick bite at the restaurant at the end of the universe whereupon he had had a blazing row with the ships computer and stormed off to his cabin shouting that he would work out the improbability factors with a pencil the heart of golds improbability drive made it the most powerful and unpredictable ship in existence there was nothing it couldnt do provided you knew exactly how improbable it was that the thing you wanted it to do would ever happen he had stolen it when as president he was meant to be launching it he didnt know exactly why he had stolen it except that he liked it he didnt know why he had become president of the galaxy except that it seemed a fun thing to be he did know that there were better reasons than these but that they were buried in a dark locked off section of his two brains he wished the dark locked off section of his two brains would go away because they occasionally surfaced momentarily and put strange thoughts into the light fun sections of his mind and tried to deflect him from what he saw as being the basic business of his life which was to have a wonderfully good time at the moment he was not having a wonderfully good time he had run out of patience and pencils and was feeling very hungry starpox he shouted at that same precise moment ford prefect was in mid air this was not because of anything wrong with the ships artificial gravity field but because he was leaping down the stairwell which led to the ships personal cabins it was a very high jump to do in one bound and he landed awkwardly stumbled recovered raced down the corridor sending a couple of miniature service robots flying skidded round the corner burst into zaphods door and explained what was on his mind vogons he said a short while before this arthur dent had set out from his cabin in search of a cup of tea it was not a quest he embarked upon with a great deal of optimism because he knew that the only source of hot drinks on the entire ship was a benighted piece of equipment produced by the sirius cybernetics corporation it was called a nutrimatic drinks synthesizer and he had encountered it before it claimed to produce the widest possible range of drinks personally matched to the tastes and metabolism of whoever cared to use it when put to the test however it invariably produced a plastic cup filled with a liquid that was almost but nit quite entirely unlike tea he attempted to reason with the thing tea he said share and enjoy the machine replied and provided him with yet another cup of the sickly liquid he threw it away share and enjoy the machine repeated and provided him with another one share and enjoy is the company motto of the hugely successful sirius cybernetics corporation complaints division which now covers the major land masses of three medium sized planets and is the only part of the corporation to have shown a consistent profit in recent years the motto stands or rather stood in three mile high illuminated letters near the complaints department spaceport on eadrax unfortunately its weight was such that shortly after it was erected the ground beneath the letters caved in and they dropped for nearly half their length through the offices of many talented young complaints executives now deceased the protruding upper halves of the letters now appear in the local language to read go stick your head in a pig and are no longer illuminated except at times of special celebration arthur threw away a sixth cup of the liquid listen you machine he said you claim you can synthesize any drink in existence so why do you keep giving me the same undrinkable stuff nutrition and pleasurable sense data burbled the machine share and enjoy it tastes filthy if you have enjoyed the experience of this drink continued the machine why not share it with your friends because said arthur tartly i want to keep them will you try to comprehend what im telling you that drink that drink said the machine sweetly was individually tailored to meet your personal requirements for nutrition and pleasure ah said arthur so im a masochist on diet am i share and enjoy oh shut up will that be all arthur decided to give up yes he said then he decided hed be dammed if hed give up no he said look its very very simple all i want is a cup of tea you are going to make one for me keep quiet and listen and he sat he told the nutrimatic about india he told it about china he told it about ceylon he told it about broad leaves drying in the sun he told it about silver teapots he told it about summer afternoons on the lawn he told it about putting in the milk before the tea so it wouldnt get scalded he even told it about the history of the east india company so thats it is it said the nutrimatic when he had finished yes said arthur that is what i want you want the taste of dried leaves boiled in water er yes with milk squirted out of a cow well in a manner of speaking i suppose im going to need some help with this one said the machine tersely all the cheerful burbling had dropped out of its voice and it now meant business well anything i can do said arthur youve done quite enough the nutrimatic informed him it summoned up the ships computer hi there said the ships computer the nutrimatic explained about tea to the ships computer the computer boggled linked logic circuits with the nutrimatic and together they lapsed into a grim silence arthur watched and waited for a while but nothing further happened he thumped it but still nothing happened eventually he gave up and wandered up to the bridge in the empty wastes of space the heart of gold hung still around it blazed the billion pinpricks of the galaxy towards it crept the ugly yellow lump of the vogon ship section does anyone have a kettle arthur asked as he walked on to the bridge and instantly began to wonder why trillian was yelling at the computer to talk to her ford was thumping it and zaphod was kicking it and also why there was a nasty yellow lump on the vision screen he put down the empty cup he was carrying and walked over to them hello he said at that moment zaphod flung himself over to the polished marble surfaces that contained the instruments that controlled the conventional photon drive they materialized beneath his hands and he flipped over to manual control he pushed he pulled he pressed and he swore the photon drive gave a sickly judder and cut out again something up said arthur hey didja hear that muttered zaphod as he leapt now for the manual controls of the infinite improbability drive the monkey spoke the improbability drive gave two small whines and then also cut out pure history man said zaphod kicking the improbability drive a talking monkey if youre upset about something said arthur vogons snapped ford were under attack arthur gibbered well what are you doing lets get out of here cant computers jammed jammed it says all its circuits are occupied theres no power anywhere in the ship ford moved away from the computer terminal wiped a sleeve across his forehead and slumped back against the wall nothing we can do he said he glared at nothing and bit his lip when arthur had been a boy at school long before the earth had been demolished he had used to play football he had not been at all good at it and his particular speciality had been scoring own goals in important matches whenever this happened he used to experience a peculiar tingling round the back of his neck that would slowly creep up across his cheeks and heat his brow the image of mud and grass and lots of little jeering boys flinging it at him suddenly came vividly to his mind at this moment a peculiar tingling sensation at the back of his neck was creeping up across his cheeks and heating his brow he started to speak and stopped he started to speak again and stopped again finally he managed to speak er he said he cleared his throat tell me he continued and said it so nervously that the others all turned to stare at him he glanced at the approaching yellow blob on the vision screen tell me he said again did the computer say what was occupying it i just ask out of interest their eyes were riveted on him and er well thats it really just asking zaphod put out a hand and held arthur by the scruff of the neck what have you done to it monkeyman he breathed well said arthur nothing in fact its just that i think a short while ago it was trying to work out how to yes make me some tea thats right guys the computer sang out suddenly just coping with that problem right now and wow its a biggy be with you in a while it lapsed back into a silence that was only matched for sheer intensity by the silence of the three people staring at arthur dent as if to relieve the tension the vogons chose that moment to start firing the ship shook the ship thundered outside the inch thick forceshield around it blistered crackled and spat under the barrage of a dozen megahurt definitkil photrazon cannon and looked as if it wouldnt be around for long four minutes is how long ford prefect gave itthree minutes and fifty seconds he said a short while later fortyfive seconds he added at the appropriate time he flicked idly at some useless switches then gave arthur an unfriendly look dying for a cup of tea eh he said three minutes and forty seconds will you stop counting snarled zaphod yes said ford prefect in three minutes and thirtyfive seconds aboard the vogon ship prostetnic vogon jeltz was puzzled he had expected a chase he had expected an exciting grapple with tractor beams he had expected to have to use the specially installed subcyclic normality assertitron to counter the heart of golds infinite improbability drive but the subcyclic normality assertitron lay idle as the heart of gold just sat there and took it a dozen megahurt definitkil photrazon cannon continued to blaze away at the heart of gold and still it just sat there and took it he tested every sensor at his disposal to see if there was any subtle trickery afoot but no subtle trickery was to be found he didnt know about the tea of course nor did he know exactly how the occupants of the heart of gold were spending the last three minutes and thirty seconds of life they had left to spend quite how zaphod beeblebrox arrived at the idea of holding a seance at this point is something he was never quite clear on obviously the subject of death was in the air but more as something to be avoided than harped upon possibly the horror that zaphod experienced at the prospect of being reunited with his deceased relatives led on to the thought that they might just feel the same way about him and whats more be able to do something about helping to postpone this reunion or again it might just have been one of the strange promptings that occasionally surfaced from that dark area of his mind that he had inexplicably locked off prior to becoming president of the galaxy you want to talk to your great grandfather boggled ford yeah does it have to be now the ship continued to shake and thunder the temperature was rising the light was getting dimmer all the energy the computer didnt require for thinking about tea was being pumped into the rapidly fading forcefield yeah insisted zaphod listen ford i think he may be able to help us are you sure you mean think pick your words with care suggest something else we can do er well ok round the central console now come on trillian monkeyman move they clustered round the central console in confusion sat down and feeling exceptionally foolish held hands with his third hand zaphod turned off the lights darkness gripped the ship outside the thunderous roar of the definitkil cannon continued to rip at the forcefield concentrate hissed zaphod on his name what is it asked arthur zaphod beeblebrox the fourth what zaphod beeblebrox the fourth concentrate the fourth yeah listen im zaphod beeblebrox my father was zaphod beeblebrox the second my grandfather zaphod beeblebrox the third what there was an accident with a contraceptive and a time machine now concentrate three minutes said ford prefect why said arthur dent are we doing this shut up suggested zaphod beeblebrox trillian said nothing what she thought was there to say the only light on the bridge came from two dim red triangles in a far corner where marvin the paranoid android sat slumped ignoring all and ignored by all in a private and rather unpleasant world of his own round the central console four figures hunched in tight concentration trying to blot from their minds the terrifying shuddering of the ship and the fearful roar that echoed through it they concentrated still they concentrated and still they concentrated the seconds ticked by on zaphods brow stood beads of sweat first of concentration then of frustration and finally of embarrassment at last he let out a cry of anger snatched back his hands from trillian and ford and stabbed at the light switch ah i was beginning to think youd never turn the lights on said a voice no not too bright please my eyes arent what they once were four figures jolted upright in their seats slowly they turned their heads to look though their scalps showed a distinct propensity to try and stay in the same place now who disturbs me at this time said the small bent gaunt figure standing by the sprays of fern at the far end of the bridge his two small wispyhaired heads looked so ancient that it seemed they might hold dim memories of the birth of the galaxies themselves one lolled in sleep but the other squinted sharply at them if his eyes werent what they once were they must once have been diamond cutters zaphod stuttered nervously for a moment he gave the intricate little double nod which is the traditional betelgeusian gesture of familial respect oh er hi great granddad he breathed the little old figure moved closer towards them he peered through the dim light he thrust out a bony finger at his great grandson ah he snapped zaphod beeblebrox the last of our great line zaphod beeblebrox the nothingth the first the nothingth spat the figure zaphod hated his voice it always seemed to him to screech like fingernails across the blackboard of what he liked to think of as his soul he shifted awkwardly in his seat er yeah he muttered er look im really sorry about the flowers i meant to send them along but you know the shop was fresh out of wreaths and you forget snapped zaphod beeblebrox the fourth well too busy never think of other people the living are all the same two minutes zaphod whispered ford in an awed whisper zaphod fidgeted nervously yeah but i did mean to send them he said and ill write to my great grandmother as well just as soon as we get out of this your great grandmother mused the gaunt little figure to himself yeah said zaphod er how is she tell you what ill go and see her but first weve just got to your late great grandmother and i are very well rasped zaphod beeblebrox the fourth ah oh but very disappointed in you young zaphod yeah well zaphod felt strangely powerless to take charge of this conversation and fords heavy breathing at his side told him that the seconds were ticking away fast the noise and the shaking had reached terrifying proportions he saw trillian and arthurs faces white and unblinking in the gloom er great grandfather weve been following your progress with considerable despondency yeah look just at the moment you see not to say contempt could you sort of listen for a moment i mean what exactly are you doing with your life im being attacked by a vogon fleet cried zaphod it was an exaggeration but it was his only opportunity so far of getting the basic point of the exercise across doesnt surprise me in the least said the little old figure with a shrug only its happening right now you see insisted zaphod feverishly the spectral ancestor nodded picked up the cup arthur dent had brought in and looked at it with interest er great granddad did you know interrupting the ghostly figure fixing zaphod with a stern look that betelgeuse five has developed a very slight eccentricy in its orbit zaphod didnt and found the information hard to concentrate on what with all the noise and the imminence of death and so on er no look he said me spinning in my grave barked the ancestor he slammed the cup down and pointed a quivering sticklike seethrough finger at zaphod your fault he screeched one minute thirty muttered ford his head in his hands yeah look great granddad can you actually help because help exclaimed the old man as if hed been asked for a stoat yeah help and like now because otherwise help repeated the old man as if hed been asked for a lightly grilled stoat in a bun with french fries he stood amazed you go swanning your way round the galaxy with your the ancestor waved a contemptuous hand with your disreputable friends too busy to put flowers on my grave plastic ones would have done would have been quite appropriate from you but no too busy too modern too sceptical till you suddenly find yourself in a bit of a fix and come over suddenly all astrally minded he shook his head carefully so as not to disturb the slumber of the other one which was already becoming restive well i dont know young zaphod he continued i think ill have to think about this one one minute ten said ford hollowly zaphod beeblebrox the fourth peered at him curiously why does that man keep talking in numbers he said those numbers said zaphod tersely are the time weve got left to live oh said his great grandfather he grunted to himself doesnt apply to me of course he said and moved off to a dimmer recess of the bridge in search of something else to poke around at zaphod felt he was teetering on the edge of madness and wondered if he shouldnt just jump over and have done with it great grandfather he said it applies to us we are still alive and we are about to lose our lives good job too what what use is your life to anyone when i think of what youve made of it the phrase pigs ear comes irresistibly to my mind but i was president of the galaxy man huh muttered his ancestor and what kind of a job is that for a beeblebrox hey what only president you know of the whole galaxy conceited little megapuppy zaphod blinked in bewilderment hey er what are you at man i mean great grandfather the hunched up little figure stalked up to his great grandson and tapped him sternly on the knee this had the effect of reminding zaphod that he was talking to a ghost because he didnt feel a thing you know and i know what being president means young zaphod you know because youve been it and i know because im dead and it gives one such a wonderfully uncluttered perspective we have a saying up here life is wasted on the living yeah said zaphod bitterly very good very deep right now i need aphorisms like i need holes in my heads fifty seconds grunted ford prefect where was i said zaphod beeblebrox the fourth pontificating said zaphod beeblebrox oh yes can this guy muttered ford quietly to zaphod actually in fact help us nobody else can whispered zaphod ford nodded despondently zaphod the ghost was saying you became president of the galaxy for a reason have you forgotten could we go into this later have you forgotten insisted the ghost yeah of course i forgot i had to forget they screen your brain when you get the job you know if theyd found my head full of tricksy ideas id have been right out on the streets again with nothing but a fat pension secretarial staff a fleet of ships and a couple of slit throats ah nodded the ghost in satisfaction then you do remember he paused for a moment good he said and the noise stopped fortyeight seconds said ford he looked again at his watch and tapped it he looked up hey the noise has stopped he said a mischievous twinkle gleamed in the ghosts hard little eyes ive slowed down time for a moment he said just for a moment you understand i would hate you to miss all i have to say no you listen to me you seethrough old bat said zaphod leaping out of his chair a thanks for stopping time and all that great terrific wonderful but b no thanks for the homily right i dont know what this great think im meant to be doing is and it looks to me as if i was supposed not to know and i resent that right the old me knew the old me cared fine so far so hoopy except that the old me cared so much that he actually got inside his own brain my own brain and locked off the bits that knew and cared because if i knew and cared i wouldnt be able to do it i wouldnt be able to go and be president and i wouldnt be able to steal this ship which must be the important thing but this former self of mine killed himself off didnt he by changing my brain ok that was his choice this new me has its own choices to make and by a strange coincidence those choices involve not knowing and not caring about this big number whatever it is thats what he wanted thats what he got except this old self of mine tried to leave himself in control leaving orders for me in the bit of my brain he locked off well i dont want to know and i dont want to hear them thats my choice im not going to be anybodys puppet particularly not my own zaphod banged the console in fury oblivious to the dumbfolded looks he was attracting the old me is dead he raved killed himself the dead shouldnt hang about trying to interfere with the living and yet you summon me up to help you out of a scrape said the ghost ah said zaphod sitting down again well thats different isnt it he grinned at trillian weakly zaphod rasped the apparition i think the only reason i waste my breath on you is that being dead i dont have any other use for it ok said zaphod why dont you tell me what the big secret is try me zaphod you knew when you were president of the galaxy as did yooden vranx before you that the president is nothing a cipher somewhere in the shadows behind is another man being something with ultimate power that man or being or something you must find the man who controls this galaxy and we suspect others possibly the entire universe why why exclaimed an astonished ghost why look around you lad does it look to you as if its in very good hands its alright the old ghost glowered at him i will not argue with you you will simply take this ship this improbability drive ship to where it is needed you will do it dont think you can escape your purpose the improbability field controls you you are in its grip whats this he was standing tapping at one of the terminals of eddie the shipboard computer zaphod told him whats it doing it is trying said zaphod with wonderful restraint to make tea good said his great grandfather i approve of that now zaphod he said turning and wagging a finger at him i dont know if you are really capable of succeeding in your job i think you will not be able to avoid it however i am too long dead and too tired to care as much as i did the principal reason i am helping you now is that i couldnt bear the thought of you and your modern friends slouching about up here understood yeah thanks a bundle oh and zaphod er yeah if you ever find you need help again you know if youre in trouble need a hand out of a tight corner yeah please dont hesitate to get lost within the space of one second a bolt of light flashed from the wizened old ghosts hands to the computer the ghost vanished the bridge filled with billowing smoke and the heart of gold leapt an unknown distance through the dimensions of time and space section ten light years away gag halfrunt jacked up his smile by several notches as he watched the picture on his vision screen relayed across the subether from the bridge of the vogon ship he saw the final shreds of the heart of golds forceshield ripped away and the ship itself vanish in a puff of smoke good he thought the end of the last stray survivors of the demolition he had ordered on the planet earth he thought the final end of this dangerous and subversive experiment to find the question to the ultimate question of life the universe and everything he thought there would be some celebration with his fellows tonight and in the morning they would meet again their unhappy bewildered and highly profitable patients secure in the knowledge that the meaning of life would not now be once and for all well and truly sorted out he thought familys always embarrassing isnt it said ford to zaphod as the smoke began to clear he paused then looked about wheres zaphod he said arthur and trillian looked about blankly they were pale and shaken and didnt know where zaphod was marvin said ford wheres zaphod a moment later he said wheres marvin the robots corner was empty the ship was utterly silent it lay in thick black space occasionally it rocked and swayed every instrument was dead every vision screen was dead they consulted the computer it said i regret that i have been temporarily closed to all communication meanwhile here is some light music they turned off the light music they searched every corner of the ship in increasing bewilderment and alarm everywhere was dead and silent nowhere was there any trace of zaphod or of marvin one of the last areas they checked was the small bay in which the nutrimatic machine was located on the delivery plate of the nutrimatic drink synthesizer was a small tray on which sat three bone china cups and saucers a bone china jug of milk a silver teapot full of the best tea arthur had ever tasted and a small printed note saying wait section ursa minor beta is some say one of the most appalling places in the known universe although it is excruciatingly rich horrifyingly sunny and more full of wonderfully exciting people than a pomegranate is of pips it can hardly be insignificant that when a recent edition of playbeing magazine headlined an article with the words when you are tired of ursa minor beta you are tired of life the suicide rate quadrupled overnight not that there are any nights on ursa minor beta it is a west zone planet which by an inexplicable and somewhat suspicious freak of topography consists almost entirely of sub tropical coastline by an equally suspicious freak of temporal relastatics it is nearly always saturday afternoon just before the beach bars close no adequate explanation for this has been forthcoming from the dominant lifeforms on ursa minor beta who spend most of their time attempting to achieve spiritual enlightenment by running round swimming pools and inviting investigation officials form the galactic geotemporal control board to have a nice diurnal anomaly there is only one city on ursa minor beta and that is only called a city because the swimming pools are slightly thicker on the ground there than elsewhere if you approach light city by air and there is no other way of approaching it no roads no port facilities if you dont fly they dont want to see you in light city you will see why it has this name here the sun shines brightest of all glittering on the swimming pools shimmering on the white palmlined boulevards glistening on the healthy bronzed specks moving up and down them gleaming off the villas the hazy airpads the beach bars and so on most particularly it shines on a building a tall beautiful building consisting of two thirtystorey white towers connected by a bridge halfway up their length the building is the home of a book and was built here on the proceeds of an extraordinary copyright law suit fought between the books editors and a breakfast cereal company the book is a guide book a travel book it is one of the most remarkable certainly the most successful books ever to

triple breasted whore of eroticon six and more controversial than oolon colluphids latest blockbusting title everything you never wanted to know about sex but have been forced to find out and in many of the more relaxed civilizations on the outer eastern rim of the galaxy it has long surplanted the great encyclopaedia galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom for though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal or at least wildly inaccurate it scores over the older and more pedestrian work in two important respects first it is slightly cheaper and secondly it has the words dont panic printed in large friendly letters on its cover it is of course that invaluable companion for all those who want to see the marvels of the known universe for less than thirty altairan dollars a day the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy if you stood with your back to the main entrance lobby of the guide offices assuming you had landed by now and freshened up with a quick dip and shower and then walked east you would pass along the leafy shade of life boulevard be amazed by the pale golden colour of the beaches stretching away to your left astounded by the mindsurfers floating carelessly along two feet above the waves as if it was nothing special surprised and eventually slightly irritated by the giant palm trees that hum toneless nothings throughout the daylight hours in other words continuously if you then walked to the end of life boulevard you would enter the lalamatine district of shops bolonut trees and pavement cafes where the umbetans come to relax after a hard afternoons relaxation on the beach the lalamatine district is one of those very few areas which doesnt enjoy a perpetual saturday afternoon it enjoys instead the cool of a perpetual early saturday evening behind it lie the night clubs if on this particular day afternoon stretch of eveningtime call it what you will you had approached the second pavement cafe on the right you would have seen the usual crowd of um betans chatting drinking looking very relaxed and casually glancing at each others watches to see how expensive they were you would also have seen a couple of rather dishevelled looking hitchhikers from algol who had recently arrived on an arcturan megafreighter aboard which they had been roughing it for a few days they were angry and bewildered to discover that here within sight of the hitch hikers guide building itself a simple glass of fruit juice cost the equivalent of over sixty altairan dollars sell out one of them said bitterly if at that moment you had then looked at the next table but one you would have seen zaphod beeblebrox sitting and looking very startled and confused the reason for his confusion was that five seconds earlier he had been sitting on the bridge of the starship heart of gold absolute sell out said the voice again zaphod looked nervously out of the corners of his eyes at the two dishevelled hitchhikers at the next table where the hell was he how had he got there where was his ship his hand felt the arm of the chair on which he was sitting and then the table in front of him they seemed solid enough he sat very still how can they sit and write a guide for hitchhikers in a place like this continued the voice i mean look at it look at it zaphod was looking at it nice place he thought but where and why he fished in his pocket for his two pairs of sunglasses in the same pocket he felt a hard smooth unidentified lump of very heavy metal he pulled it out and looked at it he blinked at it in surprise where had he got that he returned it to his pocket and put on the sunglasses annoyed to discover that the metal object had scratched one of the lenses nevertheless he felt much more comfortable with them on they were a double pair of joo janta superchromatic peril sensitive sunglasses which had been specially designed to help people develop a relaxed attitude to danger at the first hint of trouble they turn totally black and thus prevent you from seeing anything that might alarm you apart from the scratch the lenses were clear he relaxed but only a little bit the angry hitchhiker continued to glare at his monstrously expensive fruit juice worst thing that ever happened to the guide moving to ursa minor beta he grumbled theyve all gone soft you know ive even heard that theyve created a whole electronically synthesized universe in one of their offices so they can go and research stories during the day and still go to parties in the evening not that day and evening mean much in this place ursa minor beta thought zaphod at least he knew where he was now he assumed that this must be his great grandfathers doing but why much to his annoyance a thought popped into his mind it was very clear and very distinct and he had now come to recognize these thoughts for what they were his instinct was to resist them they were the preordained promptings from the dark and locked off parts of his mind he sat still and ignored the thought furiously it nagged at him he ignored it it nagged at him he ignored it it nagged at him he gave in to it what the hell he thought go with the flow he was too tired confused and hungry to resist he didnt even know what the thought meant section hello yes megadodo publications home of the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy the most totally remarkable book in the whole of the known universe can i help you said the large pinkwinged insect into one of the seventy phones lined up along the vast chrome expanse of the reception desk in the foyer of the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy offices it fluttered its wings and rolled its eyes it glared at all the grubby people cluttering up the foyer soiling the carpets and leaving dirty handmarks on the upholstery it adored working for the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy it just wished there was some way of keeping all the hitchhikers away werent they meant to be hanging round dirty spaceports or something it was certain that it had read something somewhere in the book about the importance of hanging round dirty spaceports unfortunately most of them seemed to come and hang around in this nice clean shiny foyer after hanging around in extremely dirty spaceports and all they ever did was complain it shivered its wings what it said into the phone yes i passed on your message to mr zarniwoop but im afraid hes too cool to see you right now hes on an intergalactic cruise it waved a petulant tentacle at one of the grubby people who was angrily trying to engage its attention the petulant tentacle directed the angry person to look at the notice on the wall to its left and not to interrupt an important phone call yes said the insect he is in his office but hes on an intergalactic cruise thank you so much for calling it slammed down the phone read the notice it said to the angry man who was trying to complain about one of the more ludicrous and dangerous pieces of misinformation contained in the book the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy is an indispensable companion to all those who are keen to make sense of life in an infinitely complex and confusing universe for though it cannot hope to be useful or informative on all matters it does at least make the reassuring claim that where it is inaccurate it is at least definitely inaccurate in cases of major discrepancy its always reality thats got it wrong this was the gist of the notice it said the guide is definitive reality is frequently inaccurate this has led to some interesting consequences for instance when the editors of the guide were sued by the families of those who had died as a result of taking the entry on the planet traal literally it said ravenous bugblatter beasts often make a very good meal for visiting tourists instead of ravenous bugblatter beasts often make a very good meal of visiting tourists they claimed that the first version of the sentence was the more aesthetically pleasing summoned a qualified poet to testify under oath that beauty was truth truth beauty and hoped thereby to prove that the guilty party was life itself for failing to be either beautiful or true the judges concurred and in a moving speech held that life itself was in contempt of court and duly confiscated it from all those there present before going off to enjoy a pleasant evenings ultragolf zaphod beeblebrox entered the foyer he strode up to the insect receptionist ok he said wheres zarniwoop get me zarniwoop excuse me sir said the insect icily it did not care to be addressed in this manner zarniwoop get him right get him now well sir snapped the fragile little creature if you could be a little cool about it look said zaphod im up to here with cool ok im so amazingly cool you could keep a side of meat inside me for a month i am so hip i have difficulty seeing over my pelvis now will you move before you blow it well if youd let me explain sir said the insect tapping the most petulant of all the tentacles at its disposal im afraid that isnt possible right now as mr zarniwoop is on an intergalactic cruise hell thought zaphod when hes going to be back he said back sir hes in his office zaphod paused while he tried to sort this particular thought out in his mind he didnt succeed this cats on an intergalactic cruise in his office he leaned forward and gripped the tapping tentacle listen three eyes he said dont you try to outweird me i get stranger things than you free with my breakfast cereal well just who do you think you are honey flounced the insect quivering its wings in rage zaphod beeblebrox or something count the heads said zaphod in a low rasp the insect blinked at him it blinked at him again you are zaphod beeblebrox it squeaked yeah said zaphod but dont shout it out or theyll all want one the zaphod beeblebrox no just a zaphod beeblebrox didnt you hear i come in six packs the insect rattled its tentacles together in agitation but sir it squealed i just heard on the subether radio report it said that you were dead yeah thats right said zaphod i just havent stopped moving yet now where do i find zarniwoop well sir his office is on the fifteenth floor but but hes on an intergalactic cruise yeah yeah how do i get to him the newly installed sirius cybernetics corporation vertical people transporters are in the far corner sir but sir zaphod was turning to go he turned back yeah he said can i ask you why you want to see mr zarniwoop yeah said zaphod who was unclear on this point himself i told myself i had to come again sir zaphod leaned forward conspirationally i just materialized out of thin air in one of your cafes he said as a result of an argument with the ghost of my great grandfather no sooner had i got there that my former self the one that operated on my brain popped into my head and said go see zarniwoop i have never heard of the cat that is all i know that and the fact that ive got to find the man who rules the universe he winked mr beeblebrox sir said the insect in awed wonder youre so weird you should be in movies yeah said zaphod patting the thing on a glittering pink wing and you baby should be in real life the insect paused for a moment to recover from its agitation and then reached out a tentacle to answer a ringing phone a metal hand restrained it excuse me said the owner of the metal hand in a voice that would have made an insect of a more sentimental disposition collapse in tears this was not such an insect and it couldnt stand robots yes sir it snapped can i help you i doubt it said marvin well in that case if youll just excuse me six of the phones were now ringing a million things awaited the insects attention no one can help me intoned marvin yes sir well not that anyone tried of course the restraining metal hand fell limply by marvins side his head hung forward very slightly is that so said the insect tartly hardly worth anyones while to help a menial robot is it im sorry sir if i mean wheres the percentage in being kind or helpful to a robot if it doesnt have any gratitude circuits and you dont have any said the insect who didnt seem to be able to drag itself out of this conversation ive never had occasion to find out marvin informed it listen you miserable heap of maladjusted metal arent you going to ask me what i want the insect paused its long thin tongue darted out and licked its eyes and darted back again is it worth it it asked is anything said marvin immediately what do you want im looking for someone who hissed the insect zaphod beeblebrox said marvin hes over there the insect shook with rage it could hardly speak then why did you ask me it screamed i just wanted something to talk to said marvin what pathetic isnt it with a grinding of gears marvin turned and trundled off he caught up with zaphod approaching the elevators zaphod span round in astonishment hey marvin he said marvin how did you get here marvin was forced to say something which came very hard to him i dont know he said but one moment i was sitting in your ship feeling very depressed and the next moment i was standing here feeling utterly miserable an improbability field i expect yeah said zaphod i expect my great grandfather sent you along to keep me company thanks a bundle grandad he added to himself under his breath so how are you he said aloud oh fine said marvin if you happen to like being me which personally i dont yeah yeah said zaphod as the elevator doors opened hello said the elevator sweetly i am to be your elevator for this trip to the floor of your choice i have been designed by the sirius cybernetics corporation to take you the visitor to the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy into these their offices if you enjoy your ride which will be swift and pleasurable then you may care to experience some of the other elevators which have recently been installed in the offices of the galactic tax department boobiloo baby foods and the sirian state mental hospital where many exsirius cybernetics corporation executives will be delighted to welcome your visits sympathy and happy tales of the outside world yeah said zaphod stepping into it what else do you do besides talk i go up said the elevator or down good said zaphod were going up or down the elevator reminded him yeah ok up please there was a moment of silence downs very nice suggested the elevator hopefully oh yeah super good said zaphod now will you take us up may i ask you inquired the elevator in its sweetest most reasonable voice if youve considered all the possibilities that down might offer you zaphod knocked one of his heads against the inside wall he didnt need this he thought to himself this of all things he had no need of he hadnt asked to be here if he was asked at this moment where he would like to be he would probably have said he would like to be lying on the beach with at least fifty beautiful women and a small team of experts working out new ways they could be nice to him which was his usual reply to this he would probably have added something passionate on the subject of food one thing he didnt want to be doing was chasing after the man who ruled the universe who was only doing a job which he might as well keep at because if it wasnt him it would only be someone else most of all he didnt want to be standing in an office block arguing with an elevator like what other possibilities he asked wearily well the voice trickled on like honey on biscuits theres the basement the microfiles the heating system er it paused nothing particularly exciting it admitted but they are alternatives holy zarquon muttered zaphod did i ask for an existentialist elevator he beat his fists against the wall whats the matter with the thing he spat it doesnt want to go up said marvin simply i think its afraid afraid cried zaphod of what heights an elevator thats afraid of heights no said the elevator miserably of the future the future exclaimed zaphod what does the wretched thing want a pension scheme at that moment a commotion broke out in the reception hall behind them from the walls around them came the sound of suddenly active machinery we can all see into the future whispered the elevator in what sounded like terror its part of our programming zaphod looked out of the elevator an agitated crowd had gathered round the elevator area pointing and shouting every elevator in the building was coming down very fast he ducked back in marvin he said just get this elevator go up will you weve got to get to zarniwoop why asked marvin dolefully i dont know said zaphod but when i find him hed better have a very good reason for me wanting to see him modern elevators are strange and complex entities the ancient electric winch and maximumcapacityeightpersons jobs bear as much relation to a sirius cybernetics corporation happy vertical people transporter as a packet of mixed nuts does to the entire west wing of the sirian state mental hospital this is because they operate on the curios principle of defocused temporal perception in other words they have the capacity to see dimly into the immediate future which enables the elevator to be on the right floor to pick you up even before you knew you wanted it thus eliminating all the tedious chatting relaxing and making friends that people were previously forced to do whist waiting for elevators not unnaturally many elevators imbued with intelligence and precognition became terribly frustrated with the mindless business of going up and down up and down experimented briefly with the notion of going sideways as a sort of existential protest demanded participation in the decisionmaking process and finally took to squatting in basements sulking an impoverished hitchhiker visiting any planets in the sirius star system these days can pick up easy money working as a counsellor for neurotic elevators at the fifteenth floor the elevator doors opened quickly fifteenth said the elevator and remember im only doing this because i like your robot zaphod and marvin bundled out of the elevator which instantly snapped its doors shut and dropped as fast as its mechanism would take it zaphod looked around warily the corridor was deserted and silent and gave no clue as to where zarniwoop might be found all the doors that led off the corridor were closed and unmarked they were standing close to the bridge which led across from one tower of the building to the other through a large window the brilliant sun of ursa minor beta threw blocks of light in which danced small specks of dust a shadow flitted past momentarily left in the lurch by a lift muttered zaphod who was feeling at his least jaunty they both stood and looked in both directions you know something said zaphod to marvin more that you can possibly imagine im dead certain this building shouldnt be shaking zaphod said it was just a light tremor through the soles of his feet and another one in the sunbeams the flecks of dust danced more vigorously another shadow flitted past zaphod looked at the floor either he said not very confidently theyve got some vibro system for toning up your muscles while you work or he walked across to the window and suddenly stumbled because at that moment his joo janta superchromatic peril sensitive sunglasses had turned utterly black a large shadow flitted past the window with a sharp buzz zaphod ripped off his sunglasses and as he did so the building shook with a thunderous roar he leapt to the window or he said this buildings being bombed another roar cracked through the building who in the galaxy would want to bomb a publishing company asked zaphod but never heard marvins reply because at that moment the building shook with another bomb attack he tried to stagger back to the elevator a pointless manoeuvre he realized but the only one he could think of suddenly at the end of the corridor leading at right angles from this one he caught sight of a figure as it lunged into view a man the man saw him beeblebrox over here he shouted zaphod eyed him with distrust as another bomb blast rocked the building no called zaphod beeblebrox over here who are you a friend shouted back the man he ran towards zaphod oh yeah said zaphod anyones friend in particular or just generally well disposed of people the man raced along the corridor the floor bucking beneath his feet like an excited blanket he was short stocky and weatherbeaten and his clothes looked as if theyd been twice round the galaxy and back with him in them do you know zaphod shouted in his ear when he arrived your buildings being bombed the man indicated his awareness it suddenly stopped being light glancing round at the window to see why zaphod gaped as a huge sluglike gunmetalgreen spacecraft crept through the air past the building two more followed it the government you deserted is out to get you zaphod hissed the man theyve sent a squadron of frogstar fighters frogstar fighters muttered zaphod zarquon you get the picture what are frogstar fighters zaphod was sure hed heard someone talk about them when he was president but he never paid much attention to official matters the man was pulling him back through a door he went with him with a searing whine a small black spiderlike object shot through the air and disappeared down the corridor what was that hissed zaphod frogstar scout robot class a out looking for you said the man hey yeah get down from the opposite direction came a larger black spiderlike object it zapped past them and that was a frogstar scout robot class b out looking for you and that said zaphod as a third one seared through the air a frogstar scout robot class c out looking for you hey chuckled zaphod to himself pretty stupid robots eh from over the bridge came a massive rumbling hum a gigantic black shape was moving over it from the opposite tower the size and shape of a tank holy photon whats that a tank said the man frogstar scout robot class d come to get you should we leave i think we should marvin called zaphod what do you want marvin rose from a pile of rubble further down the corridor and looked at them you see that robot coming towards us marvin looked at the gigantic black shape edging forward towards them over the bridge he looked down at his own small metal body he looked back up at the tank i suppose you want me to stop it he said yeah whilst you save your skins yeah said zaphod get in there just so long said marvin as i know where i stand the man tugged at zaphods arm and zaphod followed him off down the corridor a point occurred to him about this where are we going he said zarniwoops office is this any time to keep an appointment come on section marvin stood at the end of the bridge corridor he was not in fact a particularly small robot his silver body gleamed in the dusty sunbeams and shook with the continual barrage which the building was still undergoing he did however look pitifully small as the gigantic black tank rolled to a halt in front of him the tank examined him with a probe the probe withdrew marvin stood there out of my way little robot growled the tank im afraid said marvin that ive been left here to stop you the probe extended again for a quick recheck it withdrew again you stop me roared the tank go on no really i have said marvin simply what are you armed with roared the tank in disbelief guess said marvin the tanks engines rumbled its gears ground moleculesized electronic relays deep in its microbrain flipped backwards and forwards in consternation guess said the tank zaphod and the as yet unnamed man lurched up one corridor down a second and along a third the building continued to rock and judder and this puzzled zaphod if they wanted to blow the building up why was it taking so long with difficulty they reached one of a number of totally anonymous unmarked doors and heaved at it with a sudden jolt it opened and they fell inside all this way thought zaphod all this trouble all this not lyingonthebeachhavingawonderfultime and for what a single chair a single desk and a single dirty ashtray in an undecorated office the desk apart from a bit of dancing dust and single revolutionary form of paper clip was empty where said zaphod is zarniwoop feeling that his already tenuous grasp of the point of this whole exercise was beginning to slip hes on an intergalactic cruise said the man zaphod tried to size the man up earnest type he thought not a barrel of laughs he probably apportioned a fair whack of his time to running up and down heaving corridors breaking down doors and making cryptic remarks in empty offices let me introduce myself the man said my name is roosta and this is my towel hello roosta said zaphod hello towel he added as roosta held out to him a rather nasty old flowery towel not knowing what to do with it he shook it by the corner outside the window one of the huge sluglike gunmetalgreen spaceships growled past yes go on said marvin to the huge battle machine youll never guess errmmm said the machine vibrating with unaccustomed thought laser beams marvin shook his head solemnly no muttered the machine in its deep guttural rumble too obvious antimatter ray it hazarded far too obvious admonished marvin yes grumbled the machine somewhat abashed er how about an electron ram this was new to marvin whats that he said one of these said the machine with enthusiasm from its turret emerged a sharp prong which spat a single lethal blaze of light behind marvin a wall roared and collapsed as a heap of dust the dust billowed briefly then settled no said marvin not one of those good though isnt it very good agreed marvin i know said the frogstar battle machine after another moments consideration you must have one of those new xanthic restructron destabilized zenon emitters nice arent they said marvin thats what youve got said the machine in considerable awe no said marvin oh said the machine disappointed then it must be youre thinking along the wrong lines said marvin youre failing to take into account something fairly basic in the relationship between men and robots er i know said the battle machine is it it tailed off into thought again just think urged marvin they left me an ordinary menial robot to stop you a gigantic heavyduty battle machine whilst they ran off to save themselves what do you think they would leave me with oooh er muttered the machine in alarm something pretty damn devastating i should expect expect said marvin oh yes expect ill tell you what they gave me to protect myself with shall i yes alright said the battle machine bracing itself nothing said marvin there was a dangerous pause nothing roared the battle machine nothing at all intoned marvin dismally not an electronic sausage the machine heaved about with fury well doesnt that just take the biscuit it roared nothing eh just dont think do they and me said marvin in a soft low voice with this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side makes you spit doesnt it yes agreed marvin with feeling hell that makes me angry bellowed the machine think ill smash that wall down the electron ram stabbed out another searing blaze of light and took out the wall next to the machine how do you think i feel said marvin bitterly just ran off and left you did they the machine thundered yes said marvin i think ill shoot down their bloody ceiling as well raged the tank it took out the ceiling of the bridge thats very impressive murmured marvin you aint seeing nothing yet promised the machine i can take out this floor too no trouble it took out the floor too hells bells the machine roared as it plummeted fifteen storeys and smashed itself to bits on the ground below what a depressingly stupid machine said marvin and trudged away section so do we just sit here or what said zaphod angrily what do these guys out here want you beeblebrox said roosta theyre going to take you to the frogstar the most totally evil world in the galaxy oh yeah said zaphod theyll have to come and get me first they have come and got you said roosta look out of the window zaphod looked and gaped the grounds going away he gasped where are they taking the ground theyre taking the building said roosta were airborne clouds streaked past the office window out in the open air again zaphod could see the ring of dark green frogstar fighters round the uprooted tower of the building a network of force beams radiated in from them and held the tower in a firm grip zaphod shook his head in perplexity what have i done to deserve this he said i walk into a building they take it away its not what youve done theyre worried about said roosta its what youre going to do well dont i get a say in that you did years ago youd better hold on were in for a fast and bumpy journey if i ever meet myself said zaphod ill hit myself so hard i wont know whats hit me marvin trudged in through the door looked at zaphod accusingly slumped in a corner and switched himself off on the bridge of the heart of gold all was silent arthur stared at the rack in front of him and thought he caught trillians eyes as she looked at him inquiringly he looked back at the rack finally he saw it he picked up five small plastic squares and laid them on the board that lay just in front of the rack the five squares had on them the five letters e x q u and i he laid them next to the letters s i t e exquisite he said on a triple word score scores rather a lot im afraid the ship bumped and scattered some of the letters for the nth time trillian sighed and started to sort them out again up and down the silent corridors echoed ford prefects feet as he stalked the ship thumping dead instruments why did the ship keep shaking he thought why did it rock and sway why could he not find out where they were where basically were they the lefthand tower of the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy offices streaked through interstellar space at a speed never equalled either before or since by any other office block in the universe in a room halfway up it zaphod beeblebrox strode angrily roosta sat on the edge of the desk doing some routine towel maintenance hey where did you say this building was flying to demanded zaphod the frogstar said roosta the most totally evil place in the universe do they have food there said zaphod food youre going to the frogstar and youre worried about whether they got food without food i may not make it to the frogstar out of the window they could see nothing but the flickering light of the force beams and vague green streaks which were presumably the distorted shapes of the frogstar fighters at this speed space itself was invisible and indeed unreal here suck this said roosta offering zaphod his towel zaphod stared at him as if he expected a cuckoo to leap out of his forehead on a small spring its soaked in nutrients explained roosta what are you a messy eater or something said zaphod the yellow stripes are high in protein the green ones have vitamin b and c complexes the little pink flowers contain wheatgerm extracts zaphod took and looked at it in amazement what are the brown stains he asked barbq sauce said roosta for when i get sick of wheatgerm zaphod sniffed it doubtfully even more doubtfully he sucked a corner he spat it out again ugh he stated yes said roosta when ive had to suck that end i usually need to suck the other end a bit too why asked zaphod suspiciously whats in that antidepressants said roosta ive gone right off this towel you know said zaphod handing it back roosta took it back from him swung himself off the desk walked round it sat in the chair and put his feet up beeblebrox he said sticking his hands behind his head have you any idea whats going to happen to you on the frogstar theyre going to feed me hazarded zaphod hopefully theyre going to feed you said roosta into the total perspective vortex zaphod had never heard of this he believed that he had heard of all the fun things in the galaxy so he assumed that the total perspective vortex was not fun he asked what it was only said roosta the most savage psychic torture a sentinent being can undergo zaphod nodded a resigned nod so he said no food huh listen said roosta urgently you can kill a man destroy his body break his spirit but only the total perspective vortex can annihilate a mans soul the treatment lasts seconds but the effect lasts the rest of your life you ever had a pan galactic gargle blaster asked zaphod sharply this is worse phreeow admitted zaphod much impressed any idea why these guys might want to do this to me he added a moment later they believe it will be the best way of destroying you for ever they know what youre after could they drop me a note and let me know as well you know said roosta you know beeblebrox you want to meet the man who rules the universe can he cook said zaphod on reflection he added i doubt if he can if he could cook a good meal he wouldnt worry about the rest of the universe i want to meet a cook roosta sighed heavily what are you doing here anyway demanded zaphod whats all this got to so with you im just one of those who planned this thing along with zarniwoop along with yooden vranx along with your great grandfather along with you beeblebrox me yes you i was told you had changed i didnt realize how much but i am here to do one job i will do it before i leave you what job man what are you talking about i will do it before i leave you roosta lapsed into an impenetrable silence zaphod was terribly glad section the air around the second planet of the frogstar system was stale and unwholesome the dank winds that swept continually over its surface swept over salt flats dried up marshland tangled and rotting vegetation and the crumbling remains of ruined cities no life moved across its surface the ground like that of many planets in this part of the galaxy had long been deserted the howl of the wind was desolate enough as it gusted through the old decaying houses of the cities it was more desolate as it whipped about the bottoms of the tall black towers that swayed uneasily here and there about the surface of this world at the top of these towers lived colonies of large scraggy evil smelling birds the sole survivors of the civilization that once lived here the howl of the wind was at its most desolate however when it passed over a pimple of a place set in the middle of a wide grey plain on the outskirts of the largest of the abandoned cities this pimple of a place was the thing that had earned this world the reputation of being the most totally evil place in the galaxy from without it was simply a steel dome about thirty feet across from within it was something more monstrous than the mind can comprehend about a hundred yards or so away and separated from it by a pockmarked and blasted stretch of the most barren land imaginable was what would probably have to be described as a landing pad of sorts that is to say that scattered over a largish area were the ungainly hulks of two or three dozen crashlanded buildings flitting over and around these buildings was a mind a mind that was waiting for something the mind directed its attention into the air and before very long a distant speck appeared surrounded by a ring of smaller specks the larger speck was the lefthand tower of the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy office building descending through the stratosphere of frogstar world b as it descended roosta suddenly broke the long uncomfortable silence that had grown up between the two men he stood up and gathered his towel into a bag he said beeblebrox i will now do the job i was sent here to do zaphod looked up at him from where he was sitting in a corner sharing unspoken thoughts with marvin yeah he said the building will shortly be landing when you leave the building do not go out of the door said roosta go out of the window good luck he added and walked out of the door disappearing from zaphods life as mysteriously as he had entered it zaphod leapt up and tried the door but roosta had already looked it he shrugged and returned to the corner two minutes later the building crashlanded amongst the other wreckage its escort of frogstar fighters deactivated their force beams and soared off into the air again bound for frogstar world a an altogether more congenial spot they never landed on frogstar world b no one did no one ever walked on its surface other than the intended victims of the total perspective vortex zaphod was badly shaken by the crash he lay for a while in the silent dusty rubble to which most of the room had been reduced he felt that he was at the lowest ebb he had ever reached in his life he felt bewildered he felt lonely he felt unloved eventually he felt he ought to get whatever it was over with he looked around the cracked and broken room the wall had split round the door frame and the door hung open the window by some miracle was closed and unbroken for a while he hesitated then he thought that if his strange and recent companion had been through all that he had been through just to tell him what he had told him then there must be a good reason for it with marvins help he got the window open outside it the cloud of dust aroused by the crash and the hulks of the other buildings with which this one was surrounded effectively prevented zaphod from seeing anything of the world outside not that this concerned him unduly his main concern was what he saw when he looked down zarniwoops office was on the fifteenth floor the building had landed at a tilt of about fortyfive degrees but still the descent looked heartstopping eventually stung by the continuous series of contemptuous looks that marvin appeared to be giving him he took a deep breath and clambered out on to the steeply inclined side of the building marvin followed him and together they began to crawl slowly and painfully down the fifteen floors that separated them from the ground as he crawled the dank air and dust choked his lungs his eyes smarted and the terrifying distance down made his heads spin the occasional remark from marvin of the order of this is the sort of thing you lifeforms enjoy is it i ask merely for information did little to improve his state of mind about halfway down the side of the shattered building they stopped to rest it seemed to zaphod as he lay there panting with fear and exhaustion that marvin seemed a mite more cheerful than usual eventually he realized this wasnt so the robot just seemed cheerful in comparison with his own mood a large scraggy black bird came flapping through the slowly settling clouds of dust and stretching down its scrawny legs landed on an inclined window ledge a couple of yards from zaphod it folded its ungainly wings and teetered awkwardly on its perch its wingspan must have been something like six feet and its head and neck seemed curiously large for a bird its face was flat the beak underdeveloped and halfway along the underside of its wings the vestiges of something handlike could be clearly seen in fact it looked almost human it turned its heavy eyes on zaphod and clicked its beak in a desultory fashion go away said zaphod ok muttered the bird morosely and flapped off into the dust again zaphod watched its departure in bewilderment did that bird just talk to me he asked marvin nervously he was quite prepared to believe the alternative explanation that he was in fact hallucinating yes confirmed marvin poor souls said a deep ethereal voice in zaphods ear twisting round violently to find the source of the voice nearly caused zaphod to fall off the building he grabbed savagely at a protruding window fitting and cut his hand on it he hung on breathing heavily the voice had no visible source whatever there was no one there nevertheless it spoke again a tragic history behind them you know a terrible blight zaphod looked wildly about the voice was deep and quiet in other circumstances it would even be described as soothing there is however nothing soothing about being addressed by a disembodied voice out of nowhere particularly if you are like zaphod beeblebrox not at your best and hanging from a ledge eight storeys up a crashed building hey er he stammered shall i tell you their story inquired the voice quietly hey who are you panted zaphod where are you later then perhaps murmured the voice i am gargravarr i am the custodian of the total perspective vortex why cant i see you will find your progress down the building greatly facilitated the voice lifted if you move about two yards to your left why dont you try it zaphod looked and saw a series of short horizontal grooves leading all the way down the side of the building gratefully he shifted himself across to them why dont i see you again at the bottom said the voice in his ear and as it spoke it faded hey called out zaphod where are you itll only take a couple of minutes said the voice very faintly marvin said zaphod earnestly to the robot squatting dejectedly next to him did a did a voice just yes marvin replied tersely zaphod nodded he took out his peril sensitive sunglasses again they were completely black and by now quite badly scratched by the unexpected metal object in his pocket he put them on he would find his way down the building more comfortably if he didnt actually have to look at what he was doing minutes later he clambered over the ripped and mangled foundations of the building and once more removing his sunglasses he dropped to the ground marvin joined him a moment or so later and lay face down in the dust and rubble from which position he seemed too disinclined to move ah there you are said the voice suddenly in zaphods ear excuse me leaving you like that its just that i have a terrible head for heights at least it added wistfully i did have a terrible head for heights zaphod looked around slowly and carefully just to see if he had missed something which might be the source of the voice all he saw however was the dust the rubble and the towering hulks of the encircling buildings hey er why cant i see you he said why arent you here i am here said the voice slowly my body wanted to come but its a bit busy at the moment things to do people to see after what seemed like a sort of ethereal sigh it added you know how it is with bodies zaphod wasnt sure about this i thought i did he said i only hope its gone for a rest cure continued the voice the way its been living recently it must be on its last elbows elbows said zaphod dont you mean last legs the voice said nothing for a while zaphod looked around uneasily he didnt know if it was gone or was still there or what it was doing then the voice spoke again so you are to be put into the vortex yes er well said zaphod with a very poor attempt at nonchalance this cats in no hurry you know i can just slouch about and take in a look at the local scenery you know have you seen the local scenery asked the voice of gargravarr er no zaphod clambered over the rubble and rounded the corner of one of the wrecked buildings that was obscuring his view he looked out at the landscape of frogstar world b ah ok he said ill just sort of slouch about then no said gargravarr the vortex is ready for you now you must come follow me er yeah said zaphod and how am i meant to do that ill hum for you said gargravarr follow the humming a soft keening sound drifted through the air a pale sad sound that seemed to be without any kind of focus it was only by listening very carefully that zaphod was able to detect the direction from which it was coming slowly dazedly he stumbled off in its wake what else was there to do section the universe as has been observed before is an unsettlingly big place a fact which for the sake of a quiet life most people tend to ignore many would happily move to somewhere rather smaller of their own devising and this is what most beings in fact do for instance in one corner of the eastern galactic arm lies the large forest planet oglaroon the entire intelligent population of which lives permanently in one fairly small and crowded nut tree in which tree they are born live fall in love carve tiny speculative articles in the bark on the meaning of life the futility of death and the importance of birth control fight a few extremely minor wars and eventually die strapped to the underside of some of the less accessible outer branches in fact the only oglaroonians who ever leave their tree are those who are hurled out of it for the heinous crime of wondering whether any of the other trees might be capable of supporting life at all or indeed whether the other trees are anything other than illusions brought on by eating too many oglanuts exotic though this behaviour may seem there is no life form in the galaxy which is not in some way guilty of the same thing which is why the total perspective vortex is as horrific as it is for when you are put into the vortex you are given just one momentary glimpse of the entire unimaginable infinity of creation and somewhere in it a tiny little marker a microscopic dot on a microscopic dot which says you are here the grey plain stretched before zaphod a ruined shattered plain the wind whipped wildly over it visible in the middle was the steel pimple of the dome this gathered zaphod was where he was going this was the total perspective vortex as he stood and gazed bleakly at it a sudden inhuman wail of terror emanated from it as of a man having his soul burnt from his body it screamed above the wind and died away zaphod started with fear and his blood seemed to turn to liquid helium hey what was that he muttered voicelessly a recording said gargravarr of the last man who was put in the vortex it is always played to the next victim a sort of prelude hey it really sounds bad stammered zaphod couldnt we maybe slope off to a party or something for a while think it over for all i know said gargravarrs ethereal voice im probably at one my body that is it goes to a lot of parties without me says i only get in the way hey ho what is all this with your body said zaphod anxious to delay whatever it was that was going to happen to him well its its busy you know said gargravarr hesitantly you mean its got a mind of its own said zaphod there was a long and slightly chilly pause before gargravarr spoke again i have to say he replied eventually that i find that remark in rather poor taste zaphod muttered a bewildered and embarrassed apology no matter said gargravarr you werent to know the voice fluttered unhappily the truth is it continued in tones which suggested he was trying very hard to keep it under control the truth is that we are currently undergoing a period of legal trial separation i suspect it will end in divorce the voice was still again leaving zaphod with no idea of what to say he mumbled uncertainly i think we are probably not very well suited said gargravarr again at length we never seemed to be happy doing the same things we always had the greatest arguments over sex and fishing eventually we tried to combine the two but that only led to disaster as you can probably imagine and now my body refuses to let me in it wont even see me he paused again tragically the wind whipped across the plain it says i only inhibit it i pointed out that in fact i was meant to inhibit it and it said that that was exactly the sort of smart alec remark that got right up a bodys left nostril and so we left it it will probably get custody of my forename oh said zaphod faintly and whats that pizpot said the voice my name is pizpot gargravarr says it all really doesnt it errr said zaphod sympathetically and that is why i as a disembodied mind have this job custodian of the total perspective vortex no one will ever walk on the ground of this planet except the victims of the vortex they dont really count im afraid ah ill tell you the story would you like to hear it er many years ago this was a thriving happy planet people cities shops a normal world except that on the high streets of these cities there were slightly more shoe shops than one might have thought necessary and slowly insidiously the numbers of these shoe shops were increasing its a well known economic phenomenon but tragic to see it in operation for the more shoe shops there were the more shoes they had to make and the worse and more unwearable they became and the worse they were to wear the more people had to buy to keep themselves shod and the more the shops proliferated until the whole economy of the place passed what i believe is termed the shoe event horizon and it became no longer economically possible to build anything other than shoe shops result collapse ruin and famine most of the population died out those few who had the right kind of genetic instability mutated into birds youve seen one of them who cursed their feet cursed the ground and vowed that none should walk on it again unhappy lot come i must take you to the vortex zaphod shook his head in bemusement and stumbled forward across the plain and you he said you come from this hellhole pit do you no no said gargravarr taken aback i come from the frogstar world c beautiful place wonderful fishing i flit back there in the evenings though all i can do now is watch the total perspective vortex is the only thing on this planet with any function it was built here because no one else wanted it on their doorstep at that moment another dismal scream rent the air and zaphod shuddered what can do that to a guy he breathed the universe said gargravarr simply the whole infinite universe the infinite suns the infinite distances between them and yourself an invisible dot on an invisible dot infinitely small hey im zaphod beeblebrox man you know muttered zaphod trying to flap the last remnants of his ego gargravarr made no reply but merely resumed his mournful humming till they reached the tarnished steel dome in the middle of the plain as they reached it a door hummed open in the side revealing a small darkened chamber within enter said gargravarr zaphod started with fear hey what now he said now zaphod peered nervously inside the chamber was very small it was steellined and there was hardly space in it for more than one man it er it doesnt look like any kind of vortex to me said zaphod it isnt said gargravarr its just the elevator enter with infinite trepidation zaphod stepped into it he was aware of gargravarr being in the elevator with him though the disembodied man was not for the moment speaking the elevator began its descent i must get myself into the right frame of mind for this muttered zaphod there is no right frame of mind said gargravarr sternly you really know how to make a guy feel inadequate i dont the vortex does at the bottom of the shaft the rear of the elevator opened up and zaphod stumbled out into a smallish functional steellined chamber at the far side of it stood a single upright steel box just large enough for a man to stand in it was that simple it connected to a small pile of components and instruments via a single thick wire is that it said zaphod in surprise that is it didnt look too bad thought zaphod and i get in there do i said zaphod you get in there said gargravarr and im afraid you must do it now ok ok said zaphod he opened the door of the box and stepped in inside the box he waited after five seconds there was a click and the entire universe was there in the box with him section the total perspective vortex derives its picture of the whole universe on the principle of extrapolated matter analyses to explain since every piece of matter in the universe is in some way affected by every other piece of matter in the universe it is in theory possible to extrapolate the whole of creation every sun every planet their orbits their composition and their economic and social history from say one small piece of fairy cake the man who invented the total perspective vortex did so basically in order to annoy his wife trin tragula for that was his name was a dreamer a thinker a speculative philosopher or as his wife would have it an idiot and she would nag him incessantly about the utterly inordinate amount of time he spent staring out into space or mulling over the mechanics of safety pins or doing spectrographic analyses of pieces of fairy cake have some sense of proportion she would say sometimes as often as thirtyeight times in a single day and so he built the total perspective vortex just to show her and into one end he plugged the whole of reality as extrapolated from a piece of fairy cake and into the other end he plugged his wife so that when he turned it on she saw in one instant the whole infinity of creation and herself in relation to it to trin tragulas horror the shock completely annihilated her brain but to his satisfaction he realized that he had proved conclusively that if life is going to exist in a universe of this size then the one thing it cannot afford to have is a sense of proportion the door of the vortex swung open from his disembodied mind gargravarr watched dejectedly he had rather liked zaphod beeblebrox in a strange sort of way he was clearly a man of many qualities even if they were mostly bad ones he waited for him to flop forwards out of the box as they all did instead he stepped out hi he said beeblebrox gasped gargravarrs mind in amazement could i have a drink please said zaphod you you have been in the vortex stammered gargravarr you saw me kid and it was working sure was and you saw the whole infinity of creation sure really neat place you know that gargravarrs mind was reeling in astonishment had his body been with him it would have sat down heavily with its mouth hanging open and you saw yourself said gargravarr in relation to it all oh yeah yeah but what did you experience zaphod shrugged smugly it just told me what i knew all the time im a really terrific and great guy didnt i tell you baby im zaphod beeblebrox his gaze passed over the machinery which powered the vortex and suddenly stopped startled he breathed heavily hey he said is that really a piece of fairy cake he ripped the small piece of confectionery from the sensors with which it was surrounded if i told you how much i needed this he said ravenously i wouldnt have time to eat it he ate it section a short while later he was running across the plain in the direction of the ruined city the dank air wheezed heavily in his lungs and he frequently stumbled with the exhaustion he was still feeling night was beginning to fall too and the rough ground was treacherous the elation of his recent experience was still with him though the whole universe he had seen the whole universe stretching to infinity around him everything and with it had come the clear and extraordinary knowledge that he was the most important thing in it having a conceited ego is one thing actually being told by a machine is another he didnt have time to reflect on this matter gargravarr had told him that he would have to alert his masters as to what had happened but that he was prepared to leave a decent interval before doing so enough time for zaphod to make a break and find somewhere to hide what he was going to do he didnt know but feeling that he was the most important person in the universe gave him the confidence to believe that something would turn up nothing else on this blighted planet could give him much grounds for optimism he ran on and soon reached the outskirts of the abandoned city he walked along cracked and gaping roads riddled with scrawny weeds the holes filled with rotting shoes the buildings he passed were so crumbled and decrepit he thought it unsafe to enter any of them where could he hide he hurried on after a while the remains of a wide sweeping road led off from the one down which he was walking and at its end lay a vast low building surrounded with sundry smaller ones the whole surrounded by the remains of a perimeter barrier the large main building still seemed reasonably solid and zaphod turned off to see if it might provide him with well with anything he approached the building along one side of it the front it would seem since it faced a wide concreted apron area were three gigantic doors maybe sixty feet high the far one of these was open and towards this zaphod ran inside all was gloom dust and confusion giant cobwebs lay over everything part of the infrastructure of the building had collapsed part of the rear wall had caved in and a thick choking dust lay inches over the floor through the heavy gloom huge shapes loomed covered with debris the shapes were sometimes cylindrical sometimes bulbous sometimes like eggs or rather cracked eggs most of them were split open or falling apart some were mere skeletons they were all spacecraft all derelict zaphod wandered in frustration among the hulks there was nothing here that remotely approached the serviceable even the mere vibration of his footsteps caused one precarious wreck to collapse further into itself towards the rear of the building lay one old ship slightly larger than the others and buried beneath even deeper piles of dust and cobwebs its outline however seemed unbroken zaphod approached it with interest and as he did so he tripped over an old feedline he tried to toss the feedline aside and to his surprise discovered that it was still connected to the ship to his utter astonishment he realized that the feedline was also humming slightly he stared at the ship in disbelief and then back down at the feedline in his hands he tore off his jacket and threw it aside crawling along on his hands and knees he followed the feedline to the point where it connected with the ship the connection was sound and the slight humming vibration was more distinct his heart was beating fast he wiped away some grime and laid an ear against the ships side he could only hear a faint indeterminate noise he rummaged feverishly amongst the debris lying on the floor all about him and found a short length of tubing and a non biodegradable plastic cup out of this he fashioned a crude stethoscope and placed it against the side of the ship what he heard made his brains turn somersaults the voice said transtellar cruise lines would like to apologize to passengers for the continuing delay to this flight we are currently awaiting the loading of our complement of small lemonsoaked paper napkins for your comfort refreshment and hygiene during the journey meanwhile we thank you for your patience the cabin crew will shortly be serving coffee and biscuits again zaphod staggered backwards staring wildly at the ship he walked around for a few moments in a daze in so doing he suddenly caught sight of a giant departure board still hanging but by only one support from the ceiling above him it was covered with grime but some of the figures were still discernible zaphods eyes searched amongst the figures then made some brief calculations his eyes widened nine hundred years he breathed to himself that was how late the ship was two minutes later he was on board as he stepped out of the airlock the air that greeted him was cool and fresh the air conditioning was still working the lights were still on he moved out of the small entrance chamber into a short narrow corridor and stepped nervously down it suddenly a door opened and a figure stepped out in front of him please return to your seat sir said the android stewardess and turning her back on him she walked on down the corridor in front of him when his heart had started beating again he followed her she opened the door at the end of the corridor and walked through he followed her through the door they were now in the passenger compartment and zaphods heart stopped still again for a moment in every seat sat a passenger strapped into his or her seat the passengers hair was long and unkempt their fingernails were long the men wore beards all of them were quite clearly alive but sleeping zaphod had the creeping horrors he walked slowly down the aisle as in a dream by the time he was halfway down the aisle the stewardess had reached the other end she turned and spoke good afternoon ladies and gentlemen she said sweetly thank you for bearing with us during this slight delay we will be taking off as soon as we possibly can if you would like to wake up now i will serve you coffee and biscuits there was a slight hum at that moment all the passengers awoke they awoke screaming and clawing at their straps and life support systems that held them tightly in their seats they screamed and bawled and hollered till zaphod thought his ears would shatter they struggled and writhed as the stewardess patiently moved up the aisle placing a small cup of coffee and a packet of biscuits in front of each one of them then one of them rose from his seat he turned and looked at zaphod zaphods skin was crawling all over his body as if it was trying to get off he turned and ran from the bedlam he plunged through the door and back into the corridor the man pursued him he raced in a frenzy to the end of the corridor through the entrance chamber and beyond he arrived on the flight deck slammed and bolted the door behind him he leant back against the door breathing hard within seconds a hand started beating on the door from somewhere on the flight deck a metallic voice addressed him passengers are not allowed on the flight deck please return to your seat and wait for the ship to take off coffee and biscuits are being served this is your autopilot speaking please return to your seat zaphod said nothing he breathed hard behind him the hand continued to knock on the door please return to your seat repeated the autopilot passengers are not allowed on the flight deck im not a passenger panted zaphod please return to your seat i am not a passenger shouted zaphod again please return to your seat i am not a hello can you hear me please return to your seat youre the autopilot said zaphod yes said the voice from the flight console youre in charge of this ship yes said the voice again there has been a delay passengers are to be kept temporarily in suspended animation for their comfort and convenience coffee and biscuits are being served every year after which passengers are returned to suspended animation for their continued comfort and convenience departure will take place when the flight stores are complete we apologize for the delay zaphod moved away from the door on which the pounding had now ceased he approached the flight console delay he cried have you seen the world outside this ship its a wasteland a desert civilizations been and gone man there are no lemonsoaked paper napkins on the way from anywhere the statistical likelihood continued the autopilot primly is that other civilizations will arise there will one day be lemonsoaked paper napkins till then there will be a short delay please return to your seat but but at that moment the door opened zaphod span round to see the man who had pursued him standing there he carried a large briefcase he was smartly dressed and his hair was short he had no beard and no long fingernails zaphod beeblebrox he said my name is zarniwoop i believe you wanted to see me zaphod beeblebrox wittered his mouths said foolish things he dropped into a chair oh man oh man where did you spring from he said ive been waiting here for you he said in a businesslike tone he put the briefcase down and sat in another chair i am glad you followed instructions he said i was a bit nervous that you might have left my office by the door rather than the window then you would have been in trouble zaphod shook his heads at him and burbled when you entered the door of my office you entered my electronically synthesized universe he explained if you had left by the door you would have been back in the real one the artificial one works from here he patted the briefcase smugly zaphod glared at him with resentment and loathing whats the difference he muttered nothing said zarniwoop they are identical oh except that i think the frogstar fighters are grey in the real universe whats going on spat zaphod simple said zarniwoop his self assurance and smugness made zaphod seethe very simple repeated zarniwoop i discovered the coordinated at which this man could be found the man who rules the universe and discovered that his world was protected by an unprobability field to protect my secret and myself i retreated to the safety of this totally artificial universe and hid myself away in a forgotten cruise liner i was secure meanwhile you and i you and i said zaphod angrily you mean i knew you yes said zarniwoop we knew each other well i had no taste said zaphod and resumed a sullen silence meanwhile you and i arranged that you would steal the improbability drive ship the only one which could reach the rulers world and bring it to me here this you have now done i trust and i congratulate you he smiled a tight little smile which zaphod wanted to hit with a brick oh and in case you were wondering added zarniwoop this universe was created specifically for you to come to you are therefore the most important person in this universe you would never he said with an even more brickable smile have survived the total perspective vortex in the real one shall we go where said zaphod sullenly he felt collapsed to your ship the heart of gold you did bring it i trust no where is your jacket zaphod looked at him in mystification my jacket i took it off its outside good we will go and find it zarniwoop stood up and gestured to zaphod to follow him out in the entrance chamber again they could hear the screams of the passengers being fed coffee and biscuits it has not been a pleasant experience waiting for you said zarniwoop not pleasant for you bawled zaphod how do you think zarniwoop held up a silencing finger as the hatchway swung open a few feet away from them they could see zaphods jacket lying in the debris a very remarkable and very powerful ship said zarniwoop watch as they watched the pocket on the jacket suddenly bulged it split it ripped the small metal model of the heart of gold that zaphod had been bewildered to discover in his pocket was growing it grew it continued to grow it reached after two minutes its full size at an improbability level said zarniwoop of oh i dont know but something very large zaphod swayed you mean i had it with me all the time zarniwoop smiled he lifted up his briefcase and opened it he twisted a single switch inside it goodbye artificial universe he said hello real one the scene before them shimmered briefly and reappeared exactly as before you see said zarniwoop exactly the same you mean repeated zaphod tautly that i had it with me all the time oh yes said zarniwoop of course that was the whole point thats it said zaphod you can count me out from hereon in you can count me out ive had all i want of this you play your own games im afraid you cannot leave said zarniwoop you are entwined in the improbability field you cannot escape he smiled the smile that zaphod had wanted to hit and this time zaphod hit it section ford prefect bounded up to the bridge of the heart of gold trillian arthur he shouted its working the ships reactivated trillian and arthur were asleep on the floor come on you guys were going off were off he said kicking them awake hi there guys twittered the computer its really great to be back with you again i can tell you and i just want to say that shut up said ford tell us where the hell we are frogstar world b and man its a dump said zaphod running on to the bridge hi guys you must be so amazingly glad to see me you dont even find words to tell me what a cool frood i am what a what said arthur blearily picking himself up from the floor and not taking any of this in i know how you feel said zaphod im so great even i get tonguetied talking to myself hey its good to see you trillian ford monkeyman hey er computer hi there mr beeblebrox sir sure is a great honor to shut up and get us out of here fast fast fast sure thing fella where do you want to go anywhere doesnt matter shouted zaphod yes it does he said again we want to go to the nearest place to eat sure thing said the computer happily and a massive explosion rocket the bridge when zarniwoop entered a minute or so later with a black eye he regarded the four wisps of smoke with interest section four inert bodies sank through spinning blackness consciousness had died cold oblivion pulled the bodies down and down into the pit of unbeing the roar of silence echoed dismally around them and they sank at last into a dark and bitter sea of heaving red that slowly engulfed them seemingly for ever after what seemed an eternity the sea receded and left them lying on a cold hard shore the flotsam and jetsam of the stream of life the universe and everything cold spasms shook them lights danced sickeningly around them the cold hard shore tipped and span and then stood still it shone darkly it was a very highly polished cold hard shore a green blur watched them disapprovingly it coughed good evening madam gentlemen it said do you have a reservation ford prefects consciousness snapped back like elastic making his brain smart he looked up woozily at the green blur reservation he said weakly yes sir said the green blur do you need a reservation for the afterlife in so far as it is possible for a green blur to arch its eyebrows disdainfully this is what the green blur now did afterlife sir it said arthur dent was grappling with his consciousness the way one grapples with a lost bar of soap in the bath is this the afterlife he stammered well i assume so said ford prefect trying to work out which way was up he tested the theory that it must lie in the opposite direction from the cold hard shore on which he was lying and staggered to what he hoped were his feet i mean he said swaying gently theres no way we could have survived that blast is there no muttered arthur he had raised himself on to his elbows but it didnt seem to improve things he slumped down again no said trillian standing up no way at all a dull hoarse gurgling sound came from the floor it was zaphod beeblebrox attempting to speak i certainly didnt survive he gurgled i was a total goner wham bang and that was it yeah thanks to you said ford we didnt stand a chance we must have been blown to bits arms legs everywhere yeah said zaphod struggling noisily to his feet if the lady and gentlemen would like to order drinks said the green blur hovering impatiently beside them kerpow splat continued zaphod instantaneously zonked into our component molecules hey ford he said identifying one of the slowly solidifying blurs around him did you get that thing of your whole life flashing before you you got that too said ford your whole life yeah said zaphod at least i assume it was mine i spent a lot of time out of my skulls you know he looked at around him at the various shapes that were at last becoming proper shapes instead of vague and wobbling shapeless shapes so he said so what said ford so here we are said zaphod hesitantly lying dead standing trillian corrected him er standing dead continued zaphod in this desolate restaurant said arthur dent who had got to his feet and could now much to his surprise see clearly that is to say the thing that surprised him was not that he could see but what he could see here we are continued zaphod doggedly standing dead in this desolate five star said trillian restaurant concluded zaphod odd isnt it said ford er yeah nice chandeliers though said trillian they looked about themselves in bemusement its not so much an afterlife said arthur more a sort of apres vie the chandeliers were in fact a little on the flashy side and the low vaulted ceiling from which they hung would not in an ideal universe have been painted in that particular shade of deep turquoise and even if it had been it wouldnt have been highlighted by concealed moodlighting this is not however an ideal universe as was further evidenced by the eyecrossing patterns of the inlaid marble floor and the way in which the fronting for the eightyyard long marbletopped bar had been made the fronting for the eightyyard long marbletopped bar had been made by stitching together nearly twenty thousand antarean mosaic lizard skins despite the fact that the twenty thousand lizards concerned had needed them to keep their insides in a few smartly dressed creatures were lounging casually at the bar or relaxing in the richly coloured bodyhugging seats that were deployed here and there about the bar area a young vlhurg officer and his green steaming young lady passed through the large smoked glass doors at the far end of the bar into the dazzling light of the main body of the restaurant beyond behind arthur was a large curtained bay window he pulled aside the corner of the curtain and looked out at a landscape which under normal circumstances would have given arthur the creeping horrors these were not however normal circumstances for the thing that froze his blood and made his skin try to crawl up his back and off the top of his head was the sky the sky was an attendant flunkey politely drew the curtain back into place all in good time sir he said zaphods eyes flashed hey hang about you dead guys he said i think were missing some ultraimportant thing here you know something somebody said and we missed it arthur was profoundly relieved to turn his attention from what he had just seen he said i said it was a sort of apres yeah and dont you wish you hadnt said zaphod ford i said it was odd yeah shrewd but dull perhaps it was perhaps interrupted the green blur who had by this time resolved into the shape of a small wizened darksuited green waiter perhaps you would care to discuss the matter over drinks drinks cried zaphod that was it see what you miss if you dont stay alert indeed sir said the waiter patiently if the lady and gentlemen would care to order drinks before dinner dinner zaphod exclaimed with passion listen little green person my stomach could take you home and cuddle you all night for the mere idea and the universe concluded the waiter determined not to be deflected on his home stretch will explode later for your pleasure fords head swivelled towards him he spoke with feeling wow he said what sort of drinks do you serve in this place the waiter laughed a polite little waiters laugh ah he said i think sir has perhaps misunderstood me oh i hope not breathed ford the waiter coughed a polite little waiters cough it is not unusual for our customers to be a little disoriented by the time journey he said so if i might suggest time journey said zaphod time journey said ford time journey said trillian you mean this isnt the afterlife said arthur the waiter smiled a polite little waiters smile he had almost exhausted his polite little waiter repertoire and would soon be slipping into his role of a rather tight lipped and sarcastic little waiter afterlife sir he said no sir and were not dead said arthur the waiter tightened his lips aha ha he said sir is most evidently alive otherwise i would not attempt to serve sir in an extraordinary gesture which is pointless attempting to describe zaphod beeblebrox slapped both his foreheads with two of his arms and one of his thighs with the other hey guys he said this is crazy we finally did it we finally got to where we were going this is milliways yes sir said the waiter laying on the patience with a trowel this is milliways the restaurant at the end of the universe end of what said arthur the universe repeated the waiter very clearly and unnecessarily distinctly when did that end said arthur in just a few minutes sir said the waiter he took a deep breath he didnt need to do this since his body was supplied with the peculiar assortment of gases it required for survival from a small intravenous device strapped to his leg there are times however when whatever your metabolism you have to take a deep breath now if you would care to order drinks at last he said i will then show you to your table zaphod grinned two manic grins sauntered over to the bar and bought most of it section the restaurant at the end of the universe is one of the most extraordinary ventures in the entire history of catering it has been built on the fragmented remains of it will be built on the fragmented that is to say it will have been built by this time and indeed has been one of the major problems encountered in time travel is not that of accidentally becoming your own father or mother there is no problem involved in becoming your own father or mother that a broadminded and welladjusted family cant cope with there is also no problem about changing the course of history the course of history does not change because it all fits together like a jigsaw all the important changes have happened before the things they were supposed to change and it all sorts itself out in the end the major problem is quite simply one of grammar and the main work to consult in this matter is dr dan streetmentioners time travellers handbook of tense formations it will tell you for instance how to describe something that was about to happen to you in the past before you avoided it by timejumping forward two days in order to avoid it the event will be described differently according to whether you are talking about it from the standpoint of your own natural time from a time in the further future or a time in the further past and is further complicated by the possibility of conducting conversations whilst you are actually travelling from one time to another with the intention of becoming your own father or mother most readers get as far as the future semiconditionally modified subinverted plagal past subjunctive intentional before giving up and in fact in later editions of the book all the pages beyond this point have been left blank to save on printing costs the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy skips lightly over this tangle of academic abstraction pausing only to note that the term future perfect has been abandoned since it was discovered not to be to resume the restaurant at the end of the universe is one of the most extraordinary ventures in the entire history of catering it is built on the fragmented remains of an eventually ruined planet which is enclosed in a vast time bubble and projected forward in time to the precise moment of the end of the universe this is many would say impossible in it guests take their places at table and eat sumptuous meals whilst watching the whole of creation explode around them this is many would say equally impossible you can arrive for any sitting you like without prior reservation because you can book retrospectively as it were when you return to your own time you can have onbook haventa forewhen presooning returningwenta retrohome this is many would now insist absolutely impossible at the restaurant you can meet and dine with mayan meetan con with dinan on when a fascinating crosssection of the entire population of space and time this it can be explained patiently is also impossible you can visit it as many times as you like mayan onvisit re onvisiting and so on for further tensecorrections consult dr streetmentioners book and be sure of never meeting yourself because of the embarrassment this usually causes this even if the rest were true which it isnt is patently impossible say the doubters all you have to do is deposit one penny in a savings account in your own era and when you arrive at the end of time the operation of compound interest means that the fabulous cost of your meal has been paid for this many claim is not merely impossible but clearly insane which is why the advertising executives of the star system of bastablon came up with this slogan if youve done six impossible things this morning why not round it off with breakfast at milliways the restaurant at the end of the universe section at the bar zaphod was rapidly becoming as tired as a newt his heads knocked together and his smiles were coming out of synch he was miserably happy zaphod said ford whilst youre still capable of speech would you care to tell me what the photon happened where have you been where have we been small matter but id like it cleared up zaphods left head sobered up leaving his right to sink further into the obscurity of drink yeah he said ive been around they want me to find the man who rules the universe but i dont care to meet him i believe the man cant cook his left head watched his right head saying this and then nodded true it said have another drink ford had another pan galactic gargle blaster the drink which has been described as the alcoholic equivalent of a mugging expensive and bad for the head whatever had happened ford decided he didnt really care too much listen ford said zaphod everythings cool and froody you mean everythings under control no said zaphod i do not mean everythings under control that would not be cool and froody if you want to know what happened lets just say i had the whole situation in my pocket ok ford shrugged zaphod giggled into his drink it frothed up over the side of the glass and started to eat its way into the marble bar top a wildskinned skygypsy approached them and played electric violin at them until zaphod gave him a lot of money and he agreed to go away again the gypsy approached arthur and trillian sitting in another part of the bar i dont know what this place is said arthur but i think it gives me the creeps have another drink said trillian enjoy yourself which said arthur the two are mutually exclusive poor arthur youre not really cut out for this life are you you call this life youre beginning to sound like marvin marvins the clearest thinker i know how do you think we make this violinist go away the waiter approached your table is ready he said seen from the outside which it never is the restaurant resembles a giant glittering starfish beached on a forgotten rock each of its arms houses the bars the kitchens the forcefield generators which protect the entire structure and the decayed planet on which it sits and the time turbines which slowly rock the whole affair backwards and forwards across the crucial moment in the centre sits the gigantic golden dome almost a complete globe and it was into this area that zaphod ford arthur and trillian now passed at least five tons of glitter alone had gone into it before them and covered every available surface the other surfaces were not available because they were already encrusted with jewels precious sea shells from santraginus gold leaf mosaic tiles lizard skins and a million unidentifiable embellishments and decorations glass glittered silver shone gold gleamed arthur dent goggled wowee said zaphod zappo incredible breathed arthur the people the things the things said ford prefect quietly are also people the people resumed arthur the other people the lights said trillian the tables said arthur the clothes said trillian the waiter thought they sounded like a couple of bailiffs the end of the universe is very popular said zaphod threading his way unsteadily through the throng of tables some made of marble some of rich ultramahagony some even of platinum and at each a party of exotic creatures chatting amongst themselves and studying menus people like to dress up for it continued zaphod gives it a sense of occasion the tables were fanned out in a large circle around a central stage area where a small band were playing light music at least a thousand tables was arthurs guess and interspersed amongst them were swaying palms hissing fountains grotesque statuary in short all the paraphernalia common to all restaurants where little expense has been spared to give the impression that no expense has been spared arthur glanced around half expecting to see someone making an american express commercial zaphod lurched into ford who lurched back into zaphod wowee said zaphod zappo said ford my great granddaddy must have really screwed up the computers works you know said zaphod i told it to take us to the nearest place to eat and it sends us to the end of the universe remind me to be nice to it one day he paused hey everybodys here you know everybody who was anybody was said arthur at the end of the universe you have to use the past tense a lot said zaphod cos everythings been done you know hi guys he called out to a nearby party of giant iguana lifeforms how did you do is that zaphod beeblebrox asked one iguana of another iguana i think so replied the second iguana well doesnt that just take the biscuit said the first iguana funny old thing life said the second iguana its what you make of it said the first and they lapsed back into silence they were waiting for the greatest show in the universe hey zaphod said ford grabbing for his arm and on account of the third pan galactic gargle blaster missing he pointed a swaying finger theres an old mate of mine he said hotblack desiato see the man at the platinum table with the platinum suit on zaphod tried to follow fords finger with his eyes but it made him feel dizzy finally he saw oh yeah he said then recognition came a moment later hey he said did that guy ever make it megabig wow bigger than the biggest thing ever other than me whos he supposed to be asked trillian hotblack desiato said zaphod in astonishment you dont know you never heard of disaster area no said trillian who hadnt the biggest said ford loudest richest suggested zaphod rock band in the history of he searched for the word history itself said zaphod no said trillian zowee said zaphod here we are at the end of the universe and you havent even lived yet did you miss out he led her off to where the waiter had been waiting all this time at the table arthur followed them feeling very lost and alone ford waded off through the throng to renew an old acquaintance hey er hotblack he called out how you doing great to see you big boy hows the noise youre looking great really very very fat and unwell amazing he slapped the man on the back and was mildly surprised that it seemed to elict no response the pan galactic gargle blasters swirling round inside him told him to plunge on regardless remember the old days he said we used to hang out right the bistro illegal remember slims throat emporium the evildrome boozarama great days eh hotblack desiato offered no opinion as to whether they were great days or not ford was not perturbed and when we were hungry wed pose as public health inspectors you remember that and go around confiscating meals and drinks right till we got food poisoning oh and then there were the long nights of talking and drinking in those smelly rooms above the cafe lou in gretchen town new betel and you were always in the next room trying to write songs on your ajuitar and we all hated them and you said you didnt care and we said we did because we hated them so much fords eyes were beginning to mist over and you said you didnt want to be a star he continued wallowing in nostalgia because you despised the star system and we said hadra and sulijoo and me that we didnt think you had the option and what do you do now you buy star systems he turned and solicited the attention of those at nearby tables here he said is a man who buys star systems hotblack desiato made no attempt either to confirm or deny this fact and the attention of the temporary audience waned rapidly i think someones drunk muttered a purple bushlike being into his wine glass ford staggered slightly and sat down heavily on the chair facing hotblack desiato whats that number you do he said unwisely grabbing at a bottle for support and tipping it over into a nearby glass as it happened not to waste a happy accident he drained the glass that really huge number he continued how does it go bwarm bwarm baderr something and in the stage act you do it ends up with this ship crashing right into the sun and you actually do it ford crashed his fist into his other hand to illustrate this feat graphically he knocked the bottle over again ship sun wham bang he cried i mean forget lasers and stuff you guys are into solar flares and real sunburn oh and terrible songs his eyes followed the stream of liquid glugging out of the bottle on to the table something ought to be done about it he thought hey you want a drink he said it began to sink into his squelching mind that something was missing from this reunion and that the missing something was in some way connected with the fact that the fat man sitting opposite him in the platinum suit and the silvery trilby had not yet said hi ford or great to see you after all this time or in fact anything at all more to the point he had not yet even moved hotblack said ford a large meaty hand landed on his shoulder from behind and pushed him aside he slid gracelessly off his seat and peered upwards to see if he could spot the owner of this discourteous hand the owner was not hard to spot on account of his being something of the order of seven feet tall and not slightly built with it in fact he was built the way one builds leather sofas shiny lumpy and with lots of solid stuffing the suit into which the mans body had been stuffed looked as if its only purpose in life was to demonstrate how difficult it was to get this sort of body into a suit the face had the texture of an orange and the colour of an apple but there the resemblance to anything sweet ended kid said a voice which emerged from the mans mouth as if it had been having a really rough time down in his chest er yeah said ford conversationally he staggered back to his feet again and was disappointed that the top of his head didnt come further up the mans body beat it said the man oh yeah said ford wondering how wise he was being and who are you the man considered this for a moment he wasnt used to being asked this sort of question nevertheless after a while he came up with an answer im the guy whos telling you to beat it he said before you get it beaten for you now listen said ford nervously he wished his head would stop spinning settle down and get to grips with the situation now listen he continued i am one of hotblacks oldest friends and he glanced at hotblack desiato who still hadnt moved so much as an eyelash and said ford again wondering what would be a good word to say after and the large man came up with a whole sentence to go after and he said it and i am mr desiatos bodyguard it went and i am responsible for his body and i am not responsible for yours so take it away before it gets damaged now wait a minute said ford no minutes boomed the bodyguard no waiting mr desiato speaks to no one well perhaps youd let him say what he thinks about the matter himself said ford he speaks to no one bellowed the bodyguard ford glanced anxiously at hotblack again and was forced to admit to himself that the bodyguard seemed to have the facts on his side there was still not the slightest sign of movement let alone keen interest in fords welfare why said ford whats the matter with him the bodyguard told him section the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy notes that disaster area a plutonium rock band from the gagrakacka mind zones are generally held to be not only the loudest rock band in the galaxy but in fact the loudest noise of any kind at all regular concert goers judge that the best sound balance is usually to be heard from within large concrete bunkers some thirtyseven miles from the stage whilst the musicians themselves play their instruments by remote control from within a heavily insulated spaceship which stays in orbit around the planet or more frequently around a completely different planet their songs are on the whole very simple and mostly follow the familiar theme of boybeing meets girlbeing beneath a silvery moon which then explodes for no adequately explored reason many worlds have now banned their act altogether sometimes for artistic reasons but most commonly because the bands public address system contravenes local strategic arms limitations treaties this has not however stopped their earnings from pushing back the boundaries of pure hypermathematics and their chief research accountant has recently been appointed professor of neomathematics at the university of maximegalon in recognition of both his general and his special theories of disaster area tax returns in which he proves that the whole fabric of the space time continuum is not merely curved it is in fact totally bent ford staggered back to the table where zaphod arthur and trillian were sitting waiting for the fun to begin gotta have some food said ford hi ford said zaphod you speak to the big noise boy ford waggled his head noncommittally hotblack i sort of spoke to him yeah whatd he say well not a lot really hes er yeah hes spending a year dead for tax reasons ive got to sit down he sat down the waiter approached would you like to see the menu he said or would you like to meet the dish of the day huh said ford huh said arthur huh said trillian thats cool said zaphod well meet the meat in a small room in one of the arms of the restaurant complex a tall thin gangling figure pulled aside a curtain and oblivion looked him in the face it was not a pretty face perhaps because oblivion had looked him in it so many times it was too long for a start the eyes too sunken and too hooded the cheeks too hollow his lips were too thin and too long and when they parted his teeth looked too much like a recently polished bay window the hands that held the curtain were long and thin too they were also cold they lay lightly along the folds of the curtain and gave the impression that if he didnt watch them like a hawk they would crawl away of their own accord and do something unspeakable in a corner he let the curtain drop and the terrible light that had played on his features went off to play somewhere more healthy he prowled around his small chamber like a mantis contemplating an evenings preying finally settling on a rickety chair by a trestle table where he leafed through a few sheets of jokes a bell rang he pushed the thin sheaf of papers aside and stood up his hands brushed limply over some of the one million rainbowcoloured sequins with which his jacket was festooned and he was gone through the door in the restaurant the lights dimmed the band quickened its pace a single spotlight stabbed down into the darkness of the stairway that led up to the centre of the stage up the stairs bounded bounded a tall brilliantly coloured figure he burst on to the stage tripped lightly up to the microphone removed it from its stand with one swoop of his long thin hand and stood for a moment bowing left and right to the audience acknowledging their applause and displaying to them his bay window he waved to his particular friends in the audience even though there werent any there and waited for the applause to die down he held up his hand and smiled a smile that stretched not merely from ear to ear but seemed to extend some way beyond the mere confines of his face thank you ladies and gentlemen he cried thank you very much thank you so much he eyed them with a twinkling eye ladies and gentlemen he said the universe as we know it has now been in existence for over one hundred and seventy thousand million billion years and will be ending in a little over half an hour so welcome one and all to milliways the restaurant at the end of the universe with a gesture he deftly conjured another round of spontaneous applause with another gesture he cut it i am your host for tonight he said my name is max quordlepleen everybody knew this his act was famous throughout the known galaxy but he said it for the fresh applause it generated which he acknowledged with a disclaiming smile and wave and ive just come straight from the very very other end of time where ive been hosting a show at the big bang burger bar where i can tell you we had a very exciting evening ladies and gentlemen and i will be with you right through this historic occasion the end of history itself another burst of applause died away quickly as the lights dimmed down further on every table candles ignited themselves spontaneously eliciting a slight gasp from all the diners and wreathing them in a thousand tiny flickering lights and a million intimate shadows a tremor of excitement thrilled through the darkened restaurant as the vast golden dome above them began very very slowly to dim to darken to fade maxs voice was hushed as he continued so ladies and gentlemen he breathed the candles are lit the band plays softly and as the forceshielded dome above us fades into transparency revealing a dark and sullen sky hung heavy with the ancient light of livid swollen stars i can see were all in for a fabulous evenings apocalypse even the soft tootling of the band faded away as stunned shock descended on all those who had not seen this sight before a monstrous grisly light poured in on them a hideous light a boiling pestilential light a light that would have disfigured hell the universe was coming to an end for a few interminable seconds the restaurant span silently through the raging void then max spoke again for those of you who ever hoped to see the light at the end of the tunnel he said this is it the band struck up again thank you ladies and gentlemen cried max ill be back with you again in just a moment and meanwhile i leave you in the very capable hands of mr reg nullify and his cataclysmic combo big hand please ladies and gentlemen for reg and the boys the baleful turmoil of the skies continued hesitantly the audience began to clap and after a moment or so normal conversation resumed max began his round of the tables swapping jokes shouting with laughter earning his living a large dairy animal approached zaphod beeblebroxs table a large fat meaty quadruped of the bovine type with large watery eyes small horns and what might almost have been an ingratiating smile on its lips good evening it lowed and sat back heavily on its haunches i am the main dish of the day may i interest you in parts of my body it harrumphed and gurgled a bit wriggled its hind quarters into a more comfortable position and gazed peacefully at them its gaze was met by looks of startled bewilderment from arthur and trillian a resigned shrug from ford prefect and naked hunger from zaphod beeblebrox something off the shoulder perhaps suggested the animal braised in a white wine sauce er your shoulder said arthur in a horrified whisper but naturally my shoulder sir mooed the animal contentedly nobody elses is mine to offer zaphod leapt to his feet and started prodding and feeling the animals shoulder appreciatively or the rump is very good murmured the animal ive been exercising it and eating plenty of grain so theres a lot of good meat there it gave a mellow grunt gurgled again and started to chew the cud it swallowed the cud again or a casserole of me perhaps it added you mean this animal actually wants us to eat it whispered trillian to ford me said ford with a glazed look in his eyes i dont mean anything thats absolutely horrible exclaimed arthur the most revolting thing ive ever heard whats the problem earthman said zaphod now transferring his attention to the animals enormous rump i just dont want to eat an animal thats standing here inviting me to said arthur its heartless better than eating an animal that doesnt want to be eaten said zaphod thats not the point arthur protested then he thought about it for a moment alright he said maybe it is the point i dont care im not going to think about it now ill just er the universe raged about him in its death throes i think ill just have a green salad he muttered may i urge you to consider my liver asked the animal it must be very rich and tender by now ive been forcefeeding myself for months a green salad said arthur emphatically a green salad said the animal rolling his eyes disapprovingly at arthur are you going to tell me said arthur that i shouldnt have green salad well said the animal i know many vegetables that are very clear on that point which is why it was eventually decided to cut through the whole tangled problem and breed an animal that actually wanted to be eaten and was capable of saying so clearly and distinctly and here i am it managed a very slight bow glass of water please said arthur look said zaphod we want to eat we dont want to make a meal of the issues four rare steaks please and hurry we havent eaten in five hundred and seventysix thousand million years the animal staggered to its feet it gave a mellow gurgle a very wise choice sir if i may say so very good it said ill just nip off and shoot myself he turned and gave a friendly wink to arthur dont worry sir he said ill be very humane it waddled unhurriedly off into the kitchen a matter of minutes later the waiter arrived with four huge steaming steaks zaphod and ford wolfed straight into them without a seconds hesitation trillian paused then shrugged and started into hers arthur stared at his feeling slightly ill hey earthman said zaphod with a malicious grin on the face that wasnt stuffing itself whats eating you and the band played on all around the restaurant people and things relaxed and chatted the air was filled with talk of this and that and with the mingled scents of exotic plants extravagant foods and insidious wines for an infinite number of miles in every direction the universal cataclysm was gathering to a stupefying climax glancing at his watch max returned to the stage with a flourish and now ladies and gentlemen he beamed is everyone having one last wonderful time yes called out the sort of people who call out yes when comedians ask them if theyre having a wonderful time thats wonderful enthused max absolutely wonderful and as the photon storms gather in swirling crowds around us preparing to tear apart the last of the red hot suns i know youre all going to settle back and enjoy with me what i know we will find all an immensely exciting and terminal experience he paused he caught the audience with a glittering eye believe me ladies and gentlemen he said theres nothing penultimate about this one he paused again tonight his timing was immaculate time after time he had done this show night after night not that the word night had any meaning here at the extremity of time all there was was the endless repetition of the final moment as the restaurant rocked slowly forward over the brink of times furthest edge and back again this night was good though the audience was writhing in the palm of his sickly hand his voice dropped they had to strain to hear him this he said really is the absolute end the final chilling desolation in which the whole majestic sweep of creation becomes extinct this ladies and gentlemen is the proverbial it he dropped his voice still lower in the stillness a fly would not have dared cleat its throat after this he said there is nothing void emptiness oblivion absolute nothing his eyes glittered again or did they twinkle nothing except of course for the sweet trolley and a fine selection of aldebaran liqueurs the band gave him a musical sting he wished they wouldnt he didnt need it not an artist of his calibre he could play the audience like his own musical instrument they were laughing with relief he followed on and for once he cried cheerily you dont need to worry about having a hangover in the morning because there wont be any more mornings he beamed at his happy laughing audience he glanced up at the sky going through the same dead routine every night but his glance was only for a fraction of a second he trusted it to do its job as one professional trusts another and now he said strutting about the stage at the risk of putting a damper on the wonderful sense of doom and futility here this evening i would like to welcome a few parties he pulled a card from his pocket do we have he put up a hand to hold back the cheers do we have a party here from the zansellquasure flamarion bridge club from beyond the vortvoid of qvarne are they here a rousing cheer came from the back but he pretended not to hear he peered around trying to find them are they here he asked again to elict a louder cheer he got it as he always did ah there they are well last bids lads and no cheating remember this is a very solemn moment he lapped up the laughter and do we also have do we have a party of minor deities from the halls of asgard away to his right came a rumble of thunder lightning arced across the stage a small group of hairy men with helmets sat looking very pleased with themselves and raised their glasses to him hasbeens he thought to himself careful with that hammer sir he said they did their trick with the lightning again max gave them a very thin lipped smile and thirdly he said thirdly a party of young conservatives from sirius b are they here a party of smartly dressed young dogs stopped throwing rolls at each other and started throwing rolls at the stage they yapped and barked unintelligibly yes said max well this is all your fault you realize that and finally said max quieting the audience down and putting on his solemn face finally i believe we have with us here tonight a party of believers very devout believers from the church of the second coming of the great prophet zarquon there were about twenty of them sitting right out on the edge of the floor ascetically dressed sipping mineral water nervously and staying apart from the festivities they blinked resentfully as the spotlight was turned on them there they are said max sitting there patiently he said hed come again and hes kept you waiting a long time so lets hope hes hurrying fellas because hes only got eight minutes left the party of zarquons followers sat rigid refusing to be buffeted by the waves of uncharitable laughter which swept over them max restrained his audience no but seriously though folks seriously though no offence meant no i know we shouldnt make fun of deeply held beliefs so i think a big hand please for the great prophet zarquon the audience clapped respectfully wherever hes got to he blew a kiss to the stonyfaced party and returned to the centre of the stage he grabbed a tall stool and sat on it its marvellous though he rattled on to see so many of you here tonight no isnt it though yes absolutely marvellous because i know that so many of you come here time and time again which i think is really wonderful to come and watch this final end of everything and then return home to your own eras and raise families strive for new and better societies fight terrible wars for what you know to be right it really gives one hope for the future of all lifekind except of course he waved at the blitzing turmoil above and around them that we know it hasnt got one arthur turned to ford he hadnt quite got this place worked out in his mind look surely he said if the universe is about to end dont we go with it ford gave him a threepangalacticgargleblaster look in other words a rather unsteady one no he said look he said as soon as you come into this dive you get held in this sort of amazing forceshielded temporal warp thing i think oh said arthur he turned his attention back to a bowl of soup hed managed to get from the waiter to replace his steak look said ford ill show you he grabbed at a napkin off the table and fumbled hopelessly with it look he said again imagine this napkin right as the temporal universe right and this spoon as a transductional mode in the matter curve it took him a while to say this last part and arthur hated to interrupt him thats the spoon i was eating with he said alright said ford imagine this spoon he found a small wooden spoon on a tray of relishes this spoon but found it rather tricky to pick up no better still this fork hey would you let go of my fork snapped zaphod alright said ford alright alright why dont we say why dont we say that this wine glass is the temporal universe what the one youve just knocked on the floor did i do that yes alright said ford forget that i mean i mean look do you know do you know how the universe actually began for a kick off probably not said arthur who wished hed never embarked on any of this alright said ford imagine this right you get this bath right a large round bath and its made of ebony where from said arthur harrods was destroyed by the vogons doesnt matter so you keep saying listen alright you get this bath see imagine youve got this bath and its ebony and its conical conical said arthur what sort of shhh said ford its conical so what you do is you see you fill it with fine white sand alright or sugar fine white sand andor sugar anything doesnt matter sugars fine and when its full you pull the plug out are you listening im listening you pull the plug out and it all just twirls away twirls away you see out of the plughole i see you dont see you dont see at all i havent got to the clever bit yet you want to hear the clever bit tell me the clever bit ill tell you the clever bit ford thought for a moment trying to remember what the clever bit was the clever bit he said is this you film it happening clever thats not the clever bit this is the clever bit i remember now that this is the clever bit the clever bit is that you then thread the film in the projector backwards backwards yes threading it backwards is definitely the clever bit so then you just sit and watch it and everything just appears to spiral upwards out of the plughole and fill the bath see and thats how the universe began is it said arthur no said ford but its a marvellous way to relax he reached for his wine glass wheres my wine glass he said its on the floor ah tipping back his chair to look for it ford collided with the small green waiter who was approaching the table carrying a portable telephone ford excused himself to the waiter explaining that it was because he was extremely drunk the waiter said that that was quite alright and that he perfectly understood ford thanked the waiter for his kind indulgence attempted to tug his forelock missed by six inches and slid under the table mr zaphod beeblebrox inquired the waiter er yeah said zaphod glancing up from his third steak there is a phone call for you hey what a phone call sir for me here hey but who knows where i am one of his minds raced the other dawdled lovingly over the food it was still shovelling in excuse me if i carry on wont you said his eating head and carried on there were now so many people after him hed lost count he shouldnt have made such a conspicuous entrance hell why not though he thought how do you know youre having fun if theres no one watching you have it maybe someone here tipped off the galactic police said trillian everyone saw you come in you mean they want to arrest me over the phone said zaphod could be im a pretty dangerous dude when im concerned yeah said a voice from under the table you go to pieces so fast people get hit by the shrapnel hey what is this judgment day snapped zaphod do we get to see that as well asked arthur nervously im in no hurry muttered zaphod ok so whos the cat on the phone he kicked ford hey get up there kid he said to him i may need you i am not said the waiter personally acquainted with the metal gentlemen in question sir metal yes sir did you say metal yes sir i said that i am not personally acquainted with the metal gentleman in question ok carry on but i am informed that he has been awaiting your return for a considerable number of millennia it seems you left here somewhat precipitately left here said zaphod are you being strange we only just arrived here indeed sir persisted the waiter doggedly but before you arrived here sir i understand that you left here zaphod tried this in one brain then in the other youre saying he said that before we arrived here we left here this is going to be a long night thought the waiter precisely sir he said put your analyst on danger money baby advised zaphod no wait a minute said ford emerging above table level again where exactly is here to be absolutely exact sir it is frogstar world b but we just left there protested zaphod we left there and came to the restaurant at the end of the universe yes sir said the waiter feeling that he was now into the home stretch and running well the one was constructed on the ruins of the other oh said arthur brightly you mean weve travelled in time but not in space listen you semievolved simian cut in zaphod go climb a tree will you arthur bristled go bang your heads together foureyes he advised zaphod no no the waiter said to zaphod your monkey has got it right sir arthur stuttered in fury and said nothing apposite or indeed coherent you jumped forward i believe five hundred and seventysix thousand million years whilst staying in exactly the same place explained the waiter he smiled he had a wonderful feeling that he had finally won through against what had seemed to be insuperable odds thats it said zaphod i got it i told the computer to send us to the nearest place to eat thats exactly what it did give or take five hundred and seventysix thousand million years we never moved neat they all agreed this was very neat but who said zaphod is the cat on the phone whatever happened to marvin said trillian zaphod clapped his hands to his heads the paranoid android i left him moping about on frogstar b when was this well er five hundred and seventysix thousand million years ago i suppose said zaphod hey er hand me the raprod plate captain the little waiters eyebrows wandered about his forehead in confusion i beg your pardon sir he said the phone waiter said zaphod grabbing it off him shee you guys are so unhip its a wonder your bums dont fall off indeed sir hey marvin is that you said zaphod into the phone how you doing kid there was a long pause before a thin low voice came up the line i think you ought to know im feeling very depressed it said zaphod cupped his hands over the phone its marvin he said hey marvin he said into the phone again were having a great time food wine a little personal abuse and the universe going foom where can we find you again the pause you dont have to pretend to be interested in me you know said marvin at last i know perfectly well im only a menial robot ok ok said zaphod but where are you reverse primary thrust marvin thats what they say to me open airlock number three marvin marvin can you pick up that piece of paper can i pick up that piece of paper here i am brain the size of a planet and they ask me to yeah yeah sympathized zaphod hardly at all but im quite used to being humiliated droned marvin i can even go and stick my head in a bucket of water if you like would you like me to go and stick my head in a bucket of water ive got one ready wait a minute er hey marvin interrupted zaphod but it was too late sad little clunks and gurgles came up the line whats he saying asked trillian nothing said zaphod he just phoned up to wash his head at us there said marvin coming back on the line and bubbling a bit i hope that gave satisfaction yeah yeah said zaphod now will you please tell us where you are im in the car park said marvin the car park said zaphod what are you doing there parking cars what else does one do in a car park ok hang in there well be right down in one movement zaphod leapt to his feet threw down the phone and wrote hotblack desiato on the bill come on guys he said marvins in the car park lets get on down whats he doing in the car park asked arthur parking cars what else dum dum but what about the end of the universe well miss the big moment ive seen it its rubbish said zaphod nothing but a gnab gib a what opposite of a big bang come on lets get zappy few of the other diners paid them any attention as they weaved their way through the restaurant to the exit their eyes were riveted on the horror of the skies an interesting effect to watch for max was telling them is in the upper lefthand quadrant of the sky where if you look very carefully you can see the star system hastromil boiling away into the ultraviolet anyone here from hastromil there were one or two slightly hesitant cheers from somewhere at the back well said max beaming cheerfully at them its too late to worry about whether you left the gas on now section the main reception foyer was almost empty but ford nevertheless weaved his way through it zaphod grasped him firmly by the arm and manoeuvred him into a cubicle standing to one side of the entrance hall what are you doing to him asked arthur sobering him up said zaphod and pushed a coin into a slot lights flashed gases swirled hi said ford stepping out a moment later where are we going down to the car park come on what about the personnel time teleports said ford get us straight back to the heart of gold yeah but ive cooled on that ship zarniwoop can have it i dont want to play his games lets see what we can find a sirius cybernetics corporation happy vertical people transporter took them down deep into the substrata beneath the restaurant they were glad to see it had been vandalized and didnt try to make them happy as well as take them down at the bottom of the shaft the lift doors opened and a blast of cold stale air hit them the first thing they saw on leaving the lift was a long concrete wall with over fifty doors in it offering lavatory facilities for all of fifty major lifeforms nevertheless like every car park in the galaxy throughout the entire history of car parks this car park smelt predominantly of impatience they turned a corner and found themselves on a moving catwalk that traversed a vast cavernous space that stretched off into the dim distance it was divided off into bays each of which contained a space ship belonging to one of the diners upstairs some smallish and utilitarian mass production models others vast shining limoships the playthings of the very rich zaphods eyes sparkled with something that may or may not have been avarice as he passed over them in fact its best to be clear on this point avarice is definitely what it was there he is said trillian marvin down there they looked where she was pointing dimly they could see a small metal figure listlessly rubbing a small rag on one remote corner of a giant silver suncruiser at short intervals along the moving catwalk wide transparent tubes led down to floor level zaphod stepped off the catwalk into one and floated gently downwards the others followed thinking back to this later arthur dent thought it was the single most enjoyable experience of his travels in the galaxy hey marvin said zaphod striding over towards to him hey kid are we pleased to see you marvin turned and in so far as it is possible for a totally inert metal face to look reproachfully this is what it did no youre not he said no one ever is suit yourself said zaphod and turned away to ogle the ships ford went with him only trillian and arthur actually went up to marvin no really we are said trillian and patted him in a way that he disliked intensely hanging around waiting for us all this time five hundred and seventysix thousand million three thousand five hundred and seventynine years said marvin i counted them well here we are now said trillian felling quite correctly in marvins view that it was a slightly foolish thing to say the first ten million years were the worst said marvin and the second ten million years they were the worst too the third million years i didnt enjoy at all after that i went into a bit of decline he paused just long enough to make them feel they ought to say something and then interrupted its the people you meet in this job that really get you down he said and paused again trillian cleared her throat is that the best conversation i had was over forty million years ago continued marvin again the pause oh d and that was with a coffee machine he waited thats a you dont like talking to me do you said marvin in a low desolate tone trillian talked to arthur instead further down the chamber ford prefect had found something of which he very much liked the look several such things in fact zaphod he said in a quiet voice just look at some of these little star trolleys zaphod looked and liked the craft they were looking at was in fact pretty small but extraordinary and very much a rich kids toy it was not much to look at it resembled nothing so much as a paper dart about twenty feet long made of thin but tough metal foil at the rear end was a small horizontal twoman cockpit it had a tiny charm drive engine which was not capable of moving it at any great speed the thing it did have however was a heatsink the heatsink had a mass of some two thousand billion tons and was contained within a black hole mounted in an electromagnetic field situated halfway along the length of the ship and this heatsink enabled the craft to be manoeuvred to within a few miles of a yellow sun there to catch and ride the solar flares that burst out from its surface flareriding is one of the most exotic and exhilarating sports in existence and those who can dare and afford it are amongst the most lionized men in the galaxy it is also of course stupefyingly dangerous those who dont die riding invariably die of sexual exhaustion at one of the daedalus clubs apres flare parties ford and zaphod looked and passed on and this baby said ford the tangerine star buggy with the black sunbusters again the star buggy was a small ship a totally misnamed one in fact because the one thing it couldnt manage was interstellar distances basically it was a sporty planet hopper dolled up to something it wasnt nice lines though they passed on the next one was a big one and thirty yards long a coach built limoship and obviously designed with one aim in mind that of making the beholder sick with envy the paintwork and accessory detail clearly said not only am i rich enough to afford this ship i am also rich enough not to take it seriously it was wonderfully hideous just look at it said zaphod multicluster quark drive perspulex running boards got to be a lazlar lyricon custom job he examined every inch yes he said look the infrapink lizard emblem on the neutrino cowling lazlars trade mark the man has no shame i was passed by one of these mothers once out by the axel nebula said ford i was going flat out and this thing just strolled past me star drive hardly ticking over just incredible zaphod whistled appreciatively ten seconds later said ford it smashed straight into the third moon of jaglan beta yeah right amazing looking ship though looks like a fish moves like a fish steers like a cow ford looked round the other side hey come and see he called out theres a big mural painted on this side a bursting sun disaster areas trade mark this must be hotblacks ship lucky old bugger they do this terrible song you know which ends with a stuntship crashing into the sun meant to be an amazing spectacle expensive in stunt ships though zaphods attention however was elsewhere his attention was riveted on the ship standing next to hotblack desiatos limo his mouths hung open that he said that is really bad for the eyes ford looked he too stood astonished it was a ship of classic simple design like a flattened salmon twenty yards long very clean very sleek there was just one remarkable thing about it its so black said ford prefect you can hardly make out its shape light just seems to fall into it zaphod said nothing he had simply fallen in love the blackness of it was so extreme that it was almost impossible to tell how close you were standing to it your eyes just slide off it said ford in wonder it was an emotional moment he bit his lip zaphod moved forward to it slowly like a man possessed or more accurately like a man who wanted to possess his hand reached out to stroke it his hand stopped his hand reached out to stroke it again his hand stopped again come and feel the surface he said in a hushed voice ford put his hand out to feel it his hand stopped you you cant he said see said zaphod its just totally frictionless this must be one mother of a mover he turned to look at ford seriously at least one of his heads did the other stayed gazing in awe at the ship what do you reckon ford he said you mean er ford looked over his shoulder you mean stroll off with it you think we should no nor do i but were going to arent we how can we not they gazed a little longer till zaphod suddenly pulled himself together we better shift soon he said in a moment or so the universe will have ended and all the captain creeps will be pouring down here to find their bourgemobiles zaphod said ford yeah how do we do it simple said zaphod he turned marvin he called slowly laboriously and with a million little clanking and creaking noises that he had learned to simulate marvin turned round to answer the summons come on over here said zaphod weve got a job for you marvin trudged towards them i wont enjoy it he said yes you will enthused zaphod theres a whole new life stretching out ahead of you oh not another one groaned marvin will you shut up and listen hissed zaphod this time theres going to be excitement and adventure and really wild things sounds awful marvin said marvin all im trying to ask you i suppose you want me to open this spaceship for you what er yes yeah thats right said zaphod jumpily he was keeping at least three eyes on the entrance time was short well i wish youd just tell me rather than try to engage my enthusiasm said marvin because i havent got one he walked on up to the ship touched it and a hatchway swung open ford and zaphod stared at the opening dont mention it said marvin oh you didnt he trudged away again arthur and trillian clustered round whats happening asked arthur look at this said ford look at the interior of this ship weirder and weirder breathed zaphod its black said ford everything in it is just totally black in the restaurant things were fast approaching the moment after which there wouldnt be any more moments all eyes were fixed on the dome other than those of hotblack desiatos bodyguard which were looking intently at hotblack desiato and those of hotblack desiato himself which the bodyguard had closed out of respect the bodyguard leaned forward over the table had hotblack desiato been alive he probably would have deemed this a good moment to lean back or even go for a short walk his bodyguard was not a man which improved with proximity on account of his unfortunate condition however hotblack desiato remained totally inert mr desiato sir whispered the bodyguard whenever he spoke it looked as if the muscles on either side of his mouth were clambering over each other to get out of the way mr desiato can you hear me hotblack desiato quit naturally said nothing hotblack hissed the bodyguard again quite naturally hotblack desiato did not reply supernaturally however he did on the table in front of him a wine glass rattled and a fork rose an inch or so and tapped against the glass it settled on the table again the bodyguard gave a satisfied grunt its time we get going mr desiato muttered the bodyguard dont want to get caught in the rush not in your condition you want to get to the next gig nice and relaxed there was a really big audience for it one of the best kakrafoon fivehundred seventysix thousand and two million years ago had you will have been looking forward to it the fork rose again waggled in a noncommittal sort of way and dropped again ah come on said the bodyguard its going to have been great you knocked em cold the bodyguard would have given dr dan streetmentioner an apoplectic attack the black ship going into the sun always gets em and the new ones a beauty be real sorry to see it go if we get on down there ill set the black ship autopilot and well cruise off in the limo ok the fork tapped once in agreement and the glass of wine mysteriously emptied itself the bodyguard wheeled hotblack desiatos chair out of the restaurant and now cried max from the centre of the stage the moment youve all been waiting for he flung his arms into the air behind him the band went into a frenzy of percussion and rolling synthochords max had argued with them about this but they had claimed it was in their contract that thats what they would do his agent would have to sort it out the skies begin to boil he cried nature collapses into the screaming void in twenty seconds time the universe itself will be at an end see where the light of infinity bursts in upon us the hideous fury of destruction blazed about them and at that moment a still small trumpet sounded as from an infinite distance maxs eyes swivelled round to glare at the band none of them seemed to be playing a trumpet suddenly a wisp of smoke was swirling and shimmering on the stage next to him the trumpet was joined by more trumpets over five hundred times max had done this show and nothing like this had ever happened before he drew back in alarm from the swirling smoke and as he did so a figure slowly materialized inside the figure of an ancient man bearded robed and wreathed in light in his eyes were stars and on his brow a golden crown whats this whispered max wildeyed whats happening at the back of the restaurant the stonyfaced party from the church of the second coming of the great prophet zarquon leapt ecstatically to their feet chanting and crying max blinked in amazement he threw up his arms to the audience a big hand please ladies and gentlemen he hollered for the great prophet zarquon he has come zarquon has come again thunderous applause broke out as max strode across the stage and handed his microphone to the prophet zarquon coughed he peered round at the assembled gathering the stars in his eyes blinked uneasily he handled the microphone with confusion er he said hello er look im sorry im a bit late ive had the most ghastly time all sorts of things cropping up at the last moment he seemed nervous of the expectant awed hush he cleared his throat er how are we for time he said have i just got a min and so the universe ended section one of the major selling point of that wholly remarkable travel book the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy apart from its relative cheapness and the fact that it has the words dont panic written in large friendly letters on its cover is its compendious and occasionally accurate glossary the statistics relating to the geosocial nature of the universe for instance are deftly set out between pages nine hundred and thirtyeight thousand and twentyfour and nine hundred and thirtyeight thousand and twentysix and the simplistic style in which they are written is partly explained by the fact that the editors having to meet a publishing deadline copied the information off the back of a packet of breakfast cereal hastily embroidering it with a few footnoted in order to avoid prosecution under the incomprehensibly tortuous galactic copyright laws it is interesting to note that a later and wilier editor sent the book backwards in time through a temporal warp and then successfully sued the breakfast cereal company for infringement of the same laws here is a sample the universe some information to help you live in it begin begin item the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy offers this definition of the word infinite infinite bigger than the biggest thing ever and then some much bigger than that in fact really amazingly immense a totally stunning size wow thats big time infinity is just so big that by comparison bigness itself looks really titchy gigantic multiplied by colossal multiplied by staggeringly huge is the sort of concept were trying to get across here item it is impossible to import things into an infinite area there being no outside to import things in from item see imports item it is known that there are an infinite number of worlds simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in however not every one of them is inhabited therefore there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds so the average population of all the planets in the universe can be said to be zero from this it follows that the population of the whole universe is also zero and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination item in fact there are three freely convertible currencies in the galaxy but none of them count the altairan dollar has recently collapsed the flaninian pobble bead is only exchangeable for other flaninian pobble beads and the triganic pu has its own very special problems its exchange rate of eight ningis to one pu is simple enough but since a ningi is a triangular rubber coin six thousand eight hundred miles across each side no one has ever collected enough to own one pu ningis are not negotiable currency because the galactibanks refuse to deal in fiddling small change from this basic premise it is very simple to prove that the galactibanks are also the product of a deranged imagination item the function of art is to hold the mirror up to nature and there simply isnt a mirror big enough see point one item well in fact there is an awful lot of this largely because of the total lack of money trade banks art or anything else that might keep all the nonexistent people of the universe occupied however it is not worth embarking on a long discussion of it now because it really is terribly complicated for further information see guide chapters seven nine ten eleven fourteen sixteen seventeen nineteen twentyone to eightyfour inclusive and in fact most of the rest of the guide end end section the restaurant continued existing but everything else had stopped temporal relastatics held it and protected it in a nothingness that wasnt merely a vacuum it was simply nothing there was nothing in which a vacuum could be said to exist the forceshielded dome had once again been rendered opaque the party was over the diners were leaving zarquon had vanished along with the rest of the universe the time turbines were preparing to pull the restaurant back across the brink of time in readiness for the lunch sitting and max quordlepleen was back in his small curtained dressing room trying to raise his agent on the tempophone in the car park stood the black ship closed and silent in to the car park came the late mr hotblack desiato propelled along the moving catwalk by his bodyguard they descended one of the tubes as they approached the limoship a hatchway swung down from its side engaged the wheels of the wheelchair and drew it inside the bodyguard followed and having seen his boss safely connected up to his deathsupport system moved up to the small cockpit here he operated the remote control system which activated the autopilot in the black ship lying next to the limo thus causing great relief to zaphod beeblebrox who had been trying to start the thing for over ten minutes the black ship glided smoothly forward out of its bay turned and moved down the central causeway swiftly and quietly at the end it accelerated rapidly flung itself into the temporal launch chamber and began the long journey back into the distant past the milliways lunch menu quotes by permission a passage from the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy the passage is this the history of every major galactic civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases those of survival inquiry and sophistication otherwise known as the how why and where phases for instance the first phase is characterized by the question how can we eat the second by the question why do we eat and the third by the question where shall we have lunch the menu goes on to suggest that milliways the restaurant at the end of the universe would be a very agreeable and sophisticated answer to that third question what it doesnt go on to say is that though it will usually take a large civilization many thousands of years to pass through the how why and where phases small social groupings under stressful conditions can pass through them with extreme rapidity how are we doing said arthur dent badly said ford prefect where are we going said trillian i dont know said zaphod beeblebrox why not demanded arthur dent shut up suggested zaphod beeblebrox and ford prefect basically what youre trying to say said arthur dent ignoring this suggestion is that were out of control the ship was rocking and swaying sickeningly as ford and zaphod tried to wrest control from the autopilot the engined howled and whined like tired children in a supermarket its the wild colour scheme that freaks me said zaphod whose love affair with this ship had lasted almost three minutes into the flight every time you try to operate on of these weird black controls that are labelled in black on a black background a little black light lights up black to let you know youve done it what is this some kind of galactic hyperhearse the walls of the swaying cabin were also black the ceiling was black the seats which were rudimentary since the only important trip this ship was designed for was supposed to be unmanned were black the control panel was black the instruments were black the little screws that held them in place were black the thin tufted nylon floor covering was black and when they had lifted up a corner of it they had discovered that the foam underlay also was black perhaps whoever designed it had eyes that responded to different wavelengths offered trillian or didnt have much imagination muttered arthur perhaps said marvin he was feeling very depressed in fact though they werent to know it the decor had been chosen in honour of its owners sad lamented and taxdeductible condition the ship gave a particularly sickening lurch take it easy pleaded arthur youre making me space sick time sick said ford were plummeting backwards through time thank you said arthur now i think i really am going to be ill go ahead said zaphod we could do with a little colour about this place this is meant to be a polite afterdinner conversation is it snapped arthur zaphod left the controls for ford to figure out and lurched over to arthur look earthman he said angrily youve got a job to do right the question to the ultimate answer right what that thing said arthur i thought wed forgotten about that not me baby like the mice said its worth a lot of money in the right quarters and its all locked up in that head thing of yours yes but but nothing think about it the meaning of life we get our fingers on that we can hold every shrink in the galaxy up to ransom and thats worth a bundle i owe mine a mint arthur took a deep breath without much enthusiasm alright he said but where do we start how should i know they say the ultimate answer or whatever is fortytwo how am i supposed to know what the question is it could be anything i mean whats six times seven zaphod looked at him hard for a moment then his eyes blazed with excitement fortytwo he cried arthur wiped his palm across his forehead yes he said patiently i know that zaphods faces fell im just saying that the question could be anything at all said arthur and i dont see how i am meant to know because hissed zaphod you were there when your planet did the big firework we have a thing on earth began arthur had corrected zaphod called tact oh never mind look i just dont know a low voice echoed dully round the cabin i know said marvin ford called out from the controls he was still fighting a losing battle with stay out of this marvin he said this is organism talk its printed in the earthmans brainwave patterns continued marvin but i dont suppose youll be very interested in knowing that you mean said arthur you mean you can see into my mind yes said marvin arthur stared in astonishment and he said it amazes me how you can manage to live in anything that small ah said arthur abuse yes confirmed marvin ah ignore him said zaphod hes only making it up making it up said marvin swivelling his head in a parody of astonishment why should i want to make anything up lifes bad enough as it is without wanting to invent any more of it marvin said trillian in the gentle kindly voice that only she was still capable of assuming in talking to this misbegotten creature if you knew all along why then didnt you tell us marvins head swivelled back to her you didnt ask he said simply well were asking you now metal man said ford turning round to look at him at that moment the ship suddenly stopped rocking and swaying the engine pitch settled down to a gentle hum hey ford said zaphod that sounds good have you worked out the controls of this boat no said ford i just stopped fiddling with them i reckon we just go to wherever this ship is going and get off it fast yeah right said zaphod i could tell you werent really interested murmured marvin to himself and slumped into a corner and switched himself off trouble is said ford that the one instrument in this while ship that is giving any reading is worrying me if it is what i think it is and if its saying what i think its saying then weve already gone too far back into the past maybe as much as two million years before our own time zaphod shrugged time is bunk he said i wonder who this ship belongs to anyway said arthur me said zaphod no who it really belongs to really me insisted zaphod look property is theft right therefore theft is property therefore this ship is mine ok tell the ship that said arthur zaphod strode over to the console ship he said banging on the panels this is your new owner speaking to he got no further several things happened at once the ship dropped out fo time travel mode and reemerged into real space all the controls on the console which had been shut down for the time trip now lit up a large vision screen above the console winked into life revealing a wide starscape and a single very large sun dead ahead of them none of these things however were responsible for the fact that zaphod was at the same moment hurled bodily backwards against the rear of the cabin as were all the others they were hurled back by a single thunderous clap of noise that thuddered out of the monitor speakers surrounding the vision screen section down on the dry red world of kakrafoon in the middle of the vast rudlit desert the stage technicians were testing the sound system that is to say the sound system was in the desert not the stage technicians they had retreated to the safety of disaster areas giant control ship which hung in orbit some four hundred miles above the surface of the planet and they were testing the sound system from there anyone within five miles of the speaker silos wouldnt have survived the tuning up if arthur dent had been within five miles of the speaker silos then his expiring thought would have been that in both size and shape the sound rig closely resembled manhattan risen out of the silos the neutron phase speaker stacks towered monstrously against the sky obscuring the banks of plutonium reactors and seismic amps behind them buried deep in concrete bunkers beneath the city of speakers lay the instruments that the musicians would control from their ship the massive photonajuitar the bass detonator and the megabang drum complex it was going to be a noisy show aboard the giant control ship all was activity and bustle hotblack desiatos limoship a mere tadpole beside it had arrived and docked and the lamented gentleman was being transported down the high vaulted corridors to meet the medium who was going to interpret his psychic impulses on to the ajuitar keyboard a doctor a logician and a marine biologist had also just arrived flown in at phenomenal expense from maximegalon to try to reason with the lead singer who had locked himself in the bathroom with a bottle of pills and was refusing to come out till it could be proved conclusively to him that he wasnt a fish the bass player was busy machinegunning his bedroom and the drummer was nowhere on board frantic inquiries led to the discovery that he was standing on a beach on santraginus v over a hundred light years away where he claimed he had been happy over half an hour now and had found a small stone that would be his friend the bands manager was profoundly relieved it meant that for the seventeenth time on this tour the drums would be played by a robot and that therefore the timing of the cymbalistics would be right the subether was buzzing with the communications of the stage technicians testing the speaker channels and this it was that was being relayed to the interior of the black ship its dazed occupants lay against the back wall of the cabin and listened to the voices on the monitor speakers ok channel nine on power said a voice testing channel fifteen another thumping crack of noise walloped through the ship channel fifteen aok said another voice a third voice cut in the black stunt ship is now in position it said its looking good gonna be a great sundive stage computer on line a computer voice answered on line it said take control of the black ship black ship locked into trajectory programme on standby testing channel twenty zaphod leaped across the cabin and switched frequencies on the subether receiver before the next mindpulverizing noise hit them he stood there quivering what said trillian in a small quiet voice does sundive mean it means said marvin that the ship os going to dive into the sun sun dive its very simple to understand what do you expect if you steal hotblack desiatos stunt ship how do you know said zaphod in a voice that would make a vegan snow lizard feel chilly that this is hotblack desiatos stuntship simple said marvin i parked it for him the why didnt you tell us you said you wanted excitement and adventure and really wild things this is awful said arthur unnecessarily in the pause which followed thats what i said confirmed marvin on a different frequency the subether receiver had picked up a public broadcast which now echoed round the cabin fine weather for the concert here this afternoon im standing here in front of the stage the reporter lied in the middle of the rudlit desert and with the aid of hyperbinoptic glasses i can just about make out the huge audience cowering there on the horizon all around me behind me the speaker stacks rise like a sheer cliff face and high above me the sun is shining away and doesnt know whats going to hit it the environmentalist lobby do know whats going to hit it and they claim that the concert will cause earthquakes tidal waves hurricanes irreparable damage to the atmosphere and all the usual things that environmentalists usually go on about but ive just had a report that a representative of disaster area met with the environmentalists at lunchtime and had them all shot so nothing now lies in the way of zaphod switched it off he turned to ford you know what im thinking he said i think so said ford tell me what you think im thinking i think youre thinking its time we get off this ship i think youre right said zaphod i think youre right said ford how said arthur quiet said ford and zaphod were thinking so this is it said arthur were going to die i wish youd stop saying that said ford it is worth repeating at this point the theories that ford had come up with on his first encounter with human beings to account for their peculiar habit of continually stating and restating the very very obvious as it its a nice day or youre very tall or so this is it were going to die his first theory was that if human beings didnt keep exercising their lips their mouths probably seized up after a few months of observation he had come up with a second theory which was this if human beings dont keep exercising their lips their brains start working in fact this second theory is more literally true of the belcebron people of kakrafoon the belcebron people used to cause great resentment and insecurity amongst neighboring races by being one of the most enlightened accomplished and above all quiet civilizations in the galaxy as a punishment for this behaviour which was held to be offensively self righteous and provocative a galactic tribunal inflicted on them that most cruel of all social diseases telepathy consequently in order to prevent themselves broadcasting every slightest thought that crossed their minds to anyone within a five mile radius they now have to talk very loudly and continuously about the weather their little aches and pains the match this afternoon and what a noisy place kakrafoon had suddenly become another method of temporarily blotting out their minds is to play host to a disaster area concert the timing of the concert was critical the ship had to begin its dive before the concert began in order to hit the sun six minutes and thirtyseven seconds before the climax of the song to which it related so that the light of the solar flares had time to travel out to kakrafoon the ship had already been diving for several minutes by the time that ford prefect had completed his search of the other compartments of the black ship he burst back into the cabin the sun of kakrafoon loomed terrifyingly large on the vision screen its blazing white inferno of fusing hydrogen nuclei growing moment by moment as the ship plunged onwards unheeding the thumping and banging of zaphods hands on the control panel arthur and trillian had the fixed expressions of rabbits on a night road who think that the best way of dealing with approaching headlights is to stare them out zaphod span round wildeyed ford he said how many escape capsules are there none said ford zaphod gibbered did you count them he yelled twice said ford did you manage to raise the stage crew on the radio yeah said zaphod bitterly i said there were a whole bunch of people on board and they said to say hi to everybody ford goggled didnt you tell them who we were oh yeah they said it was a great honour that and something about a restaurant bill and my executors ford pushed arthur aside and leaned forward over the control console does none of this function he said savagely all overridden smash the autopilot find it first nothing connects there was a moments cold silence arthur was stumbling round the back of the cabin he stopped suddenly incidentally he said what does teleport mean another moment passed slowly the others turned to face him probably the wrong moment to ask said arthur its just i remember hearing you use the word a short while ago and i only bring it up because where said ford prefect quietly does it say teleport well just over here in fact said arthur pointing at a dark control box in the rear of the cabin just under the word emergency above the word system and beside the sign saying out of order in the pandemonium that instantly followed the only action to follow was that of ford prefect lunging across the cabin to the small black box that arthur had indicated and stabbing repeatedly at the single small black button set into it a sixfoot square panel slid open beside it revealing a compartment which resembled a multiple shower unit that had found a new function in life as an electricians junk store half finished wiring hung from the ceiling a jumble of abandoned components lay strewn on the floor and the programming panel lolled out of the cavity in the wall into which it should have been secured a junior disaster area accountant visiting the shipyard where this ship was being constructed had demanded to know of the works foreman why the hell they were fitting an extremely expensive teleport into a ship which only had one important journey to make and that unmanned the foreman had explained that the teleport was available at a ten per cent discount and the accountant had explained that this was immaterial the foreman had explained that it was the finest most powerful and sophisticated teleport that money could buy and the accountant had explained that the money did not wish to buy it the foreman had explained that people would still need to enter and leave the ship and the accountant had explained that the ship sported a perfectly serviceable door the foreman had explained that the accountant could go and boil his head and the accountant had explained to the foreman that the thing approaching him rapidly from his left was a knuckle sandwich after the explanations had been concluded work was discontinued on the teleport which subsequently passed unnoticed on the invoice as sund explns at five times the price hells donkeys muttered zaphod as he and ford attempted to sort through the tangle of wiring after a moment or so ford told him to stand back he tossed a coin into the teleport and jiggled a switch on the lolling control panel with a crackle and spit of light the coin vanished that much of it works said ford however there is no guidance system a matter transference teleport without guidance programming could put you well anywhere the sun of kakrafoon loomed huge on the screen who cares said zaphod we go where we go and said ford there is no autosystem we couldnt all go someone would have to stay and operate it a solemn moment shuffled past the sun loomed larger and larger hey marvin kid said zaphod brightly how you doing very badly i suspect muttered marvin a shortish while later the concert on kakrafoon reached an unexpected climax the black ship with its single morose occupant had plunged on schedule into the nuclear furnace of the sun massive solar flares licked out from it millions of miles into space thrilling and in a few cases spilling the dozen or so flare riders who had been coasting close to the surface of the sun in anticipation of the moment moments before the flare light reached kakrafoon the pounding desert cracked along a deep faultline a huge and hitherto undetected underground river lying far beneath the surface gushed to the surface to be followed seconds later by the eruption of millions of tons of boiling lava that flowed hundreds of feet into the air instantaneously vaporizing the river both above and below the surface in an explosion that echoed to the far side of the world and back again those very few who witnessed the event and survived swear that the whole hundred thousand square miles of the desert rose into the air like a milethick pancake flipped itself over and fell back down at that precise moment the solar radiation from the flares filtered through the clouds of vaporized water and struck the ground a year later the hundred thousand square mile desert was thick with flowers the structure of the atmosphere around the planet was subtly altered the sun blazed less harshly in the summer the cold bit less bitterly in the winter pleasant rain fell more often and slowly the desert world of kakrafoon became a paradise even the telepathic power with which the people of kakrafoon had been cursed was permanently dispersed by the force of the explosion a spokesman for disaster area the one who had had all the environmentalists shot was later quoted as saying that it had been a good gig many people spoke movingly of the healing powers of music a few sceptical scientists examined the records of the events more closely and claimed that they had discovered faint vestiges of a vast artificially induced improbability field drifting in from a nearby region of space section arthur woke up and instantly regretted it hangovers hed had but never anything on this scale this was it this was the big one this was the ultimate pits matter transference beams he decided were not as much fun as say a good solid kick in the head being for the moment unwilling to move on account of a dull stomping throb he was experiencing he lay a while and thought the trouble with most forms of transport he thought is basically one of them not being worth all the bother on earth when there had been an earth before it was demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass the problem had been with cars the disadvantages involved in pulling lots of black sticky slime from out of the ground where it had been safely hidden out of harms way turning it into tar to cover the land with smoke to fill the air with and pouring the rest into the sea all seemed to outweigh the advantages of being able to get more quickly from one place to another particularly when the place you arrived at had probably become as a result of this very similar to the place you had left ie covered with tar full of smoke and short of fish and what about matter transference beams any form of transport which involved tearing you apart atom by atom flinging those atoms through the subether and then jamming them back together again just when they were getting their first taste of freedom for years had to be bad news many people had thought exactly this before arthur dent and had even gone to the lengths of writing songs about it here is one that used regularly to be chanted by huge crowds outside the sirius cybernetics corporation teleport systems factory on happiwerld iii aldebarans great ok algols pretty neat betelgeuses pretty girls will knock you off your feet theyll do anything you like real fast and then real slow but if you have to take me apart to get me there then i dont want to go singing take me apart take me apart what a way to roam and if you have to take me apart to get me there id rather stay at home sirius is paved with gold so ive heard it said by nuts who then go on to say see tau before youre dead ill gladly take the high road or even take the low but if you have to take me apart to get me there then i for one wont go singing take me apart take me apart you must be off your head and if you try to take me apart to get me there ill stay right here in bed i teleported home one night with ron and sid and meg ron stole meggies heart away and i got sidneys leg arthur felt the waves of pain slowly receding though he was still aware of a dull stomping throb slowly carefully he stood up can you hear a dull stomping throb said ford prefect arthur span round and wobbled uncertainly ford prefect was approaching looking red eyed and pasty where are we gasped arthur ford looked around they were standing in a long curving corridor which stretched out of sight in both directions the outer steel wall which was painted in that sickly shade of pale green which they use in schools hospitals and mental asylums to keep the inmates subdued curved over the tops of their heads where it met the inner perpendicular wall which oddly enough was covered in dark brown hessian wall weave the floor was of dark green ribbed rubber ford moved over to a very thick dark transparent panel set in the outer wall it was several layers deep yet through it he could see pinpoints of distant stars i think were in a spaceship of some kind he said down the corridor came the sound of a dull stomping throb trillian called arthur nervously zaphod ford shrugged nowhere about he said ive looked they could be anywhere an unprogrammed teleport can throw you light years in any direction judging by the way i feel i should think weve travelled a very long way indeed how do you feel bad do you think theyre where they are how they are theres no way we can know and no way we can do anything about it do what i do what dont think about it arthur turned this thought over in his mind reluctantly saw the wisdom of it tucked it up and put it away he took a deep breath footsteps exclaimed ford suddenly where that noise that stomping throb pounding feet listen arthur listened the noise echoed round the corridor at them from an indeterminate distance it was the muffled sound of pounding footsteps and it was noticeably louder lets move said ford sharply they both moved in opposite directions not that way said ford thats where theyre coming from no its not said arthur theyre coming from that way theyre not theyre they both stopped they both turned they both listened intently they both agreed with each other they both set off into opposite directions again fear gripped them from both directions the noise was getting louder a few yards to their left another corridor ran at right angles to the inner wall they ran to it and hurried along it it was dark immensely long and as they passed down it gave them the impression that it was getting colder and colder other corridors gave off it to the left and right each very dark and each subjecting them to sharp blasts of icy air as they passed they stopped for a moment in alarm the further down the corridor they went the louder became the sound of pounding feet they pressed themselves back against the cold wall and listened furiously the cold the dark and the drumming of disembodied feet was getting to them badly ford shivered partly with the cold but partly with the memory of stories his favourite mother used to tell him when he was a mere slip of a betelgeusian ankle high to an arcturan megagrasshopper stories of dead ships haunted hulks that roamed restlessly round the obscurer regions of deep space infested with demons or the ghosts of forgotten crews stories too of incautious travellers who found and entered such ships stories of then ford remembered the brown hessian wall weave in the first corridor and pulled himself together however ghosts and demons may choose to decorate their death hulks he thought to himself he would lay any money you liked it wasnt with hessian wall weave he grasped arthur by the arm back the way we came he said firmly and they started to retrace their steps a moment later they leap like startled lizards down the nearest corridor junction as the owners of the drumming feet suddenly hove into view directly in front of them hidden behind the corner they goggled in amazement as about two dozen overweight men and women pounded past them in track suits panting and wheezing in a manner that would make a heart surgeon gibber ford prefect stared after them joggers he hissed as the sound of their feet echoed away up and down the network of corridors joggers whispered arthur dent joggers said ford prefect with a shrug the corridor they were concealed in was not like the others it was very short and ended at a large steel door ford examined it discovered the opening mechanism and pushed it wide the first thing that hit their eyes was what appeared to be a coffin and the next four thousand nine hundred and ninetynine things that hit their eyes were also coffins section the vault was low ceilinged dimly lit and gigantic at the far end about three hundred yards away an archway let through to what appeared to be a similar chamber similarly occupied ford prefect let out a low whistle as he stepped down on to the floor of the vault wild he said whats so great about dead people asked arthur nervously stepping down after him dunno said ford lets find out shall we on closer inspection the coffins seemed to be more like sarcophagi they stood about waist high and were constructed of what appeared to be white marble which is almost certainly what it was something that only appeared to be white marble the tops were semitranslucent and through them could dimly be perceived the features of their late and presumably lamented occupants they were humanoid and had clearly left the troubles of whatever world it was they came from far behind them but beyond that little else could be discerned rolling slowly round the floor between the sarcophagi was a heavy oily white gas which arthur at first thought might be there to give the place a little atmosphere until he discovered that it also froze his ankles the sarcophagi too were intensely cold to the touch ford suddenly crouched down beside one of them he pulled a corner of his towel out of his satchel and started to rub furiously at something look theres a plaque on this one he explained to arthur its frosted over he rubbed the frost clear and examined the engraved characters to arthur they looked like the footprints of a spider that had had one too many of whatever it is that spiders have on a night out but ford instantly recognized an early form of galactic eezeereed it says golgafrincham ark fleet ship b hold seven telephone sanitizer second class and a serial number a telephone sanitizer said arthur a dead telephone sanitizer best kind but whats he doing here ford peered through the top at the figure within not a lot he said and suddenly flashed one of those grins of his which always made people think hed been overdoing things recently and should try to get some rest he scampered over to another sarcophagus a moments brisk towel work and he announced this ones a dead hairdresser hoopy the next sarcophagus revealed itself to be the last resting place of an advertising account executive the one after that contained a secondhand car salesman third class an inspection hatch let into the floor suddenly caught fords attention and he squatted down to unfasten it thrashing away at the clouds of freezing gas that threatened to envelope him a thought occurred to arthur if these are just coffins he said why are they kept so cold or indeed why are they kept anyway said ford tugging the hatchway open the gas poured down through it why in fact is anyone going to all the trouble and expense of carting five thousand dead bodies through space ten thousand said arthur pointing at the archway through which the next chamber was dimly visible ford stuck his head down through the floor hatchway he looked up again fifteen thousand he said theres another lot down there fifteen million said a voice thats a lot said ford a lot a lot turn around slowly barked the voice and put your hands up any other move and i blast you into tiny tiny bits hello said ford turning round slowly putting his hands up and not making any other move why said arthur dent isnt anyone ever pleased to see us standing silhouetted in the doorway through which they had entered the vault was the man who wasnt pleased to see them his displeasure was communicated partly by the barking hectoring quality of his voice and partly by the viciousness with which he waved a long silver killozap gun at them the designer of the gun had clearly not been instructed to beat about the bush make it evil hed been told make it totally clear that this gun has a right end and a wrong end make it totally clear to anyone standing at the wrong end that things are going badly for them if that means sticking all sort of spikes and prongs and blackened bits all over it then so be it this is not a gun for hanging over the fireplace or sticking in the umbrella stand it is a gun for going out and making people miserable with ford and arthur looked at the gun unhappily the man with the gun moved from the door and circled round them as he came into the light they could see his black and gold uniform on which the buttons were so highly polished that they shone with an intensity that would have made an approaching motorist flash his lights in annoyance he gestured at the door out he said people who can supply that amount of fire power dont need to supply verbs as well ford and arthur went out closely followed by the wrong end of the killozap gun and the buttons turning into the corridor they were jostled by twentyfour oncoming joggers now showered and changed who swept on past them into the vault arthur turned to watch them in confusion move screamed their captor arthur moved ford shrugged and moved in the vault the joggers went to twentyfour empty sarcophagi along the side wall opened them climbed in and fell into twentyfour dreamless sleeps section er captain yes number one just heard a sort of report thingy from number two oh dear high up in the bridge of the ship the captain stared out into the infinite reaches of space with mild irritation from where he reclined beneath a wide domed bubble he could see before and above them the vast panorama of stars through which they were moving a panorama that had thinned out noticably during the course of the voyage turning and looking backwards over the vast twomile bulk of the ship he could see the far denser mass of stars behind them which seemed to form almost a solid band this was the view through the galactic centre from which they were travelling and indeed had been travelling for years at a speed that he couldnt quite remember at the moment but he knew it was terribly fast it was something approaching the speed of something or other or was it three times the speed of something else jolly impressive anyway he peered into the bright distance behind the ship looking for something he did this every few minutes or so but never found what he was looking for he didnt let it worry him though the scientist chaps had been very insistent that everything was going to be perfectly alright providing nobody panicked and everybody got on and did their bit in an orderly fashion he wasnt panicking as far as he was concerned everything was going splendidly he dabbed at his shoulder with a large frothy sponge it crept back into his mind that he was feeling mildly irritated about something now what was all that about a slight cough alerted him to the fact that the ships first officer was still standing nearby nice chap number one not of the very brightest had the odd spot of difficulty doing up his shoe laces but jolly good officer material for all that the captain wasnt a man to kick a chap when he was bending over trying to do up his shoe laces however long it took him not like that ghastly number two strutting about all over the place polishing his buttons issuing reports every hour ships still moving captain still on course captain oxygen levels still being maintained captain give it a miss was the captains vote ah yes that was the thing that had been irritating him he peered down at number one yes captain he was shouting something or other about having found some prisoners the captain thought about this seemed pretty unlikely to him but he wasnt one to stand in his officers way well perhaps thatll keep him happy for a bit he said hes always wanted some ford prefect and arthur dent trudged onwards up the ships apparently endless corridors number two marched behind them barking the occasional order about not making any false moves or trying any funny stuff they seemed to have passed at least a mile of continuous brown hessian wall weave finally they reached a large steel door which slid open when number two shouted at it they entered to the eyes of ford prefect and arthur dent the most remarkable thing about the ships bridge was not the fifty foot diameter hemispherical dome which covered it and through which the dazzling display of stars shone down on them to people who have eaten at the restaurant at the end of the universe such wonders are commonplace nor was it the bewildering array of instruments that crowded the long circumferential wall around them to arthur this was exactly what spaceships were traditionally supposed to look like and to ford it looked thoroughly antiquated it confirmed his suspicions that disaster areas stuntship had taken them back at least a million if not two million years before their own time no the thing that really caught them off balance was the bath the bath stood on a six foot pedestal of rough hewn blue water crystal and was of a baroque monstrosity not often seen outside the maximegalon museum of diseased imaginings an intestinal jumble of plumbing had been picked out in gold leaf rather than decently buried at midnight in an unmarked grave the taps and shower attachment would have made a gargoyle jump as the dominant centrepiece of a starship bridge it was terribly wrong and it was with the embittered air of a man who knew this that number two approached it captain sir he shouted through clenched teeth a difficult trick but hed had years during which to perfect it a large genial face and a genial foam covered arm popped up above the rim of the monstrous bath ah hello number two said the captain waving a cheery sponge having a nice day number two snapped even further to attention than he already was i have brought you the prisoners i located in freezer bay seven sir he yapped ford and arthur coughed in confusion er hello they said the captain beamed at them so number two had really found some prisoners well good for him thought the captain nice to see a chap doing what hes best at oh hello there he said to them excuse me not getting up having a quick bath well jynnan tonnyx all round then look in the fridge number one certainly sir it is a curious fact and one to which no one knows quite how much importance to attach that something like of all known worlds in the galaxy be they primitive or highly advanced have invented a drink called jynnan tonnyx or geenntnix or jinondonicks or any one of a thousand or more variations on the same phonetic theme the drinks themselves are not the same and vary between the sivolvian chinantomnigs which is ordinary water server at slightly above room temperature and the gagrakackan tzjinanthonyks which kills cows at a hundred paces and in fact the one common factor between all of them beyond the fact that the names sound the same is that they were all invented and named before the worlds concerned made contact with any other worlds what can be made of this fact it exists in total isolation as far as any theory of structural linguistics is concerned it is right off the graph and yet it persists old structural linguists get very angry when young structural linguists go on about it young structural linguists get deeply excited about it and stay up late at night convinced that they are very close to something of profound importance and end up becoming old structural linguists before their time getting very angry with the young ones structural linguistics is a bitterly divided and unhappy discipline and a large number of its practitioners spend too many nights drowning their problems in ouisghian zodahs number two stood before the captains bathtub trembling with frustration dont you want to interrogate the prisoners sir he squealed the captain peered at him in bemusement why on golgafrincham should i want to do that he asked to get information out of them sir to find out why they came here oh no no no said the captain i expect they just dropped in for a quick jynnan tonnyx dont you but sir theyre my prisoners i must interrogate them the captain looked at them doubtfully oh all right he said if you must ask them what they want to drink a hard cold gleam came into number twos eyes he advanced slowly on ford prefect and arthur dent all right you scum he growled you vermin he jabbed ford with the killozap gun steady on number two admonished the captain gently what do you want to drink number two screamed well the jynnan tonnyx sounds very nice to me said ford what about you arthur arthur blinked what oh er yes he said with ice or without bellowed number two oh with please said ford lemon yes please said ford and do you have any of those little biscuits you know the cheesy ones im asking the questions howled number two his body quaking with apoplectic fury er number two said the captain softly sir push off would you theres a good chap im trying to have a relaxing bath number twos eyes narrowed and became what are known in the shouting and killing people trade as cold slits the idea presumably being to give your opponent the impression that you have lost your glasses or are having difficulty keeping awake why this is frightening is an as yet unresolved problem he advanced on the captain his mouth a thin hard line again tricky to know why this is understood as fighting behaviour if whilst wandering through the jungle of traal you were suddenly to come upon the fabled ravenous bugblatter beast you would have reason to be grateful if its mouth was a thin hard line rather than as it usually is a gaping mass of slavering fangs may i remind you sir hissed number two at the captain that you have now been in that bath for over three years this final shot delivered number two spun on his heel and stalked off to a corner to practise darting eye movements in the mirror the captain squirmed in his bath he gave ford prefect a lame smile well you need to relax a lot in a job like mine he said ford slowly lowered his hands it provoked no reaction arthur lowered his treading very slowly and carefully ford moved over to the bath pedestal he patted it nice he lied he wondered if it was safe to grin very slowly and carefully he grinned it was safe er he said to the captain yes said the captain i wonder said ford could i ask you actually what your job is in fact a hand tapped him on the shoulder he span round it was the first officer your drinks he said ah thank you said ford he and arthur took their jynnan tonnyx arthur sipped his and was surprised to discover it tasted very like a whisky and soda i mean i couldnt help noticing said ford also taking a sip the bodies in the hold bodies said the captain in surprise ford paused and thought to himself never take anything for granted he thought could it be that the captain doesnt know hes got fifteen million dead bodies on his ship the captain was nodding cheerfully at him he also appeared to be playing with a rubber duck ford looked around number two was staring at him in the mirror but only for an instant his eyes were constantly on the move the first officer was just standing there holding the drinks tray and smiling benignly bodies said the captain again ford licked his lips yes he said all those dead telephone sanitizers and account executives you know down in the hold the captain stared at him suddenly he threw back his head and laughed oh theyre not dead he said good lord no no theyre frozen theyre going to be revived ford did something he very rarely did he blinked arthur seemed to come out of a trance you mean youve got a hold full of frozen hairdressers he said oh yes said the captain millions of them hairdressers tired tv producers insurance salesmen personnel officers security guards public relations executives management consultants you name them were going to colonize another planet ford wobbled very slightly exciting isnt it said the captain what with that lot said arthur ah now dont misunderstand me said the captain were just one of the ships in the ark fleet were the b ark you see sorry could i just ask you to run a bit more hot water for me arthur obliged and a cascade of pink frothy water swirled around the bath the captain let out a sigh of pleasure thank you so much my dear fellow do help yourselves to more drinks of course ford tossed down his drink took the bottle from the first officers tray and refilled his glass to the top what he said is a b ark this is said the captain and swished the foamy water around joyfully with the duck yes said ford but well what happened you see was said the captain our planet the world from which we have come was so to speak doomed doomed oh yes so what everyone thought was lets pack the whole population into some giant spaceships and go and settle on another planet having told this much of his story he settled back with a satisfied grunt you mean a less doomed one promoted arthur what did you say dear fellow a less doomed planet you were going to settle on are going to settle on yes so it was decided to build three ships you see three arks in space and im not boring you am i no no said ford firmly its fascinating you know its delightful reflected the captain to have someone else to talk to for a change number twos eyes darted feverishly about the room again and then settled back on the mirror like a pair of flies briefly distracted from their favourite prey of months old meat trouble with a long journey like this continued the captain is that you end up just talking to yourself a lot which gets terribly boring because half the time you know what youre going to say next only half the time asked arthur in surprise the captain thought for a moment yes about half id say anyway wheres the soap he fished around and found it yes so anyway he resumed the idea was that into the first ship the a ship would go all the brilliant leaders the scientists the great artists you know all the achievers and into the third or c ship would go all the people who did the actual work who made things and did things and then into the b ship thats us would go everyone else the middlemen you see he smiled happily at them and we were sent off first he concluded and hummed a little bathing tune the little bathing tune which had been composed for him by one of his worlds most exciting and prolific jingle writer who was currently asleep in hold thirtysix some nine hundred yards behind them covered what would otherwise have been an awkward moment of silence ford and arthur shuffled their feet and furiously avoided each others eyes er said arthur after a moment what exactly was it that was wrong with your planet then oh it was doomed as i said said the captain apparently it was going to crash into the sun or something or maybe it was that the moon was going to crash into us something of the kind absolutely terrifying prospect whatever it was oh said the first officer suddenly i thought it was that the planet was going to be invaded by a gigantic swarm of twelve foot piranha bees wasnt that it number two span around eyes ablaze with a cold hard light that only comes with the amount of practise he was prepared to put in thats not what i was told he hissed my commanding officer told me that the entire planet was in imminent danger of being eaten by an enormous mutant star goat oh really said ford prefect yes a monstrous creature from the pit of hell with scything teeth ten thousand miles long breath that would boil oceans claws that could tear continents from their roots a thousand eyes that burned like the sun slavering jaws a million miles across a monster such as you have never never ever and they made sure they sent you lot off first did they inquired arthur oh yes said the captain well everyone said very nicely i thought that it was very important for morale to feel that they would be arriving on a planet where they could be sure of a good haircut and where the phones were clean oh yes agreed ford i can see that would be very important and the other ships er they followed on after you did they for a moment the captain did not answer he twisted round in his bath and gazed backwards over the huge bulk of the ship towards the bright galactic centre he squinted into the inconceivable distance ah well its funny you should say that he said and allowed himself a slight frown at ford prefect because curiously enough we havent heard a peep out of them since we left five years ago but they must be behind us somewhere he peered off into the distance again ford peered with him and gave a thoughtful frown unless of course he said softly they were eaten by the goat ah yes said the captain with a slight hesitancy creeping into his voice the goat his eyes passed over the solid shapes of the instruments and computers that lined the bridge they winked away innocently at him he stared out at the stars but none of them said a word he glanced at his first and second officers but they seemed lost in their own thoughts for a moment he glanced at ford prefect who raised his eyebrows at him its a funny thing you know said the captain at last but now that i actually come to tell the story to someone else i mean does it strike you as odd number two errrrrrrrrrrr said number two well said ford i can see that youve got a lot of things youre going to talk about so thanks for the drinks and if you could sort of drop us off at the nearest convenient planet ah well thats a little difficult you see said the captain because our trajectory thingy was preset before we left golgafrincham i think partly because im not very good with figures you mean were stuck here on this ship exclaimed ford suddenly losing patience with the whole charade when are you meant to be reaching this planet youre meant to be colonizing oh were nearly there i think said the captain any second now its probably time i was getting out of this bath in fact oh i dont know though why stop just when im enjoying it so were actually going to land in a minute well not so much land in fact not actually land as such no er what are you talking about said ford sharply well said the captain picking his way through the words carefully i think as far as i can remember we were programmed to crash on it crash shouted ford and arthur er yes said the captain yes its all part of the plan i think there was a terribly good reason for it which i cant quite remember at the moment it was something to with er ford exploded youre a load of useless bloody loonies he shouted ah yes that was it beamed the captain that was the reason section the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy has this to say about the planet of golgafrincham it is a planet with an ancient and mysterious history rich in legend red and occasionally green with the blood of those who sought in times gone by to conquer her a land of parched and barren landscapes of sweet and sultry air heady with the scent of the perfumed springs that trickle over its hot and dusty rocks and nourish the dark and musty lichens beneath a land of fevered brows and intoxicated imaginings particularly amongst those who taste the lichens a land also of cool and shaded thoughts amongst those who have learnt to forswear the lichens and find a tree to sit beneath a land also of steel and blood and heroism a land of the body and of the spirit this was its history and in all this ancient and mysterious history the most mysterious figures of all were without doubt those of the great circling poets of arium these circling poets used to live in remote mountain passes where they would lie in wait for small bands of unwary travellers circle round them and throw rocks at them and when the travellers cried out saying why didnt they go away and get on with writing some poems instead of pestering people with all this rockthrowing business they would suddenly stop and then break into one of the seven hundred and ninetyfour great song cycles of vassilian these songs were all of extraordinary beauty and even more extraordinary length and all fell into exactly the same pattern the first part of each song would tell how there once went forth from the city of vassilian a party of five sage princes with four horses the princes who are of course brave noble and wise travel widely in distant lands fought giant ogres pursue exotic philosophies take tea with weird gods and rescue beautiful monsters from ravening princesses before finally announcing that they have achieved enlightenment and that their wanderings are therefore accomplished the second and much longer part of each song would then tell of all their bickerings about which one of them is going to have to walk back all this lay in the planets remote past it was however a descendant of one of these eccentric poets who invented the spurious tales of impending doom which enabled the people of golgafrincham to rid themselves of an entire useless third of their population the other twothirds stayed firmly at home and lived full rich and happy lives until they were all suddenly wiped out by a virulent disease contracted from a dirty telephone section that night the ship crashlanded on to an utterly insignificant little greenblue planet which circled a small unregarded yellow sun in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the galaxy in the hours preceding the crash ford prefect had fought furiously but in vain to unlock the controls of the ship from their preordained flight path it had quickly become apparent to him that the ship had been programmed to convey its payload safely in uncomfortably to its new home but to cripple itself beyond repair in the process its screaming blazing descent through the atmosphere had stripped away most of its superstructure and outer shielding and its final inglorious bellyflop into a murky swamp had left its crew only a few hours of darkness during which to revive and offload its deepfrozen and unwanted cargo for the ship began to settle almost at once slowly upending its gigantic bulk in the stagnant slime once or twice during the night it was starkly silhouetted against the sky as burning meteors the detritus of its descent flashed across the sky in the grey predawn light it let out an obscene roaring gurgle and sank for ever into the stinking depths when the sun came up that morning it shed its thin watery light over a vast area heaving with wailing hairdressers public relations executives opinion pollsters and the rest all clawing their way desperately to dry land a less strong minded sun would probably have gone straight back down again but it continued to climb its way through the sky and after a while the influence of its warming rays began to have some restoring effect on the feebly struggling creatures countless numbers had unsurprisingly been lost to the swamp in the night and millions more had been sucked down with the ship but those that survived still numbered hundreds of thousands and as the day wore on they crawled out over the surrounding countryside each looking for a few square feet of solid ground on which to collapse and recover from their nightmare ordeal two figures moved further afield from a nearby hillside ford prefect and arthur dent watched the horror of which they could not feel a part filthy dirty trick to pull muttered arthur ford scraped a stick along the ground and shrugged an imaginative solution to a problem id have thought he said why cant people just learn to live together in peace and harmony said arthur ford gave a loud very hollow laugh fortytwo he said with a malicious grin no doesnt work never mind arthur looked at him as if hed gone mad and seeing nothing to indicate the contrary realized that it would be perfectly reasonable to assume that this had in fact happened what do you think will happen to them all he said after a while in an infinite universe anything can happen said ford even survival strange but true a curious look came into his eyes as they passed over the landscape and then settles again on the scene of misery below them i think theyll manage for a while he said arthur looked up sharply why do you say that he said ford shrugged just a hunch he said and refused to be drawn to any further questions look he said suddenly arthur followed his pointing finger down amongst the sprawling masses a figure was moving or perhaps lurching would be a more accurate description he appeared to be carrying something on his shoulder as he lurched from prostrate form to prostrate form he seemed to wave whatever the something was at them in a drunken fashion after a while he gave up the struggle and collapsed in a heap arthur had no idea what this was meant to mean to him movie camera said ford recording the historic movement well i dont know about you said ford again after a moment but im off he sat a while in silence after a while this seemed to require comment er when you say youre off what do you mean exactly said arthur good question said ford im getting total silence looking over his shoulder arthur saw that he was twiddling with knobs on a small box ford had already introduced this box as a subetha sensomatic but arthur had merely nodded absently and not pursued the matter in his mind the universe still divided into two parts the earth and everything else the earth having been demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass meant that this view of things was a little lopsided but arthur tended to cling to that lopsidedness as being his last remaining contact with his home subetha sensomatics belonged firmly in the everything else category not a sausage said ford shaking the thing sausage thought arthur to himself as he gazed listlessly at the primitive world about him what i wouldnt give for a good earth sausage would you believe said ford in exasperation that there are no transmissions of any kind within light years of this benighted tip are you listening to me what said arthur were in trouble said ford oh said arthur this sounded like monthold news to him until we pick up anything on this machine said ford our chances of getting off this planet are zero it may be some freak standing wave effect in the planets magnetic field in which case we just travel round and round till we find a clear reception area coming he picked up his gear and strode off arthur looked down the hill the man with the movie camera had struggled back up to his feet just in time to film one of his colleagues collapsing arthur picked a blade of grass and strode off after ford section i trust you had a pleasant meal said zarniwoop to zaphod and trillian as they rematerialized on the bridge of the starship heart of gold and lay panting on the floor zaphod opened some eyes and glowered at him you he spat he staggered to his feet and stomped off to find a chair to slump into he found one and slumped into it i have programmed the computer with the improbability coordinates pertinent to our journey said zarniwoop we will arrive there very shortly meanwhile why dont you relax and prepare yourself for the meeting zaphod said nothing he got up again and marched over to a small cabinet from which he pulled a bottle of old janx spirit he took a long pull at it and when this is all done said zaphod savagely its done alright im free to go and do what the hell i like and lie on beaches and stuff it depends what transpires from the meeting said zarniwoop zaphod who is this man said trillian shakily wobbling to her feet whats he doing here whys he on our ship hes a very stupid man said zaphod who wants to meet the man who rules the universe ah said trillian taking the bottle from zaphod and helping herself a social climber section the major problem one of the major problems for there are several one of the many major problems with governing people is that of whom you get to do it or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them to summarize it is a well known fact that those people who most want to rule people are ipso facto those least suited to do it to summarize the summary anyone who is capable of getting themselves made president should on no account be allowed to do the job to summarize the summary of the summary people are a problem and so this is the situation we find a succession of galactic presidents who so much enjoy the fun and palaver of being in power that they very rarely notice that theyre not and somewhere in the shadows behind them who who can possibly rule if no one who wants to do it can be allowed to section on a small obscure world somewhere in the middle of nowhere in particular nowhere that is that could ever be found since it is protected by a vast field of unprobability to which only six men in this galaxy have a key it was raining it was bucketing down and had been for hours it beat the top of the sea into a mist it pounded the trees it churned and slopped a stretch of scrubby land near the sea into a mudbath the rain pelted and danced on the corrugated iron roof of the small shack that stood in the middle of this patch of scrubby land it obliterated the small rough pathway that led from the shack down to the seashore and smashed apart the neat piles of interesting shells which had been placed there the noise of the rain on the roof of the shack was deafening within but went largely unnoticed by its occupant whose attention was otherwise engaged he was a tall shambling man with rough strawcoloured hair that was damp from the leaking roof his clothes were shabby his back was hunched and his eyes though open seemed closed in his shack was an old beatenup armchair an old scratched table an old mattress some cushions and a stove that was small but warm there was also an old and slightly weatherbeaten cat and this was currently the focus of the mans attention he bent his shambling form over it pussy pussy pussy he said coochicoochicoochicoo pussy want his fish nice piece of fish pussy want it the cat seemed undecided on the matter it pawed rather condescendingly at the piece of fish the man was holding out and then got distracted by a piece of dust on the floor pussy not eat his fish pussy get thin and waste away i think said the man doubt crept into his voice i imagine this is what will happen he said but how can i tell he proffered the fish again pussy think he said eat fish or not eat fish i think it is better if i dont get involved he sighed i think fish is nice but then i think that rain is wet so who am i to judge he left the fish on the floor for the cat and retired to his seat ah i seem to see you eating it he said at last as the cat exhausted the entertainment possibilities of the speck of dust and pounced on to the fish i like it when i see you eat the fish said the man because in my mind you will waste away if you dont he picked up from the table a piece of paper and the stub of a pencil he held one in one hand and the other in the other and experimented with the different ways of bringing them together he tried holding the pencil under the paper then over the paper then next to the paper he tried wrapping the paper round the pencil he tried rubbing the stubby end of the pencil against the paper and then he tried rubbing the sharp end of the pencil against the paper it made a mark and he was delighted with the discovery as he was every day he picked up another piece of paper from the table this had a crossword on it he studied it briefly and filled in a couple of clues before losing interest he tried sitting on one of his hands and was intrigued by the feel of the bones of his hip fish come from far away he said or so im told or so i imagine im told when the men come or when in my mind the men come in their six black ships do they come in your mind too what do you see pussy he looked at the cat which was more concerned with getting the fish down as rapidly as possible than it was with these speculations and when i hear their questions do you hear questions what do their voices mean to you perhaps you just think theyre singing songs to you he reflected on this and saw the flaw in the supposition perhaps they are singing songs to you he said and i just think theyre asking me questions he paused again sometimes he would pause for days just to see what it was like do you think they came today he said i do theres mud on the floor cigarettes and whisky on the table fish on a plate for you and a memory of them in my mind hardly conclusive evidence i know but then all evidence is circumstantial and look what else theyve left me he reached over to the table and pulled some things off it crosswords dictionaries and a calculator he played with the calculator for an hour whilst the cat went to sleep and the rain outside continued to pour eventually he put the calculator aside i think i must be right in thinking they ask me questions he said to come all that way and leave all these things for the privilege of singing songs to you would be very strange behaviour or so it seems to me who can tell who can tell from the table he picked up a cigarette and lit it with a spill from the stove he inhaled deeply and sat back i think i saw another ship in the sky today he said at last a big white one ive never seen a big white one just the six black ones and the six green ones and the others who say they come from so far away never a big white one perhaps six small black ones can look like one big white one at certain times perhaps i would like a glass of whisky yes that seems more likely he stood up and found a glass that was lying on the floor by the mattress he poured in a measure from his whisky bottle he sat again perhaps some other people are coming to see me he said a hundred yards away pelted by the torrential rain lay the heart of gold its hatchway opened and three figures emerged huddling into themselves to keep the rain off their faces in there shouted trillian above the noise of the rain yes said zarniwoop that shack yes weird said zaphod but its in the middle of nowhere said trillian we must have come to the wrong place you cant rule the universe from a shack they hurried through the pouring rain and arrived wet through at the door they knocked they shivered the door opened hello said the man ah excuse me said zarniwoop i have reason to believe do you rule the universe said zaphod the man smiled at him i try not to he said are you wet zaphod looked at him in astonishment wet he cried doesnt it look as if were wet thats how it looks to me said the man but how you feel about it might be an altogether different matter if you feel warmth makes you dry youd better come in they went in they looked around the tiny shack zarniwoop with slight distaste trillian with interest zaphod with delight hey er said zaphod whats your name the man looked at them doubtfully i dont know why do you think i should have one it seems very odd to give a bundle of vague sensory perceptions a name he invited trillian to sit in the chair he sat on the edge of the chair zarniwoop leaned stiffly against the table and zaphod lay on the mattress wowee said zaphod the seat of power he tickled the cat listen said zarniwoop i must ask you some questions alright said the man kindly you can sing to my cat if you like would he like that asked zaphod youd better ask him said the man does he talk said zaphod i have no memory of him talking said the man but i am very unreliable zarniwoop pulled some notes out of a pocket now he said you do rule the universe do you how can i tell said the man zarniwoop ticked off a note on the paper how long have you been doing this ah said the man this is a question about the past is it zarniwoop looked at him in puzzlement this wasnt exactly what he had been expecting yes he said how can i tell said the man that the past isnt a fiction designed to account for the discrepancy between my immediate physical sensations and my state of mind zarniwoop stared at him the steam began to rise from his sodden clothes so you answer all questions like this he said the man answered quickly i say what it occurs to me to say when i think i hear people say things more i cannot say zaphod laughed happily ill drink to that he said and pulled out the bottle of janx spirit he leaped up and handed the bottle to the ruler of the universe who took it with pleasure good on you great ruler he said tell it like it is no listen to me said zarniwoop people come to you do they in ships i think so said the man he handed the bottle to trillian and they ask you said zarniwoop to take decisions for them about peoples lives about worlds about economies about wars about everything going on out there in the universe out there said the man out where out there said zarniwoop pointing at the door how can you tell theres anything out there said the man politely the doors closed the rain continued to pound the roof inside the shack it was warm but you know theres a whole universe out there cried zarniwoop you cant dodge your responsibilities by saying they dont exist the ruler of the universe thought for a long while whilst zarniwoop quivered with anger youre very sure of your facts he said at last i couldnt trust the thinking of a man who takes the universe if there is one for granted zarniwoop still quivered but was silent i only decide about my universe continued the man quietly my universe is my eyes and my ears anything else is hearsay but dont you believe in anything the man shrugged and picked up his cat i dont understand what you mean he said you dont understand that what you decide in this shack of yours affects the lives and fates of millions of people this is all monstrously wrong i dont know ive never met all these people you speak of and neither i suspect have you they only exist in words we hear it is folly to say you know what is happening to other people only they know if they exist they have their own universes of their own eyes and ears trillian said i think im just popping outside for a moment she left and walked into the rain do you believe other people exist insisted zarniwoop i have no opinion how can i say id better see whats up with trillian said zaphod and slipped out outside he said to her i think the universe is in pretty good hands yeah very good said trillian they walked off into the rain inside zarniwoop continued but dont you understand that people live or die on your word the ruler of the universe waited for as long as he could when he heard the faint sound of the ships engines starting he spoke to cover it its nothing to do with me he said i am not involved with people the lord knows i am not a cruel man ah barked zarniwoop you say the lord you believe in something my cat said the man benignly picking it up and stroking it i call him the lord i am kind to him alright said zarniwoop pressing home his point how do you know he exists how do you know he knows you to be kind or enjoys what he thinks of as your kindness i dont said the man with a smile i have no idea it merely pleases me to behave in a certain way to what appears to be a cat do you behave any differently please i think i am tired zarniwoop heaved a thoroughly dissatisfied sigh and looked about where are the other two he said suddenly what other two said the ruler of the universe settling back into his chair and refilling his whisky glass beeblebrox and the girl the two who were here i remember no one the past is a fiction to account for stuff it snapped zarniwoop and ran out into the rain there was no ship the rain continued to churn the mud there was no sign to show where the ship had been he hollered into the rain he turned and ran back to the shack and found it locked the ruler of the universe dozed lightly in his chair after a while he played with the pencil and the paper again and was delighted when he discovered how to make a mark with the one on the other various noises continued outside but he didnt know whether they were real or not he then talked to his table for a week to see how it would react section the stars came out that night dazzling in their brilliance and clarity ford and arthur had walked more miles than they had any means of judging and finally stopped to rest the night was cool and balmy the air pure the subetha sensomatic totally silent a wonderful stillness hung over the world a magical calm which combined with the soft fragrances of the woods the quiet chatter of insects and the brilliant light of the stars to soothe their jangled spirits even ford prefect who had seen more worlds than he could count on a long afternoon was moved to wonder if this was the most beautiful he had ever seen all that day they had passed through rolling green hills and valleys richly covered with grasses wild scented flowers and tall thickly leaved trees the sun had warmed them light breezes had kept them cool and ford prefect had checked his subetha sensomatic at less and less frequent intervals and had exhibited less and less annoyance at its continued silence he was beginning to think he liked it here cool though the night air was they slept soundly and comfortably in the open and awoke a few hours later with the light dewfall feeling refreshed but hungry ford had stuffed some small rolls into his satchel at milliways and they breakfasted off those before moving on so far they had wandered purely at random but now they struck out firmly eastwards feeling that if they were going to explore this world they should have some clear idea of where they had come from and where they were going shortly before noon they had their first indication that the world they had landed on was not an uninhabited one a half glimpsed face amongst the trees watching them it vanished at the moment they both saw it but the image they were both left with was of a humanoid creature curious to see them but not alarmed half an hour later they glimpsed another such face and ten minutes after that another a minute later they stumbled into a wide clearing and stopped short before them in the middle of the clearing stood a group of about two dozen men and women they stood still and quiet facing ford and arthur around some of the women huddled some small children and behind the group was a ramshackle array of small dwellings made of mud and branches ford and arthur held their breath the tallest of the men stood a little over five feet high they all stooped forward slightly had longish arms and lowish foreheads and clear bright eyes with which they stared intently at the strangers seeing that they carried no weapons and made no move towards them ford and arthur relaxed slightly for a while the two groups simply stared at each other neither side making any move the natives seemed puzzled by the intruders and whilst they showed no sign of aggression they were quite clearly not issuing any invitations for a full two minutes nothing continued to happen after two minutes ford decided it was time something happened hello he said the women drew their children slightly closer to them the men made hardly any discernible move and yet their whole disposition made it clear that the greeting was not welcome it was not resented in any great degree it was just not welcome one of the men who had been standing slightly forward of the rest of the group and who might therefore have been their leader stepped forward his face was quiet and calm almost serene ugghhhuuggghhhrrrr uh uh ruh uurgh he said quietly this caught arthur by surprise he had grown so used to receiving an instantaneous and unconscious translation of everything he heard via the babel fish lodged in his ear that he had ceased to be aware of it and he was only reminded of its presence now by the fact that it didnt seem to be working vague shadows of meaning had flickered at the back of his mind but there was nothing he could get any firm grasp on he guessed correctly as it happens that these people had as yet evolved no more than the barest rudiments of language and that the babel fish was therefore powerless to help he glanced at ford who was infinitely more experienced in these matters i think said ford out of the corner of his mouth hes asking us if wed mind walking on round the edge of the village a moment later a gesture from the mancreature seemed to confirm this ruurgggghhhh urrgggh urgh urgh rruurruuh ug continued the mancreature the general gist said ford as far as i can make out is that we are welcome to continue our journey in any way we like but if we would walk round his village rather than through it it would make them all very happy so what do we do i think we make them happy said ford slowly and watchfully they walked round the perimeter of the clearing this seemed to go down very well with the natives who bowed to them very slightly and then went about their business ford and arthur continued their journey through the wood a few hundred yards past the clearing they suddenly came upon a small pile of fruit lying in their path berries that looked remarkably like raspberries and blackberries and pulpy green skinned fruit that looked remarkably like pears so far they had steered clear of the fruit and berries they had seen though the trees and bushed were laden with them look at it this way ford prefect had said fruit and berries on strange planets either make you live or make you die therefore the point at which to start toying with them is when youre going to die if you dont that way you stay ahead the secret of healthy hitchhiking is to eat junk food they looked at the pile that lay in their path with suspicion it looked so good it made them almost dizzy with hunger look at it this way said ford er yes said arthur im trying to think of a way of looking at it which means we get to eat it said ford the leafdappled sun gleamed on the pulp skins of the things which looked like pears the things which looked like raspberries and strawberries were fatter and riper than any arthur had ever seen even in ice cream commercials why dont we eat them and think about it afterwards he said maybe thats what they want us to do alright look at it this way sounds good so far its there for us to eat either its good or its bad either they want to feed us or to poison us if its poisonous and we dont eat it theyll just attack us some other way if we dont eat we lose out either way i like the way youre thinking said ford now eat one hesitantly arthur picked up one of those things that looked like pears i always thought that about the garden of eden story said ford eh garden of eden tree apple that bit remember yes of course i do your god person puts an apple tree in the middle of a garden and says do what you like guys oh but dont eat the apple surprise surprise they eat it and he leaps out from behind a bush shouting gotcha it wouldnt have made any difference if they hadnt eaten it why not because if youre dealing with somebody who has the sort of mentality which likes leaving hats on the pavement with bricks under them you know perfectly well they wont give up theyll get you in the end what are you talking about never mind eat the fruit you know this place almost looks like the garden of eden eat the fruit sounds quite like it too arthur took a bite from the thing which looked like a pear its a pear he said a few moments later when they had eaten the lot ford prefect turned round and called out thank you thank you very much he called youre very kind they went on their way for the next fifty miles of their journey eastward they kept on finding the occasional gift of fruit lying in their path and though they once or twice had a quick glimpse of a native man creature amongst the trees they never again made direct contact they decided they rather liked a race of people who made it clear that they were grateful simply to be left alone the fruit and berries stopped after fifty miles because that was where the sea started having no pressing calls on their time they built a raft and crossed the sea it was reasonably calm only about sixty miles wide and they had a reasonably pleasant crossing landing in a country that was at least as beautiful as the one they had left life was in short ridiculously easy and for a while at least they were able to cope with the problems of aimlessness and isolation by deciding to ignore them when the craving for company became too great they would know where to find it but for the moment they were happy to feel that the golgafrinchans were hundreds of miles behind them nevertheless ford prefect began to use his subetha sensomatic more often again only once did he pick up a signal but that was so faint and from such enormous distance that it depressed him more than the silence that had otherwise continued unbroken on a whim they turned northwards after weeks of travelling they came to another sea built another raft and crossed it this time it was harder going the climate was getting colder arthur suspected a streak of masochism in ford prefect the increasing difficulty of the journey seemed to give him a sense of purpose that was otherwise lacking he strode onwards relentlessly their journey northwards brought them into steep mountainous terrain of breathtaking sweep and beauty the vast jagged snow covered peaks ravished their senses the cold began to bite into their bones they wrapped themselves in animal skins and furs which ford prefect acquired by a technique he once learned from a couple of expralite monks running a mindsurfing resort in the hills of hunian the galaxy is littered with expralite monks all on the make because the mental control techniques the order have evolved as a form of devotional discipline are frankly sensational and extraordinary numbers of monks leave the order just after they have finished their devotional training and just before they take their final vows to stay locked in small metal boxes for the rest of their lives fords technique seemed to consist mainly of standing still for a while and smiling after a while an animal a deer perhaps would appear from out of the trees and watch him cautiously ford would continue to smile at it his eyes would soften and shine and he would seem to radiate a deep and universal love a love which reached out to embrace all of creation a wonderful quietness would descend on the surrounding countryside peaceful and serene emanating from this transfigured man slowly the deer would approach step by step until it was almost nuzzling him whereupon ford prefect would reach out to it and break its neck pheromone control he said it was you just have to know how to generate the right smell section a few days after landing in this mountainous land they hit a coastline which swept diagonally before them from the southwest to the northeast a coastline of monumental grandeur deep majestic ravines soaring pinnacles of ice fjords for two further days they scrambled and climbed over the rocks and glaciers awestruck with beauty arthur yelled ford suddenly it was the afternoon of the second day arthur was sitting on a high rock watching the thundering sea smashing itself against the craggy promontories arthur yelled ford again arthur looked to where fords voice had come from carried faintly in the wind ford had gone to examine a glacier and arthur found him there crouching by the solid wall of blue ice he was tense with excitement his eyes darted up to meet arthurs look he said look arthur looked he saw the solid wall of blue ice yes he said its a glacier ive already seen it no said ford youve looked at it you havent seen it look ford was pointing deep into the heart of the ice arthur peered he saw nothing but vague shadows move back from it insisted ford look again arthur moved back and looked again no he said and shrugged what am i supposed to be looking for and suddenly he saw it you see it he saw it his mouth started to speak but his brain decided it hadnt got anything to say yet and shut it again his brain then started to contend with the problem of what his eyes told it they were looking at but in doing so relinquished control of the mouth which promptly fell open again once more gathering up the jaw his brain lost control of his left hand which then wandered around in an aimless fashion for a second or so the brain tried to catch the left hand without letting go of the mouth and simultaneously tried to think about what was buried in the ice which is probably why the legs went and arthur dropped restfully to the ground the thing that had been causing all this neural upset was a network of shadows in the ice about eighteen inches beneath the surface looked at it from the right angle they resolved into the solid shapes of letters from an alien alphabet each about three feet high and for those like arthur who couldnt read magrathean there was above the letters the outline of a face hanging in the ice it was an old face thin and distinguished careworn but not unkind it was the face of the man who had won an award for designing the coastline they now knew themselves to be standing on section a thin whine filled the air it whirled and howled through the trees upsetting the squirrels a few birds flew off in disgust the noise danced and skittered round the clearing it whooped it rasped it generally offended the captain however regarded the lone bagpiper with an indulgent eye little could disturb his equanimity indeed once he had got over the loss of his gorgeous bath during that unpleasantness in the swamp all those months ago he had begun to find his new life remarkably congenial a hollow had been scooped out of a large rock which stood in the middle of the clearing and in this he would bask daily whilst attendants sloshed water over him not particularly warm water it must be said as they hadnt yet worked out a way of heating it never mind that would come and in the meantime search parties were scouring the countryside far and wide for a hot spring preferably one in a nice leafy glade and if it was near a soap mine perfection to those who said that they had a feeling soap wasnt found in mines the captain had ventured to suggest that perhaps that was because no one had looked hard enough and this possibility had been reluctantly acknowledged no life was very pleasant and the greatest thing about it was that when the hot spring was found complete with leafy glade en suite and when in the fullness of time the cry came reverberating across the hills that the soap mine had been located and was producing five hundred cakes a day it would be more pleasant still it was very important to have things to look forward to wail wail screech wail howl honk squeak went the bagpipes increasing the captains already considerable pleasure at the thought that any moment now they might stop that was something he looked forward to as well what else was pleasant he asked himself well so many things the red and gold of the trees now that autumn was approaching the peaceful chatter of scissors a few feet from his bath where a couple of hairdressers were exercising their skills on a dozing art director and his assistant the sunlight gleaming off the six shiny telephones lined up along the edge of his rockhewn bath the only thing nicer than a phone that didnt ring all the time was six phones that didnt ring all the time nicest of all was the happy murmur of all the hundreds of people slowly assembling in the clearing around him to watch the afternoon committee meeting the captain punched his rubber duck playfully on the beak the afternoon committee meetings were his favourite other eyes watched the assembling crowds high in a tree on the edge of the clearing squatted ford prefect lately returned from foreign climes after his six month journey he was lean and healthy his eyes gleamed he wore a reindeerskin coat his beard was as thick and his face as bronzed as a countryrock singers he and arthur dent had been watching the golgafrinchans for almost a week now and ford had decided to stir things up a bit the clearing was now full hundreds of men and women lounged around chatting eating fruit playing cards and generally having a fairly relaxed time of it their track suits were now all dirty and even torn but they all had immaculately styled hair ford was puzzled to see that many of them had stuffed their track suits full of leaves and wondered if this was meant to be some form of insulation against the coming winter fords eyes narrowed they couldnt be interested in botany of a sudden could they in the middle of these speculations the captains voice rose above the hubbub alright he said id like to call this meeting to some sort of order if thats at all possible is that alright with everybody he smiled genially in a minute when youre all ready the talking gradually died away and the clearing fell silent except for the bagpiper who seemed to be in some wild and uninhabitable musical world of his own a few of those in his immediate vicinity threw some leaves to him if there was any reason for this then it escaped ford prefect for the moment a small group of people had clustered round the captain and one of them was clearly beginning to speak he did this by standing up clearing his throat and then gazing off into the distance as if to signify to the crowd that he would be with them in a minute the crowd of course were riveted and all turned their eyes on him a moment of silence followed which ford judged to be the right dramatic moment to make his entry the man turned to speak ford dropped down out of the tree hi there he said the crowd swivelled round ah my dear fellow called out the captain got any matches on you or a lighter anything like that no said ford sounding a little deflated it wasnt what hed prepared he decided hed better be a little stronger on the subject no i havent he continued no matches instead i bring you news pity said the captain weve all run out you see havent had a hot bath in weeks ford refused to be headed off i bring you news he said of a discovery that might interest you is it on the agenda snapped the man whom ford had interrupted ford smiled a broad countryrock singer smile now come on he said well im sorry said the man huffily but speaking as a management consultant of many years standing i must insist on the importance of observing the committee structure ford looked round the crowd hes mad you know he said this is a prehistoric planet address the chair snapped the management consultant there isnt chair explained ford theres only a rock the management consultant decided that testiness was what the situation now called for well call it a chair he said testily why not call it a rock asked ford you obviously have no conception said the management consultant not abandoning testiness in favour of good old fashioned hauteur of modern business methods and you have no conception of where you are said ford a girl with a strident voice leapt to her feet and used it shut up you two she said i want to table a motion you mean boulder a motion tittered a hairdresser order order yapped the management consultant alright said ford lets see how you are doing he plonked himself down on the ground to see how long he could keep his temper the captain made a sort of conciliatory harrumphing noise i would like to call to order he said pleasantly the five hundred and seventythird meeting of the colonization committee of fintlewoodlewix ten seconds thought ford as he leapt to his feet again this is futile he exclaimed five hundred and seventythree committee meetings and you havent even discovered fire yet if you would care said the girl with the strident voice to examine the agenda sheet agenda rock trilled the hairdresser happily thank you ive made that point muttered ford you will see continued the girl firmly that we are having a report from the hairdressers fire development subcommittee today oh ah said the hairdresser with a sheepish look which is recognized the whole galaxy over as meaning er will next tuesday do alright said ford rounding on him what have you done what are you going to do what are your thoughts on fire development well i dont know said the hairdresser all they gave me was a couple of sticks so what have you done with them nervously the hairdresser fished in his track suit top and handed over the fruits of his labour to ford ford held them up for all to see curling tongs he said the crowd applauded never mind said ford rome wasnt burnt in a day the crowd hadnt the faintest idea what he was talking about but they loved it nevertheless they applauded well youre obviously being totally naive of course said the girl when youve been in marketing as long as i have youll know that before any new product can be developed it has to be properly researched weve got to find out what people want from fire how they relate to it what sort of image it has for them the crowd were tense they were expecting something wonderful from ford stick it up your nose he said which is precisely the sort of thing we need to know insisted the girl do people want fire that can be applied nasally do you ford asked the crowd yes shouted some no shouted others happily they didnt know they just thought it was great and the wheel said the captain what about this wheel thingy it sounds a terribly interesting project ah said the marketing girl well were having a little difficulty there difficulty exclaimed ford difficulty what do you mean difficulty its the single simplest machine in the entire universe the marketing girl soured him with a look alright mr wiseguy she said youre so clever you tell us what colour it should have the crowd went wild one up to the home team they thought ford shrugged his shoulders and sat down again almighty zarquon he said have none of you done anything as if in answer to his question there was a sudden clamour of noise from the entrance to the clearing the crowd couldnt believe the amount of entertainment they were getting this afternoon in marched a squad of about a dozen men dressed in the remnants of their golgafrincham rd regiment dress uniforms about half of them still carried killozap guns the rest now carried spears which they struck together as they marched they looked bronzed healthy and utterly exhausted and bedraggled they clattered to a halt and banged to attention one of them fell over and never moved again captain sir cried number two for he was their leader permission to report sir yes alright number two welcome back and all that find any hot springs said the captain despondently no sir thought you wouldnt number two strode through the crowd and presented arms before the bath we have discovered another continent when was this it lies across the sea said number two narrowing his eyes significantly to the east ah number two turned to face the crowd he raised his gun above his head this is going to be great thought the crowd we have declared war on it wild abandoned cheering broke out in all corners of the clearing this was beyond all expectation wait a minute shouted ford prefect wait a minute he leapt to his feet and demanded silence after a while he got it or at least the best silence he could hope for under the circumstances the circumstances were that the bagpiper was spontaneously composing a national anthem do we have to have the piper demanded ford oh yes said the captain weve given him a grant ford considered opening this idea up for debate but quickly decided that that way madness lay instead he slung a well judged rock at the piper and turned to face number two war he said yes number two gazed contemptuously at ford prefect on the next continent yes total warfare the war to end all wars but theres no one even living there yet ah interesting thought the crowd nice point number twos gaze hovered undisturbed in this respect his eyes were like a couple of mosquitos that hover purposefully three inches from your nose and refuse to be deflected by arm thrashes fly swats or rolled newspapers i know that he said but there will be one day so we have left an openended ultimatum what and blown up a few military installations the captain leaned forward out of his bath military installations number two he said for a moment the eyes wavered yes sir well potential military installations alright trees the moment of uncertainty passed his eyes flickered like whips over his audience and he roared we interrogated a gazelle he flipped his killozap gun smartly under his arm and marched off through the pandemonium that had now erupted throughout the ecstatic crowd a few steps was all he managed before he was caught up and carried shoulder high for a lap of honour round the clearing ford sat and idly tapped a couple of stones together so what else have you done he inquired after the celebrations had died down we have started a culture said the marketing girl oh yes said ford yes one of our film producers is already making a fascinating documentary about the indigenous cavemen of the area theyre not cavemen they look like cavemen do they live in caves well they live in huts perhaps theyre having their caves redecorated called out a wag from the crowd ford rounded on him angrily very funny he said but have you noticed that theyre dying out on their journey back ford and arthur had come across two derelict villages and the bodies of many natives in the woods where they had crept away to die those that still lived were stricken and listless as if they were suffering some disease of the spirit rather than the body they moved sluggishly and with an infinite sadness their future had been taken away from them dying out repeated ford do you know what that means er we shouldnt sell them any life insurance called out the wag again ford ignored him and appealed to the whole crowd can you try and understand he said that its just since weve arrived that theyve started dying out in fact that comes over terribly well in this film said the marketing girl and just gives it that poignant twist which is the hallmark of the really great documentary the producers very committed he should be muttered ford i gather said the girl turning to address the captain who was beginning to nod off that he wants to make one about you next captain oh really he said coming to with a start thats awfully nice hes got a very strong angle on it you know the burden of responsibility the loneliness of command the captain hummed and hahed about this for a moment well i wouldnt overstress that angle you know he said finally ones never alone with a rubber duck he held the duck aloft and it got an appreciative round from the crowd all the while the management consultant had been sitting in stony silence his finger tips pressed to his temples to indicate that he was waiting and would wait all day if it was necessary at this point he decided he would not wait all day after all he would merely pretend that the last half hour hadnt happened he rose to his feet if he said tersely we could for a moment move on to the subject of fiscal policy fiscal policy whooped ford prefect fiscal policy the management consultant gave him a look that only a lungfish could have copied fiscal policy he repeated that is what i said how can you have money demanded ford if none of you actually produces anything it doesnt grow on trees you know if you would allow me to continue ford nodded dejectedly thank you since we decided a few weeks ago to adopt the leaf as legal tender we have of course all become immensely rich ford stared in disbelief at the crowd who were murmuring appreciatively at this and greedily fingering the wads of leaves with which their track suits were stuffed but we have also continued the management consultant run into a small inflation problem on account of the high level of leaf availability which means that i gather the current going rate has something like three deciduous forests buying one ships peanut murmurs of alarm came from the crowd the management consultant waved them down so in order to obviate this problem he continued and effectively revaluate the leaf we are about to embark on a massive defoliation campaign and er burn down all the forests i think youll all agree thats a sensible move under the circumstances the crowd seemed a little uncertain about this for a second or two until someone pointed out how much this would increase the value of the leaves in their pockets whereupon they let out whoops of delight and gave the management consultant a standing ovation the accountants amongst them looked forward to a profitable autumn youre all mad explained ford prefect youre absolutely barmy he suggested youre a bunch of raving nutters he opined the tide of opinion started to turn against him what had started out as excellent entertainment had now in the crowds view deteriorated into mere abuse and since this abuse was in the main directed at them they wearied of it sensing this shift in the wind the marketing girl turned on him is it perhaps in order she demanded to inquire what youve been doing all these months then you and that other interloper have been missing since the day we arrived weve been on a journey said ford we went to try and find out something about this planet oh said the girl archly doesnt sound very productive to me no well have i got news for you my love we have discovered this planets future ford waited for this statement to have its effect it didnt have any they didnt know what he was talking about he continued it doesnt matter a pair of fetid dingos kidneys what you all choose to do from now on burn down the forests anything it wont make a scrap of difference your future history has already happened two million years youve got and thats it at the end of that time your race will be dead gone and good riddance to you remember that two million years the crowd muttered to itself in annoyance people as rich as they had suddenly become shouldnt be obliged to listen to this sort of gibberish perhaps they could tip the fellow a leaf or two and he would go away they didnt need to bother ford was already stalking out of the clearing pausing only to shake his head at number two who was already firing his killozap gun into some neighbouring trees he turned back once two million years he said and laughed well said the captain with a soothing smile still time for a few more baths could someone pass me the sponge i just dropped it over the side section a mile or so away through the wood arthur dent was too busily engrossed with what he was doing to hear ford prefect approach what he was doing was rather curious and this is what it was on a wide flat piece of rock he had scratched out the shape of a large square subdivided into one hundred and sixtynine smaller squares thirteen to a side furthermore he had collected together a pile of smallish flattish stones and scratched the shape of a letter on to each sitting morosely round the rock were a couple of the surviving local native men whom arthur dent was trying to introduce the curious concept embodied in these stones so far they had not done well they had attempted to eat some of them bury others and throw the rest of them away arthur had finally encouraged one of them to lay a couple of stones on the board he had scratched out which was not even as far as hed managed to get the day before along with the rapid deterioration in the morale of these creatures there seemed to be a corresponding deterioration in their actual intelligence in an attempt to egg them along arthur set out a number of letters on the board himself and then tried to encourage the natives to add some more themselves it was not going well ford watched quietly from beside a nearby tree no said arthur to one of the natives who had just shuffled some of the letters round in a fit of abysmal dejection q scores ten you see and its on a triple word score so look ive explained the rules to you no no look please put down that jawbone alright well start again and try to concentrate this time ford leaned his elbow against the tree and his hand against his head what are you doing arthur he asked quietly arthur looked up with a start he suddenly had a feeling that all this might look slightly foolish all he knew was that it had worked like a dream on him when he was a chid but things were different then or rather would be im trying to teach the cavemen to play scrabble he said theyre not cavemen said ford they look like cavemen ford let it pass i see he said its uphill work said arthur wearily the only word they know is grunt and they cant spell it he sighed and sat back whats that supposed to achieve asked ford weve got to encourage them to evolve to develop arthur burst out angrily he hoped that the weary sigh and then the anger might do something to counteract the overriding feeling of foolishness from which he was currently suffering it didnt he jumped to his feet can you imagine what a world would be like descended from those cretins we arrived with he said imagine said ford rising his eyebrows we dont have to imagine weve seen it but arthur waved his arms about hopelessly weve seen it said ford theres no escape arthur kicked at a stone did you tell them what weve discovered he asked hmmmm said ford not really concentrating norway said arthur slartibartfasts signature in the glacier did you tell them whats the point said ford what would it mean to them mean said arthur mean you know perfectly well what it means it means that this planet is the earth its my home its where i was born was said ford alright will be yes in two million years time why dont you tell them that go and say to them excuse me id just like to point out that in two million years time i will be born just a few miles from here see what they say theyll chase you up a tree and set fire to it arthur absorbed this unhappily face it said ford those zeebs over there are your ancestors not these poor creatures here he went over to where the apemen creatures were rummaging listlessly with the stone letters he shook his head put the scrabble away arthur he said it wont save the human race because this lot arent going to be the human race the human race is currently sitting round a rock on the other side of this hill making documentaries about themselves arthur winced there must be something we can do he said a terrible sense of desolation thrilled through his body that he should be here on the earth the earth which had lost its future in a horrifying arbitrary catastrophe and which now seemed set to lose its past as well no said ford theres nothing we can do this doesnt change the history of the earth you see this is the history of the earth like it or leave it the golgafrinchans are the people you are descended from in two million years they get destroyed by the vogons history is never altered you see it just fits together like a jigsaw funny old thing life isnt it he picked up the letter q and hurled it into a distant pivet bush where it hit a young rabbit the rabbit hurtled off in terror and didnt stop till it was set upon and eaten by a fox which choked on one of its bones and died on the bank of a stream which subsequently washed it away during the following weeks ford prefect swallowed his pride and struck up a relationship with a girl who had been a personnel officer on golgafrincham and he was terribly upset when she suddenly passed away as a result of drinking water from a pool that had been polluted by the body of a dead fox the only moral it is possible to draw from this story is that one should never throw the letter q into a pivet bush but unfortunately there are times when it is unavoidable like most of the really crucial things in life this chain of events was completely invisible to ford prefect and arthur dent they were looking sadly at one of the natives morosely pushing the other letters around poor bloody caveman said arthur theyre not what oh never mind the wretched creature let out a pathetic howling noise and banged on the rock its all been a bit of waste of time for them hasnt it said arthur uh uh urghhhhh muttered the native and banged on the rock again theyve been outevolved by telephone sanitizers urgh gr gr gruh insisted the native continuing to bang on the rock why does he keep banging on the rock said arthur i think he probably wants you to scrabble with him again said ford hes pointing at the letters probably spelt crzjgrdwldiwdc again poor bastard i keep on telling him theres only one g in crzjgrdwldiwdc the native banged on the rock again they looked over his shoulder their eyes popped there amongst the jumble of letters were eight that had been laid out in a clear straight line they spelt two words the words were these fortytwo grrrurgh guh guh explained the native he swept the letters angrily away and went and mooched under a nearby tree with his colleague ford and arthur stared at him then they stared at each other did that say what i thought it said they both said to each other yes they both said fortytwo said arthur fortytwo said ford arthur ran over to the two natives what are you trying to tell us he shouted whats it supposed to mean one of them rolled over on the ground kicked his legs up in the air rolled over again and went to sleep the other bounded up the tree and threw horse chestnuts at ford prefect whatever it was they had to say they had already said it you know what this means said ford not entirely fortytwo is the number deep thought gave as being the ultimate answer yes and the earth is the computer deep thought designed and built to calculate the question to the ultimate answer so we are led to believe and organic life was part of the computer matrix if you say so i do say so that means that these natives these apemen are an integral part of the computer program and that we and the golgafrinchans are not but the cavemen are dying out and the golgafrinchans are obviously set to replace them exactly so do you see what this means what cock up said ford prefect arthur looked around him this planet is having a pretty bloody time of it he said ford puzzled for a moment still something must have come out of it he said at last because marvin said he could see the question printed in your brain wave patterns but probably the wrong one or a distortion of the right one it might give us a clue though if we could find it i dont see how we can though they moped about for a bit arthur sat on the ground and started pulling up bits of grass but found that it wasnt an occupation he could get deeply engrossed in it wasnt grass he could believe in the trees seemed pointless the rolling hills seemed to be rolling to nowhere and the future seemed just a tunnel to be crawled through ford fiddled with his subetha sensomatic it was silent he sighed and put it away arthur picked up one of the letter stones from his homemade scrabble set it was a t he sighed and out it down again the letter he put down next to it was an i that spelt it he tossed another couple of letters next to them they were an s and an h as it happened by a curious coincidence the resulting word perfectly expressed the way arthur was feeling about things just then he stared at it for a moment he hadnt done it deliberately it was just a random chance his brain got slowly into first gear ford he said suddenly look if that question is printed in my brain wave patterns but im not consciously aware of it it must be somewhere in my unconscious yes i suppose so there might be a way of bringing that unconscious pattern forward oh yes yes by introducing some random element that can be shaped by that pattern like how like by pulling scrabble letters out of a bag blindfolded ford leapt to his feet brilliant he said he tugged his towel out of his satchel and with a few deft knots transformed it into a bag totally mad he said utter nonsense but well do it because its brilliant nonsense come on come on the sun passed respectfully behind a cloud a few small sad raindrops fell they piled together all the remaining letters and dropped them into the bag they shook them up right said ford close your eyes pull them out come on come on come on arthur closed his eyes and plunged his hand into the towelful of stones he jiggled them about pulled out four and handed them to ford ford laid them along the ground in the order he got them w said ford h a t what he blinked i think its working he said arthur pushed three more at him d o y doy oh perhaps it isnt working said ford heres the next three o u g doyoug its not making sense im afraid arthur pulled another two from the bag ford put them in place e t doyouget do you get shouted ford it is working this is amazing it really is working more here arthur was throwing them out feverishly as fast as he could go i f said ford y o u m u l t i p l y what do you get if you multiply s i x six b y by six by what do you get if you multiply six by n i n e six by nine he paused come on wheres the next one er thats the lot said arthur thats all there were he sat back nonplussed he rooted around again in the knotted up towel but there were no more letters you mean thats it said ford thats it six by nine fortytwo thats it thats all there is section the sun came out and beamed cheerfully at them a bird sang a warm breeze wafted through the trees and lifted the heads of the flowers carrying their scent away through the woods an insect droned past on its way to do whatever it is that insects do in the late afternoon the sound of voices lilted through the trees followed a moment later by two girls who stopped in surprise at the sight of ford prefect and arthur dent apparently lying on the ground in agony but in fact rocking with noiseless laughter no dont go called ford prefect between gasps well be with you in a moment whats the matter asked one of the girls she was the taller and slimmer of the two on golgafrincham she had been a junior personnel officer but hadnt liked it much ford pulled himself together excuse me he said hello my friend and i were just contemplating the meaning of life frivolous exercise oh its you said the girl you made a bit of a spectacle of yourself this afternoon you were quite funny to begin with but you did bang on a bit did i oh yes yes what was all that for asked the other girl a shorter roundfaced girl who had been an art director for a small advertising company on golgafrincham whatever the privations of this world were she went to sleep every night profoundly grateful for the fact that whatever she had to face in the morning it wouldnt be a hundred almost identical photographs of moodily lit tubes of toothpaste for for nothing nothings for anything said ford prefect happily come and join us im ford this is arthur we were just about to do nothing at all for a while but it can wait the girls looked at them doubtfully im agda said the tall one this is mella hello agda hello mella said ford do you talk at all said mella to arthur oh eventually said arthur with a smile but not as much as ford good there was a slight pause what did you mean asked agda about only having two million years i couldnt make sense of what you were saying oh that said ford it doesnt matter its just that the world gets demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass said arthur with a shrug but thats two million years away and anyway its just vogons doing what vogons do vogons said mella yes you wouldnt know them whered you get this idea from it really doesnt matter its just like a dream from the past or the future arthur smiled and looked away does it worry you that you dont talk any kind of sense asked agda listen forget it said ford forget all of it nothing matters look its a beautiful day enjoy it the sun the green of the hills the river down in the valley the burning trees even if its only a dream its a pretty horrible idea said mella destroying a world just to make a bypass oh ive heard of worse said ford i read of one planet off in the seventh dimension that got used as a ball in a game of intergalactic bar billiards got potted straight into a black hole killed ten billion people thats mad said mella yes only scored thirty points too agda and mella exchanged glances look said agda theres a party after the committee meeting tonight you can come along if you like yeah ok said ford id like to said arthur many hours later arthur and mella sat and watched the moon rise over the dull red glow of the trees that story about the world being destroyed began mella in two million years yes you say it as if you really think its true yes i think it is i think i was there she shook her head in puzzlement youre very strange she said no im very ordinary said arthur but some very strange things have happened to me you could say im more differed from than differing and that other world your friend talked about the one that got pushed into a black hole ah that i dont know about it sounds like something from the book what book arthur paused the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy he said at last whats that oh just something i threw into the river this evening i dont think ill be wanting it any more said arthur dent end
