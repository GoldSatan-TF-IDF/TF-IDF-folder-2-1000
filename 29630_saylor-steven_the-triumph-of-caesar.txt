steven saylor the triumph of caesar i heard that you were dead such a brusque comment from caesars wife might have offended me had i not heard it already from so many others since i returned from egypt to rome where everyone had apparently given me up for dead having sent a slave to summon me calpurnia had received me in an elegant but sparsely furnished room in her house not far from mine on the palatine hill there was only one chair she sat i stood and tried not to fidget while the most powerful woman in rome looked me up and down yes im sure one of my agents told me you drowned in the nile she said gazing at me shrewdly yet here you stand before me gordianus as alive as everunless those egyptians have learned to bring the dead back to life not just mummify them she fixed her chilly gaze on my face how old are you finder sixtyfour no have the egyptians found a way to restore a mans youth you look very fit for a man your age youre ten years older than my husband yet i daresay you look ten years younger i shrugged great caesar carries the weight of the whole world on his shoulders his enemies have been destroyed but his responsibilities are greater than ever the worries and cares of the worlds master must be endless my humble life has taken a different course my obligations grow less not more ive had my share of strife but now im at peace with the world and with myself for the time being at least having been summoned by caesars wife i had to wonder if the tranquillity of my life was about to be sorely disrupted when did i last see you gordianus it must have been almost exactly two years ago just before i left for egypt she nodded you went there because your wife was unwell yes bethesda was born in egypt she believed that she could be cured of her illness only by bathing in the waters of the nile the cure apparently worked because yet you spent most of your time in the city of alexandria along with my husband she said showing no interest in bethesdas cure yes i arrived in the midst of the civil war between queen cleopatra and her siblings during the siege that confined caesar to the royal palace for several months i was trapped there as well where you became quite friendly with my husband i had the privilege of conversing with him on numerous occasions i said evading the topic of friendship my feelings toward caesar were more complicated than that eventually my husband was victorious in egypt as hes been victorious in every other campaign he put an end to the civil strife in alexandria and installed young cleopatra on the throne she spoke the queens name with a grimace caesars adulterous love affair with cleopatra who claimed to have borne his child was a favorite topic of every scandalmonger in rome the grimace deepened the wrinkles on her face and calpurnia suddenly looked much older than when i had last seen her she had never been a beautiful woman caesar had not married her for her looks but for her respectability his previous wife had embarrassed him by falling prey to gossip caesars wife he had declared must be above suspicion calpurnia proved to be hardheaded pragmatic and ruthless caesar had entrusted her to run his network of spies in the capital while he fought his rivals on distant battlefields there was nothing frivolous in either her manner or her appearance she made no effort to flatter her face with colorful cosmetics or her figure with elegant fabrics i looked about the room which reflected the taste of its occupant the walls were stained deep red and somber yellow instead of depicting an image from history or homer the impeccably crafted mosaic floor displayed an array of interlocking geometric patterns in muted colors the furnishings were exquisite but fewwoolen rugs bronze lamp holders and the single backless chair made of ebony inlaid with lapis tiles in which my hostess sat it was not the reception hall of a queen those i had seen in egypt bright with gold and dripping with ornaments their dazzle intended to intimidate all who entered and yet in fact if not in name calpurnia was now the queen of rome and caesar having defeated every rival was its king though for now he preferred the venerable title of dictator the office our ancestors created so that a strong man could rule the state in times of emergency but if rumors were truethat caesar intended to make the senate declare him dictator for lifehow was he any different from the kings of olden days before rome became a proud republic caesar is in danger calpurnia said abruptly she clasped her hands tightly in her lap her face was taut great danger thats why ive called you here the statement struck me as so peculiar that i laughed out loud then checked myself when i saw the look on her face if the most powerful man on earth the victorious survivor of a brutal civil war that had wreaked havoc across the whole world was in danger what could gordianus the finder do to protect him im sure that caesar can look after himself i said or if he wants my help then he can ask me no her voice rose sharply this was not the dispassionate coldly calculating calpurnia i knew but a woman touched by genuine fear caesar doesnt realize the danger caesar is distracted distracted hes too busy preparing for his upcoming triumphs i nodded there were to be four triumphal processions in the days to come the first to celebrate caesars conquest of gaul would take place three days hence caesar is consumed with the planning and arrangements she said he intends to give the people a series of spectacles such as theyve never seen before small things fall below his notice but small things can grow to be great things they say the nile crocodile begins life as a creature hardly bigger than my little finger yet it very quickly it grows into a monster that can bite a man in two exactly thats why ive called you here gordianusyou have a nose for danger and a taste for finding the truth she raised a finger the gesture was so slight i barely noticed it but an alert slave standing just outside the doorway hurried to her side bring porsenna said calpurnia the slave departed without a sound a few moments later a graybearded man entered the room he wore the yellow costume of an etruscan haruspex over a bright tunic was a pleated cloak fixed at his shoulder with a large clasp of finely wrought bronze the clasp was in the shape of a sheeps liver marked into numerous sections with notations in the etruscan alphabet etched into each sectiona diviners chart for locating omens amid the entrails on his head the haruspex wore a high conical cap held in place by a strap under his chin haruspicy was the etruscan science of divination from ancient days romes neighbors to the north worshipped a childgod called tages who had snakes for legs long ago tages appeared to an etruscan holy man in a freshly plowed field rising from the dirt and bearing books filled with wisdom from those books the science of haruspicy was born even before rome was founded the etruscans were examining the entrails of sacrificed animals to predict every aspect of the future from the outcome of great battles to the next days weather they were also adept at interpreting dreams and at finding meaning in various phenomena lightning freakish weather strange objects fallen from the sky and the birth of monstrously deformed animals were all attempts by the gods to communicate their will to mankind haruspicy had never become a part of romes official state religion to determine the will of the gods roman priests consulted the sibylline books and roman augurs observed the flight of birds roman priests sacrificed animals to be sure and offered the blood and organs to the gods but they did not presume to predict the future from this pious activity nevertheless despite its unofficial status the ancient etruscan art of divination persisted believers consulted haruspices for guidance in personal and business affairs and in recent years even the senate had taken to calling upon a haruspex to read the entrails of a sacrificed beast before beginning the days debate one of the charms of haruspicy was the fact that its practitioners used the etruscan language in their rituals nobody spoke etruscan anymore not even the etruscans and the language is so different from every other language that the sound of it alone conveys an exotic otherworldly quality even so there were plenty of nonbelievers who scoffed at what they considered outmoded superstitions practiced by charlatans cato leader of the oppositions last stand against caesar in africa once remarked when two of these yellowclad buffoons meet in the street babbling in their incomprehensible tongue its a miracle that either can keep a straight face of course cato had come to a terrible end enduring perhaps the most wretched of all the deaths suffered by caesars opponents all rome would no doubt be reminded of the grisly details during one of the upcoming triumphs according to my son meto who had served with him for many years caesar too took a dim view of haruspicy at pharsalus all the omens went against caesar but he ignored them and went to battle anyway completely destroying the forces of his chief rival pompey caesar made a show of observing the old ways of divination but when the haruspices weighed against him he had only contempt for them from everything i knew of her i would have assumed that calpurnia placed no more faith in haruspicy than did her husbandyet here stood a haruspex in his gaudy yellow garments and peaked hat looking at me with a smug expression on his face this is the one they call the finder he said to calpurnia yes porsenna nodded vigorously causing his pointed hat to poke the air like a comical weapon in a mime show indeed this is the very man i saw in my dreams this is the one who can help you calpurniathe only one she raised an eyebrow before you said the other fellow was the man to help meand we both know how that turned out yes but i was right then as well dont you see because that man despite his misfortune was the one to lead us to this man divination does not always guide us straight to the truth like the furrow of a plow sometimes it meanders like a stream no matter as long as we follow the precepts of tages we surely arrive what other fellow are you talking about i said and what is it you want from me calpurnia when your messenger summoned me i came here at once how could i refuse before i left for egypt you dealt with me honestly and fairly and i owe you my respect for that above and beyond your station as the dictators wife but i must tell you right now that if you intend to offer me some commission that involves poking into dark corners uncovering ugly secrets getting someone killedor getting myself killedi wont accept it im finished with that sort of thing im too old i wont have my tranquillity disturbed i can pay you handsomely so she did intend to employ me for some sort of intrigue i sighed fortunately i dont need your money i would advise you to call on my son ecohe does that sort of thing nowadays and hes younger than i am faster stronger probably twice as clever eco is away from rome at the momenta commission has taken him down to syracusebut as soon as eco returns no its you we must have finder said porsenna tages has decreed it just as the god previously decreed that you turn to that other fellow you spoke ofthe one who met with misfortune i dont like the sound of that calpurnia made a sour face youll at least hear me out gordianus it was a statement not a question uttered in a tone to remind me that i was in the presence of the most powerful woman in rome i took a deep breath what is it you want from me then seek the truth only that and why not its your nature its the thing you were born to do the gods made you thus and when you find the truth i wish you to share it with meand with no one else truth i thought you had porsenna to find that for you she shook her head haruspicy functions at one level a fellow like you functions at another i see instead of sifting through entrails i dig in the dirt thats one way of putting it we each must use whatever skills we possess do whatever is necessary to save my husbands life what is this threat to caesar i was first alerted by my dreamsnightmares so terrible that i sought out porsenna to interpret them for me his divinations confirmed my worst fears caesar is in immediate and very terrible danger i sighed im surprised calpurnia i thought you were not the sort to act on dreams or omens others yes but not you you sound like my husband ive tried to warn him he scoffs at my fears have you introduced him to your haruspex no caesar knows nothing about porsenna nor must he ever know it would only further arouse his skepticism but i assure you caesar has never been in greater danger i shook my head surely caesar has never been in less danger all his enemies are dead pompey beheaded by egyptians who wanted to please caesar ahenobarbus driven to earth and speared like a rabbit by marc antony at pharsalus cato driven to suicide in africa the survivors who were pardoned by caesar like cicero have been reduced to cowering sycophants yet some of them must wish caesar dead some many i should think but wishes are not daggers have these men the will to act caesar thinks not otherwise he wouldnt have pardoned them i trust his judgment the man has been courting danger all his life and getting the better of it once in alexandria i stood beside him on a quay when a flaming missile from an enemy ship came hurtling straight toward us i thought that missile was the end of usbut caesar calmly assessed the trajectory stood his ground and never flinched and sure enough the missile fell short another time in alexandria i watched his ship sink during a battle in the harbor and i thought he would surely drown instead he swam wearing full armor all the way to safety i laughed later his only complaint was that he had lost his new purple capea gift from cleopatra this is not a laughing matter finder was it my mention of cleopatra that rankled her i took a deep breath of course not very well when you say caesar is in danger what exactly do you mean is there a particular person you suspect or some particular group is there a conspiracy against him i dont know i frowned calpurnia why am i here to help me save caesars life she had begun to slump but now sat stiffly upright grasping the arms of the chair with white knuckled hands how porsenna will be our guide i shook my head i wont take instructions from a haruspex your orders will come from me said calpurnia sternly i sighed caesar was not yet a king and the republics citizens were not yet his subjects yet caesars wife seemed incapable of accepting a direct refusal perhaps i could lead her by argument to see that employing me was simply not to her advantage i acknowledge your sense of urgency calpurnia but i dont understand what you want from me what would you have me do where would i begin porsenna cleared his throat you can start by retracing the steps of the man we called upon to do this work before you he delivered written reports to us i take it this fellow came to a bad end yes from the looks on both your faces a very bad end i dont care to follow in the footsteps of a dead man calpurnia i directed my gaze at her pointedly ignoring the haruspex but it was porsenna who replied those footsteps might lead you to the mans killer he said and knowing who killed him might lead us to the source of the threat against caesar the fellow must have discovered something dangerous to have paid for it with his life i shook my head dreams divination death i dont like anything about this affair calpurnia i respectfully decline to become involved porsenna was about to speak but calpurnia silenced him with a gesture perhaps if you saw the dead man she said quietly i dont see how that would make a difference nonetheless she rose from the chair and proceeded toward a doorway porsenna indicated that i should follow i did so reluctantly with porsenna behind me i disliked the haruspex from first sight and didnt like having him at my back we walked down a long hallway passing rooms as simply decorated as the one in which calpurnia had received me the house seemed empty calpurnias slaves were trained to remain out of sight we crossed a small garden ornamented by a splashing fountain with a splendid statue of venuscaesars reputed ancestorstanding naked upon a gigantic seashell a man was sitting in the shade of the garden he wore the voluminous toga of a pontifex with its extra folds gathered and tucked in a loop above his waist his mantle was pushed back to show a head of perfectly white hair the old priest glanced up as we passed and gave me a quizzical look i thought i saw a family resemblance to calpurnia his words confirmed it who have you brought into the house now niece another spy or worse another soothsayer be quiet uncle gnaeus this is my affair and i shall handle it as i see fit not a word to caesar do you understand of course my dear the priest rose to his feet he was a bigger man than i had thought he took calpurnias hand did i speak harshly to you its only because i think youre troubling yourself over nothing you allow this haruspex to excite your fears and insist on drawing others into this foolishness and now we see where it leads i know what you think uncle gnaeus but if you cannot say words of support say nothing this served to silence gnaeus calpurnius who dropped calpurnias hand and returned his gaze to me he seemed to regard me with a combination of pity scorn and exasperation i followed calpurnia out of the garden and back indoors glad to escape the old priests scrutiny we walked down another long hallway the rooms in this part of the house were more cluttered and less elegantly furnished finally we arrived at a small chamber dimly lit by a single window high in the wall it appeared to be a storage room odds and ends were piled against the wallsa rolled carpet boxes full of blank parchment and writing materials chairs one atop another in the center of the room a body had been laid upon a makeshift bier flowers and spices had been strewn around it to mask the inevitable scent of putrefaction but the body could not have been lifeless for more than a day for it was still stiff presumably the corpse had been discovered after rigor began for the petrified body retained the posture of an agonizing death with shoulders hunched and limbs contracted the hands were clutching the chest at a bloodstained spot directly over the heart i avoided looking at the face but even from the corner of my eye i could see that the jaw was tightly clenched and the lips were drawn back in a hideous grimace the body was clothed in a simple tunic the darkened bloodstain was vivid against the pale blue fabric there was nothing particularly distinctive about the garmentit had a black border in a common greek key patternyet it seemed familiar to me where did you find the poor fellow i said in a private alley that runs alongside this house said calpurnia the slaves use it to come and go as do a few otherslike this manwho dont wish to call at the front door a secret entrance for your secret agents sometimes he was discovered at dawn lying on the paving stones just outside the door the body was already stiff yes just as you see him now then he had probably been deadand lying undisturbedfor at least four hours thats when rigor begins thats certainly possible to my knowledge no one used that passageway during the night so he could have been lying there since sundown i presume he came here to tell me something but before he could rap at the door someone stabbed him are there more wounds only this one so he died of a single stab wound to the heart his assailant must have been very lucky or very quick or else must have known the victim how else could someone draw close enough to land such a perfect blow was there a trail of blood in the passageway no he fell where he was stabbed calpurnia shuddered his tunic looks familiar i said feeling uneasy does it perhaps you should look at his face i stepped closer the scent of flowers and spices filled my nostrils my heart pounded in my chest my mouth was dry hieronymus i whispered ii although his features were contorted almost beyond recognition there could be no doubt it was my friend hieronymus the scapegoat of massilia who lay dead upon the bier his teeth were bared in a grimace and his eyes were wide open this was your agent hieronymus calpurnia nodded i shook my head in disbelief it had been three years since id met him in massilia when the city was besieged by caesar following an ancient custom the massilians chose a citizen upon whom they would lavish every imaginable luxury until the day they cast him from the sacrifice rock as an offering to the gods to avert catastrophe hieronymus had been selected for the role not as an honor but as a way to get rid of him once and for all his father had been a powerful man who lost his fortune then committed suicide hieronymus began life at the very top of massilian society then found himself at the bottom his very existence was an embarrassment to the citys ruling class who valued nothing but success and despised nothing more than failure his caustic wit had not won him any friends either hieronymus saved my life in massilia when i returned to rome he came with me and took up residence in my household after i left for egypt he struck out on his own so my daughter diana told me saying she had run into him occasionally in the city but since my return i had not heard from him this did not surprise me as hieronymus was something of a misanthrope nor had i sought him i had become such a hermit that it took a summons from caesars wife to get me out of my house i assumed our paths would cross sooner or later if he was still in the city and still alive amid the chaos and confusion of the long bloody civil war hieronymus was just another friend of whom i had lost track now i had found him again lying lifeless on a bier in the house of caesars wifewho was telling me that hieronymus had been her spy the notion was absurd or was it in a flash i saw how such a thing must have happened having resided with me observing how i made a living and hearing my stories of past investigations how like hieronymus to conclude that any fool could do the same what skills were required except perseverance and cheek what resources were needed beyond a circle of knowledgeable informants many of whom hieronymus had already met through me he knew i had dealt with calpurnia shortly before my departure and that i had come away from those dealings with a great deal of money after i left for egypt he must have approached her and offered his services but why did you hire him i asked what sort of information could hieronymus possibly have obtained for you he was an outsider a foreigner he spoke with a greek accent he could never pass as a citizen he had no need to be anything other than himself said calpurnia his notoriety opened doors notoriety the man shunned society perhaps but society did not shun him everyone in rome had heard of the scapegoat and as hieronymus quickly discovered once he began making the rounds there was hardly a household in rome that wouldnt admit him if he paid a call he was a curiosity dont you see exotic mysteriousthe famous scapegoat of massilia the sacrificial victim who was never sacrificed in times such as these a man who can cheat death is a man people want to meet the superstitious hoped that some of his good fortune might rub off the curious merely wanted to take a good look at him and once he was admitted to a household hieronymus could be quite charming charming he had a tongue like a viper amusing then never at a loss for an epigram very erudite this was true as a child before his father fell into ruin hieronymus had received an excellent education from his tutors he could recite long passages from the iliad and knew the greek tragedies by heart when he chose to show off his learning it was usually to comic effectan ironic rejoinder a whimsical metaphor an absurdly highflown bit of poetry that deflated the selfimportance of his listener i suppose hieronymus was something of a character i admitted and a good companion when you got to know him i can see how he might have been accepted in the households of your friends and your enemies i looked down at his face it seemed his grimace had softened a bit was the rigor beginning to pass i looked at his long gangly limbs at the pale thin hair on his head at the narrow strip of wispy beard that outlined his sharp chin what a bitter irony to survive a terrible fate in his native city only to meet death in a such a manneralone in a dark alley far from home hieronymus hieronymus i whispered who did this to you we dont know who killed him said calpurnia quietly or why it might have been any of the subjects on whom hes been delivering reports perhaps gordianus if you were to read those reports and pursue the threads that hieronymus was following you might discover who killed him i grunted and in the meantime id be doing just as you wishfollowing in hieronymuss footsteps and looking for threats to caesar how brazenly she played upon my sympathies to get what she wanted from me why cant you deduce for yourself what hieronymus discovered you say he delivered reports i presume youve read them you must know what he was up to calpurnia shook her head like all informants hieronymus was never entirely forthcoming its human nature to hold something backfor the next meeting the next payment hieronymus was more frustrating in that regard than most of my agents i knew he wasnt telling me everything but given his unique potential i decided to be patient with him perhaps if i had been less indulgent and more demanding he might still be alive or we might at least know who killed him said porsenna i glared at the haruspex until he lowered his eyes dont blame porsenna said calpurnia no one recruited hieronymus he sought me out to offer his services and your soothsayerthe man who claims to see the futureadvised you to take him on and now this the end of hieronymus tears filled my eyes i refused to shed them while they watched i averted my face leave me alone with him i whispered after a pause i heard the rustling of their clothing as they left the room i touched the corpses brow the rigor had begun to release its grip i straightened the fingers of the bloodstained hands that clutched his chest i straightened his legs i smoothed the grimace from his face and closed his eyes hieronymus i whispered when i arrived in massiliafriendless miserable in terrible dangeryou took me in you protected me you shared your wisdom you made me laugh i thought i saw you die there in massilia but you returned from the dead you came with me to rome and i was able to repay your hospitality i shook my head its hard to see a friend die once now ive had to bear your death twice for now you truly are dead my friend i ran my fingers over his what long elegant hands he had i stood silently for a while then left the room calpurnia and porsenna were waiting for me in the next room i cleared my throat these written reports porsenna had already fetched them he held up a leather tube for carrying scrolls and parchments begrudgingly i took the collection of documents from porsenna ill begin reading these tonight if i have questions ill expect you to answer them if there seems to be a chance that i might discover how hieronymus died and who killed him calpurnia could not suppress a smile of victory but ill take no payment from you calpurnia and ill take no directions from your haruspex whatever i discover i may share with youor i may not i work for myself not for you i do this for hieronymus not for caesar her smile faded her eyes narrowed she considered for a moment then nodded her assent on my way out i passed her uncle who still sat in the garden gnaeus calpurnius clutched his priestly robes and glared at me there was not a cloud in the sky and the sun was at its zenith as i left the house of calpurnia and crossed the palatine hill i moved through a bright glaring world without shadows the thick hot air seemed to eddy sluggishly around me the windowless walls of the houses of the rich colored in shades of saffron and rust looked hot enough to scorch my fingertips the month was september but the weather was hardly autumnal when i was a boy september was a month for playing amid fallen leaves and donning cloaks to ward off the chill no more september had become the middle of the summer those who knew about such things said the roman calendar was flawed and had gradually fallen out of step with the seasons the problem was worse now than ever before the calendar was a full two months behind the place where it should be autumn festivals spring festivals and summer feast days were still celebrated according to the calendar but made no sense there was something absurd about making sacrifices to the gods of the harvest when the harvest was another sixty days in the future or celebrating the parole of proserpine from hades when there was still frost on the ground was it only oldtimers like me who felt acutely the absurdity of our disjointed calendar perhaps the young simply took it for granted that september had become a month of long sweltering days and short nights too hot for sleeping but to me the broken calendar represented a broken world the civil war which had spread to every corner of the mediterranean from egypt to spain was over at last but amid the wreckage lay the centuriesold republic of rome we had a calendar that could no longer reckon the days and a senate that could no longer govern but we also had julius caesar and caesar would put everything right so his supporters claimed so caesar promised he would rebuild the roman state making it stronger than ever he had even pledged to fix the calendar according to rumor the details would be announced at the conclusion of his upcoming triumphs after which the requisite number of daystwo months worthwould be added to the current year and the forthcoming year with newly proportioned months would commence in harmony with the seasons and the passage of the sun but could caesar repair the broken people of rome even the gods cannot restore a severed hand or a pluckedout eye to a body maimed by warfare others whose bodies might show no signs of damage from violence or deprivation had nonetheless been changed by the fear and uncertainty that hung over their lives for so many years while caesar and pompey struggled for dominion something about those men and women was not as it had been before not quite right no doctor could diagnose their nameless disease yet it burned inside them nonetheless changing them from the inside out like the calendar they still functioned but no longer in harmony with the cosmos even calpurnia might be numbered among these invisible victims the confederate of caesar and mistress of his spy ring in the capitalrigorously logical ruthlessly pragmaticnow confessed to being driven by dreams she allowed a haruspex to conduct her affairs and was doing so behind her husbands back i came to the ramp the long straight treelined path that led down to a gateway between the house of the vestals and the temple of castor and pollux i descended from the quiet calm of the palatine to the hubbub of the forum senators and magistrates attired in togas swept by me followed by their retinues of scribes and sycophants looking like little caesars with their noses in the air their posture and gait projecting an attitude that the world would come to an end if anyone dared to prevent them from reaching whatever meeting they were headed for their selfimportance seemed all the more absurd considering that caesars victory had rendered them irrelevant the senate had reconvened but everyone knew that all power flowed from caesar his approval was needed for all important decisions he held the key to the treasury he had bypassed elections to personally appoint the magistrates he had parceled out the provincial governorships to his friends and supporters and was busily filling the scores of vacancies in the senate with creatures of his choosing some of these new senators to the shock of oldtimers like myself were not even romans but gauls men who had betrayed their own people to join caesar and who were now receiving their rewards yet the business of the forum carried on as if the civil war had never occurred or at least it appeared to be so for the forum was suffering from the same invisible malady that plagued the populace of rome on the surface everything seemed to be back to normal priests made sacrifices on temple steps vestals tended the eternal hearth fire and ordinary citizens sought redress from the magistrates but below the surface everything was askew people were simply going through the motions knowing that nothing was quite right and might never be so again i listened to snatches of conversation from men passing by everyone was talking about caesar may yet step down thats the rumor i heard return to private life as sulla did never his supporters wouldnt allow it nor would his enemies theyd kill him he has no enemies left or none worth considering not true pompeys son is said to be in spain right now rallying a force to take on caesar my son meto was in spain serving in caesars forces so my ears pricked up at this if thats true came the response caesar will squash young pompey like an insect just wait and see and caesar may even name a new month after himselfthe month of julius theres to be a complete revision of the calendar done with the help of astronomers from alexandria well its about timeno pun intended and the whole thing will go on for four straight days i heard not four days in a row you silly man four triumphs yes but each with a day between well need those days of rest to recover from so much drinking and feasting imagine it four fullscale processions plus public banquets for everyone in rome followed by plays and chariot races and gladiator gamesi dont see how caesar can afford to put on such a spectacle he cant afford not to after all weve put up with the people of rome deserve a celebration besides he has all the money in the worldliterally his conquests have made him the richest man in history why shouldnt he lavish some of the booty on us im not sure its right celebrating with triumphs to mark the end of a civil war so much roman blood was spilled its not just about the civil war have you forgotten his victory over vercingetorix and the gauls the triumph for that is long overdue and another triumph will be for putting down the revolt of pharnaces in asia and thats certainly well deserved granted as may be the triumph for defeating king ptolemy in egypt although that wasnt exactly a roman conquest was it more like settling a family feud the kings sister cleopatra kept her throne because she conquered caesar they say the queen is in rome right now here to watch her rebel sister arsinoe paraded in chains and put to death to cap the egyptian triumph yes yes triumphs for caesars victories in gaul and asia and egyptno one can complain about those but what about this triumph thats planned for his victory in africa it was fellow romans he fought there poor cato who could raise a cheer about the way he died oh you might be surprised the roman mob loves to see a big man brought down especially by a bigger man and if cato was the best general the opposition could put up after pompey was killed then they deserved to lose you you there whats that youre saying my brother fought for cato you piece of scum and died at thapsus he was a better roman than the likes of you you slandering pig from the corner of my eye i saw the beginnings of a scuffle and hurried on passing beyond the public buildings of the forum i entered a maze of streets crowded with shops offering every sort of merchandise and service closest to the forum were the more respectable eateries tailor shops fullers craftsmen and jewel merchants further on the atmosphere grew progressively seedier and the clientele less affluent i saw fewer togas and more tunics this was the subura district notorious for its rough taverns and brothels nowadays it was thronged by caesars veterans many of them maimed or bearing hideous scars under the midday sun they gathered outside taverns drinking wine and gambled in the streets casting dice made from bones i saw a group of street performers putting on a show for a little crowd that had gathered unlike their colleagues in the theater such troupes sometimes include female performers the ones in this company were notable for their ample breasts barely contained in tight sheer gowns the sketch was more pantomime than play featuring a balding letch dressed as a roman commander his armor was made of tin and the most buxom of the actresses who wore a cheap imitation of the tall egyptian headdress called an atef crown and very little else the performers were obviously meant to be caesar and cleopatra and their buffoonish interaction grew progressively more suggestive after a few obscene puns including a comparison of caesars intimate anatomy to that of a nile riverhorse the creature herodotus called a hippos potamios cleopatra extended her arms planted her feet well apart and broke into a ribald dance every part of her body jiggled wildly while her towering headdress remained rigidly upright and perfectly motionless i suddenly realized it looked more like a phallus than an atef crown i found the dance both arousing and hilarious all the more so because i had dealt with the real queen in alexandria who was nothing like her imitator a more selfpossessed young woman than cleopatra i had never met believing herself to be the living incarnation of the goddess isis she tended to take herself quite seriously and the idea that she would ever perform such a lurid dance was as delightful as it was ludicrous an alms collector for the troupe saw me laughing and quickly hurried over extending a cup i contributed a small coin i moved on looking for the street where calpurnia had told me i would find hieronymuss apartment years ago when i lived in a ramshackle house on the esquiline hill above the subura i had walked through this neighborhood almost every day i had known its meandering alleys like the veins on the back of my hand nowadays i visited the subura less often and much had changed over the years the tall crowded tenements some of them soaring to six stories were so cheaply constructed that they frequently collapsed and almost as frequently burned down new buildings were quickly thrown up to take their place entire streets had become unrecognizable to me and for a while i became lost then in the blink of an eye i found myself in front of the very building i was searching for it was unmistakable brandnew and six stories tall calpurnia had told me with a fresh yellow wash on the walls a pubic fountain at the corner and an eatery on the ground floor she owned the building a part of her arrangement with hieronymus had been to supply him with free lodging calpurnia had told me i would find a slave posted in the tiny vestibule he was there partly for the security of the tenants but also to make sure they didnt start cooking fires in their rooms or carry on any business that was too dangerous or too illegal i encountered an unshaven young man so scruffily dressed that he might have been a beggar who had wandered in off the street but the suspicious look he gave me was definitely that of a watchman you must be agapios i said my name is gordianus your mistress sent me for proof i showed him a bit of sealing wax into which calpurnia had pressed her signet ring for a symbol she used the profile of king numa with his flowing beard and priests mantle the calpurnii could trace their descent from calpus he was one of the four sons of pious king numa who lived more than hundred years ago and was the founder of many religious rites and priesthoods he bowed obsequiously what can i do for you citizen you can show me to the room where hieronymus of massilia lived the young slave caught my use of the past tense and shot me a curious look but he said nothing he turned and motioned for me to follow him up the stairs usually the choicest apartments in such tenements are located in the middle floors high enough to escape the noise and odors of the street but not so high that climbing the stairs becomes an onerous challenge or jumping from a window in case of fire means certain death i had expected to find hieronymuss apartment on the second floor up or perhaps the third but the sprightly watchman bounded up one flight of stairs after another i found myself huffing and puffing and called to him to slow down but he had disappeared from sight i followed at my own pace and eventually caught up with him on a landing he was miming boredom by examining his cuticles hieronymus lived all the way up here i said i should have thought not on this floor one more flight up what you have to take this final flight of steps over here why had hieronymus left my home for such a place this tenement was not as squalid as some but was it really an improvement on the comfortable quarters i had provided for him the last flight of stairs delivered us not as before to a landing with dark hallways leading to numerous apartments but to a single door with an open skylight above under the bright sunshine the watchman produced an iron key and opened the door the room was sparsely furnished but the rugs and chairs were of good quality the space was brightly lit by unshuttered windows on either side a doorway appeared to lead to another room another doorway opened onto a terrace that entirely encircled the apartment i stepped outside a rooftop apartment i said the only one the tenant had it all to himself hieronymus had done well for himself after all the space and seclusion would have suited him and the vista would have reminded him of his pampered days in massilia this was one of the tallest buildings in the subura and the view was virtually unimpeded in all directions beyond the forum there was an excellent view of the capitoline hill with its crown of magnificent temples and monumental statues i leaned forward peered over the parapet and felt a bit dizzy gazing down at the tiny figures in the street below how well did you know him i said the tenant not at all he kept to himself we stepped back into the apartment did he have visitors never you speak of him in the past tense is the tenant you can go now agapios leave the key with me so that i can lock the door as i leave in fact ill keep the key but tenants always leave their key with me when they go out i dont have another good but the mistress i have authority from calpurnia i showed you the seal so you did said the slave cocking an eyebrow all very mysterious he paused in the doorway and turned back you know for a graybeard who can barely manage the stairs youre not bad looking he skipped lithely down the steps and vanished i stood confounded for a moment it had been quite some time since a young slave of either gender had flirted with me i blinked and caught my reflection in the polished square of copper hung on the wall beside the doorway hieronymus must have used it for checking his appearance before leaving his rooms the full lips set into a frown the knitted brow the flattened nose a boxers nose bethesda called it all projected a stern countenance the silverstreaked hair and beard were kept short and neatly trimmed that was my daughter dianas doing there was perhaps a certain gentleness about the eyes a suggestion of the callow youth i once had been a lifetime ago i watched a trickle of sweat run down my forehead onto my nose all the heat of the building rose to these rooms which were baked by the sun as well i grunted and wiped the sweat away then shrugged at the figure in the mirror and set about exploring hieronymuss lair i walked from room to room and searched the usual places i lifted the rugs i checked the chairs for false bottoms and rapped on the legs to see if they might be hollow i rummaged though the trunk that contained his clothing there were a few cups and jars and other containers they held only wine or olive oil for the lamps i examined the narrow bed the straw mattress the coverlets and the cushions he kept his valuables in a little box under the bed i found some coins and a few trinkets but not much else of value hieronymus had kept a small collection of books the rolledup scrolls were neatly inserted into a tall pigeonhole case against one wall most of the scrolls were identified by little tags with titles and volume numbers written on them eirenaioss history of massilia fabius pictors history of rome the epigrams of appius claudius the blind and so on perusing the bookcase from top to bottom i came upon a whole row of scrolls that had come from my own library including a rare copy of manius calpurniuss life of king numa cicero had given it to me many years ago i couldnt remember ever lending it to hieronymus when he vacated my house he must have borrowed itif borrow was the correct word feeling a bit peeved i pulled the scroll from its pigeonhole and unrolled it wanting to check its condition the scroll was intact but several loose pieces of parchment had been rolled up inside it i removed these extraneous pages and saw that they were covered with writing in hieronymuss hand i had only to scan a few lines to realize that i had found what appeared to be a private journal kept hidden inside the scroll of numa i felt a sudden chill i sensed a presence in the room and slowly turned around almost certain i would see the lemur of hieronymus standing behind me i saw no one i was alone still i felt an uncanny sensation of being watched and in my head i seemed to hear hieronymuss voice how predictable you are gordianus you saw your precious copy of numa and felt compelled to check at once that i hadnt damaged ityou did exactly as i intended you found my private notes intended for my eyes only while i lived but now that im dead i wanted you to find my journal gordianus tucked inside your precious numa i shuddered and put the pieces of parchment aside i looked through all the other scrolls but found no more hidden documents there was one scroll however that piqued my curiosity it was quite different from anything else in the bookcase it was not a work of history or poetry or drama it was not even a book properly speaking but a collection of oddsized pieces of parchment stitched together the various documents did have a common theme astronomy if i could judge the enigmatic notations and drawings rightly the movements of the sun moon and stars and the symbols used to represent them were not things i knew much about hieronymuss taste in reading had not run to the scientific yet these notations appeared to have been made by his own hand i gathered up the scrolls which had belonged to me i decided to leave the other scrolls for the time being except the astronomical miscellany which i wanted to study further i added that scroll to the others i was taking along with hieronymuss private journal i stepped outside the apartment and locked the door behind me iii you went to that womans house alone bethesda greeted me in the vestibule with her hands on her hips you should have taken rupa with you for protection or at least the two troublemakers if only to get them out of my hair she referred to our two young slaves the brothers mopsus and androcles who were not quite boys anymore but not yet men either protection i hardly needed any people say the city is quite safe now with caesar back in residence and his officers in charge and with half the citizenry dead or in exile caesar himself is said to go strolling about the city with no bodyguard at all because venus protects him but what goddess looks after you bethesda scowled at me youre an old man now old men make tempting targets for cutthroats and thieves not as old as that why just today a young slave engaged in a rather obvious and completely unsolicited flirtation with me said that i she probably wanted something from you as a matter of fact promise me you wont stir from the house again without taking someone with you wife did we not survive the civil war and the darkest days of the chaos here in rome did we not survive a terrible storm at sea and a rocky landing in egypt and a separation of many months and my own intention to drown myself in the nile when i mistakenly thought that you must have met such a fate how can you suggest that no gods watch over me ive always assumed that my life must be providing them with considerable amusement how else can you explain the fact that im still alive she was not impressed the gods may have been amused when you were gordianus the finder always sticking your nose where it didnt belong exposing socalled great men and women as conniving thieves and killers daring the fates to strike you down but what have you done to amuse them lately you sit at home play with your grandchildren and watch the garden grow the gods have grown bored with you bethesda are you saying that you are bored with me of course not quite the opposite i hated it when you were always putting yourself in danger it seems to me that now is the best time of our lives when youve finally settled down and no longer have to work you belong in the garden playing with aulus and looking after little beth why do you think i became so upset when i found that youd left the house to go visit that woman and taken no one with you for protection tears welled in her eyes since our return to rome it seemed to me that a change had come over her what had become of the strangely aloof young slave girl i had taken as my concubine then married where was the selfcontained autocratic matron of my household who kept a cool exterior and never showed weakness i took bethesda in my arms she submitted to the embrace for a moment then pulled away she was as unused to being comforted as i was to comforting her very well i said quietly in the future i shall be more careful when i leave the house even though the house of that woman as you insist on calling her is only a few steps away i decided not to tell her about my excursion to the seedy dangerous subura youll be going back there then to calpurnias house yes shes asked for my help something dangerous enough to pique the gods interest in you no doubt said bethesda tartly having recovered from her tears something to do with all those scrolls youve brought home with you she eyed the bag slung over my shoulder with the suspicion of those who have never learned to read yes actually theres something i need to tell you something i need to tell everyone can you gather the family in the garden they reacted more strongly to the news of hieronymuss death than i had anticipated bethesda weptperhaps that was to be expected given her new propensity for tearsbut so did my daughter diana at the age of twentyfour she was quite the most beautiful young woman i had ever known even allowing for a fathers prejudice and it pained me to see her loveliness marred by an outburst of weeping davus her hulking mass of a husband held her in his brawny arms and wiped the mist from his own eyes the last time i had seen him weep was when bethesda and i arrived home unexpectedly from egypt and found that everyone feared that we were dead poor davus thinking we might be lemures first was scared half out of his witsof which he had few enough to sparethen cried like a child their fiveyearold son aulus was perhaps still too young to understand the cause of their grief on this occasion but seeing his mother in tears he joined in with a piercing wail that set off an even more piercing cry from his little sister beth who had recently learned to walk and tottered to his side my son rupa was the newest addition to the family by adoption as anyone could tell by seeing the two of us side by side he had the blue eyes golden hair and muscular frame of a handsome sarmatian bloodline rupa had hardly known hieronymus nonetheless caught up in the familys grief he opened his lips and despite his muteness let out a sound of despair as poignant as any line ever uttered by roscius on the stage even the young slaves mopsus and androcles who could usually be expected to exchange taunts at any sign of weakness bowed their heads and joined hands the brothers had been very fond of the scapegoat but papa said diana fighting back her tears what was he doing in calpurnias employ something to do with massilia hieronymus hardly had the personality to be a diplomat besides he swore he would never go back there i had decided to tell them as little as possible about the specific nature of hieronymuss activities for calpurnia to be sure i was not certain myself exactly what hieronymus had been up to i had not yet read the reports calpurnia had given me beyond that i saw no need for any of them to know such details especially diana who more than once had expressed a desire bordering on an intention to someday do exactly what hieronymus had doneto follow in my footsteps as a professional ferret for the rich and powerful of rome even with her keen mind and a protector like davus such a dangerous activity was hardly suitable for a young roman matron perhaps he was working for her as a tutor hieronymus was smarter than just about anybody this came from androcles who had been very impressed by all the stories hieronymus could recite it couldnt be that said bethesda sighing through her tears calpurnia has no need for tutors shes never given caesar a child the woman is famously barren but caesar has a son even so doesnt he offered mopsus doggedly following his younger brothers chain of thought he had a son by queen cleopatra a little boy about the same age as beth and they say cleopatra is in rome right now to witness caesars egyptian triumph and she brought her little boy caesarion with her his face was lit by the glow of deductive success ill wager calpurnia wanted hieronymus to be caesarions tutor even davus as thick as he is knew better than this he laughed i hardly think that caesars roman wife would want to engage a tutor for the son of caesars egyptian mistress he was right of course but what was calpurnias attitude toward cleopatra and more especially toward the child cleopatra claimed to be the son of caesar i had seen calpurnia grimace when she spoke the queens name but she had said not a word harsh or otherwise about cleopatra mopsus and androcles were clearly far from the mark with their speculations about hieronymus but could the scapegoats death have had something to do with cleopatra nonetheless i felt a stab of eagerness to begin reading the reports calpurnia had given me as well as hieronymuss private journal but first there were practical considerations to be dealt with i had told calpurnia that i would assume responsibility for hieronymuss funeral rites i dispatched rupa and the slave boys with a cart to fetch his body diana with davus to accompany her i sent to pay a call on an undertaker near the temple of venus libitina i had used the mans services before he would supply slaves to wash the body and anoint it with oil and perfumes and deliver a wreath of cypress for the door and a funeral bier with garlands for my vestibule he would also enter the name of hieronymus in the official registry of the dead and make arrangements for his cremation bethesda busied herself with preparing the evening meal we would eat that night in honor of the memory of our departed friend hieronymus of massilia left to myself i withdrew to the garden and sat on a chair in the afternoon shade with the scrolls beside me and with a muchdesired cup of wine close at hand i began to read i began with the documents calpurnia had given me the reports from hieronymusthere were a great many of themhad been neatly arranged into sections under the names of various persons most of these people were familiar to me and i could see why calpurnia thought it worthwhile to keep an eye on them i turned to the reports regarding marc antony antony had been one of caesars most trusted officers during the conquest of gaul later he fought beside caesar at pharsalus in greece where pompey was routed when caesar pursued pompey to egypt he sent antony back to rome to keep order because antonys return occurred shortly after i left for egypt myself i had not been present during his tenure as master of the city governing the city for month after month while caesar defeated his enemies and quelled unrest abroad had been no easy task the wartime capital was plagued by shortages and riven by factional violence antony had forbidden citizens to carry arms but this ban was universally ignored gangs had ruled the streets by day common criminals had ruled the city by night added to the general violence had been the growing unruliness of the lower classes many of whom expected caesar to abolish all debts and in their wildest dreams to redistribute the vast properties of the defeated pompeians to the poor stirred up by one of caesars youngest officers the radical firebrand dolabella a mob had gathered in the forum to call for debt relief antony explained that he had no authority to grant their demands they would have to wait for caesars return the mob rioted antony determined to keep order dispatched soldiers to clear the forum by the end of the day more than eight hundred citizens were dead the city was calmer after that when caesar finally returned and learned of the massacre one of his first actions was to publicly berate antony for the heavyhandedness of his ruleand to heap praise on dolabella the instigator of the mob caesars actions may have been purely pragmatic a bid to regain the favor of the lower orders still his rebuke of his longtime protege must have stung shortly after caesars return antony vanished from the public arena so much from hearsay i knew about the situation between caesar and antony what else had hieronymus discovered i scanned the notes written in hieronymuss elegant hand he went back and forth between latin and greek his latin was a bit stiff but his greek was almost absurdly elevated full of homeric flourishes recondite references and complicated puns all this made for slow and difficult reading glancing at the massive volume of material i groaned at the idea of trying to read it all i was surprised that calpurnia had tolerated such prose translating in my head i tried to strip away hieronymuss stylistic indulgences looking simply for the facts antony currently resides in pompeys old house called the house of the beaks in the carinae district how could that be i remembered the day shortly after my return to rome when caesar announced that pompeys entire estate would be sold at public auction to benefit the treasury he had charged antony with conducting the auction a formidable task pompeys house was stuffed with so many precious items looted from his many campaigns of conquest that simply making an inventory would pose a logistical challenge but so far as i knew there had been no auction yet antony himself was living in the house of pompey according to hieronymus had caesar given antony the house outright and with it pompeys treasures that seemed unlikely rewarding a favorite with so much plunder would be a slap at the mob many of whom were in desperate straits and still ready to agitate for a radical redistribution of wealth it would also smack of the arrogant favoritism that sulla had practiced when he was dictator and caesar would never wish to be compared to sulla i read on antony divorced his second wife and first cousin the lovely antonia some time ago he is living quite openly with his lover the even more beautiful cytheris there can be no question of marriage of course an aristocrat like antony no matter how dissolute could never marry a mere actress especially a foreigner from alexandria news of antonys divorce came as no surprise i had met antonia before i left for egypt she was a bitter woman her marriage had not been happy thanks largely to antonys open affair with cytheris whom i had met also even more beautiful than antonia hieronymus had written but when i tried to picture cytheris the impression in my mind was not so much of her face as of her sheer sexual allurea tangled mass of auburn hair flashing hazel eyes a loose gown that could barely contain her voluptuous breasts and most especially the way she had of moving executing even the smallest gesture with a dancers sinuous grace everything that one hears about the parties antony and cytheris have been throwing in pompeys house is true these events are obscenely lavish if there are food shortages in rome one would never guess from looking at antonys table pompeys famous stock of expensive wines almost gone antony and cytheris have done their share to empty the amphorae but theyve had plenty of help from every thirsty actor dancer street mime and juggler in rome cytheris knows everyone connected to the theater she has told me i have a splendid voice for declaiming greek and says i should have gone on the stage i laughed out loud at this sudden intrusion of hieronymuss vanity into his report it seemed that my friend had not only managed to get himself invited into antonys house but also had won plaudits from cytheris i could easily imagine him reciting a racy bit of aristophanes at one of the couples raucous gatherings after warming his throat with a draft from the dwindling store of pompeys fine vintages i quickly scanned the rest of the material about antony the details seemed to be as much about the spy as about the spied uponhieronymus reported that one of his puns had made antony laugh so hard he spat out a mouthful of wine and recounted at length a verbal duel in which he got the better of a faded actor with rouged cheeks i grew weary of the ornate prose and found the documents increasingly difficult to read it seemed to me hieronymus was intentionally filling space to pad reports that had contained very little actual information he would not be the first confidential informant to pull such a trick as long as calpurnia kept paying and antony kept inviting him back why not stretch out the accounts as much as possible even if he had nothing of importance to report i wondered if his private journal had been as prolix i set aside the material about antony and picked up the scraps of parchment i had found in hieronymuss apartment i saw at once that the prose was indeed differentit was entirely in greek with some passages succinct to the point of abbreviation like the shorthand code invented by ciceros secretary tiro i saw my own name and stopped to read the passage beginning to think dear old gordianus was a bit of a puffedup charlatan this finder business not remotely as difficult or as dangerous as he always made it out to be the tales he used to tell portraying himself as the fearless hero on a relentless quest for the truth half of those stories were probably made up still if hes truly dead as people say i shall miss the old windbag my face turned hot if the lemur of hieronymus was present watching me what would he say now about the danger of this sort of work i shuffled through the notes looking for other mentions of my name but instead i found this at last i have hit upon it calpurnias fears which i had begun to think absurd may be wellfounded after alland the menace to caesar will come at a time and from a direction we did not anticipate but i could be wrong consequences of a false accusationunthinkable must be certain until then not a word in any of my official reports to the lady and her soothsayer i dare not write my supposition even here what if this journal were to be discovered must keep it hidden but what if i am silenced to any seeker who finds these words and would unlock the truth i shall leave a key look all around the truth is not found in the words but the words may be found in the truth an icy chill swept through me apparently hieronymus had discovered something of deadly importance after all but what it appeared he had even foreseen his death and anticipated the discovery of his journal but what was the key he spoke ofa real key or a metaphorical one look all around he wrote yet i had searched every corner of his rooms and found no key nor anything else of obvious significance the truth is not found in the words but the words may be found in the truth more of his irritating selfindulgent wordplay mopsus appeared in the garden to announce that dinner was ready i put aside the scraps of parchment and rose from my chair glad to feel the warmth of the last rays of the sun on my face iv i stayed up late that night reading for as long as the lamps had oil to burn my eyes are not what they were and neither my brain nor my body can boast the stamina they once possessed deciphering hieronymuss ornate handwriting and his cluttered prose especially by dim lamplight wearied me to exhaustion the great majority of documents remained unread when i finally succumbed to a few hours of restless sleep before breakfast i stepped into the vestibule to view the body of hieronymus all had been properly done according to roman custom washed perfumed and dressed in a spotless tunic surrounded by fragrant garlands he lay upon a bier with his feet toward the door his upper body slightly elevated so that any visitors could see him at once from the entrance where a wreath of cypress had been hung on the door to signal the households grief no doubt the massilians had their own way of doing these things but hieronymus had rejected his native city and it seemed to me that roman rites would be proper i gazed for a long moment his face which was peaceful in repose in death his features gave no indication of the tart words that could issue from that mouth of his within which now lay the coin to pay his passage to the underworld puffedup he had called me and charlatan and worst of all windbag indeed yet gazing at him i could feel no resentment tears welled in my eyes and i turned away after a breakfast of farina prepared in the egyptian manner with bits of dates and a sprinkling of poppy seedssince our return from the nile bethesda had prepared nothing but egyptian dishes revisiting all the favorites of her childhoodi set out with rupa at my side if i were to discover the reason for hieronymuss murder i had to begin somewhere the house of pompey where antony now resided seemed as good a place as any the socalled great one had owned several houses in rome i was most familiar with his magnificent villa with gardens on the pincian hill outside the city walls the house claimed by antony was within the walls in the very heart of the city people called it the house of the beaks because the vestibule was decorated with metal ramming beaks from ships captured by pompey during his illustrious campaign to rid the sea of piracy some twenty years ago only the choicest of these trophies were displayed it was said that pompey captured some ships the house of the beaks was located in the carinae district on the southwestern slope of the esquiline hill above the valley of the subura the most prominent monument on the slope of the carinae was the temple of tellus the earth goddess we passed it on the way to pompeys house and rupa indicated by a nod and gesture that he wished to step inside for a moment i could guess his reason tellus is celebrated during sowing and harvest for accepting seed and giving forth grain but she is also worshipped for receiving the dead for all things return eventually to the soil rupa still mourned his older sister cassandra whose death had brought him into my family no doubt he wished to put a coin in the temple coffers and say a prayer for the departed spirit of cassandra i waited outside on the temple steps remembering cassandra in my own way just as rupa emerged i saw a litter coming up the hill heading in the direction of the house of the beaks through a break in the yellow curtains i caught a glimpse of the occupant it was cytheris lounging on a pile of rustcolored cushions that complemented her auburn hair and exquisite complexion cytheris had known cassandra and rupa back in her days as a dancer in alexandria if i moved quickly i might make it appear that we had run into her by chance a meeting that seemed fortuitous rather than premeditated was often to be preferred in my workas i had more than once told hieronymus had he absorbed that lesson or had he considered it hot air from a windbag i grabbed rupa by the arm insofar as my hand could lay claim to such a massive limb and hurried down the steps to intercept the litter which was making slow progress through the crowded street things could not have gone more to my liking while i pretended to look the other way cytheris spotted the two of us and called out gordianus hello there can it truly be you back from the dead but it must be because that big blond demigod beside you can only be cassandras little brother rupa she pushed aside the curtains and not waiting for a slave to assist her bounded from the litter the flimsy gown she was wearing seemed more suitable for staying in than going out and the hug she gave rupa pressing her small body full against him caused him to blush to the roots of his golden hair but when cytheris threw back her head in a laugh of sheer delight rupa did likewise though the sound that emerged from his throat was something between a bray and a bleat but this is too delicious she said turning her attention to me one heard that you were dead oh dear is it awful of me to say that aloud im sure i must be flouting some superstitious rule of silence but really its such a surprise you were off in alexandria werent you along with rupa but now youre back what are you up to here in the carinae well we were just stopping here at the temple of tellus so that rupa could say a prayer for his sister this was the truth after all ah yes cassandra cytheris and cassandra had been close in their younger days when they were both street performers in alexandria but you must come with me both of you you must tell me all about alexandria its been ages since i was there but some days i still wake up with the salty smell of the harbor in my nostrils come with me to the house of the beaks and well share some wine in the garden are you watching lemur of hieronymus i thought take notes i had intended to make your death the reason for my visit as the bearer of sad news but this is much better to all appearances we have met by chance and my visit to the house of antony is cytheriss idea not my own i shall mention your death only in passing slaves scurried to assist cytheris back into her litter but she shooed them away and beckoned to rupa with a single sweep of his arms he lifted her up and deposited her among the cushions while cytheris rode we walked beside her the litter bearers restrained their pace in deference to my slow uphill progress like many houses of the rich in rome pompeys old residence presented an unostentatious face to the street the portico was small and there was little in the way of ornament but once we passed through the front doorway i saw how the house had come by its name the vestibule was enormousone could have fitted a more humble house inside itand the display of ramming beaks was dazzling some were very crudely fashioned little more than mansized lumps of bronze with a pointed end but some were amazing works of art fashioned to look like griffins with ferocious beaks or sea monsters with multiple horns they were fearsome objects intended to wreak havoc on other ships but strikingly beautiful i pondered for a moment the degree of artistry that is lavished on spears and swords and other weapons to make pleasing to the eye a thing designed to cause death and destruction hideous arent they said cytheris noting my fascination antony dotes on them like children he has names for them all youd think he had captured them himself he says that someday he may build a fleet of warships and use the best of these to ornament them his own fleet of ships caesar might have something to say about that ah yes caesar she made a wry face as we walked through the house it appeared to me that the rooms had been depleted of some of their furniture and ornaments there were niches without statues and walls where paintings had been removed it had the halfvacant feeling of a house where someone is moving in or moving out completely secluded from the street the garden at the center of the house was unusually large and splendid full of fragrant roses in bloom and pebblestrewn pathways decorated with fountains and statues set amid the little arbors of myrtle and cypress were many dining couches piled with plump cushions clearly the occupants of the house spent a great deal of time in this space which could accommodate many guests cytheris led us to a secluded corner collapsed on a couch with a sigh and gestured for rupa and me to do likewise there was no need to call for wine a slave bearing a tray with a pitcher and cups appeared before i had time to settle myself so gordianus tell me everything about your stay in egypt are the alexandrians as mad as ever do they still hate romans did you meet cleopatra yes yes and yes really i keep telling antony he should invite her here since shes in rome for a visit but he says it wouldnt do hed be embarrassed to present his concubine to a queen i suppose but antony says its because caesar is still disputing his claim to this house yes i was curious about that i thought the house of the beaks and all its contents were to be sold at a public auction to benefit the treasury cytheris laughed oh yes theres going to be an auctionbut dont bother to come because antonys already given the best things to our friends every time we throw a party no one is allowed to leave without a piece of silver or a rare scroll or whatever else theyre up for carrying antony tells me id rather your actor friends end up with pompeys spoils than some rich banker friend of caesars have a look around gordianus and see what you might like to take home with you rupas big and strong he could probably carry that statue of cupid over there you are joking are you not a friend gordianus youve met antony havent you a few times over the years and doesnt he like you antony likes everyone well everyone except cicero antony says caesar should have executed cicero after pharsalus instead of pardoning him shows just how little my opinion counts with caesar these days as poor antony says but you were going to tell me about alexandria gordianus if youre going to earn that cupid youll have to cough up an amusing anecdote or two im afraid my time in egypt was not particularly amusing but you must have had many adventures you were there for months and right in the middle of that nasty little war between cleopatra and her brother with caesar showing up to play kingmaker you must have had a brush or two with deathor perhaps a dalliance with one of the queens handmaidens cytheris raised an eyebrow well i suppose i could tell you about the narrow escape we had from a rioting mob when we had to find our way through a secret passage beneath of the tomb of alexander the great cytheris sat forward yes thats exactly the sort of tale i want to hear hilarion bring more wine we must keep gordianuss throat well lubricated i regaled her with that story and thought of a few more incidents in alexandria that might amuse her and then steered the conversation back to the subject of the house how beautiful it is here in your garden and what a splendid house this is no wonder pompey loved it but i still dont quite understand does antony own the house or not the wine had relaxed her considerably she spoke freely that depends on whom you ask when caesar saw that antony was dragging his heels they exchanged some harsh words caesar pressed the matter throw a final party there if you must then auction the damned place and get out but antony wouldnt budge he was quite blunt the way i see it he told caesar i deserve this house as much as anyone i did my part to bring down pompey no less than you and this is my reward the two of them have carried on a pissing match about it ever since officially caesar insists on an auction but i think he may have finally given up or maybe hes just too busy arranging his upcoming triumphs to keep pestering antony so antonys plan now is to hold some semblance of an auctiontoss out pompeys motheaten togas and get rid of the dented silverthen declare that the auction is done and go on living here i want to redecorate the whole place anyway pompeys wife had dreadful taste in furniture what a long way cytheris had come from working as a street dancer in alexandria to cohabiting with one of the worlds most powerful men an actress and a foreigner speaking ill of pompeys wife and brazenly living in pompeys house in defiance of caesar himself but surely i said antony must realize how this might look to those who accuse caesar of betraying the common people they might say caesars behaving like sulla allowing a henchman to distribute the spoils of war to a small circle of favorites rather than using them for the common good the common people arent that stupid every gossip in rome knows that antony is keeping the house against caesars wishes but i should think thats even worse from caesars point of view the people will see that he allows open defiance a dictator cant afford to tolerate disobedience it makes him look weak cytheris smiled no it makes antony look like a spoiled brat and caesar like an indulgent parent is he not the father of the roman people now and isnt antony his most brilliant protege a little stubborn and reckless at times but worth a bit of spoiling in the long run never mind that the two of them are hardly speaking at the moment that will pass was this really what cytheris believed or was she glossing over a deeper anxiety had caesar become a menace to her world and what were antonys feelings to me he had always seemed a bluff brash fellow completely open about his likes and dislikes an unlikely candidate for conspiracy but anyone who had risen as high as antony undoubtedly possessed the instinct for selfpreservation at any cost that characterized such men and women just how serious was his fallingout with caesar even as these questions flashed through my mind cytheris spotted him across the garden smiled and waved antony came striding over wearing a tunic that was a bit more brief than many would consider seemly it certainly showed off his brawny legs the rumpled yellow garment looked as if he might have slept in it and there was a long wine stain down the front he looked and moved as if he might be slightly hungover he cast a curious heavylidded glance in my direction then bent forward to plant a kiss on cytheriss cheek she whispered something in his earmy name no doubtand he gave me a halting nod of recognition gordianus yes of course metos father by hercules how long has it been since our paths crossed quite some time and yet they cross again was there a glint of suspicion in his bleary eyes antonys face combined the poet and the brute making his expression hard to read he had a harsh profile with his dented nose craggy brows and jutting chin but there was something gentle about the curve of his full lips and a soulful quality in his eyes i would have called him a bit homely but women seemed to find his looks fascinating he grunted and held out his hand a slave put a cup of wine in it where is meto nowadays i suppose he must be back in rome for he was surely going to say the gallic triumph for meto had served caesar in gaul as had antony but his voice trailed away no meto is in spain im afraid antony grunted scouting the extent of young pompeys forces no doubt you and meto were both in alexandria werent you while caesar was there yes i said but now youre back can you believe it said cytheris we met by chance outside the temple of tellus and this is rupa whos gordianuss son now rupa is an old friend from my days in alexandria ah yes said antony all roads circle back to alexandria it seems i shall have to return there myself someday but i seem to recall hearing yes im certain someone told us that you were missing in egypt and presumed to be dead gordianus now who was it who told us that i can recall standing in this very garden and somehow your name came up and some fellow cytheris help me remember oh i know she said it was the scapegoat scapegoat the massilian you knowhieronymus hes the one who told us the rumor of gordianuss demise he seemed quite upset he hardly ate or drank a thing that night ah yes hieronymus antony nodded an odd character that one i thought he was another of your actor friends my dear until you explained where he came from claims to be a friend of yours gordianus hieronymus i whispered so you knew him what a stroke of fortune that they should be the first to mention him not i oh yes the scapegoat is one of cytheriss pets antony did not sound entirely pleased come antony hieronymus never fails to make you laugh admit it such a naughty tongue that fellow has actually im afraid i have some bad news about hieronymus i tried to make my face and voice register the emotion one feels when confronted suddenly and unexpectedly with the task of delivering sad news i glanced at rupa his muteness made him a good companion for this investigation he would never blurt out anything to give me away hieronymus is dead i said bluntly oh no cytheriss surprise seemed genuine of course she was a trained actress antony was harder to read he furrowed his forehead and narrowed his eyes when did this happen two nights ago where how he was stabbed in an alley on the palatine this was true if deliberately vague by whom asked antony he had once been charged with keeping order in rome news of a crime seemed to pique his interest i dont know it happened at night there seem to have been no witnesses how distressing said cytheris who would have wanted to kill poor harmless hieronymus was it a thief i thought the days of robbery and murder in the streets were over i shrugged and shook my head we must send a garland for the bier said cytheris the body hieronymus lies in my vestibule yes beloved send a garland said antony ill let you take care of that he squinted and shielded his eyes from the sunlight youll have to excuse me now suddenly my head is pounding no need to get up cytheris stay here in the garden with your guests but she was already on her feet gazing at him sympathetically and reaching out to gently stroke his temples i saw it was time to go thank you for the wine and the hospitality i should return to my house now in case anyone comes to pay his respects to hieronymus antony nodded let me know if you discover anything else about his death if you wish i realize how busy you must be with caesars triumphs approaching i believe the first to celebrate his conquest of gaul is the day after tomorrow i know from meto what an important role you played in that war antony scowled be that as it may i shall not be taking part in the gallic triumph no but you were a cavalry commander at alesia werent you when vercingetorix led a night attack against the roman besiegers it was only your swift response that saved the situation antony grunted your son told you about that did he caesar himself says so in those memoirs of his surely youll be riding in a place of honor the first mounted officer behind caesars chariot and i should think you would be among the privileged few to witness the execution of vercingetorix in the tullianum im sure they can manage to strangle the wretched gaul without me do you know cytheris i think well hold the auction that day right here in the street outside the house lets see if we can lure any of the revelers away from the parade route to come gawk at pompeys pinky rings and bedroom slippers but surely caesar himself will insist that you take part i said caesar is a selfish ungrateful antony caught himself for months after pharsalus i was left on my own in charge of this unruly city without any instructions from caesar to be fair caesar was trapped inside the royal compound at alexandria with no way to send word i said for part of that time yes but once hed broken out and defeated ptolemy did he hurry back to rome no he took a leisurely trip up the nile with cleopatra while he was sightseeing and doing who knows what else with the queen i was facing an angry mob here in rome not even knowing whether caesar was alive or dead the situation was quite precarious let me tell you and dolabella deliberately made it worse it wasnt enough that the boy was sleeping with my wifefrom whom i am now divorced thank the gods oh no dolabella insisted on promising wholesale debt relief to the poor saying it was just what caesar would have wanted he raised the hopes of the rabble whipped them to a frenzy and pitted them against me do you know what he called that gathering he organized in the forum a demonstration i called it a riot if i hadnt ordered my men to restore the peace there would have been a complete breakdown of order in this city utter chaos with looting and murders everywhere i did what i had to do but when caesar finally returned and heard all the complaints did he thank me did he praise me reward me no he scolded me in publichumiliated meand embraced dolabella saying what a good clever boy he was to show such sensitivity to the needs of the poor this was just the kind of spontaneous response i was hoping for how might i goad him to further candor i frowned and feigned surprise at his vehemence i clucked my tongue dolabella that naughty fellow sleeping with your antonia presumably he did so behind the back of his own dear wife the pathetic tullia ciceros whelp dolabella divorced herafter finally getting her pregnant but dont trick me into saying that cursed name again what name i ventured antony narrowed his eyes and glared at me suspicious now that i was deliberately taunting him ah you mean cicero i said i realize that the two of you have been bitter enemies for a long time but caesar saw fit to pardon cicero did he not antony gritted his teeth yet another example of caesars outrageous he caught himself he pinched the bridge of nose grimaced turned around and left without another word oh dear said cytheris im afraid you set him off i hadnt realized the situation between antony and caesar was so delicate its not as bad as it sounds truly she shook her head these headaches hes sufferingthey worry me its not what you think it isnt the drinking that causes them its the pressure hes under a man like antony must have much on his mind not enough these days thats the problem these headaches never plague him when hes in the thick of things having to contain a riot or lead a cavalry charge its the idleness afterward that brings them on its as if hes still releasing the pressure after all those months of stress running the city as caesars surrogate facing one crisis after another not knowing if caesar would ever come back it took a toll on him who can blame antony if all he wants now is to throw parties and drink and sleep until noon who can blame him indeed i said v as rupa and i departed from the house of the beaks and made our way back to the palatine i experienced a distinct sensation of being followed over the years i have learned to trust this sensation it never misleads me unfortunately my skill at spotting a stealthy pursuer has diminished over the years even as my skill at sensing one has grown more acute at one point i asked rupa to lag behind a bit to see if we could outstalk my stalker but the ruse didnt work i arrived home safely but with the disturbing sensation of having been followed and no idea who had done so or why i retired to the garden found a shady spot and resumed my reading of hieronymuss reports and his private journal there was little in them to hint at any danger that antony might pose to caesar mostly hieronymus listed in great detail who attended the parties at the house of the beaks what they wore ate and drank and what they gossiped about after my single interview with them i could have done a better job of reporting on antonys state of mind and speculating on any dangerous motivations that might be attributed to cytheris hieronymus had uncovered something dangerous enough to get himself killed it would appear he harbored no particular suspicions of antony and yet that very fact raised an alarm how had hieronymus put it the menace to caesar will come at a time and from a direction we did not anticipate to judge by his reports hieronymus had not anticipated any menace from antony and cytherisor had he grown suspicious only when it was too late to save himself i scribbled a few of my own notes toward assembling a report to calpurnia then skimmed more of the material which of hieronymuss paths should i retrace next i decided to talk to vercingetorix as soon as possible in two days the man would be dead since his defeat and capture at alesia six years ago the former leader of the gauls had been kept a prisoner had the civil war not intervened caesar would long ago have staged his gallic triumph and vercingetorix would be dead thus it had been since the earliest days of the republic when a victorious roman general celebrates a triumph his most prominent captives are paraded in fetters and at the conclusion of the procession they are taken to the dungeon chamber called the tullianum and strangled to death to the delight of the gods and the glory of rome now the time had come for caesars triumph and for vercingetorix to face his destiny it was hard to see how the captured leader of the gauls could pose any threat to caesarsurely he was kept under strict guardyet calpurnia had arranged for hieronymus to see him so she must have considered him a possible menace looking through hieronymuss notes on their single meeting i saw references to the gauls appearance and state of mind but the most important question was not addressed had vercingetorix been allowed any contact at all with friends and family if he had been kept in complete seclusion as i suspected then he could not be plotting against caesar nor have any knowledge of a plot on the other hand even during the most controlled visits from the outside he might have exchanged information in code or might simply have given inspiration to his visitors by a show of fortitude caesar had done his best to undermine any remaining gallic resistance partly by rewarding those who cooperated but there must be many gauls who hated him fiercely and wished him dead hieronymus had not remarked on the question of outside contacts with vercingetorix perhaps because calpurnia already had that information mostly he ruminated on the special attributes he possessed for winning the captives trust the two of us have something in common after all as the scapegoat in massilia impending doom hung over me every day every hour i tasted the torment that v faces as his final day draws near because i escaped the fates he may deduce that i received special dispensation from the gods for a man in his circumstances it will be natural to draw close to me hoping that some of that favor might rub off on him hieronymus hieronymus i whispered shaking my head you cheated the fates for a time but no man escapes them forever the doomed gaul still lives while you lie on a bier in my vestibule did he have anything to do with your death papa diana stepped into the garden the sunlight sparkled and glimmered upon her dark hair i was struck anew by her beautyinherited entirely from her motherbut her face was grave what is it daughter theres a visitor whos come to pay respects to hieronymus so soon word of his death had already begun to spread then faster than i expected the official entry had been registered by the undertakers of course and there are gossip vultures who follow those lists daily or had someone in calpurnias household spread the news who is it i asked fulvia she says shed like to speak to you of course would you show her to the garden yourself diana have the boys bring refreshment my association with fulvia went back many years it was safe to say that she was the most ambitious woman in rome but what had she gained by her ambitions except a widows garments first she married the rabblerouser clodius whose mobs terrorized the city but when clodius was murdered on the appian way fulvia as a woman could do nothing with the tremendous political power her husband had harnessed then she married curio one of caesars most promising young lieutenants when the civil war began curio captured sicily and pressed on to africawhere king juba of numidia made fulvia a widow again and took curios head for a trophy when i last saw her before my departure for alexandria she was still beautiful but bitter and brooding lacking the one thing a woman in rome needed to exercise power an equally ambitious husband in alexandria a woman like cleopatra may exercise power alone but romans are not egyptians we may revert to having a king but we have never submitted to the rule of a queen so far as i had seen fulvia did not figure in any of hieronymuss reports to calpurnia her ambitions thwarted she had become irrelevant but if hieronymus had not visited her why was she coming to pay her respects even as i recalled hieronymuss reference to a threat from a direction we did not anticipate fulvia stepped into my garden appropriately for such a visit she was dressed in a dark stola with a black mantle over her head but she had been similarly dressed when i last saw her in mourning for curio perhaps she had never put off her widows garments she was now in her late thirties her face was beginning to show the strain and suffering she had endured over the years but the fire in her eyes had not gone out fulvia spoke first as if she were the hostess and i the guest that was like her to take the initiative its good to see you gordianus even if the occasion is a sad one i had heard yes yes i knowthat i was dead she smiled faintly and nodded but you must have known that wasnt the truth fulvia surely you knew the moment i arrived back in rome from your famous network of allseeing allhearing spies i seem to recall at our last meeting that you boasted to me that nothing of importance could occur in rome without your knowledge perhaps your return to rome was not of sufficient importance i winced was this sarcasm her expression indicated that she was simply stating a fact you came here to pay respects to hieronymus yes did you know him well she hesitated an instant too long and chose not to answer you didnt know hieronymus at all did you fulvia she hesitated again i never met him i never spoke to him but you knew of hieronymuswho he was where he went what he was up to perhaps and somehow you knew about his death ahead of nearly everyone in rome and of the presence of his body in this house how could that be i wonder and why should you care enough about this stranger hieronymus to come pay your respects she drew back her shoulders and stood rigid for a moment then released her tension with a short laugh its a good thing i have nothing to hide from you gordianus with only two eyes and two ears you perceive all what a gift you possess very well i know who hieronymus was because i have men who watch the house of the beaks and report back to me on everyone who comes and goesincluding your old friend the socalled scapegoat and your men were watching this morning werent they they saw me arrive with cytheris and at least one of them tracked me when i left i knew someone was following me the fellow must be very good try as i might i couldnt trick him into revealing himself thats quite a compliment coming from gordianus the finder hell be flattered and when your spy saw the cypress wreath on my door he knew there must be a dead body in my vestibule the death of hieronymus is a matter of public record now my man had merely to check the registry and that gave you the pretext for this visit yes but i see now that i neednt have bothered with a pretext i should simply have come to you as a friend this was exaggerating our relationship but i let it pass and as a friend what would you ask of me fulvia why did you visit antonys house today whos employing you to spy on him my response was equally blunt do your men merely watch the comings and goings at the house of the beaks or does someone follow cytheris wherever she goes fulvia did not answer because if one of your men was following cytheris he could tell you that she met me quite by chance outside the temple of tellus and invited me on the spot to come home with her i dont believe it if you met cytheris in the street it didnt happen by chance but because you wanted it to happen you were at antonys house today because you meant to be there gordianus and that would happen only because someone has hired you to investigate antony either that or youre acting entirely on your ownin which case you must suspect that antony had something to do with your friends death couldnt it simply be that i wished to inform antony and cytheris of hieronymuss demise knowing that he had been a guest in their home in recent months she wrinkled her brow perhaps her shoulders slumped she was suddenly tired of sparring with me i realized she was standing in the hot sunlight please sit fulvia here beside me in the shade there should be some wine on its way i wonder where those useless boys have got to as if they had been lurking out of sight waiting to be prompted mopsus and androcles appeared at once one bearing a silver pitcher and the other two cups at least they had the good sense to bring the best vessels hopefully they also had brought the best vintage at the sight of them fulvia expressed surprise then smiled my how theyve grown theyre almost a big as my son publius i had almost forgotten that the boys had once belonged to fulvia i acquired them from her in the course of my investigation into the murder of her first husband i saw now why the boys had hung back they were still in awe of their former mistress and why not i was a little in awe of fulvia myself androcles approached her with downcast eyes and offered her a cup mopsus was equally shy when he poured from the pitcher theyve served me very well i said they went to egypt with me and kept me company in alexandria you may go now boys after daring to raise their eyes to catch a glimpse of fulvias face the two of them withdrew from the garden the wine was very good a mamertine vintage that was almost as smooth and delicate as a fine falernian i thought fulvia might comment on it but she said nothing no doubt she took such quality for granted as i see it fulvia the question is not why i was at antonys house this morning the question is why are you keeping such a close watch on him she studied me over the rim of her cup was this your first contact with antony and cytheris since your return yes and what did you make of their little household they seem very comfortable with each other were they amorous i smiled not in my presence if youre asking if they carried on like sexmad lovers the answer is no to be candid antony seemed a bit hungover i think he may have been asleep when i arrived but cytheris was lively enough cytheris fulvia spoke the name with disdain well at least shes achieved her goal of getting him to divorce antonia i think antonia may have done her part to make that happen carrying on with dolabella indeed well their marriage is over and thats what matters now its just a matter of prying him away from that dreadful actress you intend to marry antony yes but does he intend to marry you weve discussed the matter at some length she spoke as if they were negotiating a business partnership or planning a military expedition we agree on the advantages of such a marriage we also agree on our compatibility in certain other areas i am in every way woman enough to satisfy a man like antony she said this defiantly as there might be some doubt i was a passionate wife to clodius and to curio as well a good partner why antony thinks he must hold on to that creature i cant understand he actually proposes that i should agree to some formal arrangement for keeping her letting her live in one of antonys houses and draw an income as if she were a second wife when my mother heard that well the repercussions were not pleasant for anyone i remembered the gaunt whitehaired sempronia who was every bit as ambitious as her daughter but less charming as for those who say i brought ill fortune to my previous husbands and would bring ill fortune to antony as well who says such a thing cytheris of course but its a lie and a slander to suggest that i carry a curse given the times we live in is it any wonder that two men who dared to raise themselves above the pack were struck down i tended to agree with fulvia but it seemed prudent to change the subject what about antonys fallingout with caesar i said the situation is ridiculous and totally unnecessary cytheris is behind it of course shes the one who talked him into settling in at the house of the beaks shes made it their little love nest where they can entertain her dubious circle of foreign dancers and acrobats dubious foreigners like my friend hieronymus i said im sure they welcomed him into their circle because he had a certain freakish appealthe scapegoat who cheated death on the contrary hieronymus could be quite witty and entertaining of course i didnt mean to speak ill of your friend gordianus but a woman like cytheris is not to be trusted she cares only for her own advancement everyone else is merely a steppingstone including antony it occurred to me that fulvia might be describing herself so your marriage to antony our plans have not been finalized he wont be pinned down hes behaving like an irresponsible boy rejecting the sensible advice of the two people who care most about his career and can do most to help him caesar and myself hes spurning us to carry on with thatthat alexandrian whore perhaps antony is not such a good match for you after all if he lacks sound judgment no hes come this far and hell go much much farther hes the man i should have married in the first place we both know that weve known it for years but circumstances simply never fell out that way i married clodius and he married that first wife of his that nobody i cant even remember her name then the fates led us both to a second marriage but not to each otheri to curio antony to antoniaand our mutual destiny was postponed until now i am a widow again antony is divorced now is the time it will happen it must happen i shrugged the gods have a habit of thwarting even our most reasonable expectations no not this time it will happen because i will make it happen antony will achieve the destiny he deserves and so will i i sighed i feared it would not be the gods who denied fulvia her desire but another mortal antony there is nothing so unsure as the plans we make that rely on the sensible behavior of another human being i gather fulvia that you intend to save antonyfrom cytheris from himself but what if antony refuses to be saved her face lengthened was that your impression from your visit to the house of the beaks not exactly i was there to talk about hieronymus not antony this was not entirely true but the fact was that i had nothing useful to tell her about antonys future plans at least regarding the women in his life i do know that he wont be taking part in the gallic triumph but im not sure if that was caesars decision or antonys she shook her head he should be in the very front line just behind caesar the whole city should see him and remember the part he played in conquering the gauls he offended many people when he was in charge of the city but if they could be reminded of his sacrifice his bravery his loyaltywhat a squandered opportunity this rift with caesar it must be ended one way or another the light behind her eyes suddenly flared like flames fanned by a hot wind she closed her eyes as if to hide their intensity from me at least i shall be able to take some satisfaction from the african triumph eight days from now king juba claimed my husbands head as a trophy now juba is dead his kingdom belongs to rome and caesar shall parade jubas little son as a captive she abruptly rose and made ready to go adjusting her mantle and gathering the folds of her stola as always gordianus your candor is greatly refreshing this city is full of flatterers and outright liars sometimes i think you must be exactly what that monster cicero called you the most honest man in rome i smiled that was a rare compliment from cicero and im not sure hed repeat it nowadays i spoke carefully if anyone hated cicero even more than antony did it was fulvia i havent seen cicero in a very long time not since you returned from egypt no i see then you dont know what the old goat is up to no i raised an eyebrow she laughed shrilly its too delicious but i dont think ill tell you ill let you find out for yourself you wont believe itwhat a fool that old scoundrel cicero has made of himself i followed her out of the garden and into the vestibule she paused for a moment to gaze at the body of hieronymus i truly am sorry about your friend she whispered and then stepped outside where a retinue with a litter awaited her in the street i watched her depart hieronymus had jotted no notes about fulvia in his reports or his journal but he had also spoken of a menace from an unexpected quarter it was fulvias ambition that antony must be made to fulfill his destiny at any cost before that could happen his rift with caesar must be endedone way or another as fulvia had stressed vi after fulvias departure i sent a message to calpurnia telling her i wanted to be admitted to visit vercingetorix in his cell the next day she sent a message back to me before sunset apparently she had been able to arrange my visit at a moments noticeand without caesars knowledge since she cautioned me to tell no one lest he learn of it the extent of her authority continued to surprise me it occurred to me that calpurnia was the woman fulvia wished to become how could that happen as long as caesar was alive that night at dinner with the family i recounted some of my conversation with antony and cytheris but kept to myself anything that might embarrass or simply displease calpurnia should it spread beyond my house it was not that i doubted the discretion of my loved ones but in my experience words once uttered have a way of taking flight as if acting on their own volition i was struck again at rupas suitability to act as my companion and bodyguard he heard all but could repeat nothing my body was weary i would have slept with the sun but restless thoughts kept me awake the prospect of meeting the leader of the gauls on the last full day of his life filled me with trepidation the interview would almost certainly be unpleasant in one way or another and i found myself wishing i could avoid it altogether unable to sleep i left my bed the night was warm crickets thrummed in the garden i stepped into my library lit a lamp and did my best to peruse the difficult handwriting of hieronymus previously i had intentionally skipped over the entries having to do with cicero assigning them a low priority for one thing i had no wish to read about ciceroif hieronymus had thought me a windbag what in hades had he made of ciceroand for another it seemed to me that cicero was the unlikeliest of assassins but fulvias reference to him had piqued my curiosity over the years my relations with the great lion of the roman law courts had been mixed over thirty years ago i ferreted out the truth for cicero when he took on his first major case defending a man accused of parricide in the gloomy days when sullas shadow covered rome i nearly got myself killed more than once in the course of that investigation and cicero had faced considerable danger as well daring to take on one of the dictators most dangerous henchmen in the court his surprising success had redounded to the enduring benefit of us both but ciceros meteoric rise in the political arena had revealed a darker side of his character he was perfectly willing to sacrifice the reputations and even the lives of his rivals to attain success though he was careful to do so by using some would say twisting the law as he grew in fame and power i hardened my heart toward cicero but when men like caesar and pompey elbowed him off the political stage their terrifying ruthlessness made cicero even at his worst look benevolent my feelings about him had softened but i had never quite patched up the strained relations between us could cicero be the menace to caesar when civil war loomed cicero had wavered between caesar and pompey for as long as he possibly could and would have avoided choosing either side had such an option been possible ultimately he sided with pompey and the old establishment and fought against caesar at pharsalus after a resounding victory caesar saw fit to pardon cicero since then the great orator whatever his true feelings about the new dictator had kept his mouth shut i could no more easily picture cicero as a conspirator that i could picture antony for different reasons if antony was too brash and outspoken cicero was too cautious and indecisive and to his credit he was a true defender of the republican virtues of debate compromise and consensus a man like cicero would pursue every possible legal channel no matter how tortuous or tenuous rather than resort to violence but had not caesars victory closed all political and legal avenues of challenge to his authority what was a true republican to do when faced with the prospect of a dictator for life these were strange days if calpurnia could fall under the spell of a haruspex if antony the man of action could wile away his days in a drunken stupor if an alexandrian dancer could take up residence in pompeys house could cicero become a murderous conspirator what had he been up to in my absence and since my return to rome what had fulvia been hinting at having kept so completely to myself i truly had no idea when i read the details in hieronymuss report my jaw dropped could it be true marcus tullius cicero the most pious advocate in rome now that cato was dead the defender of staid virtue and oldfashioned family values had divorced his wife of more than thirty years and married his ward a girl named publiliawho was only fifteen strange days indeed i laughed out loud imagining cicero married to a teenager this i would have to see with my own eyes laughter released the tension in me suddenly i was very sleepy i extinguished the lamp and stumbled to bed where bethesda huffed and sighed and spooned her body to accommodate me beneath the thin coverlet the first roman prison called the carcer and located at the foot of the capitoline hill above the forum was built hundreds of years ago by ancus marcius fourth king of rome according to legend it was the sixth king servius tullius who excavated a subterranean cell in the carcer which forever after bore his name the tullianum this dreadful word evoked dankness darkness an inescapable pit a place of hopeless helpless waiting for death yet it was also a word that politicians and military men uttered with pride for the tullianum had been the final destination of many of romes fiercest enemies over the centuries where they met their end at the hands of a roman executioner it had been the practice begun by the kings to parade their captives in a triumphal procession stripped of all insignia and symbols of worldly statussometimes stripped naked entirelythe better to demonstrate the utter humiliation of their defeat and the contempt of their conquerors after being paraded for the amusement of the roman populace less important captives were destined for slavery the more important were strangled in the tullianum afterward their bodies were thrown down a flight of steep steps to the forum so that the crowd could view their corpses as i made my way with rupa across the forum heading for the tullianum all around us we saw preparations for the gallic triumph to be held the next day along the parade route reviewing stands with awnings were being erected to accommodate important personages and areas where vendors usually hawked their wares were already being cleared to make room for the anticipated crowds from atop the capitoline hill i could hear the echo of workers shouting amid a din of hammering and creaking wood a bronze statue of caesar had been installed across from the temple of jupiter and the scaffolding around it was being removed for its official unveiling the next day at the western end of the forum with the steep slope of the capitoline looming above us we came to a flight of steps carved out of the stone two guards stood at the foot of the steps i produced the pass i had received from calpurniaa small wooden disk with the seal of her ring impressed in red waxand they let us pass without speaking a word the narrow steps ascended steeply behind us the forum was a jumble of columns rooftops and public squares at some distance to the northeast in a newly developed area adjacent to the forum i could see the glittering solid marble temple of venus erected by caesar in honor of his divine ancestress and the patroness of his victories the temple had just been completed it faced a vast open square surrounded by a colonnaded portico that was still under construction with the pedestal in place for a monumental equestrian statue of caesar the temple of venus was to be dedicated on the last day of caesars four triumphs providing a divine climax to the celebrations of his earthly conquests such lofty thoughts fled when we came to the heavily guarded entrance to the carcer again the guards looked at my pass from calpurnia and said nothing before admitting me rupa was made to wait outside the heavy bronze doors swung open i stepped into the carcer and the doors clanged shut behind me the chamber perhaps twenty paces in diameter had stone walls and a vaulted stone roof the only natural light and ventilation came from a few small windows high in the wall facing the forum which were crisscrossed with iron bars the place stank of human excrement and urine as well as the odor of putrefaction perhaps there were dead rats trapped in the walls even on a warm day such as this the place was dank and chilly the warder a grizzled bull of a man insisted on seeing my pass again he scowled at the pass then at me shouldnt be doing this he muttered if the dictator finds out he wont find out from me i said and i presume the dictators wife has paid you quite well enough to keep your mouth shut he grunted i can hold my tongue no one will know you were hereas long as you dont do anything stupid like try to help the prisoner escape im sure thats impossible others have tried and failed he smiled grimly but i was thinking more along the lines of helping him escape his fate by dying you mean before caesar has the chance to execute him exactly in this case a dead gaul is a useless gaul you wouldnt try to pull a trick like that would you youve seen the seal i carry what more do you want your word as a roman as a roman who sneaks behind caesars back and consorts with others who do the same loyalty to caesar isnt necessarily the same as loyalty to rome you dont have to be caesars lackey to have a sense of honor as a roman i raised an eyebrow who would have guessed a pompeian is in charge of the tullianum hardly i dont shed tears for losers couldnt do this job if i did just swear by your ancestors that youre not up to something very well by all the gordianii who came before me i swear that i have no intention either to harm or to help vercingetorix good enough and dont get yourself killed i wouldnt be able to explain that either killed isnt the prisoner chained the warder lowered his voice druid magic they say he can cast the evil eye i never look him in the face i put a bag over his head whenever i have to go down there and slosh his feces down the drain hole with that pleasant image in my mind i sat on a wooden plank attached to a thick padded rope it was like a crudely made swing that a boy might hang from a tree branch the warder handed me a small bronze lamp with a single wick and then using a winch he slowly lowered me though a hole in the floor this was the only entrance to the tullianum as my head passed below the rim of the hole i descended into a world that was darker danker and even more foul smelling than the room above an odor of mold sweat and urine filled my nostrils the dim lamplight faded to darkness before it could reach the surrounding walls below me as i slowly descended i heard the scurrying of rats i looked down i couldnt see the floor for a moment i almost panicked then i caught a glimmer of reflected lamplight on the glistening wet stone floor that drew nearer and nearer until my feet made contact all steady the warder called down from above no dont look up at the hole youll get vertigo besides the light will blind you close your eyes for a bit let them adjust closing my eyes was the last thing i intended to do in that place i stepped away from the rope holding it to steady myself and raised the lamp so as to illuminate the chamber without dazzling my eyes slowly i began to perceive the dimensions of the place it seemed larger than the chamber above but perhaps that was an illusion of the darkness huddled against a wall i saw a human figure the lamplight reflected dully off the chains binding his wrists and ankles he wore a filthy ragged tunic his hair and beard were long and tangled when he turned his face toward me the lamplight flashed in his eyes so this was vercingetorix leader of the gauls the man who had accomplished the almost impossible task of unifying the fiercely independent tribes under a single command he had very nearly succeeded in throwing off the roman yoke but caesars tactical genius and sheer good luck defeated him in the end caesars utter ruthlessness had also played a part in his victory even my son meto who loved caesar was haunted by the cruelties inflicted on the gaulsvillages burned women and children raped and enslaved old men hacked to death during the revolt of vercingetorix caesar laid siege to the city of avaricum and took no prisoners the entire populationforty thousand men women and childrenwere massacred caesar boasted of this atrocity in his memoirs the last stand of the gauls had been at the fortress of alesia vercingetorix believed he could hold the position until reinforcements arrived then destroy the roman legions with the combined armies of the gauls but the reinforcements were insufficient and the roman choke hold on the fortress proved impenetrable the starving survivors were ultimately forced to surrender a roman commander would have killed himself but vercingetorix rode out from alesia and surrendered to caesar if he thought that caesar would treat him with honor and respect he had been mistaken vercingetorix must still be a young manmeto told me the gaul was only a teenager when he began his campaign to unify his peoplebut i would never have guessed it from the broken figure huddled against the wall the gaunt face sharply shadowed by the lamplight or the haunted eyes that flashed like shards of obsidian is this the day he whispered hoarsely his latin had a strong gallic accent no not yet i said he pressed himself against the wall as if he wished to disappear into the stone im not here to harm you i said liar why else are you here if he could see my face i thought he might be reassured i held the lamp before me the light shone into my eyes he could see me but i could no longer see him in the darkness his breathing quickened the chains rattled when i flinched and stepped back he barked out a noise that must have been a laugh you fear me roman thats rich after all the beatings youve given me im not here to beat you i only want to talk talk about what im a friend of a man who came to visit you not too long ago a visitor no one visits me he was a massilian his name was hieronymus ah i heard him breathe in the darkness there was a rattle in his throat as if phlegm had settled in his lungs the scapegoat you mean i wasnt sure if he existed or not i thought perhaps i only dreamed about him hieronymus was real he was my friend excuse my poor latin roman but i think youre speaking in a past tense yes hieronymus is dead more breathing in the darkness more rattling from his throat then an explosion of laughter he muttered something in his native tongue i shook my head what are you saying the man who was famous for cheating death is dead and i vercingetorix am still alive at least i think i am for all i know this is the roman underworld and yet i dont remember dying unable to see his expression or gauge the tone of the words cloaked by his thick accent i couldnt tell whether he was serious or not i felt an urge to see his face but i kept the lamp before me illuminating myself as long as he could see me and look into my eyes he might keep speaking i think i like that ideathat im already dead he said that means the ordeal is over the thing i dreaded so much for so longits behind me now yes thats good and for all i know youre the roman god of the dead here to welcome me pluto is the name i think isnt that right the darkness grew thick around me the dank air chilled my lungs yes i whispered pluto is the name so hieronymus the scapegoat arrived in hades ahead of me too bad for him he seemed to be having such a good time being alive in the world when he visited i made him tell me all about the parties he went to he described the houses of the rich and powerful the sweetsmelling gardens the banquets with food of every sort piled high oh yes the food in the darkness i heard his stomach grumble can this be right he whispered does a dead mans empty belly groan in hades i couldnt tell if he was joking mad or simply spinning a fantasy as men do in unbearable circumstances i only knew that he was speaking freely which was what i wanted yes hieronymus loved life i said how did he die he was stabbed ha by a jealous husband or some great warrior he insulted i honestly dont know you say he was your only visitor yes no one else has come to see you no one except the warders but you werent always kept in the tullianum were you usually the prison was only for those awaiting imminent judgment or execution no for a long timemonths and months years and yearsi was kept here and there in cages and boxes and holes in the ground moved from one of caesars estates to another i presume to keep my followers from knowing my whereabouts the siege of alesia had ended more than six years ago with that victory romes conquest of gaul was complete normally caesar would have returned to rome to celebrate his triumph over the gauls as soon as events allowed certainly within a year or two but his quarrel with the senate and the eventual civil war had intervened vercingetorix should have been executed years ago instead he had been kept in captivity all this time living a nonlife while awaiting a terrible death no wonder he seemed more a ghost than a man how did they treat you in those cages and holes not badly no not badly at all i was fed well enough kept reasonably clean beaten only when i tried to escape or made other trouble they needed to keep me alive you see for caesars triumph you cant humiliate a dead man by parading him through the forum you cant inflict suffering on a corpse no they needed to keep me alive indefinitely so they never starved me and they never beat me beyond my endurance they made sure i had no way to kill myself they even sent a physician once or twice when i was ill then everything changed the time grew near they brought me to rome i knew when they lowered me into this pit that i would never come out again until the day of my death they began to starve me they beat me for no reason they tortured me they made me sleep in my own waste for caesars triumph they didnt want a strong proud gaul walking upright through the forum they wanted a broken man a cringing pathetic creature covered in filth a laughingstock an object of ridicule something for children to jeer at and old men to spit on he suddenly lurched forward pulling his shackles taut i gave a start and almost dropped the lamp tell me im right he cried tell me youre pluto and the ordeal is already over they say the dead forget their troubles when they cross to the underworld and drink from the river lethe have i drunk from the river have i forgotten the day of my death my heart pounded in my chest my hand shook causing the lamplight to flicker who knows what youve forgotten tell me what you remember vercingetorix tell me about the plot to kill caesar he fell silent was he puzzled or angry or too shrewd to answer at last he spoke what are you talking about surely your people wont let your death go unavenged are the gauls not bitter are they not proud can they allow the great vercingetorix to die and do nothing to avenge his death again there was silence it went on so long that i became unnerved imagining that he had slipped from his chains somehow and was drawing toward me i braced myself and stood upright letting the lamps steady glow illuminate my face i have no people he finally said the best of the gauls died at alesia the survivors were sold into slavery the traitors who sided with caesar received their reward this was true all over gaul caesar had placed the native chieftains who had supported him in positions of authority over the rest some he had even elevated to the roman senate but the gauls have other ways to inflict harm on a man i whispered druid magic how you must long for caesars death have you placed a curse on him he laughed bitterly if the druids possessed true magic would gaul be a roman province theres nothing i can do to cause caesars death but hell die soon enough how do you know that every man dies even caesar if not this year then the next or the year after vercingetorix dies caesar dies the same fate awaits us all strange that i should have to remind pluto of that fact he began to weep i moved the lamp so that i could see him he shivered and trembled he hid his face in his hands insects and glistening slugs crept amid the strands of his matted filthy hair a rat skittered between us my stomach churned with nausea i tugged on the rope and called to the warder above the winch gave a squeal the rope pulled taut i sat on the wooden plank and began to rise slowly i turned my face up toward the opening longing for light desperate to fill my lungs with fresh clean air vii i hurried across the forum with rupa beside me thankful for the simple freedom to gaze at the blue sky above and to run my fingertips over the smooth sunheated stone wall of a temple from a food vendor near the temple of castor and pollux i paused to buy a little pastry stuffed with fig paste and slathered with fishpickle sauce rupa who had never acquired a taste for roman garum waved his hand to signal that he wanted a pastry with fig paste only together eating as we walked we passed the house of the vestals and trudged up the ramp to the crest of the palatine at the top we turned down the winding lane that would take us to the house of cicero not far from my own as we rounded the crest of the hill i had a clear view of the top of the capitoline hill across the way the temple of jupiter rebuilt after its destruction by fire during the days of sulla was as imposing as ever in a prominent place before the temple obscured by a canopy of sailcloth pending its unveiling stood the bronze statue that would be dedicated the next day what pose had caesar struck for his grand image on the capitoline that of a mortal supplicant a man more than other men but still obeisant to the king of the gods or something more grand the upright unbowed image of a descendant of venus a demigod and junior partner to the olympians we arrived at ciceros door rupa gave a polite knock with his foot to the slave who perused us through the peephole i stated my name and the desire to see his master on personal business a few moments later we were admitted to the vestibule then conducted down a hallway to ciceros library he was balder and fatter than i remembered he rose from his chair laid aside the scroll he had been reading and gave me a beaming smile gordianus how long has it been i thought i know you thought i was dead i sighed why no i knew you were back in rome i probably knew it the day you arrived i walk by your house almost every day you know and neighbors talk no i was going to say i thought youd never come to see me ive been keeping to myself he nodded so have i a lot of that going around these days best to stay at home with a stout fellow to guard the door dare to stick your head up and youre liable to get it whacked off he made a vivid gesture slashing one hand across his throat like the orator he was he exaggerated caesar isnt sulla i said i havent seen the heads of his enemies on spikes down in the forum no not yet not yet his voice trailed off but can i offer refreshment to you and your companion this is rupa i adopted him before i left for egypt he doesnt speak cicero smiled you and your extended family isnt this your third adopted son hes certainly the biggest of the lot but silent eh well theres been an additionand a subtractionto my own household as you may already know but my new family member most certainly speaksoh how that girl can speak hopefully shell return from her shopping before you leave and you can meet her but what can i offer you are you hungry we just had a bite actually perhaps some liberally watered wine to wash it down cicero clapped his hands and sent a slave to fetch the refreshment he cleared away some scrolls that were stacked on chairs and the three of us sat well gordianus tell me your news and then ill tell you mine from the look on his face i saw he could hardly wait to talk about his new wife my news is not happy im afraid while i was away i think you made the acquaintance of a good friend of mine hieronymus of massilia ah yes i heard the bad news i sent a message of condolence to your house just this morning id have come myself but as i said i dont go out much you know about his death already cicero nodded i send a man every day to check the new entries in the death registry these days one must keep abreast or else fall hopelessly behind theres nothing more embarrassing than to meet an old friend or someone i once defended in court and not to know that the fellows brother or son or father is dead it makes one look uncaring not to mention uninformed yes i was sorry to learn of hieronymuss death how did it happen he was stabbed here on the palatine stabbed in the street more or less but this is terrible do we know who did it not yet ha caesar claims to have made the city safe again but theres more lawlessness than ever another reason i hardly budge from my house so gordianus are you on the trail of the killer slipping into your old role playing the finder to seek justice for poor hieronymus venturing hither and yon uncovering scandal and skullduggery and whatnot something like that like the good old days eh when we were young you and i when there was a point to seeking out the truth and striving for justice will our grandchildren even know what a republic was or how the law courts operated if were to have a king i suppose the king will mete out justice no more juries eh there wont be much use for an old advocate like myself his tone was more wistful than bitter i nodded sympathetically speaking of hieronymus i was wondering how well you came to know him oh i had him here to my house a few times he greatly admired my library he was a very scholarly fellow you know awfully wellread and what a memory i had an old scroll of homer that had suffered some water damageneeded to be patched where a few lines had been lost can you believe that hieronymus was able to recite the missing lines by heart he dictated them to tiro and we restored the missing text on the spot yes he was the model of the wellversed greek proof that the massilian academies are every bit as good as theyre reputed to be i nodded would cicero speak as glowingly if he could read the parts about himself in hieronymuss journal those passages were especially full of pedantic wordplay as if hieronymus enjoyed making fun of cicero by using overwrought rhetoric the old satyr seems completely unaware of how ridiculous he looks to everyone except the fellow he sees in the mirror if he would pause to reflect he would die of blushing the little queen with beestung lips he calls my honey will sting him sooner or later some say he married her for money not honey a bad case of the hives is likely to kill an old satyr like cicero publilia cicero abruptly exclaimed and rose from his chair rupa and i did likewise for ciceros young bride had entered the room my honey i didnt hear you come in cicero hurried toward her he took a plump little arm in one hand and stroked her honeyblond hair with the other you flit like a butterfly you come and go without a sound your dainty little feet barely touch the earth rupa shot me a look and rolled his eyes i tried not to laugh publilia this is gordianus an old friend and this is his son rupa the petite roundfaced girl gave me a polite nod then turned her attention to rupa who i have noticed seems to be just the sort of fellow most fifteenyearold girls enjoy looking at publilia perused him openly for a moment then tittered and averted her eyes cicero appeared not to understand the cause of her chagrin but he delighted in her childish laughter and joined in with a cackle of his own shes a shy thing really no i am not the girl protested pulling her arm free she pouted for a moment then shot another glance at rupa and smiled ah i think all that shopping has tired out my little honey hasnt it crooned cicero or is this heat making her cranky perhaps you should take a nap my dear i suppose i could go lie down for a bit she looked rupa up and down and sighed especially if you men are talking about boring old books actually we were talking about death and murder i said oh the girl gave an exaggerated shudder causing her breasts to quiver they were surprisingly large for a fifteenyearold gordianus youve frightened her protested cicero you should be more careful what you say publilia is hardly more than a child indeed i said under my breath run along my honey have a drink cool yourself call one of the slaves to come fan you ill join you a bit later you can show me that cloth you bought for your new gown red gossamer from cos she said so light and gauzy you can see right through it the lump protruding from ciceros throat bobbed up and down as he swallowed he blinked yes well run along my honey your bride is utterly charming i said after publilia had gone did she bring a large dowry in the social circles to which cicero aspired this was not a rude question enormous he said but that is not why i married her oh i can believe that i assured him still it must have been painful after so many years together to end your marriage with terentia cicero smiled wryly im a strong man gordianus i survived sulla ive survived caesarso far and by hercules i survived thirty years with terentia still the divorce must have been painful for her if not for you his smile vanished terentia is a rock the way he said it the word was not a compliment shes indestructible shell live to be a hundred mark my words dont worry yourself about terentia if i were to worry i thought it would be about you cicero what do the etruscans say there is no fool like an old fool i bit my tongue im happy dont you see cicero crossed the room with a swagger i had never seen him so cocky not even in court and cicero orating before a jury could be very cocky indeed despite the dismal state of the world despite the end of everything ive fought for all my life about my personal life i have no complaints in that sphereafter so many reverses disappointments outright disastersat last everything is going my way my debts are all paid terentia is finally out of my life and i have a wonderful new bride who adores me oh his eyebrows lifted and at long last my dear little tullia is expecting a child soon my daughter shall make me a grandfather congratulations i said but i heard that her marriage to dolabella is finally over he said and tullia is well rid of the beast he caused her nothing but heartbreak he shall come to a bad end under normal circumstances a respectable public figure like cicero would hardly boast that his daughter was about to give birth out of wedlock but circumstances were no longer normalnot in a world where calpurnia consulted a soothsayer and cicero was married to a vapid teenager in such a world turned utterly askew could the vacillating timorous stayathome cicero pose a genuine threat to caesar it occurred to me that his new marriage might be both symptom and cause of a major shift in ciceros behavior might the old goat be thinking like a young goatstamping the ground and getting ready to take a reckless run at caesar with horns lowered with a new brideand a grandchildto impress did the husband of publilia feel sufficiently virile to take a stand as savior of the republic and if that were the case could cicero have been behind the killing of hieronymus when i spoke of the murder his response had seemed entirely innocent but cicero was an oratorromes greatestand what was an orator but an actor i had heard him boast of throwing dust in a jurys eyes was he throwing dust in my eyes even now if i could stay a bit longer conversing and drawing him out he might yet let something slip i nodded to rupa who reached into the shoulder bag he carried and pulled out some documents i was wondering cicero if you might take a look at something i found among hieronymuss private papers a literary work cicero raised an eyebrow was our friend secretly composing a tragedy an epic poem no this is something more in a scientific vein i think though im not really sure thats why i want to show it to you with your vast knowledge drawn from your wide reading perhaps you can make sense of it cicero smiled broadly did publilia find it this easy to lead him by flattery i handed him the documents he pursed his lips squinted clucked his tongue and hummed as he perused them he was stalling i thought he could no more decipher the arcane symbols and calculations than could i but at last he nodded and slapped the documents with the back of his hand as if to indicate he had cracked the code well i cant make it all outim hardly an astronomical expertbut clearly this has something to do with the calendar the roman calendar the roman yes but also the calendars of the greeks and the egyptians and perhaps of others as well there are many calendars gordianus every civilization has come up with its own way of reckoning the passage of time dividing years into seasons seasons into months months into days it was king numa who devised the roman calendar and established the priesthoods to maintain it numa was both a holy man and a king the whole point of his calendar was to make sure that religious rites were remembered and performed on time but as you must know no one has yet devised a perfect calendarthat is to say a reckoning of days that works equally well for every year irregularities inevitably creep into the process and no one quite knows why youd think the movements of the stars in the heavens would be as precise and predictable as the measurements of a water clock but its more complicated than that which is why numas calendar has become such a mess for most of my lifetime and yours its been at least slightly out of step with the seasons and nowadays its worse than ever but arent there priests who fix the calendar as we go along i said every year they decide whether to introduce an extra month and the month is as long as they wishthey add however many days they deem necessary to bring the calendar back into alignment with the planets thats correct gordianus said cicero in a patronizing tone as if he were surprised that a fellow like myself could grasp such an abstract concept you may remember in the year that clodius was killed on the appian way we had an intercalary month between februarius and martius twentyseven days as i recall he hummed thoughtfully and looked toward the doorway i wonder if i should invite publilia to join us she could learn a great deal from this discussion its good for a female to stretch her mind occasionally cicero was in pedagogic mode craving a worthy audience it struck me that few topics were more likely to bore ciceros honey than this one ah but shes probably napping cicero sighed and shrugged where was i oh yeseven with the addition of intercalary months the roman calendar has grown more and more out of step so that nowadays the harvest festivals of our ancestors occur during the summer which makes no sense and the holidays that are supposed to relieve the tedium of midwinter arrive in the autumn when everyone is busy with the harvest and so on this is the middle of september yet the weather is sweltering and the days are long i nodded to show i understood cicero continued which is why our esteemed dictator for life is planning to introduce a new calendar the first real advance on king numas ever attempted apparently when caesar was trapped for all those months in alexandria under siege in the palace complex he had rather a lot of time to kill i know rupa and i were there as well i passed the time by borrowing books from the famous library of the ptolemies i read them aloud to rupa and the slave boys i think i must have read every book ever written about alexander the great caesar also took advantage of his access to the library when he wasnt diddling that dreadful queen he consulted with her astronomersthe library boasts an impressive faculty of scientists and stargazersand it occurred to him that he might use his spare time to devise a more accurate and durable calendar now caesar is back in rome and so is the egyptian queen along with her retinue including scholars from the library even now caesar is said to be putting the final touches to his calendar intending to unveil it on the final day of his triumphs when he dedicates his temple to venus we shall have a new calendar for the new age cicero scowled as the dispassionate pedagogue gave way to the thwarted republican but surely thats a good thing i said whatever you may think of caesars other accomplishments if he can repair the roman calendar we shall all benefit that is true and if he can truly pull it off its only fitting that a roman should be the man to give the world an accurate accounting of the movement of the heavens i only regret that the man should be caesar this was as candid as i could wish throughout our conversation not once had cicero appeared to speak disingenuously his guard seemed to be entirely down he spoke to me as to a confidant i was finding it hard to believe he could in any way be responsible for hieronymuss death all these notations and scribblings i said indicating the documents what do they mean and why did hieronymus possess them cicero pursed his lips thoughtfully do you know what i think i think hieronymus made these calculations as a kind of mental exercise a challenge to himself he must have heard about caesars plan for a new calendar wouldnt it have been just like him to think if caesar can do it then so can i or perhaps he somehow got hold of the proposed calendar and was attempting to find flaws he was a very competitive sort of fellow he had a high estimation of his talents and considerable cheek once he told me that he thought he could quite easily become a finer orator than i can you believe that i nodded i can believe it indeed it was easy enough to imagine hieronymus obtaining information about the calendar from calpurnia or someone in her household or perhaps from the household of cleopatra whom he had visited and whose scholars were working with caesar on the project but if hieronymus had hoped to show up caesars calendar with one of his own that dream like all his others had come to an abrupt end cicero looked past me the slave who had admitted me stood in the doorway speak said cicero you have another visitor master who is it marcus junius brutus cicero smiled broadly and clapped his hands ah brutus he must have just arrived in the city show him in at once and bring more wine and a basin of water and some food brutus will be hungry after his journey the slave hurried to obey thank you for the hospitality i said and for your thoughts about hieronymus i began to rise from my chair but cicero gestured for me to sit please gordianus stay for a while ive shared your sadness for the loss of one friend now you can share my joy at being reunited with another by hercules not only is brutus still breathinga miraclebut caesar appointed him governor of cisalpine gaul you do know brutus dont you only by name i said i dont think our paths have ever crossed cicero nodded thoughtfully i always assume you know everyone but thats not true is it you never did have any ties to cato and his circle did you you were always too busy fetching and finding for pompey or for caesar well then you must stay so that i can introduce you brutus stepped into the room his tunic and his shoes were still dusty from traveling he and cicero greeted each other and embraced rupa and i rose while cicero introduced us then we all sat brutus washed his face and hands in a basin of water held by a slave then enthusiastically accepted a cup of wine he was a handsome man with a long face and keen eyes not quite forty years old throughout his adult life brutuss family connections and political affiliations had repeatedly put him at odds with caesar brutus had been the protege of his uncle cato who was the champion of the most hidebound conservative clique and one of caesars most relentless enemies when the civil war erupted brutus did not hesitate to side with pompey but on the eve of the battle of pharsalus caesar explicitly ordered his officers to spare brutus and take him alive after the battle he not only pardoned brutus but took him into his entourage as an honored companion why did caesar show such special favor to brutus for a number of years brutuss widowed mother servilia had carried on a torrid love affair with caesar despite the consternation of her brother cato brutus was only a boy when the affair began and came of age with caesar coming and going in his house the bond that formed between caesar and brutus survived the eventual cooling of caesars passion for servilia and also survived their political differences when caesar sailed off to africa to deal with the last defiant survivors of pharsalusincluding catohe sent brutus in the opposite direction the appointment to govern cisalpine gaul not only rewarded brutus but also got him out of rome and away from the battlefront caesar could hardly expect brutus to be in at the kill of his beloved uncle caesar had no son unless he intended to acknowledge cleopatras child perhaps he thought of brutus as a surrogate son perhaps as some people speculated he even intended to make brutus his heir how was the journey asked cicero long hot and dusty thanks for asking and thanks for the wine awfully good of you even in casual conversation brutus spoke with a clipped cultured accent his family claimed to be descended from the famous brutus who led the revolt against king tarquin the proud and helped to found the republic i found myself comparing him to antony who was every bit as aristocratic but seemed far less pretentious so how are things in the hinterland said cicero brutus snorted cisalpine gaul is practically italy you know the rubicon isnt the styx we do have the rudiments of civilizationbooks brothels and garum on a fast horse rome is only a few days away you made it just in time for the triumphs yes for better or worse caesar didnt exactly demand my attendance but he made his desire clear enough in his last letter i suppose i shant mind watching him parade the spoils of egypt and asia and further gaul but if he uses the african triumph to crow about his victory over uncle cato im not sure i can stomach that oh dear have i just made the most awful pun brutus flashed a lopsided smile in africa after a crushing defeat cato first tried to commit suicide by cutting open his belly its my understanding said cicero that the african triumph will chiefly celebrate the victory of roman arms over king juba of numidia who went down fighting the good fight along with uncle cato brutus sighed well whatever else we may say of caesar the old boy won the war fair and square didnt he and saw fit to let you and me keep our heads eh cicero what about you gordianus not a military man are you gordianus has a son whos been serving under caesar for quite some time said cicero you may have heard of him meto gordianus numas balls not the fellow who wrote those memoirs for caesar my son took caesars dictation yes i said brutus snorted dictation eh caesar probably wasnt even in the tent while your boy was scribbling away give credit where its due old man everybody knows those memoirs were written by a shadow and by hades they certainly did their job from the way those memoirs tell it the poor gauls didnt stand a chance quite a tale all blood and thunder and beat my roman chest pumped up caesars prestige with the common folk eh made him look invincible scared the piss out of cato i can tell you wouldnt want to go up against that bloodthirsty madman quoth my doomed uncle well bugger me the father of great caesars ghost sitting right here this is quite the literary gathering isnt it ciceros written his latest book especially for me did you know been sending me chapters a history of famous orators dedicated to yours truly celebrating a dead art i suppose who needs orators when the courts are closed and the senates a shadow nonetheless my name shall enjoy immortality on the dedication page of ciceros great opus cicero smiled i have no doubt that you shall achieve immortality by your own actions brutus really i dont see how a hundred years from now i doubt that anyones likely to remember who was governor of cisalpine gaul in the year of caesars quadruple triumphs youre still a young man brutus and caesar cicero glanced at me then looked back to brutus caesar wont live forever ah yes and what will come after caesar said brutus people are already speculating about that what does that tell you weve begun to think just the way people think when they live under a king were not worrying about the next election or whos liable to get himself exiled for corruption or how to keep a foot in a game were wondering how long will the old fellow live and who will be his heir for shame brutus tossed back his wine and held out his cup for the slave to refill it wine soothing the weariness of the journey had loosened his tongue he turned to rupa and smiled it was my ancestor also named brutus who founded this little thing we call a republic did you know that big fellow he paused as if expecting rupa to answer though he had been told when introduced that rupa was mute republiccomes from two fine old words res and publica the peoples state youre a fellow citizen i suppose being gordianuss son by adoption thats correct i said where were you born big fellow somewhere quite exotic ill wager rupa is sarmatian indeed you come from the very ends of the earth from the mountains where the sun rises whats that line from ennius you know cicero his epitaph for scipio cicero raised his voice to a ringing orators pitch the sun that rises above the easternmost marshes of lake maeotis illumines no man my equal in deeds far from being chagrined by his friends loose tongue he seemed to be as intoxicated as brutus this was not the cicero i knew thats right said brutus and you you big sarmatian fellow you must have actually seen lake maeotis though ill wager you havent a clue who scipio was no matter thats the point really what a remarkable thing is this republic eh it grows and grows spreading across the whole world from the pillars of hercules to lake maeotis laying down roads and building cities establishing courts of law securing the sea lanes and rewarding its best and brightest with the greatest prize on earth roman citizenship and enslaving a vast multitude in the process i commented rupa had been enslaved before he gained his freedom i shall not debate the natural necessity of slavery at least not here and now said brutus thats a book for cicero to write one of many now that hes retired the law courts loss will be the readers gain my point if i may return to it is the end of our republic and everything it stands for as i said it was my ancestor who founded this thing this was an exaggerationthe brutus of ancient times hardly drove the tarquins out of rome singlehandedlybut i let it go over four hundred and fifty years ago the republic has served us for many many generations the republic has made us masters of ourselves and masters of the world as brutus knew it would how he loved the republic no effort was too herculean no sacrifice too great to ensure its survival do you know what he did sarmatian in the very first year of the republic when he got wind of a conspiracy to bring back the king rupa shook his head brutus declared that any man involved in such a plot must die then a slave brought him proof that his own two sons were involved in the plot did he make an exception for them did he spirit them out of the city or destroy the evidence or pardon them no he did not he had every royalist conspirator arrested the guilty were lined up and forced to kneel and the lictors chopped their heads off one by one chop chop chop brutus watched the beheading of his own two sons and the historians tell us he never flinched and afterward he rewarded the slave who had informed on them by granting the man citizenshipmaking him the first slave ever to become a roman citizen a precedent that has worked to your advantage my sarmatian friend brutus sat back held out his cup for another refill and drank it down talking had made him thirsty and that fellow citizens is a tale of true republican virtue what man today could claim to be as brave as resolute as decisive as my forefather perhaps his descendant suggested cicero in a voice that was barely more than a whisper brutus the founder had killed his own sons for the sake of the republic might another brutus dare to kill his surrogate father for sake of the same res publica and might cicero romes greatest advocate and orator be just the man to persuade brutus to do it but whats this brutus tossed his empty cup to a slave and picked up the astronomical documents cicero had laid aside upon his arrival he perused the notations a bit blearyeyed symbols for capricorn and cancer virgo and libra those are clear enough but what are these extraordinary nonsense words egyptian months mesore phamenoth pharmouthi thoth phaopi tybi hathyr mecheir epiphi choiak pachon payni quite a mouthful and all these columns of numbers he squeezed his eyes shut for a moment and laid the documents aside what are you up to cicero helping our dictator with calculations for his new calendar i do hope hes not intending to saddle us with egyptian months along with an egyptian queen really that would be the last straw shall we dine on the ides of tybi meet me in the forum two days before the kalends of thoth he threw back his head and laughed actually gordianus brought these said cicero they appear to be the pet project of a mutual friend a friend who no longer has need of a calendar alas the time seemed right to depart i rolled up the documents and handed them to rupa i asked cicero to convey my farewell to his napping bride i wished brutus a good stay in rome and i took my leave viii tomorrow said bethesda standing in the front doorway with her arms crossed her tone was adamant her posture imperious hand her a flail and a crook i thought and put a nemes crown with a rearing cobra on her head and she could pass for egyptian royalty youre right i said even standing outside the house i caught a whiff of the odor of putrefaction that was beginning to emanate from the body in my vestibule i shall organize a procession for tomorrow well have him cremated outside the esquiline gate bethesda nodded satisfied that her point had been taken and stepped aside to allow me to enter the odor was stronger in the vestibule but not overpowering nonetheless i could see how my wife being at home all day had reached her limit did anyone come to pay their respects while i was out no visitors ah well im not surprised with all these preparations for caesars triumphs beginning tomorrow i suppose everyones too busy only fulvia came then and she didnt even know hieronymus her condolences were merely a pretext to question me ah hieronymus i gazed down at his face you amused them seduced them with your charm spied upon them and now it seems theyve forgotten about you no visitors bethesda repeated but some messengers did come they brought these she bent down to fetch a few pieces of parchment that had been tossed haphazardly in the corner near the door as if they were bits of refuse bethesda had little respect for the written word there was also a wax writing tablet among the messages bethesda these are notes of condolence they were brought for hieronymus you should have laid them upon his bier she raised a skeptical eyebrow and shrugged i suppose im lucky you didnt burn them wont they be burned tomorrow along with hieronymus yes but only after ive read them who are they from then this ones from cicero he told me hed sent a message the laughter and erudition of our learned friend from massilia will be sorely missed in these trying times and so on and the others heres one from antony cytheris added a note she says she wants to provide the singers and mimes for the funeral procession friends of hers i imagine and these others i scanned the names of the senders they were all persons whose names appeared in hieronymuss reports these were the people he had visited whose trust he had sought to cultivate with an eye toward uncovering any threat they might pose to caesar did the fact that these people had sent condolences make them any more or less suspicious surely the person responsible for hieronymuss death would have sent condolences along with everyone else here was a note from caesars young grandnephew octavius who was about to turn seventeen he included an epigram in greek probably from a play though i didnt recognize it here was a note from the sculptor arcesilaus with whom many years ago i had shared cherries from the garden of lucullus it was his statue of venus that was to adorn the new temple built by caesar here was a note from a new playwright in town publilius syrus who paraphrased the last lines of enniuss epitaph for scipio from which cicero had recited earlier if any mortal may ascend to the heaven of immortals for you let the gods gate stand open and here upon a very heavy piece of parchment rimmed with an embossed border of a repeating lotus leaf pattern was a note from the queen of egypt to gordianus with fond remembrance of our meeting in alexandria i have discovered that the late hieronymus of massilia was a member of your household and it is to you i should send a message of condolence now you are here in rome and so am i we live in a very small world but the realm of the afterlife where i shall reign as isis in splendor is vast and eternal may our mutual friend be guided there swiftly to enjoy his reward i laid the notes amid the flowers piled upon the bier still in my hand was the wax writing tablet i untied the strings of the wooden cover panel the reusable wax surface contained not a message of condolence but two questions below each of which space had been left to scratch a reply i felt a bit like a pupil being handed a test by his tutor the name of the sender was not included but the tablet obviously came from calpurnia the first question read to whom have you spoken reply using initials only that was done easily enough the second question read have you discovered anything to indicate that he should not take part in tomorrows event send your reply at once in other words had i discovered anything to indicate an immediate danger to caesar i considered how to answer if something untoward occurred calpurnia might hold me accountable even if caesar was unharmed but i had discovered no clear and present danger to caesar no i wrote the word looked small and inadequate amid the blank space she had left for my reply i rose before daybreak the next morning the family appropriately garbed in our darkest clothing gathered to share a simple meal of mourning consisting of black bread with black beans had it been entirely up to me i would have given hieronymus the simplest possible ceremony but since cytheris with her connections in the performing world had volunteered to provide the traditional mourners musicians and mimes as well as some sturdy young slaves to carry the bier it would have been churlish to refuse her offer amazingly the entire troupe showed up on time it was a good thing bethesda had prepared extra food since they all expected to be fed an hour after daybreak our little procession set out we took a roundabout route walking up and down the streets of the palatine so as to pass by various houses where hieronymus had been an invited guest if the inhabitants were not awake before we passed by the screeching mourners and the musicians with their rattles flutes horns and bells surely roused them from bed pedestrians paused and curious onlookers peered from windows to watch the mime trying to guess whom he was impersonating the fellow had met hieronymus only once at one of cytheriss parties but he was remarkably gifted wearing one of hieronymuss favorite tunics he produced an uncanny simulation of my friends posture gait hand gestures facial expressions and even his laugh one passerby after watching the mime for a moment made a typical comment hieronymus the scapegoat is that him on the bier didnt know he was dead such recognition was a testament to the mimes talent and to the impression hieronymus had made on a surprising number of people i was amazed at how many men and women seemed to have known him walking at a slow gait with the rest of the family behind the musicians and the funeral bier i found myself staring at every stranger who paused to watch the procession wondering if hieronymuss murderer was among them eventually we descended the western slope of the palatine and crossed the sacred way at a point well away from the forum had hieronymus been a roman man of affairs a pass through the forum would have been mandatory but i decided to forego the area where huge crowds were already gathering for the gallic triumph we avoided the narrow noisome streets of the subura as well and instead ascended the slope of the esquiline through the carinae district cytheris had requested that the funeral cortege pass before the house of the beaks the performers knew who was paying them as we approached the house the moaning and shrieking and the drumming and fluting rose to an earsplitting crescendo at the same time the passable portion of the street narrowed considerably true to his word antony was holding an auction in front of the house to sell off some of pompeys possessions the auction had not yet begun but numerous objects had already been laid out for preview on makeshift tables there were odds and ends from silver table settings many of the pieces dented or black with tarnish a few items of jewelry presumably from the collection of pompeys wife cornelia had been put on display these included single earrings that had lost their mates necklaces that needed repair rings that had lost their stones and stones that had lost their rings there were piles of clothing pieces of furniture and a few bookcases stuffed with tattered scrolls behind me i heard whispering i turned to see that bethesda and diana were looking sidelong at the goods for auction and holding a hushed conference i shushed them but they seemed not to hear respect i finally said and they tore their eyes from the items on display looking a bit chagrined we can come back later and see whats left i heard diana whisper to her mother i had to admit that i myself was tempted to rummage through the shelves and see which of pompeys books were on offer see anything you like finder i can put it aside for you i turned to see antony nearby leaning nonchalantly against one of the display tables he reached for a voluminous green tunic with silver embroidery and held it up by the shoulders can this huge sack have been pompeys the great one indeed the old fellow had gotten as big as an elephant a hand snatched the tunic from him cytheris replaced it on the table and gave him a chiding look antony crossed his arms and pouted cant you see that hieronymus is passing by she said ah yes antony raised his arm in a mock salute hail and farewell scapegoat in elysium there shall be endless parties for you to crash the day was just beginning yet antony was already drunk or had he stayed up all night drinking and not yet gone to bed this was how he chose to mark the day of caesars gallic triumph in which he should have played a honored role as we passed beyond the constricted area of the auction and into the open street beyond i noticed a man leaning against a fig tree before he could step behind the tree i saw his face clearly and recognized him as thraso one of fulvias slaves realizing i had seen him he made no further effort to conceal himself and even gave me a slight smile and a nod something told me he was the man who had followed me after my meeting with cytheris did fulvia keep a watcher posted on the house of the beaks every hour of every day at length we passed though the esquiline gate beyond the old city walls sprawling over the gently sloping hillsides was the public necropolis the city of the dead the unmarked graves of slaves and the modest tombs of common citizens were crowded close together on a normal day there would have been other funerals taking place their flaming pyres scenting the necropolis with the smells of burning wood and flesh but on that day ours was the only one a little way off the road atop a small hill the pyre had been prepared it was in the very same location where two years ago we burned the body of rupas sister cassandra hieronymus was laid upon the pyre the keepers of the flame set about stoking the fire a few people had sent their condolences but only my family saw fit to actually attend the ceremony granted it was still early in the morning and on that day much else was happening but i wondered at the fickleness of those whom hieronymus had supposedly befriended after i left rome of course when all was said and done he had been a foreigner and an outsider with no blood connection to the city it was incumbent on me to say a few words even though only the family was present i recalled my first meeting with hieronymus in massilia when his intervention alone saved me from arrest his hospitality to me and to davus in that desperate besieged city his narrow escape from the fate that awaited him as the scapegoat and his journey with me to rome i reflected on the oscillating fortunes of his life he had been born a child of privilege in the highest echelon of massilian society but his fathers financial ruin and suicide had reduced the family to poverty and made them social outcasts his selection to act as the scapegoat promised him a brief period of the utmost luxury followed by a sacrificial death but it had not been so and the doomed man became a guest in my home and then curiously enough a soughtafter dinner companion to the elite of the city then came a reversal as ironic as all the other reversals in his peculiar life and with it the end while i spoke davus began to weep and diana hugged him mopsus androcles and rupa seemed distracted by the work of the fire starters they stared past me at the pyre awaiting the first tongues of flame bethesda stood stiff and unbending was she thinking of that other funeral for cassandra which she had been too ill to attend eco was still in syracuse but his wife menenia was here along with their goldenhaired twins titus and titania what can we learn from his death i looked from face to face amid the small gathering of those dearest to me only what we already know that fortune is changeable that the love of the gods is no more steadfast than the love of mortals that all who live must die but the words and acts of the living carry on after them the story of hieronymus is not yet over not while any one of us who remembers him still lives and not while at least one man continues to search for his killer and the true cause of his death i thought i bowed my head a little later i heard the crackling of wood smelled the odor of burning and felt the heat of the flames against my back farewell hieronymus i whispered ix what does one do for the rest of the day when the day begins with a funeral such days seem to take place outside normal time a dull gloom settles over the world after being made to confront mortality at its starkest one is left to face the ensuing hours stripped of the simple comforts of a workday routine normal thought is impossible a carefree laugh or an idle daydream are out of the question we have looked into the abyss then have stepped back from the precipice still alive yes but touched at our core by the chill of death for the rest of the day one must simply endure the gloom and wait for the setting of the sun and the eventual escape into sleep that will bring the day after but this was not a normal day for anyone in rome this was the day of the first of caesars four triumphs even before we reentered the city by the esquiline gate i could hear a dull roar from within the walls when every man woman and child in rome has cause to be out of doors at the same time all talking to one another at once the whole city hums like beehive such a buzzing seemed to emanate from every quarter of the city but it grew noticeably louder as we drew near the forum everyone was in the streets wearing their brightest holiday attire how my family stood out all garbed in black everyone was headed for the same place drawn toward the heart of the hubbub amid the contagious excitement bethesda and diana completely forgot their intention to return to the auction at the house of the beaks impatient to witness the spectacle mopsus and androcles repeatedly ran ahead and then circled back entreating the rest of us to hurry we reached the forum the doors of every temple stood open inviting the people to visit the gods and the gods to witness the days events garlands of flowers decorated every shrine and statue incense burned on every altar filling the air with sweet fragrance historians say that king romulus celebrated the first triumphal procession in rome after he slew acron king of the caeninenses in single combat while acrons body was still warm romulus cut down an oak tree and carved the trunk into the shape of a torso then he stripped the armor from acrons corpse and fastened it onto the effigy carrying the trophy over his shoulder and wearing a laurel crown he walked through the streets of rome while the citizens looked on in awe he ascended the capitoline at the temple of jupiter he made a solemn offering of acrons armor to the god in gratitude for romes triumph romuluss victory march was the origin and model for all subsequent triumphs over the centuries the pomp and ceremony of these celebrations grew ever more elaborate king tarquin the elder was the first to ride a chariot instead of walk and for the occasion he wore a goldembroidered robe in his day only kings could celebrate a triumph but with the coming of the republic the senate continued the tradition by granting triumphs to generals in recognition of a great military victory camillus who liberated the city when it was occupied by the gauls was the first to harness four white horses to his chariot in emulation of the quadriga statue atop jupiters temple with its white horses pulling the king of the gods in those days the face and arms of a triumphant general were painted red to match the statue of jupiter which was dyed with cinnabar on holidays what a strange sight that must have been i had witnessed a number of triumphs in my lifetime the first i could remember was when i was six years old and caesars granduncle marius paraded the captured numidian king jugurtha through the streets before executing him a few years later after repelling an invasion by germanic tribes marius celebrated another triumph in the year before i met cicero i saw sulla the dictator celebrate his victory over king mithradates of pontus cicero himself had been voted a triumph by the senate for the dubious achievement of putting down a band of brigands during his year as governor of cilicia but the civil war had postponed that event probably forever pompey had celebrated three triumphs in his career beginning at the age of twentyfour the last and most lavish of these was some fifteen years ago to mark his conquests in the east and his eradication of piracy in the mediterranean that triumph had been spread over two days of unprecedented pomp and largesse featuring not only processions but also huge public banquets and a distribution of money to the citizens and in a move that surprised everyone pompey had spared the intended victims proving that mercy could be exercised by a victorious roman general but of all the triumphs i had seen the celebration put on by caesar that day and in the days to come eclipsed them all when a man has lived in a place as long as i have lived in rome he learns a few of the citys secrets i happened to know the best vantage point for watching a triumph while other latecomers pressed toward the front of the crowd stood on tiptoes or gazed enviously at those who had arrived early to find seats among the stands i led the family to the temple of fortuna built by lucullus at the side of the temple an easy climb along the branch of an olive tree allowed access to a recessed marble shelf along one wall just deep enough and wide enough for my entire family to sit if we huddled close together even an old fellow like me could make the ascent with no trouble and my reward was a comfortable perch above the heads of the crowd below with a perfect view of the procession along the sacred way dressed as we were we must have looked like a flock of ravens roosting on the little outcrop of marble a roar erupted as bethesda was settling herself beside me we were just in time to see the beginning of the parade following tradition the procession began with the senators they were usually three hundred in number the body had been greatly depleted by the civil war but new appointments by caesar had replenished their ranks dressed in their togas with red borders the senators flowed down the sacred way like a river of white flecked with crimson for many of the newcomers this occasion marked their first public appearance i could pick out the new senators by how stiffly they adopted the politicians standard poseone hand clutching the folds of the toga the other raised to wave to the crowd these included either appropriately or ironically considering the occasion a number of gallic chieftains who had allied themselves with caesar not one of them sported long hair or a giant mustache they were as wellgroomed as their roman colleagues still keeping together in a group they were easy to spot by their stature the gauls towered above the sea of white cicero and brutus who were usually the type to put themselves out front marched near the back of the contingent they strode with their heads close together conversing as if more interested in each others company than in what was happening around them their attitude seemed almost deliberately disrespectful of the occasion what were those two talking about next in the procession came the white oxen that would be sacrificed on the altar before the temple of jupiter on the capitoline attended by the priests who would slaughter them bearing their ceremonial knives the oxen had gilded horns brightly colored fillets of twisted wool on their heads and garlands of flowers around their necks following were the camilli the specially chosen boys and girls who would attend the priests carrying the shallow libation bowls in which they would receive the blood and the organs of the sacrificed oxen other members of the priesthoods followed wearing long robes and mantles over their heads these included the keepers of the sibylline books the augurs responsible for divination the flamens devoted to various deities and the priests who maintained the calendar and reckoned sacred dates among this last group i saw a familiar face the whitehaired uncle of calpurnia gnaeus calpurnius whom i had seen briefly in the garden at her house clearly uncle gnaeus was in his element on this day a priest among priests taking part in a great occasion his expression was at once solemn and joyous he had that smug look one often sees on priests of knowing a little more than ordinary people and rather enjoying this superior knowledge now that i realized the priesthood to which he was attached it occurred to me that it might have been uncle gnaeus who piqued hieronymuss interest in the calendar and perhaps even assisted him with astronomical calculationsif indeed he had deigned to have anything to do with hieronymus i made a mental note to ask him about it if the opportunity arose next came a band of trumpeters blaring the ancient summons to arms as if a hostile enemy approached in fact behind the trumpeters an enemy did approachthe captive chiefs of the conquered gauls there were a great many of these prisoners the gauls were divided into scores of tribes and caesar had subdued them all these onceproud warriors were dressed in rags they shambled forward with their heads bowed chained to one another the crowed laughed and jeered and pelted them with rotten fruit at their head was vercingetorix he was as i had seen him in the tullianum nearly naked and covered with filth but his appearance was even more appalling under bright sunlight his eyes were hollow his lips were dry and cracked his hair and his beard were as tangled as a birds nest his fingernails were like claws so long they had begun to curl his shoes had disintegrated while he walked bits of shredded leather trailed from his ankles and each step left a bloody footprint on the paving stones confused and exhausted he suddenly came to a halt a soldier pacing alongside the prisoners like a herd dog ran up and struck him with a whip the crowd roared fight back gaul someone yelled show us what youre made of king of the gauls king of the cowards vercingetorix lurched forward and almost fell one of the other chieftains reached out to steady him the soldier struck the man across the face and sent him reeling back spectators jeered and clapped and jumped up and down with excitement the chastened prisoners quickened their pace a moment later they passed beyond my sight bethesda touched my arm and gave me a sympathetic look i realized i was gripping the edge of the shelf so firmly that my knuckles had turned white so this was the end of vercingetorix for him the day would end where it began back at the tullianum where he would be lowered into the pit and strangled in quick succession the other chieftains would meet the same fate there would be no lastminute rescue there would not be even a final show of defiance or pride or anger only submission and silence he had been broken to the ultimate degree that could still leave him breathing and able to walk caesars torturers were exquisitely skilled at obtaining exactly what they wanted from a victim and vercingetorix had proved to be no exception next came musicians and a troupe of mincing mimes who mocked the chieftains who had just passed the tension aroused in the crowd by the sight of their enemies melted into screams of laughter the mime who played vercingetorixrecognizable by a ludicrously oversized version of the warriors famous winged helmet which almost swallowed his headconfronted a mime meant to be caesar to judge by his glittering armor and red cape their mock swordfight attended by a great deal of buffoonery excited squeals of laughter from the children watching and ended when the caesar mime appeared to plunge his sword up the fundament of the vercingetorix mime who first gave a highpitched scream then cocked his head to one side and started rolling his hips as if he enjoyed the penetration the crowd loved this dancers musicians and a chorus of singers followed people clapped their hands and sang along to marching songs they had learned from their grandparents onward roman soldiers for jupiter you fight the way of rome is forward the cause of rome is right next came the spoils of war specially made wagons festooned with garlands were loaded with the captured armor of the enemy superbly crafted breastplates helmets and shields were mounted for display as were the most impressive weapons of the enemy including gleaming swords with elaborately decorated pommels fearsome axes and irontipped spears hewn from solid oak and carved with strange runes the grandest wagon was reserved for the armor and weapons of vercingetorix the crowd applauded the sight of his famous bronze helmet with massive feathered wings on either side there was also a display of his personal belongings including his signet ring for sealing documents his private drinking cup of silver and horn a fur cloak made from a bear he himself had killed and even a pair of his boots crafted of fine leather and tooled with intricate celtic designs more wagons rolled by carrying captured booty from every corner of gaul artfully displayed so that the crowd could take in each object as it slowly passed by there were silver goblets and pitchers and vases richly embroidered fabrics woven goods with patterns never before seen in rome magnificent garments made of fur elaborately wrought bronze lamps copper bracelets torques and armbands made of gold and clasps and pins and brooches set with gemstones of remarkable size and color there were bronze and stone statues crude by greek or roman standards depicting the strange gods who had failed to protect the gauls more wagons passed stuffed with coffers overflowing with gold and silver coins and bullion at the sight of so much lucre people gasped with excitement and their eyes glittered with greed word had spread that caesar intended to distribute a considerable portion of the captured wealth of gaul to the people of rome every citizen could expect to receive at least three hundred sesterces we would all profit from the pillaging of gaul as impressive as were these displays of bullion and jewels and metalwork the human booty of gaul far exceeded its other plundered wealth caesar had gone to war on borrowed money but from the sale of humans he had become phenomenally wealthy his enslavement of the population had taken place on a vast scale in his memoirs he boasted of selling over fifty thousand of the aduatuci tribe alone in celebration of this achievement a small sampling of the most striking of caesars captives was presented by the hundreds with hands chained behind their backs and constrained by the shackles on their ankles to take baby steps giant warriors with long red mustaches and naked youths with flowing locks shuffled past their heads hung in shame looking even more miserable a seemingly endless succession of beautiful girls draped in sheer veils were made to prance and twirl for the amusement of the crowd these slaves would be sold at a special auction the next day their display in the triumph was a preview for interested buyers those who could not afford such exquisite merchandise could at least stare at them with amazement and be proud that caesar had made slaves of such outstanding human specimens having satisfied the crowds prurient interest in death greed and lustshowing off the doomed and humiliated leaders then the magnificent spoils of war then an assortment of the flesh made available for purchase thanks to caesarthe procession continued with its educational component the crowd was shown a series of painted placards made of cloth stretched across wooden frames some of these placards mounted on poles were small enough to be held aloft by a single man but others were quite large and required several men to carry them placards proclaimed the name of every vanquished tribe and captured city accompanying these were models of the most famous cities and forts of the gauls crafted from wood and ivory more placards depicted notable features of the gallic landscapeits rivers and mountains forests and bays other placards were painted with vivid scenes of the war in which caesar was usually at the center mounted atop his white charger and wearing his red cape speakers recited vivid episodes from caesars memoirs extolling his own ingenuity and the bravery of the romans legions large models of siege towers rolled by along with actual battering rams catapults ballistae and other machines of conquest with signs identifying the battles in which they had been used in his campaign against the gauls caesar and his engineers had greatly advanced the science of war the many battles and sieges had allowed them to perfect new methods of inflicting mayhem and death and here were the artifacts of the unstoppable war machine that had crushed not only the gauls but also every one of caesars rivals next marching in single file came caesars private bodyguard as the multitude of armed lictors went by their numbers seemingly endless the crowd gradually ceased its raucous cheering and grew quiet long ago romulus had surrounded himself with lictors each bearing an ax to protect the person of the king and a bundle of rods to scourge anyone who defied him when the monarchy gave way to the republic the senate assigned lictors to the consuls and other magistrates to protect them during their term of office despite their perpetually grim expressions and the fearsome weapons they carried there was nothing alarming about the mere sight of a band of lictors one saw them every day crossing the forum what made the crowd uneasy that day i think was the sheer number of lictors never had i seen so many at one time not even the ancient kings had given themselves such a vast bodyguard even the most oblivious citizen was made to realize by the sight of so many lictors the unprecedented status that caesar had claimed for himself sobered by the parade of lictors the crowd broke into a deafening roar when caesar appeared i saw the four snowwhite horses first tossing their proud heads and splendid manes then caught a first glimpse of the golden ceremonial chariot caesar was wearing the traditional costume a tunic embroidered with palm leaves over which was draped a goldembroidered toga a wreath of laurel leaves covered his receding hairline in his right hand he held a laurel bough and in his left a scepter a slave stood behind him holding above caesars head a golden crown ornamented with jewels while i watched the slave leaned forward and whispered in caesars ear no doubt he was reciting the ancient formula remember you are mortal the reminder was not meant to humble the triumphant general but to avert the socalled evil eye the damage that could be inflicted by the gaze of the envious other talismans attached to the chariot served the same purposea tinkling bell a scourge and placed in a hidden spot underneath by the vestal virgins the phallic amulet called a fascinum the higher a man rose the more protection he required against the evil eye behind caesar i saw the troops that followed the foremost on horseback and behind them carrying military standards and spears adorned with laurel leaves a great multitude of the legionaries who had served in gaul just as caesar was passing before us i heard a cracking noise so sharp and loud that mopsus and androcles covered their ears the ceremonial chariot lurched to a halt caesar was thrown violently forward the slave holding the crown tumbled against him the white horses clattered their hooves against the paving stones tossed their heads and whinnied my heart pounded in my chest i felt an icy trickle down my spine what was happening the nearest lictors turned and ran back to the chariot some of the officers on horseback sharply reined their mounts but others bolted forward to see what was happening with looks of alarm caesar was hidden from sight by the bodyguards and officers swarming around him confusion spread among the spectators i felt a sinking sensation calpurnia was right after all i thought there was a plot on caesars lifeand now its playing out right before my eyes the hubbub around the chariot continued there were murmurs and cries of panic from the crowd at last an officer on horseback broke from the group he raised his arm and addressed the crowd be calm theres nothing to worry about caesar is unharmed the axle of the chariot broke thats all the triumph will continue as soon as another chariot can be brought the officer rode off to address another part of the crowd thats all the man says muttered someone in the crowd below me an evil omen for sure the crowd around caesar thinned he was standing near the stalled chariot i could see now that the carriage had collapsed and the wheels were askew aware that all eyes were on him caesar did his best to adopt a nonchalant expression but he looked a bit shaken nonetheless he tapped one foot fretfully it must be hard to maintain ones dignity after very nearly being thrown from a chariot the wait stretched on to pass the time the idle soldiers sang a marching song then shouted cheers for caesar as the waiting continued and the mood became more relaxed some of the rowdier soldiers took up a rude chant about their commander lock up your money roman bankers he took it all to spend in gaul lock up your women quivering gauls here caesar comes so bold so bald lock up your law books senators consuls hail dictator crown you later there were many more verses some of them mildly obscene the crowd responded with gales of laughter roman troops are famous for making fun of their commanders and the commanders are famous for enduring it caesar managed a crooked smile as the mood grew even more relaxed the chants grew more ribald including one about caesars youthful dalliance with king nicomedes of bithynia all the gauls did caesar conquer but nicomedes conquered him in gaul did caesar find his glory in caesar nico found a quim the crowd laughed even harder caesars face turned as red as if he had stained it with cinnabar like the triumphant generals of old he stepped onto the broken chariot faced the soldiers and raised his hands still clutching the laurel bough and scepter the men stopped chanting though they continued to chuckle and grin while caesar addressed them soldiers of rome i must protest these songs are amusing to be sure and your bravery has earned you the right to indulge in a bit of levity on this day even at caesars expense but these verses about the king of bithynia are unfair and unsubstantiated but not untrue shouted someone from the ranks farther back to a burst of laughter and untrue insisted caesar most assuredly untrue on my honor as a roman swear by numas balls shouted someone no swear by nicomedes staff shouted someone else the laughter was deafening caesars face turned even redder did he realize how absurd he looked at that moment a fiftytwoyearold man resplendent in his laurel crown and toga perched on a broken chariot attempting in vain to convince his soldiers that he had not been another mans catamite some thirty years ago the soldiers did not believe him nor for that matter did i during one of our conversations in alexandria caesar had spoken quite wistfully of his youthful relationship with the older king despite the fact that his enemies had needled him about it many times over the years it was not so much the affair itself that caused him embarrassment but the assumption that caesar had played the receptive role an unbecoming position for a roman male who is required always to dominate and penetrate whatever the true details of caesars intimacy with the king the story had acquired a life of its own the more caesar denied it the more it dogged him he was at last rescued from further ridicule by the arrival of the replacement chariot as he climbed from the broken carriage i could see the relief on his face the new chariot was an identical ceremonial model with the same distinctive round shape but not quite as splendidly gilded a group of priests and vestal virgins arrived to transfer the talismans for averting the evil eye among them i saw calpurnias uncle gnaeus who chanted under his breath and tinkled the bell as he fixed it to the new chariot his expression of solemn joy was gone replaced by a stern frown perhaps he was peeved at having to perform this sacred duty a second time meanwhile another priest attached the scourge to the chariot after flicking it in the air a few times then under the supervision of the virgo maxima a young camillus crawled under the broken carriage and removed the fascinum before it was placed under the new chariot some in the crowd caught a glimpse of the phallic amulet which is usually never seen and uttered cries of religious awe the broken carriage was removed from the roadway the white horses were attached to the new chariot the procession recommenced caesar disappeared from view and following him the multitude of soldiers marched by the men were in high spirits laughing and smiling the collapse of the axle had been a simple accident it seemed the outcome had been not only harmless but amusing as the disruption allowed for some flashes of candor amid the orchestrated pomp and ceremony the chants had been spontaneous and caesars blustering reaction to them had certainly been unrehearsed but i kept thinking of what the man below me had said about the breaking of the axle an evil omen for sure there would be more days of celebration to come and many more opportunities for the enemies of caesar to act x at the end of the long procession caesar left his chariot and ascended the capitoline hill on foot the winding path visible to those of us who remained below in the forum was flanked by forty elephants in bright regalia stationed on either side before the temple of jupiter he awaited word that vercingetorix and the other prisoners had been executed in the tullianum when a crier arrived bearing the news a cheer went up and the sacrifice of the white oxen to jupiter commenced various spoils of war were offered to the god caesar himself removed his laurel crown and placed it in the lap of jupiters statue inside the temple the new bronze statue of caesar opposite the temple was officially dedicated it depicted him in a victorious pose standing atop a map of the world the inscription bearing the long list of his titles and attributesconqueror of gaul arbiter of the pharaohs victor of the nile and so forthended with the declaration descendant of venus demigod a public banquet followed the entire forum became an openair dining room for the people of rome who brought their own plates or ate from skewers standing or leaning against walls or sitting on temple steps as darkness fell caesar descended from the capitoline his way was lit by the elephants that flanked the path holding aloft bronze torches attached to their trunks seen from the forum below the vision of those elephants and their flaming lamps with caesar in his goldembroidered toga threading his way between them was like a strange dream utterly unexpected awesome unforgettable this final flourish of the gallic triumph elicited cries of delight rapturous applause and sighs of wonder that night when i finally returned home a messenger was waiting at my door i allowed the man to follow me to my study where i opened and read the wax tablet he handed me it was unsigned but obviously from calpurnia egypt is next the day after tomorrow you must question the queen how you manage an audience with her is up to you but be quick as for the queens sister i have arranged for you to see her as i did with the gaul no need to reply now to this message but i will want to know what you discover tomorrow wipe these words from the wax after you read them i smoothed the wax with the edge of my hand and returned the blank tablet to the messenger he handed me a small wooden disk with the seal of calpurnias ring impressed in green waxthe same sort of pass that had gained my admittance to the tullianumand told me when and where i could visit the captive egyptian princess arsinoe the next day for an hour before i slept i perused hieronymuss scribblings about cleopatra and her less fortunate sister and so my thoughts that day began and ended with hieronymus no matter that caesar dominated the hours between the visiting queen of egypt had been installed in one of caesars villas outside the city located on a slope of the janiculum hill above the tiber the morning was so hot that i hired a litter in the forum boarium to carry me across the bridge and down the river road i did not want to appear before a living goddess red faced and covered with sweat the bearers balked at carrying rupa and rupa balked at the idea of being carried so he walked alongside the litter flexing his muscles thrusting out his jaw and peering this way and that trying to look like a bodyguard i imagine but appearing to me at least more like an inquisitive overgrown boy was there a possibility as calpurnia seemed to think that cleopatra was involved in hieronymuss murder and therefore in some plot against caesar to me it seemed more likely that calpurnia was confusing her dislike of the queen with a genuine cause for suspicion and yet cleopatra was among those whom hieronymus had visited also the normal scruples against killing another human being that restrain most people most of the time could not be presumed to apply to cleopatra what did death or murder mean to a woman who believed herself to be the future monarch of the afterlife to cleopatra the killing of a mere mortal like hieronymus would count for nothing even the murder of a demigodsuch as caesar since he claimed to be descended from venusmight be contemplated with equanimity if his death served to advance the interests of isiss incarnation on earth at any rate i was far from certain that cleopatra would grant me an audience despite the pretty words of her note of condolence my relationship with the queen in alexandria had not exactly been friendly but as she had done on previous occasions cleopatra surprised me after giving my name to the guard at the gate within a very short time a slave arrived to escort me into the queens presence rupa was instructed to stay behind the slave did not enter the house but instead conducted me through the terraced gardens roses were blooming scenting the warm air exquisite pieces of statuary were placed amid the flowers and shrubs we came upon the queen taking breakfast beneath the shade of a fig tree seated on a stone bench facing a spectacular view of the sparkling river and the city skyline beyond cleopatra wore a sleeveless gown of thin pleated linen suitable for the hot weather the line of the gown was simple but even the plainest garments of the very rich betray their exquisite workmanship to the observant eye her supple leather slippers were likewise unostentatious but very finely made her jewelry was a matching set of bracelets and a necklace and earrings all made of hammered silver with settings of smoky topaz and black chalcedony her dark hair was pulled back into a bun so that my first glimpse was of the profile as seen on her coins of a young woman with a very prominent nose and chin her twoyearold son was seated on the grass nearby dressed in a purple tunic and attended by cooing nursemaids the queens longtime bodyguard apollodorus was leaning against the trunk of the fig tree it was apollodorus who had delivered her to caesar rolled up in a carpet the handsome longlimbed sicilian perused me though narrowed eyes and gave me a nod of recognition the queen put aside a shallow dish piled with shelled almonds and dates gordianuscalledfinder i never thought to see you again i bowed deeply but did not prostrate myself we were on roman soil after all i hope the surprise is a welcome one your majesty for an answer she gave me only a thin smile then popped a date into her mouth to an old survivor like myself the queen still seemed hardly more than a girltwentythree i calculatedbut since i had first seen her emerging from that carpet to confront caesar she had matured considerably she had been voluptuous before motherhood had made her even more buxom her supreme selfconfidence no longer seemed quite so precocious the attribute seemed earned not merely inborn cleopatra was a fullfledged queen now the survivor of a bloody civil war the ruler of the oldest kingdom on earth and the living inheritor of alexander the great since her distant ancestor ptolemy had been alexanders general and successor she had also given birth to the son of a demigod if the boy caesarion was indeed caesars child it occurred to me that a triumphing general is traditionally accompanied by his sons on the joyous occasion grown sons ride behind him while sons in swaddling are carried in the chariot yet caesarion had not accompanied caesar during the gallic triumph but was it still possible the egyptian child would take part in caesars egyptian triumph you found your wife after all said cleopatra referring to the end of my stay in egypt yes your majesty i did were both back in rome now so she didnt drown in the nile as you feared apparently not cleopatra laughed are you being ironic gordianus or do you perhaps have a trace of the mystic in you your answer leaves open the possibility that she did drownyet still walks and why not the nile is a god it takes life but it also gives life perhaps the nile took both your wife and your life gordianuscalledfinderand then gave them both back to you in truth i had never been quite sure what happened that day i found bethesda after our long separation i had waded into the water seeking her or seeking oblivion if i could not find her i entered the nile and the nile entered me through my open mouth the water turned black then a woman emerged from the darkness and placed her mouth upon mine in a kiss and then i was lying on the sandy riverbank beside bethesda beneath a purple sky shot with streaks of aquamarine and vermilion i shivered at the memory then strove to shake it off the nile was far away the river below us was the tiber and this was rome a slight breeze stirred the fig tree dappled sunlight played across the queen her silver jewelry glittered flashes of light reflected off the baubles of topaz and chalcedony did you receive my message of condolence regarding your friend hieronymus i did your majesty is that why youve come she was making my task easy i merely needed to nod there was no need to explain that i had come as the spy of the wife of the man who had fathered her child im surprised that my friend hieronymus was able to make your majestys acquaintance let alone merit your condolences in death but why not your friend hieronymus and i had more in common than you may realize he was an outcast so was i during those wretched months that my brother held the throne and forced me to flee into the desert and hide among camel drivers and nomads hieronymus also spoke lovely greek and was very wellreadqualities not easy to find in this city despite the romans claim to be the guardians of greek culture honestly when that pompous fool cicero tried to quote a bit of aeschylus to me i had to laugh out loud his accent is so uncouth no wonder cicero detests you i thought your friend also had a wonderful sense of humor she said hieronymus made me laugh the way caesar used to do does caesar no longer make you laugh she frowned and ignored the question yes i was sorry to learn of hieronymuss demise he was murdered was he not that is correct but that detail was not entered into the death registry she snorted i dont rely on public records for my information gordianuscalledfinder and neither do you what have you learned about your friends death the killer remains unknown but not for long im sure youre such a clever fellow have you come to seek my help or do you perhaps think im responsible by horus there seems to be no crime too great or too small but some roman will accuse me of it actually there is a question you might help me to answer your majesty ask the previous day it had occurred to me that hieronymuss apparent interest in calendars might have been fostered by calpurnias uncle gnaeus in his capacity as a priest but because hieronymus had visited cleopatra and her scholars were assisting caesar with his new calendar it also occurred to me that someone in the queens household might have instructed hieronymus in astronomical matters i had brought his notes with me i pulled them from my satchel and began to hand them to cleopatra but apollodorus intervened he stepped forward and snatched the scraps of parchment from me he sniffed them and ran his hands over them systematically front and back as if testing them for poison toxins which can kill though contact with the skin have existed at least since the time of medea satisfied that the notes were harmless he passed them to the queen who perused them with a curious expression i was wondering if your majesty might recognize these no ive never seen them before but clearly these computations have something to do with the movements of the moon and stars and the reckoning of days did these come from hieronymus they were among his personal papers your majesty she handed the documents back to me what a clever fellow he was i was wondering your majesty if hieronymus might have consulted with your scholars about the new calendar caesar plans to introduce absolutely not you seem very certain at caesars request i have instructed all those involved in devising the new calendar to speak to no one caesar is very insistent that there should be no public knowledge of the details before he makes his official announcement then hieronymus must have made these calculations with instruction from someone else yes he certainly had no precise knowledge about my new calendar your calendar i thought the revised calendar was caesars brainchild she raised an eyebrow and nodded so it is to be sure its my scholars whove performed the necessary computations but if it pleases him let caesar take credit for the calendar caesar should take credit for all his creations she looked at the little boy on the grass i followed her gaze such a handsome lad i said though to me the child looked no different from any other he looks like his father said cleopatra everyone says so the child had a fuller head of hair than caesar but perhaps i could see a resemblance around the cheekbones and the chin he has his mothers eyes i said and then feeling daring i asked will he be taking part in the triumph tomorrow she looked at me for a long moment before she answered thats a delicate question the whole matter of the egyptian triumph is delicate the role that should be played by myself and by our son has been discussed at some length discussed by herself and caesar she surely meant despite her careful passive construction those discussions had not been pleasant to judge by the way apollodorus rolled his eyes not realizing i was watching him in the endso it has been explained to mea roman triumph is a purely indigenous celebration she said a roman triumph has everything to do with military conquest and nothing to do with diplomacy or dynasty the egyptian triumph will celebrate caesars victory over my renegade brother ptolemy who refused to make peace with me and who died in the nile for his treachery the egyptian triumph is about roman arms not about caesars personal connection to egypt but you were his ally in the war he fought on your behalf she smiled without mirth he fought to make peace in egypt because our civil strife was disrupting the supply of egyptian grain to rome so your majesty will not be appearing in the triumph according to caesar a triumph is performed by romans for romans even the most distinguished persons of foreign birth can have no place in the procession except as captives i nodded they say your sister arsinoe will be paraded in chains i dont think any female of royal blood has ever been marched as a captive in a triumph before so some innovation is possible in a triumph after all cleopatra said drily arsinoe dared to raise troops against me she deserves her fate but shes cant be more than nineteen she was even younger then nonetheless she and her confederate ganymedes will both be paraded as captives and put to death ganymedes her tutor a eunuch most household attendants of the ptolemies were castrated of course after arsinoe put to death her general achillas ganymedes took over command of her troops such as they were i shook my head caesars grand captives will be a teenaged girl and a eunuch im not sure what the roman people will make of that i suspect they would have been far more impressed by the sight of you your majesty perhaps riding in state atop a giant sphinx she smiled pleased by the suggestion what an imagination you have gordianuscalledfinder alas caesar did not possess such a vision the triumph will celebrate his victories in egypt although i was his collaborator and the beneficiary of those victories i shall not take part and neither shall caesars son apollodorus shuddered and shook his head reflexively i had broached a topic that must have caused much heated debate between caesar and the queen perhaps in this very spot in the garden cleopatra scrutinized me for a long moment she was displeased that i had brought up the subject yet she was pleased that i had called the boy caesars son without equivocation it has been decided that caesarion will not ride in the chariot with his father tomorrow she finally said cleopatra was doing her best to hide her disappointment but it seemed clear that one of the purposes of her diplomatic visit to romeperhaps the main purposehad been to persuade caesar to acknowledge her son she had hoped to make the egyptian triumph a celebration of herself and caesarion it was easy enough to follow her reasoning why shouldnt the romans be pleased that the heir to the egyptian throne was a boy of roman blood the son of their own ruler should they not be impressed that caesar had coupled with a woman who was the living heir of alexander the great the latest representative of the worlds most venerable dynasty and the incarnation of a goddess i could also imagine why caesar had balked at the idea an open declaration of dynastic intentions was still too radical for the roman people to accept and an egyptian queen of greek blood however regal was still a foreigner and an unsuitable mother for the children of a roman noble it might also be that caesar had other plans for the future and intended for someone other than caesarion to be his heir for whatever reason caesar had refused to acknowledge caesarion despite the opportunity presented by his egyptian triumph cleopatra had been thwarted what now were her feelings toward caesar it occurred to me that caesar dead might now be more valuable to her than caesar alive the assassination of caesar would plunge rome into confusion perhaps even another civil war amid the wreckage and the chaos might egypt drive out the roman garrisons and cast off the roman yoke weighed against demands of state and her own ambition any personal feelings she still harbored for caesar might count for nothing cleopatra came from a long line of coldblooded crocodiles who were notorious for devouring their own her older sister berenice had usurped their father when he regained the upper hand their father put berenice to death cleopatra had not shed a tear when her brother perished in their civil war she now seemed to be looking forward to the impending humiliation and execution of her younger sister with grim satisfaction was cleopatra capable of plotting caesars death did she have sufficient motive to do so i looked into her eyes and shivered despite the stifling heat of the day xi unlike vercingetorix arsinoe and ganymedes were not being held in the tullianum but if all went according to plan they would both end up there tomorrow to be dispatched by the executioner their quarters were located in the vast new complex housing pompeys theater on the field of mars calpurnias messenger had given me instructions on how to find the place but wending our way among the shops and arcades and meeting halls rupa and i became completely turned around and found ourselves in the theater itself with its countless semicircular tiers of seats surmounted by a temple to venus on the stage a play was being rehearsed no doubt one of the many scheduled to be performed as part of the ongoing festival that would follow caesars fourth and final triumph dramas comedies athletic competitions chariot races in the newly expanded circus maximus and mock battles on the training grounds of the field of marsall this and much more had been announced after so many months of deprivation and dread caesar intended to give the people of rome a prolonged series of holidays full of feasting and every kind of public entertainment i regained my bearings and found the dedicated stairwell that led up up up to the topmost floor of the theater rupa and i came to a heavily guarded door where i showed my pass i expected rupa to be kept behind but perhaps carelessly the guards allowed us both to enter i never knew such a place existeda private suite located behind the highest tier of seats and just beneath the temple of venus perhaps pompey had built this aerie to be his personal hideaway but its seclusion and limited access made it an ideal place to lock someone away its proximity to the field of mars where caesars troops would muster for the triumph would allow quick and secure delivery of the prisoners to their place in the procession the spacious room was sparsely but tastefully appointed lit by windows along one wall there was even a balcony with an expansive view of rooftops below and the winding tiber and rolling hills beyond the balcony was much too high to offer any means of escape apparently the princess had been allowed at least one servant while in captivity an unusually tall plainfaced ladyinwaiting appeared wearing a shimmering robe with wide sleeves and a khat headdress that gathered her hair into a kind of pillow behind her head she wore no makeup except for a few lines of kohl around her eyes who are you she said sharply eyeing me with disdain and rupa with something closer to alarm perhaps i looked sufficiently resolute and rupa sufficiently brawny to pass for public executioners youve nothing to fear from us i said are you romans yes then my princess can expect nothing good from you i assure you we wish her no harm my name is gordianus this is my son rupa who does not speak i presume you come from caesar no one gets past those guards unless theyre sent by the kingkiller himself obviously her view of caesar differed from that of cleopatra he was not the peacemaker who restored the throne to its rightful occupant but the man who had murdered one monarch young ptolemy and was about to murder another but thats not quite true is it i said youve had at least one visitor who was not sent by caesar who gained admittance on his own initiative to satisfy his curiosity and to show his sympathy i imagine i speak of my friend hieronymus her whole bearing changed the stiff shoulders relaxed the deep wrinkles of her face recombined into a smile her eyes sparkled she clapped her bony hands together ah hieronymus your friend you say then tell me how is that charming fellow i was struck by two things the household of arsinoe was ignorant of hieronymuss death and the lady before me was infatuated with him why not she looked to be about the same age as hieronymus indeed with her long neck and narrow homely features she might have been his female counterpart im afraid thats why ive come i have some bad news for your mistress she responded with a guttural very unladylike laugh bad news on this of all days the day before what news could possibly qualify as bad considering the fate that hangs over the princess she shook her head and glowered at mesetting the wrinkles into a new configurationthen suddenly raised her eyebrows and gasped oh no you dont mean that something has happened to hieronymus not dear hieronymus of all people im afraid so but i would prefer to deliver the news directly to your mistress or perhaps to her minister ganymedes even as i said the name so did someone else who had just entered the room over the ladys shoulder stepping toward us through a doorway i saw the princess arsinoe ganymedes she was saying ganymedes whos that at the door what do they want i stared at the ladyinwaiting i blinked in an instant the illusion created by my own assumptions melted away i looked at the bony hands the flesh was soft and had never known physical labor but they were not a womans hands i looked at the throat and detected the telltale bump like a tiny apple i looked at the plain wrinkled face and wondered how i could have been mistaken the lady was no lady it was ganymedes the eunuch who stood before me arsinoe was allowed no servants after all she and her minister were the only inhabitants of the suite no wonder the princess was so simply attired since there was no one to dress her her long shimmering robe was not much more elaborate than that worn by ganymedes having no one to wash and set her hair she concealed it inside a striped nemes headdress made of stiff cloth which covered her brow and hung in lappets on either side framing her plump round face short and voluptuously built like her sister arsinoe had put on weight in captivity ganymedes did not look starved either a potbelly interrupted the otherwise straight line of his robe except for the nervous glint in their eyes they looked like two bored houseguests who had nothing to do but eat all day perhaps because neither was truly a warrior it had not been thought necessary to reduce them by torture and starvation to a wretched state of near collapse or perhaps the lack of illtreatment was on account of their genders no princess had ever been paraded to her death in rome before and i do not think a eunuch had ever been paraded in a triumph either the organizer of the triumph perhaps caesar himself may have considered the two of them sufficiently unmanly to begin with so that no further degradation was deemed necessary to make them ready to be displayed for the scorn and contempt of the roman people ganymedes who are these men arsinoe drew alongside the much taller eunuch and stared up at me ganymedes delicately wiped a tear from one eye careful not to smear the kohl friends of hieronymus he whispered his voice choked with emotion dear hieronymus my name is gordianus my son who does not speak is rupa i said your majesty i added and even made a slight bow elbowing rupa to do the same i could see she appreciated the gesture however perfunctory you may be the last mortals on earth to call me that and acknowledge me with a bow she said wistfully not true your majesty said ganymedes overcoming his tears i shall address you by your title and bow before you until the very end of course you will ganymedes said the princess not counting you i mean whats this about hieronymus then im very sorry to tell you that hes dead she drew a breath how he was murdered stabbed to death when five nights ago on the palatine hill she shook her head is there no end to the wickedness of this world poor hieronymus i decided that her plumpness was not unbecoming she was prettier than her older sister and the softness of her features made it more difficult to imagine her as a rapacious crocodile behind me i heard ganymedes weeping i understand that hieronymus managed to visit you here your majesty on more than one occasion yes he was one of the very few visitors weve received other than our jailors he sent a message first explaining where he came from and who he was and saying he was curious to meet me the curiosity was mutual how so your majesty she walked toward the balcony and stepped up to the parapet i followed at a respectful distance massilia and alexandria both were founded by greeks near the mouth of a great river she said both became centers of culture learning and commerce alexandria is by far the greater city of course but massilia is older hieronymus was chosen to serve as scapegoat for massilia a sacrificial victim to bear away the suffering that might otherwise consume the whole citysuffering inflicted by caesar am i not the scapegoat of alexandria caesar came caesar imposed his will upon us by brute force the city surrendered and now there must be a victim to display to the bloodthirsty people of rome i am that victim she gazed at the city below vile place vile people and to think that a ptolemy should be paraded before them like a criminal and put to death like a dog the gods will have much to answer for when i join them in elysium she turned around and transfixed me with a smoldering gaze she seemed much older than her nineteen years and projected a presence beyond her stature but hieronymus eluded the fates he was the scapegoat who escaped we were hoping that some of his good fortune would rub off on useh ganymedes alas his luck must have rubbed off on something if he was murdered as you say how well did you know him i briefly explained my relationship with hieronymus and gave a reason for coming since his death ive been reading his personal papers he said very kind things about you in truth he had written very little about arsinoe yet he had visited her more than once why had he come back to see her if there was nothing of interest to report hieronymus had not even mentioned ganymedes which seemed odd given the eunuchs obvious infatuation with him had hieronymus been so embarrassed by ganymedes attentions that he kept silent about them even in his private journal i thought not hieronymus was not easily flustered and not easily silenced if he had considered the eunuchs infatuation absurd he would have said so it was not like hieronymus to miss a chance to ridicule someone but such was not the case this left a curious possibility that the attraction had been mutual i tended to think of hieronymus as a voluptuary with an appetite for beautiful boys or girls such were the pleasures that had been offered to him when he was the pampered scapegoat plainfaced ganymedes hardly seemed a likely recipient for his passions but there is nothing as unpredictable as the attraction of one mortal for another what did i know about hieronymuss most secret longings or about ganymedes for that matter no doubt there was more to the eunuch than met the eye i thoughtand winced at the cutting pun hieronymus could have extracted from that observation ganymedes had risen to a position of power in one of the most competitive royal courts in the world amid the most elegant and sophisticated surroundings imaginable his learning and wit had served him well he had lived the sort of life that hieronymus should have lived had fortune not turned against him when he was young then fortune turned against ganymedes at a time when hieronymus seemed to be living a charmed existence each might have served as a mirror image to the other could that have been the root of a mutual attraction if hieronymus had indeed felt drawn to the eunuch it was perhaps not surprising that no mention of the fact appeared in his papers he would not have told calpurnia considering it none of her business and i suspected he would have kept such feelings out of his personal journal which was more a repository for scathing observations and witty wordplay than for heartfelt confessions i turned to the tearful ganymedes i looked long and hard into his glittering eyes and knew that my supposition was right hieronymus hieronymus will you never cease to surprise me even in death you throw up new puzzles had arsinoe known had she allowed the two of them privacy when hieronymus came to visit his visits could not have lasted long the guards would not have allowed it it might be that the intimacy of the scapegoat and the eunuch extended to no more than a touch or a fleeting kiss some relationships are all the more intense for being limited by tragic circumstance wait a moment arsinoe walked up to me and stared at my face i knew you looked familiar and i now i know why you were with caesar in alexandria do you deny it its true your majesty i was in the royal palace when caesar was there but i dont recall that you and i ever met i remember you nonetheless i recognize your face you were among the romans in the grand reception hall that daythe morning after cleopatra smuggled herself into caesars presence and into his bed caesar gathered all the royal siblings and proceeded to apportion our fathers kingdom among us cleopatra and ptolemy were to share the throne in alexandria i was to be given cyprus of course that arrangement lasted as long as a drop of water in the egyptian desert she looked me up and down who are you one of caesars officers certainly not one of his political advisers or one of those merchants who came to egypt with caesar to pillage our grain supply i didnt arrive in alexandria with caesar your majesty i traveled to egypt on personal business i happened to find myself in the royal palace only because how well do you know my sister i came to a halt in midspeech my mouth open arsinoe locked her eyes on mine no ready answer for that question eh when did you last see cleopatra the crocodile had stirred within her the menacing edge in her voice sent a chill up my spine never mind that it came from a plump teenaged girl who at that moment was a helpless captive this was the conquered enemy whom caesar considered formidable enough to be paraded in his triumph and dangerous enough to be put to death if i lied she would know i saw your sister this morning your majesty ive just come from visiting her as a matter of fact did she send you to spy on me is she afraid i might yet escape i would if i could and then id go straight to the villa where caesar is keeping her like his personal whore and strangle her with my bare hands she clutched the air with her plump little fingers the illusion of the crocodile vanished she was a furious very frightened child she bolted toward me i grabbed her wrists unhand me you filthy roman she shouted ganymedes started toward us but rupa blocked his way by the ka of my own father i swear that i am not your sisters spy i said the oath seemed to calm her but i kept a firm grip on her wrists then what business did you have with her we talked about hieronymus hieronymus visited cleopatra as well yes but he was not your enemy and neither am i arsinoe tore herself from my grip and turned her face away she trembled and heaved then steadied herself tell caesar or my sister or whatever person sent you that the rightful queen of egypt is ready to confront her fate she shall do so with her head held high and her shoulders back she will not weep she will not tremble she will not tear her hair and beg for mercy from the roman mob nor will she throw herself from this balconythough i suspect that was caesars hope when he placed us in these quarters that i would kill myself and save him the shame of executing a woman she turned to face me sufficiently composed to stare into my eyes again my fate is in the hands of the gods but so is caesars whether he knows it or not his crimes against me are an offense to the gods who never forget and seldom forgive caesar will not escape their judgment when the time comes his punishment will be terrible mark my words the door flew open one of the guards stepped into the room whats the shouting about my visitors will leave now arsinoe turned her back on me and returned to the balcony ganymedes with his nose in the air strode past me to join her as we made our way down the many flights of steps i pondered the threat posed to caesar and to cleopatra by arsinoe she would certainly kill them both if she could the death of cleopatra would clear the way for arsinoe to seize control in alexandria presuming she could return there alive the death of caesar could lead to chaos in rome and to full independence for egypt yet what means did arsinoe possess to bring about anyones death or to engineer her own escape did she have confederates in the city ready to act on her behalf might there be individuals in the entourage of cleopatra who were secretly loyal to arsinoe these were idle speculations i had no reason to think that arsinoe could possibly devise a double assassination and a lastminute escape and yet hieronymus had asserted that the threat to caesar came from an unforeseen quarter skipping ahead of me down the steps rupa kept turning back attempting to tell me something by using his personal system of gestures and facial expressions i frowned unable to understand him what are you trying to say rupa here stop for a moment so that i can see you clearly he was fairly bursting with emotion he made a shapely gesture to indicate arsinoe that was clear enough but the feeling he was trying to express was so grand it defeated his vocabulary i smiled sadly yes rupa i agree in her own way arsinoe is magnificent he nodded vigorously i saw a bemused look on his face and tears in his eyes oh rupa i thought its no good for a fellow like you to have such feelings for a princessespecially a princess wholl be dead tomorrow xii so you managed to endure them both in one day said calpurnia which sister struck you as the more wicked the last rays of sunlight from the windows illuminated the room with a soft glow it was not quite the hour of lighting lamps caesars wife and her haruspex sat side by side while rupa and i remained standing porsennas yellow costume was the brightest thing in the room it seemed to absorb all the ambient light and cast it back again wicked is not necessarily a word i would use to describe either of them i said theyre not as simple as that nonsense dont tell me youve been taken in by the socalled ptolemaic mystique finderthis absurd notion they put about regarding their supposed divinity i raised an eyebrow the new statue of caesar on the capitoline declares him to be a demigod i believe descending from a goddess and incarnating a goddess are two different things she said ill have to take your word for that calpurnia ignored my sardonic tone all this fuss they make about the many generations of their royal line going back to the first ptolemy when did he reign two hundred and fifty years ago my own family descends from king numa and he lived more than six hundred years ago the ptolemies are mere upstarts compared to the calpurnii isnt that right uncle gnaeus she nodded to the whitehaired priest who had just stepped into the room gnaeus calpurnius gave his niece a kiss on the forehead he snapped his fingers a slave brought a chair uncle gnaeus sat down with a grunt that is correct my dear our line is far more ancient than that of the ptolemies and what did any ptolemy ever achieve compared to the accomplishments of our ancestor numa numa established the order of the vestal virgins he set the dates for the holy festivals and sacrifices prescribed the rituals for venerating the gods and established the priesthoods for performing these sacred duties through the mediation of his beloved the nymph egeria he communed with great jupiter himself what did any ptolemy ever do except build a lighthouse which you obviously have never seen you pompous fool i thought the pharos lighthouse was the tallest building on earth with a beacon visible across a vast expanse of land and sea a true wonder of the world it was likely to still be standing long after numas decrepit reckoning of days was long forgotten supplanted by caesars new calendarwhich had been devised by scholars from the library established by the ptolemies i refrained from saying any of this uncle gnaeuss boasting was merely a distraction calpurnia wanted to know whether cleopatra or arsinoe posed any threat to her husband hieronymuss notes on his visits were worthless in this regard i had to rely on my own observations and instincts its my belief that the queen of egypt came to rome with one goal in mind to persuade caesar to acknowledge her son as his offspring something he will never do said calpurnia for one thing the child isnt caesars porsenna has studied the matter is that right i said the haruspex smiled i managed to obtain a few strands of the boys hair never mind how i performed a sacrifice when the hair and the entrails of the sacrificial beast were burned the pattern of the smoke clearly indicated that the child has no roman blood whatsoever the science of haruspicy is never wrong in such matters its probably the whelp of that lackey of hers the one who toted her about inside a carpet said uncle gnaeus any woman who would resort to such an indignity would probably allow even a servant to have his way with her i doubted this if there was anything cleopatra took seriously it was the dignity of her person for a woman who considered herself a goddess copulation was a serious and sacred matter is caesar aware of the results of this divination calpurnia made a face caesar does not always accord sufficient importance to the ancient ways of knowing he observes the rituals but he lacks true understanding uncle gnaeus shook his head enough uncle said calpurnia sharply now is not the time to discuss caesars deficiencies in matters of religious insight let the finder finish his report as i said the queen came to rome hoping to establish her sons legitimacy she hoped tomorrows triumph might celebrate that event her intentions have been thwarted i think she misunderstood how the roman people might react to such an announcement i think she misunderstood the true nature of a roman triumph caesar corrected her mistaken viewpoints what does she intend to do now said calpurnia cleopatra is a pragmatic womanpragmatic enough to hide in a carpet if it serves her purpose but shes also tremendously willful i wouldnt want to disappoint her i certainly wouldnt want to be her enemy and is caesar having disappointed her now her enemy i dont know perhaps you should ask caesar what he thinks im much more certain about the feelings of princess arsinoe i have no doubt that she would do away with both caesar and cleopatra if she possibly could but how could she do such a thing does arsinoe have allies in the city with your network of agents youre more likely to know that than i am calpurnia but what is your feeling about these egyptians finder what does your instinct tell you what a question from the once hardheaded calpurnia had she entirely abandoned cold logic and deduction in favor of divination and intuition i sighed here is what i think cleopatra almost certainly could kill caesar if she wanted to but she probably doesnt arsinoe would kill him without hesitation if she could but she almost certainly cant then caesar will survive tomorrows triumph calpurnia looked at her uncle then at the haruspex and finally at me she was demanding reassurance i have no reason to think otherwise i said and prayed to fortuna that i was right rupa and i crossed the palatine at twilight the streets were almost deserted for many people this had been a day to recover from the festivities of the gallic triumph and to rest up for the next days egyptian triumph the only people stirring were slaves on ladders outside houses setting torches in sconces to light the doorways and illuminate patches of the street we rounded a corner my house came into sight a little way down the winding street a small company of armed lictors was standing outside my door rupa gripped my arm to alert me yes i see them rupa lictors at the doornever a good sign i tried to keep my tone light but my heart was pounding the nearer we drew the bigger the lictors appeared every one of them was half a head taller than rupa and considerably broader veritable giants they were quite possibly gauls i thought next to whom the romans are a little people gallic senators gallic lictorsone of the chief complaints one heard against caesar nowadays was that he had infested the city with gauls he had exterminated the gauls who opposed himvercingetorix was presumably the lastand those who remained were loyal only to caesar or were they everywhere i looked now i sought threats to caesar could even his own lictors be trusted but more to the point what were the dictators bodyguards doing outside my house as i approached the door never breaking my stride one of the men stepped forward to block my way remove yourself i said trying to keep my voice from quavering my name is gordianus i am a citizen this is my house the man nodded he looked at rupa warily but stepped aside even as i reached toward the door it swung open there before me framed by the doorway stood caesar himself i had not seen him facetoface since our time together in alexandria where he had grown sleek and tan beneath the egyptian sun now he looked thin and pale almost as pale as his toga and there was more gray than i remembered amid the scant hair on his head for just an instant i saw his face unguarded the mouth was turned down the eyes slightly vacant the brow furrowed he looked like a man with many worries in the next instant he saw me and his face was transformed by a beaming smile gordianus just the man ive come to see they told me you were out and didnt know when to expect you i waited for a while anyway how blessedly peaceful it is in your quaint little garden i was about to leavebut here you are yes here i am and whos that behind you ah yes rupa i remember him from alexandria those were memorable days dictator caesar laughed no need to address me formally gordianus weve been through too much together nonetheless i am a roman citizen and you are my dictator the office is a venerable one is it not our ancestors created the dictatorship so that strong men could save the state in times of peril the short list of citizens who have held the office is most distinguished his smile twisted at one corner the dictatorship was tarnished by sulla to be sure hopefully i can burnish it to its former luster in the hearts of the roman people well now that youre here perhaps you might invite me to rest a bit longer in your garden of course dictator if your lictors will allow me to pass in fact no one was really blocking my way but at a nod from caesar the lictors all drew back caesar himself stepped aside to make way for me bethesda diana and davus were standing in the vestibule mopsus and androcles lurked behind them everyone looked stiff and uncomfortable apparently they had just bade caesar a formal farewell as i passed allowing caesar to precede me diana whispered in my ear what in hades does he want with you papa i answered her with a shrug since i had no idea unless of course he was aware of his wifes activities and was about to tell me what he thought of my investigations on calpurnias behalf lamps had been lit in the house but the garden was growing dark i told rupa to fetch some lights but caesar shook his head no need for that gordianus i dont mind the darkness if you dont its rather pleasant like this smelling the jasmine and the roses in the warm twilight we sat in chairs facing each other in the gloaming i found it difficult to make out his expression perhaps he liked it that way it occurred to me that he must grow weary of being constantly scrutinized by others eager to read his thoughts and intentions and then my heart gave a lurch and my mouth turned dry for it suddenly struck me that caesar might have come with news of meto had something occurred in spain where the scattered remnants of caesars enemies were said to be gathering in hopes of mounting yet another challenge to his supremacy i pressed my hand to my chest as if i could still my racing heart surely caesar would not have greeted me with such a beaming smile if he had come to deliver bad news i must have muttered metos name aloud for caesar smiled againi could see that even in the gloamingand said the name back to me metoah yes dear meto how i miss that boy and so must you of course hes hardly a boy anymore is he he turned thirtythree in quinctilis i said my mouth dry thats right do you know i think i forgot to send him a greeting a bit late to do so now even belatedly i wish he could be here now but his service in spain is too important i need men there i can trust and your sons devotion to me is truly a gift from the gods i relaxed he had not come with bad news after all im surprised you can spare a thought for such trivialities as birthdays you must have so many things on your mind indeed i do which is why i completely forgot about you yesterday gordianus but why should you have thought of me at all dictator he clucked his tongue to chide me for my insistent formality because of meto of course your son should have been with me yesterday to celebrate the gallic triumph he was with me everywhere in gaul at practically every moment he was always there always ready and eager to receive my dictation sometimes in the middle of the night i cleared my throat meto and i had never explicitly discussed his relationship with caesar but i had long assumed that my son had been receptive to more than caesars dictation their intimacy was none of my business of course and at any rate it seemed to have cooled with the passing years as such affairs almost invariably do as for their relationship as author and amanuensis according to meto he himself had written a large part of caesars memoirs of the gallic campaign taking his imperators raw notes and fleshing them into prose with caesar merely amending and approving a final version before it was copied and disseminated caesars expression became impossible to read in the darkness but the politicians bluffness fell away from his voice his tone was wistful can i speak to you candidly gordianus to call meto my loyal secretary is to make light of what hes meant to me over the years meto has fought for me spied for me even risked his life for me not once but many times he was there with me in gaul and at pharsalus and in alexandria he was with me in asia and africa he should have been here for all my triumphs instead hes on a vital mission in spain which is only further testament to his unflagging loyalty caesar sighed meto has seen me at my bestand at my worst over the years ive learned to trust him to take off my armor in his presence so to speaknot an easy thing for an old warrior to do hes as close to me as a sonyet in no way have i ever presumed that i could take the place of his father meto is not of my blood i adopted him and yet you are as surely metos father as if you had made him yourself i envy you that gordianushaving a son especially a son like meto does caesar have no son i thought of cleopatra he was silent for a long moment that is a complicated question ironic isnt it one man produces a sonat long lastyet hesitates to call himself the boys father while another man adopts a boy not of his blood and becomes a father in every way that matters to gods and mortals caesarion was his son thenor so he believed caesar breathed deeply do you know this is the first time ive come to a complete halt in well i have no idea how long its been i cant relax like this in my own garden servants are always hovering supplicants are in the vestibule senators are at the door my wife is forever fussing and fretting over me your wife did he know of calpurnias fears and the divinations of her haruspex calpurnia the old dear no man could have asked for a better wife in wartime while i was away from the city calpurnia did everything necessary to see that my home was well run she watched the other women of rome with a careful eye she made sure that any conspiracies against me came to nothing there is the world of the bloody battlefield and there is the world of the hearth and the loom and any warespecially a civil warmust be waged in both arenas calpurnia was my commander for the home front and she conducted herself brilliantly but now that the peace has been won he shook his head shes become a different woman she fills her head with superstitious nonsense she pesters me with dreams and portents i wonder if its not the influence of that crazy uncle of hers gnaeus calpurnius is always in the house these days the old fellows a priest and takes himself very seriouslyso proud of his descent from king numa i nodded and considered the irony that the master of the world should be so unaware of events in his own household from what i had observed uncle gnaeus disapproved of his nieces obsession with the superstitious nonsense fostered by the haruspex porsenna of whom caesar appeared to know nothing he laughed softly but why am i telling you all this it must be that gift you possess gift your special giftthe power to compel the truth from others cicero warned me about it a long time ago catilina said the same thingdo you remember himand meto confirmed it the gift of gordianusthat must be whats loosened my tongue or perhaps perhaps im just tired the moon had risen above the roofline its blue light gleamed on caesars bald pate he turned his face upward into the moonbeam and i saw that his eyes were closed he fell silent and breathed so deeply that i thought he might have fallen asleep until he sighed and spoke again ah but ive strayed from the point of my visit i wanted to give you this he produced a thin square token carved from bone i took it from him squinting under the moonlight i saw there was a letter and a number painted on it whats this dictator what does f xii refer to its the section reserved for you and your family in the viewing stands im told the seats are quite good theyre rather high up but thats what you want for a spectacle isnt it a bit of distance you wouldnt want to be too close youre not the sort to make a rush at the captives as they pass or to bait the exotic animals just show that token to the usher and hell lead you and your family to your seats theyre reserved for tomorrows triumph and for the next two triumphs as well this is for metos sake because meto cannot be here yes ill honor metos father and family in his stead but you deserve a seat on your own merits gordianus at least for tomorrows egyptian triumph you were there in alexandria after all you witnessed history in the making now you can witness the celebration i began to object but caesar silenced me with a gesture no dont thank me youve earned this favor gordianus its the least i can do he stood and straightened his toga i meant to ask did you manage to find good seats for the gallic triumph on your own as a matter of fact yes theres a little ledge at luculluss temple of fortuna that affords a good view of the route ah yes he nodded then his face grew long if you were at the temple of fortuna then you must have seen the unexpected interruption when the axle of the chariot broke yes but i thought you handled it very well the episode provided a bit of relief from all that grandiose formality your soldiers must love you very much indeed to think they can tease you so mercilessly yes he said his tone a bit cool a funny thing thatthe axle breaking when we examined it later it appeared almost as if someone had tampered with it tampered caused it to break intentionally it looked to me as if the wood had been partially sawed through but it was impossible to be sure the way the wood had splintered sabotage but who would have done such a thing he shook his head it was probably a simple accident after all and now i really must be going calpurnia becomes especially worried if im not home after dark i accompanied him through the house and into the vestibule where the family still gathered suspending their normal activities as long as the dictator was among us diana nudged davus who nudged mopsus who gave his little brother a kick androcles rushed to open the door and caesar his thoughts now elsewhere departed without another word the family gathered around me while they peppered me with questions i peered at the token in the palm of my hand i would have preferred to stay at home the next day avoiding the egyptian triumph altogether but now that caesar himself had gone to the effort to present this gift to me i could hardly be absent on the morrow i would have an excellent view of the princess arsinoe and her minister ganymedes as they took their final walk on this earth xiii bethesda was quite pleased when i showed her the token caesar had given me and explained what it was good for such signs of favor from a social superior always seemed to matter to her far more than they did to me perhaps because of her origins she had been born a foreigner and a slave now she was a roman matron and proud of it despite clinging to certain foreign ways my own attitude toward the elite and the favors they could bestow was more problematical though born a roman i had realized from an early age that i would never become one of the socalled nobilitas those who are known for having won public office i never expected even to be allowed into the homes of such people now after a lifetime of serving them i was still not the sort of person they cared to invite to dinner romes noble families are few in number and they closely guard their privileges though outsiders of exceptional ability and ambition can occasionally join their ranks cicero was the prime example of such a new man the first of the tullius family to be elected to office and set upon the course of honor in the quest to become consul for a year many of those nobles who had thought me barely worthy to serve them and certainly unworthy of their friendship were dead now while i a humble citizen of no distinction was still alive for those aristocrats who had survived what did the course of honor or nobility itself mean now with one man installed in a permanent position at the apex of power and what did this token of favor from the dictator mean to me i pondered this question as i examined the little piece of carved bone in my hand by the soft morning light in my vestibule i was already dressed in a toga with a simple breakfast of farina and stewed fruit in my belly menenia had just arrived with the twins bethesda insisted that the family set out early to claim our seats even though i tried to explain to her that the whole point of possessing such a token was to allow us to show up whenever we wanted since the seats were reserved for us i think she wanted us to be seated early so that we might be conspicuously visible to the arriving throng ensconced in our place of privilege with my family surrounding me including mopsus and androcles well need them to fetch food and drinks bethesda had insisted i set out descending from the palatine directly to the forum which was already more crowded than i would have expected at such an early hour the stands with our seats were located near the end of the route facing the foot of the capitoline hill and high enough to afford a panoramic view directly across from us were the most prestigious of the viewing stands upon which curtained boxes with plush appointments had been erected for the comfort of important dignitaries those seats were still empty beyond and between the dignitaries boxes i could clearly see the trail that led up the slope of the capitoline to the carcer later if i cared to i could probably watch arsinoe and ganymedes being led to the very door of the prison behind which they would meet their deaths in the pit of the tullianum while we waited for the procession to begin i thought about what caesar had said regarding his accident during the gallic triumph if someone had deliberately severed the axle of his chariot did the sabotage support calpurnias suspicions of a plot against caesar it was hard to see how such an accident could hardly have been counted on to injure caesar much less kill him perhaps it had been devised merely to embarrass him but by whom and for what reason renegade gauls in the city might have wished to mar his victory over vercingetorix but how could they have obtained access to the sacred chariot caesars veterans had felt free to tease him with lewd verses might some of them have been so bold as to sever the axle to play a practical joke on him had caesar only imagined signs of tampering and if so what did such imaginings indicate about his state of mind or was caesars speculation about sabotage a ruse he had seemed to reveal this concern in a genuinely unguarded moment but did such a man ever speak without premeditation it might be that caesar was disseminating this rumor of sabotage with the intent of dispelling any notion that the accident was an evil omen the result of divine displeasure rather than human intervention husband my thoughts were interrupted by bethesda her voice was hushed her tone excited husband is that her i blinked and looked about while i had been staring abstractedly into empty space the stands around me had filled up below us every spot along the route was taken the forum was a sea of spectators bisected by the broad path left open for the triumph over there bethesda said insistently in the special seats is that really her i gazed across the way the boxes for dignitaries had also filled up amid the gaudily attired ambassadors and emissaries and visiting heads of states sat a lone female resplendent in a purple gown and a golden diadem the walls and high parapet of the box kept her from being seen by the crowd around and below her but because our seats were directly across from the box we had a clear view of her yes i said that is cleopatra the queen had arrived without fanfare no one in the crowd seemed to be aware of her presence barred by caesar from taking part in the triumph she was merely another spectator amid the thousands present that day bethesda squinted tilted her head to one side and frowned shes not as pretty as i had imagined i looked sidelong at my wife and smiled shes certainly no rival to you it was the right thing to say bethesda could not suppress a smile of triumph and it was true in her heyday bethesda had been much more beautiful than cleopatra and when i looked at bethesda now did i not still see the girl she had been a deafening cheer rang out the procession had begun first came the senators and magistrates again i saw cicero and brutus strolling side by side talking to each other and ignoring the crowd as if nothing of importance was taking place the trumpeters followed their fanfare had a distinctly egyptian flourish to it and charged the air with anticipation what wonders from the distant nile would caesar present to the people of rome the spoils of gaul had been vast and impressive but the items from egypt were of another order of magnificence they were not booty strictly speaking since caesar had not conquered the country his role had been to end the civil war between the royal siblings and install one of them on the throne many of the items displayed that day were gifts from queen cleopatra to demonstrate her gratitude to caesar and to the people of rome for taking her side in the war with her siblings there was a towering black obelisk etched with hieroglyphs and decorated with gold bosses in the shape of lotus blossoms there were bronze statues of various gods including an incarnation of the nile represented as an old man surrounded by river nymphs with creatures of the deep entwined in his flowing beard there was a grand procession of magnificent sphinxes one after another carved from granite and marble the wagons bearing these massive objects were pulled not by beasts but by exoticlooking slaves from the teeming markets of alexandria these slaves came from faroff lands whose very names excited wondernubia arabia ethiopiaand the sight of their dark gleaming bodies excited almost as much comment as the treasures they were pulling the crowd gasped with amazement at the appearance of the final sphinx it was being pulled by the longest train of slaves and at a distance appeared to loom far larger than the other sphinxes this was a trick of the eye it was not the sphinx but the slaves who were out of scale these were the miniature people called pygmies who were said to dwell in a land of dense forests near the source of the nile the incongruity of the sight appealed to the roman sense of humor and prompted gales of laughter a replica of the sarcophagus of alexander was presented along with several statues of the conqueror the founding of alexandria had been his most enduring accomplishment and his burial place was one of the principle shrines of the city there followed a visual catalog of the municipal achievements of alexanders successors the ptolemies a remarkably detailed model of alexandria carved from ivory depicted the walls of the city the great library and museum the royal palace and the theater the broad avenues decorated with ancient monuments and the jetties embracing the great harbor caesar had very nearly met his death in that harbor when his ship was sunk in a naval engagement and he was forced to swim ashore a towering model of the pharos lighthouse rolled by complete with a fiery beacon at the summit this was followed by a model of the gigantic temple of serapis and a statue of the god whom the greek ptolemies had established as the chief deity of egypt serapis resembled bearded zeus or jupiter sitting on a throne and wielding a scepter but on his head he wore a grain basket for a crown and at his feet crouched a threeheaded dog meant to be cerberus but rendered in a style more akin to the jackalheaded egyptian god anubis an exotic bestiary followed featuring the fabled creatures of the nile and of regions even more remote muzzled crocodiles were paraded fitted with harnesses attached to leashes held by teams of beastmasters the creatures were so strong and unpredictable it seemed to take all the keepers strength to prevent them from lurching into the crowd images were displayed of the hippos potamios the famous nile riverhorse and of the rhinokeros which looks like a leathery overgrown boar brandishing a single monstrous tusk the beast show ended with a genuine crowdpleaser a troupe of pygmies rode by mounted on the gigantic flightless birds the greeks call strouthokamelos camelsparrows famed for their magnificent feathers and absurdly long necks they are said to hide their heads in the sand when frightened there followed an exhibit celebrating the various crops grown along the nile the great granary of the mediterranean thanks to its yearly inundation the pretty egyptian maidens in pleated linen gowns carrying sheaves of grain were not as exciting as crocodiles on leashes but they nonetheless garnered the crowds applause and cheers rang out for caesar when a crier announced that a distribution of free grain to the citizenry would follow the triumph the tone of the procession grew more martial as placards were exhibited showing incidents of the war caesar had promised to tell the full story in his continuing memoirs but that volume had not yet been published there were scenes of the battles in the harbor of alexandria in which the skies were filled with flaming missiles hurled from shipboard ballistae other scenes illustrated the long siege of the royal palace by the egyptians who attempted for months to penetrate caesars defenses or else to cut off his water supply and failed at every turn there were several scenes of the final decisive battle on the banks of the nile where young king ptolemys royal barge was capsized by fleeing egyptian soldiers the kings remains were never found nonetheless a number of his personal effects had been retrieved from the nile including some of his ceremonial weapons and armor and these magnificent pieces were displayed as trophies other scenes depicted the deaths of caesars chief enemies in egypt king ptolemys lord chamberlain the eunuch pothinus had been forced by caesar to drink poison for conspiring against him the man had died before my eyes cursing both cleopatra and her brother the placard illustrating his death portrayed him with exaggerated breasts and hips which he had not possessed and feminine makeup which he had not worn pothinus was reduced to a roman caricature of a eunuch the crowd laughed and cheered as they were shown the picture of him writhing in agony at caesars feet the death cup still clutched in his hand another placard showed the death of achillas the egyptian general who had mounted the siege against caesar it was arsinoe who eventually executed him for treachery achillas was a name of infamy in rome for he had been among the murderers of pompey delivering the blow that struck the great ones head from his shoulders even before he could step ashore in egypt curiously there was no placard to illustrate pompeys demise or the subsequent presentation of pompeys head as a gift from king ptolemy to caesar pompeys defeat at pharsalus his desperate flight to egypt and his ignominious death were not to figure in any of caesars triumphs whether for fear of hubris or in deference to the lingering sentimental attachment many romans felt for pompey caesar did not seize the occasion to gloat over his rivals desecrated corpse others besides me noticed this omission and clearly not everyone felt sentimental about the great one a man called out where is pompeys head show us the head some joined in this call but many others groaned shushed their neighbors and booed a ripple of discord passed through the crowd sparking restlessness and loosening tongues and while youre at it show us cleopatra someone yelled yes wheres cleopatra lets have a look at the little nymph who has caesar so hot and bothered show us the queen show us the queen there should at least be a picture of her preferably naked the wags in the crowd remained unaware that cleopatra was among them seated amid the dignitaries i looked across the way and saw that she had moved back from the parapet as if to further conceal herself her face showed no expression the inevitable chants followed speculating on the activities of caesar and the egyptian queen during their long boat trip up the nile many in the crowd already knew these lewd ditties and joined in at once clapping in unison as they recited one verse after another men share such bits of doggerel in the forum wives bring them home from the marketplace soon even children know them by heart for all his earthly glory caesar was powerless to stop the spread of a rude joke or an awful pun at his expense i gazed at cleopatra across the way her face remained impassive but even at such a distance i could see that her cheeks had reddened a bit the queen was not used to being mocked then abruptly the ditties fell silent and the clapping stopped as if conjured by the will of the crowd cleopatra suddenly loomed before themor rather her image loomed for approaching on the path mounted on a platform and pulled by a team of nubian slaves was a breathtaking statue of her it was larger than life and appeared to be made of solid gold though it was probably gilded bronze the gilt shimmered brightly beneath the sun flashes of golden light dazzled my eyes the queen was portrayed not in the outlandish garb of the pharaohs which the ptolemies had appropriated when they assumed the rule of egypt but in elegant greek dress wearing a simple diadem on her brow the statues face had a stern almost mannish quality perhaps the sculptor made his subject look older and plainer than she was so as to emphasize her qualities as a ruler of men rather than an object of male desire the face with its sparkling lapis eyes and elusive smile nonetheless projected a powerful feminine allure one could see why a man like caesar had been captivated by such a woman i drew a sharp breath caesars inclusion of the statuea gift from the queen herselfwas a considerable gamble who could predict the crowds reaction or did he brazenly parade the statue for just that reason as a means to gauge the temper of the roman mob if the statue had been a piece of captured booty and cleopatra a vanquished enemy there would have been no controversy but caesars war in egypt had affirmed cleopatras claim to the throne so the appearance of the statue seemed to be a celebration of the queen herself here for all to see in golden splendor was the exotic creature who claimed to have borne caesars son and whom many thought was encouraging caesars royal ambitions if the crowd found the statue offensive they might break into a fullscale riot i looked around me wondering if our high seats would prove to be our salvation or our doom would we remain above the rampaging mob or be driven up and over the top to fall to our deaths there was also the possibility that the crowd might realize that cleopatra was present and vent their fury against her i gazed at the queen in her box across the way our eyes met cleopatra nodded slightly to show that she recognized me she saw the alarm on my face and her own expression grew apprehensive she raised her eyebrows slightly she frowned but the reaction of the crowd was far from violent a hush fell over the throng there were no jeers no cries of outrage not even any ribald jests the golden statue seemed to cast a spell people gazed up in wonder as it passed before them across the way i saw the queen of egypt smile she turned to confer with someone in her entourage she turned back and began to stand did she intend to draw attention to herself to make her presence known to the crowd before that could happen the moment passed the mood of the crowd abruptly changed the air rang with jeers shouts and taunts for immediately following cleopatras statue came the procession of egyptian prisoners from the golden glory of the queen the crowds attention was drawn to the abject misery and wretchedness of her vanquished enemies cleopatra sat her smile vanished the few surviving officers of ptolemys army were paraded before us in chains and rags and tattered egyptian headdresses a few of these were eunuchs and the crowd peered at their nearnaked bodies curiously looking for distinguishing characteristics to be sure the eunuchs were not as hirsute as some of their compatriots but their bodies had none of the voluptuousness of women perhaps because they had been fed so poorly all the prisoners looked gaunt and bony nor did the eunuchs express emotions differently from their fellows the eunuchs and the other exhibited the same range of reactions a few stared back defiantly at the crowd some hid their faces and many trembled and wept broken by their humiliation and the approach of death the last but one of the prisoners was ganymedes i had last seen him in a shimmering widesleeved gown and a khat headdress with kohl outlining his eyes now he wore only a filthy loincloth and his undressed hair hung in tendrils around his pale winkled face his chains robbed him of any pretense of dignity the shackles on his ankles and wrists forced him to bow and take shambling steps he was barefoot and his feet were bleeding someone in the crowd hurled a piece of fruita green unripe figand struck him between his legs ganymedes flinched but did not cry out others hurled more bits of fruit and even stones always aiming for the same spot they were mocking him with blows that would have made an intact man scream with agony but served only to humiliate the eunuch by drawing attention to the part of his anatomy that had been amputated following ganymedes at a distance which clearly set her apart was arsinoe the princess too was barefoot and dressed in rags baring more of her arms and legs than was considered decent for a highborn woman in public inviting the prurient inspection of the crowd the manner in which she was chained seemed calculated to emphasize her debasement her ankles were connected by a short chain and her hands were bound tightly behind her forcing her to mince forward with her shoulders back and her breasts thrust forward but the position also allowed her to hold her chin high her face was clearly visible and her expression was surprisingly composed she looked neither fearful nor defiant there was neither hatred nor panic in her eyes her face was sphinxlike without emotion as if her thoughts were completely elsewhere far removed from the degradation to which her body was being subjected as arsinoe slowly drew nearer below us i looked from her face to that of cleopatra they appeared to wear the same expression despite the difference in their situations cleopatra watched her sisters march to oblivion without showing the least sign of regret or rejoicing arsinoe moved toward her fate with no more expression than if she were gazing at the slow steady unending flow of the nile of what stuff were these ptolemies made what had caesar presumed would happen when he decided to parade a helpless young woman in his triumph he had presided over the rape of many cities he had seen the merciless reaction of his soldiers to the sight of tender females stripped of all protection did he think the roman mob would react in the same way at the sight of arsinoe in chains allowing a desire to revel in her debasement to overcome any impulse toward pity i would not have been surprised to see the onlookers pelt arsinoe with fruit cruelly aiming for her breasts and taunt her with lascivious remarks and perhaps even reach out to strip the remaining rags from her body forcing her to walk naked to her death but that was not what happened instead the crowd which had been so eager to jeer at the captured military men and ministers of state fell silent as arsinoe passed by foulmouthed men became speechless in the sudden quiet the soft clinking of arsinoes chains was the only sound then a murmur passed through the crowd i could not make out any words only a low grumbling but its tone was clear this was not right what we were seeing was improper indecent wrongperhaps an affront to the gods the murmur grew louder the crowd more uneasy it was rupa who took action he was sitting next to me when he stood i thought he was getting up for some other reasonto go relieve himself or simply to stretch his legs but something about the urgency of his movements caught my eye as he stepped over the spectators and made his way to the nearest aisle others saw him as well and took notice there was a resoluteness about his demeanor that drew attention especially amid that uncertain suddenly anxious crowd he reached the bottom of the stands and then looming taller than everyone around him he elbowed his way through the standing spectators he stepped onto the triumphal path he ran toward arsinoe there were gasps of surprise and cries of apprehension rupa was so much larger than the princess and his movements so determined that some people must have thought he was about to attack her instead before he reached arsinoe he turned and raised his hands waving them in the air to catch the crowds attention at the same time he opened his mouth and made a strange braying noise a plaintive cry that echoed around the forum his behavior excited cries from the crowd who is that big fellow awfully goodlooking and what does he want hes trying to say something cant you see he must be mute makes a loud noise though whats he up to looks big enough to do whatever he wants with the little princess caesars lictors preceding the triumphal chariot were not far behind arsinoe seeing rupa the foremost among them broke from the processional file and rushed toward him my heart lurched in my chest like everyone else in the stands i jumped to my feet amid the sudden tumult a few voices rang out more clearly than the rest the lictors will protect the princess from what the mute wont hurt her he means to escape with her escape where shes heading straight for the tullianum along with her pet eunuch this last comment referred to ganymedes realizing that something was transpiring behind him he had turned with a look of alarm on his wrinkled face he was frantically shambling back toward arsinoe as if he could somehow protect her despite his shackles but arsinoe was in no danger with every eye fixed upon him rupa turned toward the princess for a moment he loomed over her then he dropped to his knees and bowed deeply with a great flourish of his outspread arms he touched his lips to one of her bare feet throughout the entire episode arsinoes expression or lack of expression had remained unchanged but when rupas lips touched her big toe a smile lit her face transforming it completely it was like the face of alexandross venus of milosserene and aloof sublime and majestic the reaction of the crowd was instantaneous and overwhelming like a thunderbolt from jupiter people raised their hands in the air giddy with excitement they laughed squealed roared shouted some of them mimicked the plaintive noise that rupa had made not mocking but paying homage i looked at cleopatra across the way had she ever met rupa i thought not and there was nothing to indicate that she realized who was kissing her sisters toe while all rome watched but on her face was a frown as dark as her sisters smile was dazzling ganymedes reaching arsinoe and seeing that she was in no danger fell to his knees beside rupa awkwardly because of his chains he bowed deeply and kissed the princesss other foot the crowd became even more jubilant the lictors yanked rupa to his feet i held my breath fearing the worst but the lictors only threw him back into the crowd where he sent spectators tumbling in all directions like a boulder hurled from a catapult the lictors reached for ganymedes flailing against his chains the eunuch managed to thwart them and remained on his knees abasing himself before arsinoe spare the princess someone shouted yes spare the princess cried others the cry quickly became a chant spare the princess spare the princess spare the princess but what about the eunuch shouted someone kill the eunuch came the answer followed by a roar of laughter this was added to the chant spare the princess kill the eunuch spare the princess kill the eunuch ganymedes was finally pulled to his feet and shoved forward with blows from the lictors rods to speed him along on his face was a look of both triumph and despair arsinoe her head held high the smile still lighting her face resumed her mincing forward progress the princess passed from view and the long file of lictors paraded before us but still the chanting continued spare the princess kill the eunuch spare the princess kill the eunuch by some magic of group mentality the crowd spontaneously split the chant between the two sides of the triumphal pathway those opposite the capitoline hill shouted spare the princess those on the other side responded kill the eunuch the two sides competed to see which could yell the loudest in the middle of this deafening crossfire came caesar in his triumphal chariot the chants roared back and forth like volleys from rival catapults spare the princess kill the eunuch spare the princess kill the eunuch caesar looked vexed and confused and doing a poor job of trying not to show it much as he had appeared in the gallic triumph when his soldiers teased him for his youthful liaison with nicomedes i saw him lift his gaze to the dignitaries box and exchange a look of consternation with cleopatra these two should have been sharing the afterglow of the crowds reaction to the golden statue of the queen instead they were being subjected to acclamations for arsinoe up in the stands we were all on our feet and my own family members had joined in the chant fortunately we were on the side calling to spare the princess i doubt that my wife daughter or daughterinlaw would have joined in calling for the death of ganymedes but davus might have done so and the bloodthirsty slave boys would not have hesitated i myself remained silent as if trying to make sense of the crowds fervor caesar ran his eyes slowly over the reviewing stands looking from face to face he saw my family chanting with the rest he saw me standing silent for an instant his eyes met mine he had no way of knowing that it was my adopted son who had set off the crowds reaction the triumphal chariot eventually passed from view followed by rank upon rank of veterans from the egyptian campaign infected by the crowds enthusiasm even the soldiers took up the deafening chant spare the princess kill the eunuch spare the princess kill the eunuch oh rupa i whispered to myself what have you done xiv rupa what were you thinking you could be dead right now the lictors could have dragged you up to the carcer along with those wretched egyptians and dropped you into the tullianum and we would never have seen you alive again the sun had set the moon had risen occasionally here in my lamplit garden i could hear snatches of music and revelry from the forum where the feast that followed the triumph still continued with endless egyptian delicacies on offer but i was in no mood to eat and drink every time i thought of the terrible risk rupa had taken that day my blood ran cold but papa objected diana what did rupa do that was against the law im pretty sure that a citizen is not allowed to interrupt the progress of a triumph he didnt interrupt it he took part in it people do that sort of thing all the time they run onto the path to taunt the prisoners or to get a closer look at some trophy or to plant a kiss on a soldiers cheek weve all seen such things unless caesar has passed some law against kissing a girls toe rupa embarrassed the dictator im pretty sure thats not against the law either papa caesars not a king we dont live and breathe at his pleasure not yet i muttered and nothing untoward happened the lictors came running they threw rupa off the pathway he disappeared back into the crowd and that was the end of it apparently caesar doesnt even know it was rupa who saved the princess saved the princess i uttered the statement incredulously amazed at the enormity of it arsinoe had been spared and rupa was the man most responsible for saving her a foreignborn freedman does not go about thwarting the will of a roman dictator and nullifying a death sentence ordered by the roman state such things do not happen but apparently they do papa it was a mad act i think it was terribly heroic insisted diana so do i said bethesda the two of them converged on rupa and planted kisses on his cheeks he had been frowning and staring at the ground while i lectured him but now he smiled and hugged himself all my admonishments were for nothing besides said diana rupa acted purely on impulse there was nothing deliberate about what he did he couldnt possibly foresee the outcome of his actions i was not so sure about this in earlier days rupa and his sister cassandra had been street performers in alexandria he was not an actor just a mime playing burly silent parts nevertheless he must have learned how to anticipate and manipulate the reactions of an audience bowing before arsinoe and kissing her foot had played adroitly upon the crowds sentiment and the result had been just what rupa desired at the conclusion of his triumph caesar had bowed to the will of the people criers announced that the princess would be spared and sent into exile while ganymedes and the other captives were duly executed i gazed hard into rupas unblinking eyes his wits were on the simple side of average that was certain but because he was a mute and brawny as well had i underestimated his native intelligence he might not possess the verbal capabilities of a cicero able to sway a jury with wellchosen words yet he had proven himself able to rouse a multitude with a single bold perfectly timed gesture besides papa you wanted to see arsinoe spared just like everyone else admit it the poor girl bethesda shook her head an egyptian princess at the mercy of those roman brutesterrible more than ever since our return from egypt my wife loved to play the part of the cosmopolitan alexandrian appalled by roman barbarity poor girl i threw up my hands arsinoe is a conniving royal brat responsible for hundreds maybe thousands of deaths back in egypt she put one of her own generals to death shes a viper no less than her sister even so caesar had no business threatening to execute the child just to show off insisted bethesda it did him no credit it made him look bad parading that poor girl in chains i had to agree and when all was said and done i was not sorry that rupa had acted on his impulse let us speak no more of the matter i said and let there be no boasting about this to the other women in the market do you understand you may praise rupa all you like here in the privacy of our home but youre not to whisper a word of this to anyone else if caesar were to find out yes papa said diana what might the big bad dictator do lets pray that we dont find out caesar had survived his first two triumphs the only damage he had sustained was to his dignity and that was minor the teasing from his soldiers only served to endear him to them all the more while his clemency to arsinoe made him appear not weak and vacillating but decisive and wise and won him even greater favor with the crowd if not from the gauls or the egyptians or from disaffected antony or ambitious fulvia or from loveaddled cicero or glib brutus then from what quarter came the threat to caesar that hieronymus had hinted at rather than feeling relieved that the dictator had survived his first two triumphs unscathed i felt more anxious than before what danger might caesar face in the next two triumphs first would come the celebration of his recent victory in asia where king pharnaces of pontus had taken advantage of the civil strife between pompey and caesar to reclaim the kingdom of his father the great mithradates pharnacess ruthlessness had been shocking at least to roman sensibilities in conquering city after city he not only plundered the property of a great many roman citizens but also made a practice of castrating all the youngest and bestlooking males including roman citizens before selling them into slavery news of these atrocities caused outrage throughout the roman world but pharnacess successes had gone unchecked until caesar himself after settling affairs in egypt moved to reassert roman rule in the region pharnaces was routed at the battle of zela fled for his life and was eventually captured and killed by one of his own treacherous underlings with pharnaces dead and largely unmourned it was hard to imagine who might choose the asian triumph as a venue to try to kill caesar but hadnt hieronymus speculated that danger would come from an unexpected quarter late that night looking through hieronymuss writings for links to the upcoming asian triumph i came across a passage in his private journal i had not read before and what of this speculation one hears about young gaius octavius caesars grandnephew antony repeats the tale with great zest and for all i know the rumor originated with him if indeed it is only a rumor i realize that antony is piqued at caesar but why should he spread salacious gossip about octavius unless he thinks caesar intends to make the boy his heir and antony imagines that he himself deserves that honor even though he has no blood tie to the dictator or could the tale be true i decided to see the boy with my own eyes to judge whether he might tempt a man like caesar the meeting was easy to arrange octavius is a bright lad easily bored always looking for distraction he was quite fascinated by me is he a match for caesar well i suppose hes pretty enough though not to my taste his face is too broad and his eyes are too sharpi should think a man would more likely cut himself on those eyes rather than become lost in them but who knows what caesar may have gotten up to with the boy octavius is ambitious and ambitious boys are pliable caesar bestrides the world like the colossus of rhodes but even giants long for lost youth and i must admit the boy has a certain engaging freshness to him as antony says caesar gets to play nicomedes and octavius gets to play caesar or is antony making it all up antony loves to gossip more than any man ive ever met and cytheris constantly eggs him on this tale was new to me clearly hieronymus was of two minds whether to give it credence on its face the idea that caesar might seek sexual favors from a younger man did not strike me as unlikely i believed that caesar had sought such a relationship with meto though i did not know and had never asked to know the exact details i had reason to believe that caesar had done the same with young king ptolemy in egypt with whom he shared a most intimate relationship before they turned irrevocably against each other and caesar finally chose to side and share his bed with ptolemys sister cleopatra and for all i knew caesar might have shared such an intimacy with brutus that might explain the enduring but strangely volatile nature of their relationship i had never met gaius octavius i tried to recall what i knew about him he was caesars grandnephew being the grandson of one of caesars sisters he had been born in the year that cicero served as consul and put down the socalled conspiracy of catilina that would make octavius about sixteen now his father had been a new man like cicero the first of the family to become a senator the elder gaius octavius was a banker and financier and began his political career by distributing bribes to gangs on election days his chief claim to fame had been tracking down a band of runaway slaves made up of the last remnants of the longdestroyed armies of spartacus and of catilina for as long as thirteen years some of these fugitives had remained at large living by their wits and eluding capture in the vicinity of thurii the elder octavius managed to round up these ragged runaways and put them all to death thus he established his credentials as a serious proponent of law and order and seemed destined for a particularly ruthless political career but after a year as provincial governor of macedonia he died of a sudden illness if i calculated correctly in my head young gaius octavius was only four years old when his father died perhaps that explained his devotion to the women who raised him when his grandmother died octavius at the age of twelve delivered a eulogy at her funeral that was said to have wrested tears from caesar himself oratorical skills aside the boy had never seen battle and was still too young to have made a mark on the world but he must be very near the age of manhood i thought and when i began to read again hieronymus confirmed this on the other hand octavius is now sixteen which is the very age that some older men find most appealing will caesar turn fickle the day the calf becomes a bull octavius will turn seventeen and don his manly toga on the twentythird day of september or as the romans calculate the date nine days before the kalends of october octavius boasted that his granduncle may allow him to appear in one of his triumphs to celebrate his ascent to manhood never mind that the boy fought in none of the foreign campaigns i doubt he has ever even picked up a sword caesar intends to parade him as a conqueror presenting him formally to the roman peopleand that reinforces the idea that caesar may be grooming young octavius to become his heir because of the family tie because caesar sees something extraordinary in the boy or because his catamite deserves a generous reward i whistled aloud at hieronymuss boldness at least he had confined such reckless speculations to his private journal rather than putting them in his reports to calpurnia but i was surprised he had written them down at all it suddenly occurred to me that caesar himself might have had hieronymus killed but if that were the case wouldnt caesar have tracked down and destroyed this offending document i shook my head as far as i could tell caesar knew nothing about either his wifes etruscan haruspex or about her massilian spy if hieronymus had the date correct octaviuss birthday was tomorrow caesars asian triumph would take place the next day with the african triumph to follow two days after that would octavius be taking part in either one hieronymus claimed that octavius had been fascinated by him what if hieronymus had misread the boys reactions hieronymus was not always tactful and not always skilled in hiding his thoughts had he given away to octavius his suspicions about a relationship between the boy and caesar had octavius been embarrassed offended even outraged had he suspected that hieronymus was maliciously spreading rumors about him antony was too powerful to be killed for such a thing but hieronymus was not here was yet another possible motive for someone to murder hieronymus or if the story was true did it provide octavius with a motive to plot the death of his granduncle the notion that caesars sixteenyearold grandnephew and possible heir might conspire to kill him seemed farfetchedand thus perfectly matched hieronymuss warning of a menace from a quarter no one expected but was the idea so unlikely catamites have been known to turn against their older lovers for all sorts of reasons perhaps octavius was of the insanely jealous sort or perhaps he resented submitting to the domination of an older man considering it a form of degradation and craved revenge no matter that his personal fortunes depended on caesar until i knew more about gaius octavius these ideas were no more than idle speculation like hieronymus before me i decided that i needed to meet the boy facetoface so as to form my own judgment of him xv the house of the widow atia octaviuss mother was not far from my own on a slope of the palatine the next morning i put on my best toga called for rupa and went to pay a visitand encountered a crowd outside the house of atia so large it blocked the street most of the men wore togas others were dressed in military regalia in the sea of faces i recognized senators magistrates highranking officers and wealthy bankers there were also a number of foreigners including diplomats traders and merchants i seemed to have stumbled into a openair gathering of the most elite men in rome i had expected a crowd though not quite this big it was traditional for wellwishers to pay their respects to a young citizen and his family on the day he reached adulthood and put on his manly toga usually such guests trickle in over the course of the day but in this case the young man happened to be the grandnephew of julius caesar and the wellwishers were legion because the rather modest house of atia was too small to accommodate more than a handful of guests at once an officiouslooking slave was keeping strict order at the door allowing only one or two callers to enter at a time as other guests departed well rupa i said we shall never get in mentioning hieronymus wont count for much in these circumstances the situation was even worse than i first thought after watching awhile i realized that callers were not being admitted by order of arrival instead the less important visitors were expected to give way to the more important even as i watched caesars rabblerousing favorite dolabella showed up with a swaggering gait marc antonys young nemesis and the erstwhile soninlaw of cicero strode through the throng no elbowing was necessarily the crowd parted for him as if by instinct he stepped past the officious doorkeeper and into the house without so much as a nod if admission was by order of influence i would be the last man admitted unless perhaps i could argue my way ahead of young gaius octaviuss fuller or shoe mender come rupa i said lets go home i was about to leave when i felt a strong grip on my shoulder gordianus isnt it the father of meto gordianus i turned around to see a man in his middle forties he had a plump but handsome face twinkling eyes and touches of gray at his temples a neatly trimmed beard strengthened his round jaw the outlines of his toga suggested a robust physique with a touch of plumpness to match his face the togas purple border and the fact that lictors attended him indicated he was a praetor one of caesars handpicked magistrates in charge of the city he looked vaguely familiar but i couldnt place him he saw the uncertainty on my face slapped my shoulder and laughed hirtius is the name not sure weve ever been properly introduced but i know your son very well and ive seen you before let me think was it in caesars tent outside brundisium that day we ran pompey out of italy no he tapped his forefinger against his lips or maybe it was at one of ciceros estates youre thick with cicero arent you so am i very old friends cicero and i we have adjoining properties down in tusculum see each other more there than we do here in the city he gives me oratory lessons in return i share my favorite recipes with ciceros cookand beg caesar not to cut the fools head off when he will insist on picking the wrong side his good humor was infectious i smiled and nodded no i dont think weve been introduced before but of course i know of aulus hirtius he had been one of caesars officers in gaul and had fought with caesar in spain at the outset of the civil war in the political arena he had authored laws limiting the rights of pompeians to serve in public office and legitimizing some of caesars more highhanded actions hirtius was a caesar loyalist through and through here to pay respects to young octavius eh he said yes one of the multitude it seems know him then octavius no i admitted but i believe we had an acquaintance in common a massilian named hieronymus ah the scapegoat yes i heard about his death did you know hieronymus too i had not encountered hirtiuss name anywhere in hieronymuss writings i met the scapegoat in this very house as a matter of fact that day he came to call on octavius im here rather a lot lately spending time with the boy at caesars request briefing him you see because i know my way around spain and octavius will be heading there soon now that hes old enough to serve your son is in spain already i believe yes he is right meto is probably gathering intelligence assessing the loyalty of the locals judging the strength and resolve of the resistance laying the groundwork for caesar to sweep in and obliterate the enemy metos good at that sort of thing a spanish campaign will give young octavius a chance to gain valuable experience in the fieldspill some blood show his uncle what hes made of ive been teaching the boy everything i know about the lay of the land and the local customs reviewing basic strategy and tactics drilling him in the use of different weapons but there i go still calling him a boy starting today gaius octavius is a fullfledged citizen and the paterfamilias of his household hirtius surveyed the crowd which had grown even thicker since his arrival he put his hands on his hips and shook his head well theres no way im waiting to take my turn i have far too much to do today getting ready for tomorrows triumph lictors clear a path to the front door easy does it gently but firmly he stepped forward looking over his shoulder to flash a parting smile he saw my glum expression leaned back and grabbed my arm here come along with me gordianus are you sure even as i made a show of demurring i signaled to rupa to stay behind and moved alongside hirtius this is most gracious of you praetor my pleasure gordianus its the least i can do for metos father as we reached the door dolabella was just leaving in his midtwenties with a boyish face the radical firebrand didnt appear much past his own togadonning day he and hirtius exchanged a brief but boisterous greeting with much grinning and shoulder slapping but as we stepped past him hirtius made a face and lowered his voice what does caesar see in that young troublemaker we were greeted in the vestibule by octaviuss mother atia dressed in a sumptuous stola made of richly woven cloth and wearing a great deal of jewelry she must have been greeting visitors since daybreak but her smile for hirtius appeared completely genuine she planted a kiss on his cheek greetings stranger she said hirtius laughed no stranger than that fellow who just left i hope atia narrowed her eyes young dolabellasuch a charmer hirtius clucked his tongue just be sure to keep him away from octavia now that dolabella is free of ciceros daughter no young lady will be safe or do you have your eye on the rogue yourself atia laughed you know my reputation as a chaste widow all the dictators women must be above suspicioncaesars niece as well as caesars wife hirtius nodded where is your uncle i thought caesar would be here by now hes supposed to be too busy with some crisis or other im sure hell eventually show up hed better i certainly cant be the one who takes gaius for a walk across the forum in his new toga and then up to the capitoline to take the auspices theyre planning to perform the ritual in front of uncles new statue we couldnt ask for finer weather but who is this fellow hirtius introduced me atias demeanor at once became more formal softened by a smile that was obviously synthetic perhaps her uncle had taught her how to put on a politicians face when called upon to greet a horde of strangers we were shown to a small garden a short young man in a toga stood inconspicuously amid the shrubbery his face in repose displayed a thoughtful almost somber expression his forehead was quite broad but covered by a very thick head of fair hair his eyebrows nearly met his mouth was finely shaped but almost too small in proportion to his long nose when he saw hirtius his lips curved into a smile but his eyes remained distant the result was an ironic expression that seemed precocious for his years the two greeted each other warmly gripping elbows in a near embrace impulsively it seemed hirtius leaned forward and kissed octavius on the lips then gave his cheek a playful pinch my boy my boy or should i say my good manlook at you in that toga how proud your uncle will be when he sees you do you think so all i know is this thing is hotter than i expected i shall faint if i have to stand under the full sun when they take the auspices nonsense youll conduct yourself with perfect grace as you always do hirtius grabbed octavius by the scruff of the neck the young man submitted to this familiarity with neither embarrassment nor apparent pleasure he turned his curiously distant gaze to me this is gordianus said hirtius the father of meto gordianus your uncles amanuensis octavius raised an eyebrow i see you know my son only by reputation what did octavius mean by that his detached manner hinted at thoughts unspoken and judgments made in silence or was i merely imagining this greetings on this special day citizen i said thank you gordianus you two know someone in common said hirtius or knew hieronymus of massilia i said quickly wanting to see octaviuss reaction for a long moment octavius showed no expression at all then he lifted both eyebrows ah the scapegoat excuse me but so many names have passed through my head today i drew a blank how is hieronymus you havent heard said hirtius the fellow was found stabbed to death somewhere on the palatine wasnt it gordianus yes sad news said octavius such a terrible crime in the heart of the city his killer unknown i said an outrage has my uncle been told he must do something about it i still have hope that the killer or killers may be exposed i said octavius nodded his expression had never altered but forgive me citizen for marring the day with such tidings this is a joyous occasion it is indeed atia came striding into the garden and joy must be shared we have many more visitors waiting to pay their respects hirtius put on a wounded face have we outstayed our welcome already you never but right now youre welcome to go find my uncle and bring him here if you want to be useful atia smiled and left the garden farewell then hirtius gazed wistfully at octavius and cocked his head my boy my boy how very fine you look in that toga he took a step toward octavius and for a moment i thought he might kiss him again but octavius stiffened slightly and drew back and there was something awkward and perfunctory about their parting embrace we left the garden and returned to the vestibule where the next visitors were already being greeted by atia hirtiuss lictors were waiting for him on the doorstep as we headed back toward the place where i had left rupa with the lictors clearing a path a murmur ran through the crowd heads turned in a single direction in a hush the name caesar passed from tongue to tongue then was shouted aloud caesar hail caesar octaviuss granduncle had finally arrived he was attended by a considerable retinue and surrounded by lictors but he broke away from his party to walk alone and unprotected into the gathering before atias house everyone of importance in rome appeared to know that this was the toga day of caesars grandnephew and that caesar himself sooner or later would be in attendance if anyone desired to harm caesar in a public place here was the perfect opportunity how many knives might be hidden in that crowd it would take only one to kill a man how quickly could a determined assassin strike before anyone could stop him i stood on tiptoes to watch caesars slow progress through the gathering men pressed forward to touch him utter words of greeting and speak their names in hopes that he would remember them every time caesar turned or nodded i flinched by my heartbeats i counted the number of times he escaped a possible death he saw hirtius and moved toward us aulus hirtius how is our boy holding up on his special day splendidly caesar he was born to wear a toga good good and can this be gordianus beside you tell me finder did you enjoy your seats at yesterdays triumph we were able to see everything dictator he nodded and pursed his lips including that business with arsinoe and her anonymous admirer my mouth went dry rupa was standing only a few feet away i did my best not to look in his direction that was quite unexpected i said yes after a lifetime in politics a man thinks he knows the roman people yet they continue to be full of surprises but lets hope therell be no more surprises in the triumphs to come i nodded will your nephew be taking part caesar brightened he will indeed not in tomorrows triumph but in the one after the final triumph over africa gaius octavius shall receive military honors and ride at the head of my troops and after the procession he shall join me when i dedicate the new temple venus is his ancestress as well as mine its my hope that the people of rome will love him as dearly as i do and as does hirtius here they will caesar said hirtius how could they not embrace him i look to you hirtius to see that the boy is properly outfitted and knows how to conduct himself in the triumph we dont want him to look like a raw recruit by the way he handles his weapon or leaves a piece of armor unbuckled i have every confidence that the boythe young manwill satisfy your expectations said hirtius caesar nodded and pressed on a few moments later he disappeared into atias house unharmed i felt relieved i also experienced a nagging uncertainty the rumors recounted by hieronymus were stuck in my head they had shaped my ideas about octavius before i had a chance to meet him i had found hirtiuss casual but insistent habit of touching the young man and octaviuss passive but unemotional reaction to being touched not innocent and endearing but oddly disturbing what was the exact relationship between caesar and octavius and between octavius and hirtius was i allowing gossip and innuendo to color my observations to be seduced into error by way of preconceptionthis was a common often dangerous mistake made by amateurs such as hieronymus when they set about uncovering secrets i reminded myself that octavius was only seventeen a sheltered youth without a father and hardly any practical experience of the world he must be acutely selfconscious about living in his granduncles shadow and was probably a bit intimidated by the huge public reaction to his birthday what i took to be aloofness was more likely the closely guarded expression of a young man who did not yet know himself and was quite uncertain of his place in the world when i arrived home calpurnias messenger was waiting for me again she asked whom i had interviewed and what i had discovered despite her deliberately cryptic choice of words i could sense her increasing anxiety again i sent a reply saying i had nothing significant to report i spent the rest of the day in a strange state of mind hardly stirring from my garden the day was brutally hot i thought of young octavius sweltering in his toga while augurs watched the flight of birds from atop the capitoline no doubt assuring caesar that all the auspices were good i drank only water abstaining from wine and took a number of brief naps from time to time i reached for hieronymuss reports but his handwriting seemed more indecipherable than ever and his prose more pointlessly prolix there was still a great deal of material i had not yet read or had only scanned in a haphazard fashion finally shadows began to lengthen but the heat of the day gave no indication of relenting my daughter joined me in the garden are you all right papa said diana i considered the question im not unwell its this heat davus and i were just down at the riverside market the whole city is in a kind of daze good i thought it was only me she frowned your work isnt going well is it i shrugged who can say a sudden revelation could come to me at any moment thats happened before but right now i have no idea who killed hieronymus or why it will come to you you know it will but something else is bothering you i nodded you can see inside my head you inherited that ability from your mother perhaps from the look on your face i can see that youre troubled i shaded my brow and squinted at the sun it seemed to have caught on the edge of the roofline i could have sworn it was just sitting there not moving when i accepted this mission from calpurnia i told her i was doing so for only one purpose to see justice done for hieronymus but thats no longer true if it ever was somehow ive become caught up in her zeal to safeguard caesar today outside the house of gaius octavius there was a large gathering caesar walked through the crowd alone without any lictors without even friends to protect him i found myself very nearly in a panic when i thought of the danger he was facing my breath shortened my pulse began to race i was relieved beyond words when he passed safely through the crowd and disappeared into the house was he any safer inside said diana werent all those people going to follow him in one or two at a time to pay their respects to his kinsman and might not this gaius octavius himself pose a threat to caesar you must have thought so or you wouldnt have paid a call on him you can see inside my head i never discussed any of this with you she smiled i have my own ways of finding papa but the point is neither you nor anyone else can protect caesar all the time especially if someone close to him is determined to harm him true enough daughter but you miss the point which is why should i care whether caesar lives or dies i told calpurnia i would study these documents and follow them wherever they led only so that i might discover who killed hieronymus caesar means nothing to me not true caesar means something to all of us for better or worse hes brought an end to the civil war and all its suffering caesar himself inflicted a great deal of that suffering but now its over at least in rome people are beginning to live againto hope to plan to think about the future to think about life instead of death no one wants a return to the bloodshed and sorrow of the last few years if caesar were to be murderedespecially before he names an heirthe killing would start all over again you dont have to love caesar to want him to keep breathing you dont even have to like him you can despise himand still want him to stay alive for the sake of peace for the good of all of us has it come to that must a man submit to having a king and want him to live forever because the alternative is too awful to consider diana cocked her head it must be terrible to be a man and to have think about such things even in this heat for those of us who cant vote or fight or own propertyor ever hope to do any of those manly thingsits all much simpler how many more people have to die before the world can be at peace if caesar were to be killed i dont know if any good would come of it but im certain a great deal of evil would follow thats what you dread papa thats why you care about what happens to caesar i looked up and realized that the sun had slipped behind the roofline twilight would come after all followed by night and then another day i closed my eyes i must have slept because i seemed to be in the tullianum the dank cool darkness was almost pleasant compared to the brutal heat of the day amid the shadows lemures were all around methe lemures of vercingetorix and ganymedes and countless other gauls and egyptians soon to be joined by more victims from asia and africa and unheardof lands beyond but the lemur of hieronymus was not among them xvi the next day for the asian triumph we arrived a bit late and with our party incomplete there was some minor crisis with little beth and after much discussion diana convinced her mother to come along while she stayed home our seats were waiting for us in the viewing stands we missed the opening procession of senators and magistratessmall lossbut managed to take our places just as the trumpets were sounding to mark the parade of trophies the rebellious king pharnaces had overrun cappadocia armenia and pontus all these regions which caesar had subsequently reclaimed were represented by precious objects donated by the grateful inhabitants a golden crown and other treasures with which pharnaces had attempted to placate caesar upon his arrival in asia were also displayed along with a statue of the moon goddess bellona the principal deity of the cappadocians to whom caesar had sacrificed before he began the campaign among the captured weapons and machines of war pharnacess own chariot was wheeled before us it was an impressive vehicle the carriage was heavily plated and fearsomelooking blades projected from the wheels a placard displayed the flight of pharnaces at the battle of zela the king was shown in his chariot his crown tumbling from his head his face a mask of panic on one side of him loomed a sternlooking caesar his hands on hips on the other side loomed pharnacess treacherous henchman asander the man who would murder him flashing a wicked grin the crowd bust into laughter at the sight of these exaggerated but cleverly rendered caricatures i could see that a very large placard was approaching as wide as the pathway would permit and twice as tall as the men carrying it the sight of it elicited a tumultuous cheer as it passed when it came into view i saw why in a single battle within five days after his arrival and within four hours after sighting the enemy caesar had vanquished pharnaces the magnitude of his victory was impressive its speed was astonishing rendered in huge golden letters upon the placard were the words i came i saw i conquered always eager to take up a chant the crowd began to repeat caesars terse boast one side shouted came the other side shouted saw then all together as loudly as possible conquered i had been feeling the call of nature ever since we sat and could wait no longer i think i shall go stand and relieve myself take rupa with you said bethesda he rose to accompany me but i waved him back no rupa there are some things it is safe for me to do all by myself stay and watchand dont get into any trouble bethesda gave me an exasperated look but i ignored her i made my way to the aisle descended the steps and threaded a path through the crowd the nearest public latrines built directly above the cloaca maxima were not far away the chamber was one of the largest public facilities in the forum but when i stepped inside i found myself alone the most exciting part of the triumph for many spectatorsthe procession of prisonerswas coming up and probably no one wanted to miss it i had my choice of whichever of the scores of holes i wanted i followed my nose to the freshestsmelling part of the room and stood before the receptacle the roar of the crowd outside echoed through the stone chamber sounding strangely distant i was just beginning when someone entered the chamber from the corner of my eye i saw that he wore priestly garments i took a closer look and i saw that it was calpurnias uncle gnaeus calpurnius he must have left his place in the procession to come relieve himself he gave me a grunt of recognition as he walked up to a nearby receptacle and made ready hitching up his robes he had interrupted me and i was slow to start again he was slow to begin at all which was not surprising for a man his age we stood in silence for a long moment hot today he finally said staring straight ahead yes i said a little surprised that he would deign to strike up a conversation with me even about the weather though not as hot as yesterday i think he grunted i kept my gaze politely averted but from the corner of my eye i saw that uncle gnaeus appeared to be adjusting himself yet to no avail for still i heard no release my niece has great faith in you he said does she should she he turned his head slightly and trained a single eye upon me or are you no better than the other one the one who got himself killed wasting her time and filling her head with yet more nonsense hieronymus was my friend i said quietly i would prefer that you not speak ill of him in my presence my flow began tell me did you ever discuss astronomy with him what hieronymus made notations having to do with the movements of the stars and such youre a keeper of the calendar arent you i thought perhaps you gave him instruction he snorted do you seriously think i would waste my time giving sacred instruction to one of my nieces minions and a foreigner at that now tell me finder are you wasting calpurnias time have you discovered anything of interest are you at all close to doing so im doing my best i said and in some ways doing much better than you i thought for still there was no relief for uncle gnaeus no wonder he was so irritable he snorted just as i thought youve found nothing because there is nothing to find this menace to caesar that consumes my niece is entirely imaginary created from thin air by that haruspex porsenna if thats true then why did someone murder hieronymus your friend was poking his nose into other peoples businesspowerful people dangerous people who knows what embarrassing or incriminating information he may have uncovered having nothing at all to do with caesar the scapegoat surely offended someone but his death is hardly proof of a plot against caesar what he said made sense yet i found myself recalling the cryptic key that hieronymus had mentioned in his journal i repeated the words aloud look all around the truth is not found in the words but the words may be found in the truth what in hades is that supposed to mean i wish i knew i said then seemingly from nowhere a memory came to me and i felt a sudden chill whats that look on your face said uncle gnaeus i shivered a long time ago in a public latrine here in the forum i was very nearly murdered by hercules id almost forgotten it was thirtyfive years ago during the trial of sextus roscius the first time i worked with cicero a hired killer followed me into a latrine near the temple of castor we were alone he pulled a knife all very interesting im sure but perhaps you could leave a man in peace i turned and left at once almost feeling sorry for uncle gnaeus judging by the silence he still had not managed to begin relieving himself the crowd had grown even thicker than before i looked in vain for a way to pass through the din of the shouting and laughter was deafening i realized i had no desire to return to my seat in the stands i had seen quite enough of doomed humiliated prisoners of caesar in his ceremonial chariot and of lictors and cavalry officers and marching legionaries i suddenly longed to be anywhere else i started walking heading away from the triumph fleeing the crush and the noise at length taking a roundabout path of least resistance i found myself at the flaminian gate in the old city walls i kept walking once through the gate i was outside the city proper on the field of mars when i was a boy much of this area had still been literally a field with vast parade grounds some areas of the field of mars remained undeveloped but in my lifetime the greater part of it had been filled with new tenements and temples and public buildings it had become one of the liveliest neighborhoods of rome but on this day the streets were almost deserted from beyond the capitoline hill which now loomed between me and the forum i could still hear the roar of the crowd but more and more faintly as i continued to walk toward the great bend of the tiber i felt a sense of freedom and escapefrom haughty uncle gnaeus from caesar from calpurnia from my fretful wife and even from rupa my constant companion in recent days at length i came to the new neighborhood of shops and apartments that had sprung up around pompeys theater where i had come to visit arsinoe was she there still returned to her high prison but alone now without ganymedes to look after her i wandered past the empty porticos all the shops were closed i came to the entrance to the theater itself the gate was open and unmanned i wandered inside the tiers of seats were empty i gazed up row after row fascinated by the play of sunlight and shadow on the repeating semicircles all the way to the top where the temple of venus stood lost in thought i slowly ascended the steps i remembered the enormous controversy that erupted when pompey announced his plans to build the theater for centuries conservative priests and politicians had thwarted the construction of a permanent theater in rome arguing that such an extravagance would lead the romans to become as decadent as the stagestruck greeks pompey circumvented their objections by adding a temple to the complex so that the whole structure could be consecrated as a religious building the design was clever the rows of theater seats also served as steps leading up to the sanctuary at the summit can you hear me i was not alone a lone figure with a white beard dressed in a tunic of many colors had stepped onto the stage i said can you hear me up there dont simply nod speak yes i shouted no need to yell thats the whole point acoustics im barely talking above normal volume now and yet you can hear me perfectly well cant you yes good lalala lalala fodida fodida he continued to utter a series of nonsensical noises i realized he was a performer limbering his throat but i laughed aloud anyway well i can see youre going to be an easy audience he said sit listen you can help me with my timing i did as i was told i had come here seeking escape after all what better escape could i hope for than a few moments in the theater he cleared his throat then struck a dramatic pose when he spoke again his voice was utterly different it had a rich dark tone full of curious inflections it was an actors voice trained to fascinate friends and countrymen welcome to the play i am the playwright this is the prologuemy chance to tell you what to think about the tale youre about to see i could let you simply watch the play and make up your own mindsbut being fickle romans i know better than to trust your judgment oh thats right jeer and boo he broke from his pose well jeer and boo i obliged him with what i imagined would be a suitably obscene jeer involving his mother thats better he said and continued his soliloquy i know why youre all here to celebrate a great mans good fortune not a good mans great fortune that would be a different matterand a different man i obligingly laughed at this witticism which was clearly a jab at caesar the sponsor of the upcoming plays my laughter may have sounded a bit forced but decimus laberiusfor now i recognized the man one of the leading playwrights and performers of the roman stageseemed not to care if my reactions were sincere as long as i gave him a token response to help him with his timing but why am i here he continued to be perfectly candid i had rather be at home right now with my feet up and my nose in a book ive had enough of all this carryingon and celebrating it grates on an old mans nerves yet here i am with a new play produced on demand and why because im desperate to beat that fool publilius syrus out of the prize no i dont need a prize to tell me im a better playwright than that babbling freedman no i am here because the goddess of necessity compels me to what depths of indignity has she thrust me here at the end of my life you see me at twice thirty years a broken man when i was thirtyor better yet half thirtyoh how young and proud i was no power in heaven or on earth could bend me to its will neither begging nor bribery cajoling nor threatening could move me one iota but nowlook at me jump laberius executed a sudden leap and barely stopped himself from tumbling head over heels his awkwardness was so convincing that i laughed out loud he paused for a moment as if waiting for the laughter of a huge audience to subside a most unbecoming activity for a man my age so why do i jump because a certain man demands it no thats unfair the fellow does not demand it he asks he makes a polite request he says laberius dear friend best and boldest of playwrights would you be so kind and laberiusjumps he executed an even more fitful leap with a hairraising recovery and heres the rub it matters not a fig that i should stand here and complain he merely takes my mutterings as a compliment look hes laughing now laberius pointed at the box of honor in the midst of the seats which was as empty as the rest of the theater he shook his head bitter are the twists and turns of fortune my own success has made me anothers slave the dazzling jewel of fame had turned me into another mans ornament my gift for words renders me mute but oh can i jump again he took a leap but something in the halting movement was more pathetic than absurd more pitiful than funny i did not laugh at all he cocked his head do you remember that game we played when we were boys called king of the hill well i imagined i was very nearly at the top of that hill for a while but then i took a tumble and now i find myself at the bottomjust like all of youlooking up at the winner whos so high above me i have to squint to see him in a quavering childlike voice so strange it gave me gooseflesh he quoted from the ditty boys sang when they played the game you will be king if you can cling to the height do the thing to prove youre right send em tumbling with all your might i sat forward in my seat no longer pretending to be his attentive audience but genuinely riveted in my mind his voice conjured images of boys at play so seemingly harmless in their rush to compete but i also saw fields of dead bodies and heads on stakes the terrible outcomes of those boyhood games carried into the world of men i was reminded of how completely an actor could command the stage controlling his audiences emotions with a change in the tone of his voice or a simple shrug of his shoulders ah but i suppose i was getting too big for my toga anyway said laberius with a sigh i was due for a bit of taking down werent we all o people of the toga we forgot the way of the world all cannot be first and the highest rank is the hardest to hold on to from the pinnacle of success the only direction is down a man has his day and falls his successor will fall in turn and his successor and so on only the immortals hold fast to their place in this universe while everything around them changes in the blink of a gods eye we rightly fear the gods we rightly fear certain men but mark my words the man who is feared the most has the most to fear a shrill voice coming from behind me interrupted him laberius you old fraud you will never dare to speak that line from the stage why are you even bothering to rehearse it i looked over my shoulder and saw a striking figure a man perhaps in his forties with touches of silver in his dark beard he struck me as the type whos quite handsome in his youth but runs to fat in middle age he was striding down the aisle toward the stage followed by a troupe of actors ill rehearse the prologue just as i wrote it snapped laberius whether i deliver it that way is another matter and none of your business publilius syrus if the temper of the audience and the exigencies of performance call for a bit of spontaneous rewrite how about a spontaneous exit the newcomer had passed me and was fast approaching the stage you shouldnt even be here this is the hour scheduled for my troupe to practice and you know very well that we rehearse in secret i cant have eavesdroppers plagiarizing my best lines how dare you syrus as if i would steal a single one of your tired platitudes youyou freedman that right insult a man whos actually made his way in this profession by merit go on laberius off with you disappear send a puff of smoke out of your rear end and vanish through a trapdoor youre the one who resorts to such vulgar stage effects syrus i rely on words and the instrument of my body well get your instrument out of here and take your assistant with you i cleared my throat actually i am not this mans assistant i only happened to be whoever you are get out or ill have ajax throw you out syrus gestured to one of his actors whether ajax was his name or his role in the play it suited the mans brawny build i suddenly regretted having wandered off on my own without rupa i had no desire to become involved in a brawl between rival playwrights though i was curious about the men themselves both laberius and syrus were listed by hieronymus as frequent guests at marc antonys parties syrus must have known hieronymus he had sent a message of condolence to my house i headed out the way i had come and was walking down a long portico when i felt a hand on my shoulder i turned to see laberius what did you think of my prologue citizen i shrugged amusing provocative i suppose im not a great follower of the theater yet you laughed in all the right places and when i did the bit about the boys playing king of the hill it gave you chills didnt it admit it it did come with me citizen he took my arm and steered me to a nearby doorway the door was plain and unadorned but the chamber into which it opened was quite grand we had entered by a side door into the great meeting room in the theater complex pompey had built it expressly to accommodate gatherings of the senate the hall was an ovalshaped well with seats on either side descending in tiers to the main floor marble was everywhere in many colors and patterns the design and workmanship of even the smallest detail was exquisite a common citizen like me is seldom allowed into such a place i must have gawked like a tourist for laberius laughed and gave me a friendly pat on the back quite a room isnt it come see the man who built it we descended to the main floor laberius indulged in a bit of mummery raising his arms and twirling like a speaker orating to his colleagues he ended his little mime show by doing an aboutface and bowing low before a statue placed conspicuously against the wall where everyone in the hall could see it i did not need to read the inscription on the pedestal to recognize pompey the man who had built this complex as a gift to the city and to serve as his crowning accomplishment the statue depicted pompey in a toga as a statesman rather than a soldier on his blandly handsome face was an amiable almost serene expression my most enduring memory of pompeys countenance was quite different once in a rage he tried to kill me with his bare hands and the look on his face then had been anything but serene i still had bad dreams haunted by pompeys face as depicted by this statue the great one looked harmless enough gazing with a smile at the grand assembly room he had provided for his colleagues a great patron of the theater said laberius with a sigh though to give him his due caesar promises to be even more generous for the upcoming competition hes offering the winning playwright a prize of a million sesterces a million that could go a long way to easing an old mans retirement so your reason for taking part in the festival isnt entirely because a dictator compels it i said no i dont see much difference jumping because i fear the man who tells me to jump or doing it because he owns all the worlds gold and promises to throw a few coins my way strong words playwright when politicians give up on liberty it falls to poets to preserve it or to write its epitaph i dont know what your play is about but with a prologue like that can you really expect caesar to give you the prize why not it would prove that he allows dissent loves freedom and has excellent taste what harm can i do to caesar at my worst im no more than the buzzing of a gnat in his ear all my ranting is mere flattery to such a man i meant what i said it matters not a fig that i should stand here and complain he merely takes my mutterings as a compliment still that last bithow did it go the man who is feared the most has the most to fear no tyrant likes to hear that sort of talk calpurnia certainly wouldnt like it i thought better that such words be shouted in public than whispered in private said laberius at least im no hypocrite like that notalent pigs paunch who syrus thats his nickname since he arrived in rome he eats it at every meal which makes him a voluptuary perhaps but not a hypocrite no one speaks more scathingly about the dictator behind his back than syrus yet his socalled play consists of nothing but insipid platitudes in praise of caesar a million sesterces could purchase an endless supply of pigs paunch but how do you know this syrus rehearses in secret laberius snorted i know every line of drivel in his new play a gift worthily bestowed is a gift to the giver too much wrangling and the truth is lost sight of a quick refusal is a kindness half done one cloying banality after another but how do you know this he smiled that fellow ajax looks the strong silent typebut indulge his weakness for wine and he sings like a lark i shook my head in caesars rome even playwrights employed spies against each other let me understand you laberius youre saying that you speak harshly about caesar but pose no threat to him but a man like syrus who appears completely obsequious is far more likely to be up to no good but caesar knows this hes a shrewd judge of character how else has he kept his head on his shoulders are you seriously suggesting that syrus might pose a threat a grave threat the man who wrote the line you never defeat danger by refusing to face it could murder the theater outright i see tell me who is this publilius syrus he was born a slave in syria thus the uncouth cognomen acquired the name publilius from his master when he was freed how that came about no one knows but they say he was a beautiful boy syrus wouldnt be the first slave who rose in this world by trading on his looks made his way to italy and presented himself as a playwright hes had a bit of success in the hinterlands doing the smalltown festival circuit now he thinks he can make a name for himself in the big city ha what passes for cleverness in calabria wont make them chuckle in rome of course with an audience made up of gallic senators and the like who knows what for passes for popular taste nowadays i sighed indeed persons of true refinement are few and far between and now there is one less such person in the world im thinking of a friend of mine who was murdered recently he was a very cultured fellow and a true lover of the theater i think perhaps you might have met him hieronymus of massilia laberius looked at me blankly perhaps at one of those parties marc antony is famous for i suggested ugh not my crowd for those affairs i show up early recite a few lines eat and drink my fill and then run home to an early bed but you attend such parties nonetheless a free meal is a free meal the playwrights credo but you never encountered my friend hieronymus he shrugged the name is vaguely familiar but if the fellow was the type to arrive late and stay till dawn syrus wouldve been more likely to make his acquaintance syrus is frequently seen staggering downhill from the house of the beaks at dawn he frowned but you say your friend was murdered we need not speak of it since you didnt know him laberius nodded respectfully then seized my arm now citizen if you would be so kind take a seat about midway up ill stay down here and finish reciting my prologue the acoustics here arent the same as in the theater but i can still practice my movements and hone my timing im afraid i should leave now without hearing the rest ill hear it when you perform it for caesar i suppose citizen im offering you a rare opportunity to witness theatrical history in the making to hear the unexpurgated version thats the problem i fear you see laberius i left the triumph and wandered in this direction in search of escape i thought thats what i was in for when i paused to listen to you in the theater instead what did i hear topical satire about the state of rome veiled references to the dictatorthe very things from which i was fleeing no thank you playwright if theres no escape from the dictator anywhere in rome not even in the theater then i might as well spend the day with my loved ones which reminds me my wife will be desperately worried by now hercules protect mei must face the wrath of bethesda now theres a subject for a play with a final glance at pompey who gazed over our heads with a placid smile i took my leave of decimus laberius xvii when i returned to my seat at the triumph caesar had already passed without incident the legionaries who had served him in asia were marching by i was a bit taken aback by bethesdas reaction she seemed hardly to have noticed my absence perversely perhaps i felt obliged to point out that i had been gone a rather long time have you she said when theres so much to watch the time simply flies you missed the cappadocian acrobats i swear those boys and girls must have wings to fly through the air like that and the bithynian archersthey were impressive offered davus archers i said they shot hundreds of arrows high into the air explained bethesda from which multicolored pennants unfurled the arrows fluttered down as harmless as a rain of rose petals it was really quite spectacular you know i could have been in danger i said danger when all rome is watching a triumph how i dont know someone might have tried to stab me in the public latrine that happened once before oh that was a long time ago said bethesda which doesnt mean it couldnt happen again so it never occurred to you to send rupa or davus to look for me she shrugged i assumed you ran into someone and were chatting away i should hate to interrupt when youre busy catching up on gossip with some lowlife from the subura or some wharf rat from the docks excuse me wife but most of my chatting these days is done with people considerably higher up the social scale than that i talk to senators and magistrates and relatives of the dictator and famous playwrights yes yes she said now shush the soldiers have broken into one of those chants they love so much by bona dea its not about caesar and king nicomedes again is it i suppose those archers from bithynia reminded them if this was material for a play it was decidedly a comedy and at my expense i sat though the remainder of the triumph in glum silence the feasting that followed the triumph left me torpid and drowsy i meant to read more of hieronymuss reports when i returned home looking especially for anything to do with the playwrights laberius and syrus but i could hardly stay awake long enough to tumble into bed i slept like a stone bethesda complained of my snoring the next morning during breakfast i received another message from calpurnia come at once i am desperately fearful my wise counselor assures me the danger increases as the time grows shorter have you discovered nothing rub the words from this wax as soon as you have read them and report to me in person now there i thought is a woman who knows how to fret over her husband taking rupa with me i went to her house at once porsenna the haruspex was with her looking as selfimportant as ever uncle gnaeus sat with his arms crossed shaking his head from time to time to express his opinion that all this fuss was for no good reason calpurnia was in a highly agitated state you realize there is only one more triumph remaining she said yes tomorrows african triumph i said ostensibly to celebrate the defeat and death of king juba but also to mark caesars triumph over his roman opponents who fled to africa after the battle of pharsalus no roman has ever before celebrated a triumph for killing other romans which makes this occasion all the more dangerous for caesar said calpurnia how his enemies would love to pull him down even as he reaches the pinnacle of his glory is that what your haruspex tells you porsennas warnings are dire but its also common sense then surely your husband will take every precaution no man has more common sense than caesar why only yesterday someone was telling me what a good judge of character caesar must be enough prattling said calpurnia have you discovered anything that might be useful anything at all i sighed im no closer to being able to tell you who killed hieronymus and why as i told you from the outset that is my real purpose for pursuing this matter when will you know something its impossible to say and yet all three of them leaned toward me go on said porsenna over the years i seem to have developed a certain instinct as others can smell rain before it comes so i can smell the truth approaching and my nose has begun to twitch what is that supposed to mean snapped uncle gnaeus i sense that im drawing closer to the truth though i dont yet have an inkling of what that truth is or where or how the revelation will come its like the first whiff of a scent you know you recognize it even though you cant put a name to it at least not yet but soon you sound as mystical as porsenna said calpurnia i thought you relied on logic and deduction like a greek philosopher i do but sometimes i seem to skip a step or two in the chain of reasoning i arrive at the truth by a kind of shortcut does it matter how i get there it matters when you get there she said in time to save caesar i took a deep breath ill do what i can i returned home once again i set to studying hieronymuss reports and his personal journal though the hour was early the day was already hot no breeze stirred the baking heat of the garden i found nothing new to pique my interest but i did come across a passage i had not read before concerning the doorkeeper at hieronymuss building the slave called agapios in passing hieronymus noted what a flirt the boy is today he actually winked at me to be sure cytheris served wine of chios last night and that vintage is said to restore the allure of the drinkers lost youth hieronymus hieronymus i muttered what a vain old fellow you were and how easily you were flattered in fact i felt a bit put out by the passage agapios had flirted with me as well but obviously the young man did so promiscuously and without the least sincerity some slaves acquire a habit of flirting with their superiors they ingratiate themselves by reflex diana brought me a cup of water she surveyed the scrolls and scattered bits of parchment all around me she seemed to hesitate then spoke papa do you think youve given sufficient weight to the note hieronymus left for whomever might find his private writings i mean the part where he says look all around the truth is not found in the words daughter have you been looking through these documents behind my back you never forbade me to read them papa but i never asked you to do so i scowled at her the heat was making me irritable hieronymus was my friend too she said quietly yes of course he was i sipped the water i want to know what happened to him just as you do she added and since you think it unseemly that i should go about asking questions of strangers as you do what else can i do but read his reports and try to imagine which of those people wanted to kill him ill grant that you have the advantage of younger stronger eyes how much have you read only bits and pieces some of his greek i cant follow and sometimes his handwriting is very hard to make out as i know only too well but what were you saying earlier about something ive overlooked i dont know that youve overlooked it papa but it strikes me that it might be significant its this part here she reached for a scrap of parchment and read aloud i dare not write my supposition even here what if this journal were to be discovered must keep it hidden but what if i am silenced to any seeker who finds these words and would unlock the truth i shall leave a key look all around the truth is not found in the words but the words may be found in the truth i nodded yes yes i noticed that passage at once when i discovered his private writings there was no literal key or at least none that i could find as for looking all around i did so i scoured every corner of his rooms was rupa with you no this was before your mother issued her proclamation that i should never venture out alone why do you ask another pair of eyes might have seen something you overlooked do you think i should go back and look again and take rupa with me no i think you should take me with you diana you know how i feel about your interest in this sort of but papa you just admitted that my eyes are younger and stronger might i not see something that you overlooked four eyes are better than two an aphorism worthy of publilius syrus so you will take me with you to hieronymuss apartment i never said that but that was what i did an hour later three of us arrived at the building in the subura rupa diana and myself agapios the door slave was nowhere to be seen but we did not need him i had the key to hieronymuss rooms as we made our way up the stairs diana bounded ahead of me i could see she was very excited to be accompanying her father in the performance of his work but her excitement gradually faded as we conducted our examination of the rooms together we searched the furniture looked for hidden compartments in the walls and the floor and sorted though hieronymuss few possessions we looked through the various scrolls that remained in the bookcase searching for any scraps of parchment with hieronymuss handwriting we circled the rooftop terrace searching for hidden compartments in the exterior walls we discovered nothing of interest at length diana sighed i was so sure wed find something i nodded i know that feeling and yet i was wrong i know that feeling too theres a great deal of frustration and disappointment in this sort of work but when theres nothing to see four eyes are no better than two i suppose youre right but id be even more frustrated if i hadnt been able to take a look for myself thank you papa as we made our way down the stairs i heard voices from the vestibule below we came upon young agapios in conversation with gnaeus calpurnius the old priest looked surprised to see me and even more surprised at the sight of rupa and diana what are these people doing here the usually cheerful agapios seemed completely cowed by uncle gnaeus who was no doubt immune to his powers of flirtation the one called gordianus has the key to the rooftop apartment he explained how did he acquire that he took it from me he showed me the mistresss seal uncle gnaeus boxed his ear a fine job youve done looking after this property i should send you to the salt mines no sooner had agapios recovered himself than gnaeus struck him again stop i said its as the slave says i took the key by calpurnias authority what business is it of yours my niece delegated the running of this property to me months ago shes much too busy to deal with evicting tenants or collecting rents the slave should never have given you a key to this building without my authority gnaeus calpurnius i think you know the importance your niece attaches to my work whether you respect it or not would you have denied me the key i think not for numas sake leave the boy alone how dare you invoke the name of my ancestor on behalf of a slave finder here take back the key i dont need it anymore i tossed it at his feet but it was agapios who scrambled to retrieve it the groveling slave offered it to gnaeus calpurnius who gave him a kick i hurried out with diana and rupa behind me now youve seen another side of my work daughter i could see that diana was shaken by the exchange it isnt all sipping wine with cytheris or trading barbs with cicero strip away their cultivated manners and youll find that our betters are a nasty lot what an awful man diana shuddered ive encountered worse i said but at the moment i couldnt remember where or when after sharing a midday meal with the family i was inclined to take a nap but diana insisted that we sit together in the garden and continue reading hieronymuss notes having worn me down in her pursuit to share my work she was eager to continue it was diana who came across a passage that neither of us had read before do i miss living in the household of gordianus i certainly miss bethesdas cooking i miss gordianuss largesse and his conversation but the two of them are gone perhaps never to return i miss the others too of course but there is much to be said for striking out on ones own and not looking back i am living my own adventure his own adventure i whispered which came to such a sad end diana nodded theres also a bit about that haruspex porsenna part of the fun is seeing how far i can trick a fellow trickster like porsenna into trusting me and inducing calpurnia to pay me the fellow is probably a charlatan through and through but i wonder if he hasnt convinced himself of his powers of precognition if i validate his prediction of a plot against the dictator his hold on calpurnia can only increase if i were to show him up as a fool or a fraud even she could not protect me from his fury do you think hes exaggerating papa about how dangerous porsenna might be youve met the man i havent hard to say its a thought though isnt it hieronymus might have been killed because he was close to proving that caesar was not in danger from a plot on his life i gazed at her and shook my head you have your mothers looks thank the gods but i fear youve inherited your fathers devious mind this made her smile i was also wondering papa if we shouldnt be thinking more about the dedication ceremony at the new temple of venus what of it its scheduled to take place shortly after the completion of tomorrows triumph might that not be a more likely occasion for someone to gain access to caesar if they wanted to do him harm perhaps i presume work on the temple is finished but im not sure about the surrounding area theres a great deal of new construction taking place i suppose there might be hiding places suitable for staging an ambush traps that could be made to look like accidents that sort of thing perhaps we should have a look we it was my idea papa i sighed very well go find rupa lets take a look at caesars new temple xviii with typical modesty caesar intended to call his new complex of buildings the great forum to differentiate it from the agesold forum officially the forum romanum created by our forefathers as yet only the outlines of the great forum could be discerned except for the completed temple of venus prominently situated at one end of the concourse the area was a vast construction site with its constituent parts in various stages of completion when it was finished the great forum would become the legal center of rome with hearing rooms judicial halls offices for advocates and legislative archives clustered around a large square bordered by a colonnaded portico in its center would stand a monumental equestrian statue of caesar as yet only the huge pedestal was in place while the area in front of the temple of venus would be graced by an elaborate fountain for which only the pipes had been laid down the site was swarming with workmen for tomorrows dedication ceremony the space in front of the temple was being cleared of debris and tidied up so as to accommodate a great many spectators most would be expected to stand for the more important personages benches were being delivered and arranged in rows before the temple steps at the foot of the steps a marble altar for sacrifice was being set up the temple was a magnificent sight made entirely of marble it was built on a high podium accessed by a long flight of steps with the columns set close together every detail of the facadethe cornices and capitals the pediment and sculptural decorationshad been exquisitely crafted this was the temple caesar had pledged to erect on the eve of the battle of pharsalus should he be victorious in honor of his divine ancestress its full name was the temple of venus genetrix pompeys temple atop his theater was officially consecrated to venus victrix but the victory of venus had been bestowed on caesar i surveyed as much of the construction site as the workmen would allow us to enter looking for potential places of ambush or traps it seemed unlikely that anyone could engineer such a threat in secret with so many men involved in clearing and cleaning the site lets have look inside said diana im not sure we can the temple isnt open yet nonsensethe doors are standing wide open besides you have calpurnias seal dont you and shes an inlaw of venus isnt she without waiting for me diana headed up the long flight of steps i dutifully followed and gestured for rupa to come along she paused on the porch for me to catch up then together we stepped through the wide doorway the interior was even more sumptuous than the facade the marble floors walls ceiling and columns presented a staggering array of colors and patterns and everything was newly finished so that all the surfaces gleamed with a mirrorlike polish to decorate the facing walls of the vestibule caesar had acquired two of the most famous paintings in the world the medea and the ajax by the renowned artist timomachus a series of ornate cabinets exhibited an extraordinary collection of jewelry and gemstones acquired by caesar in his travels not the most beautiful but surely the most exotic was a savagelooking breastplate strung with tiny pearls a placard noted that it came from the island of britannia at the furthest end of the world from the sanctuary i could hear the tapping noise of a sculptors hammer and chisel diana heard it too and we exchanged a curious look you dont think someone is still at work on the statue on the very day before the dedication she said lets find out i said we entered the sanctuary the sculptor who had received caesars commission arcesilaus was reputed to be the most highly paid artist in the world he was mentioned in passing in hieronymuss reports and had sent a note of condolence many years ago i had met him at the house of the late lucullus a great patron of the arts arcesilaus had been young then and quite handsome with a reputation for vanity and hottempered genius his hair had grown grayer but he still had the big shoulders and biceps of a sculptor and his temper still ran hot if his reaction to our appearance in the sanctuary was any indication what in hades are you doing here he shouted the marble statue of venus stood on a high pedestal at the rear wall arcesilaus was perched on a riser which allowed him access to the base of the statue where he was tending to a finishing detail with a small hammer and a chisel i cleared my throat my name is gordianus and im diana his daughter and this is rupa his son i frowned at dianas forwardness arcesilaus raised an eyebrow i didnt care for the way his mouth twisted at one corner as he looked diana up and down you and i have met before i said though it was a long time ago i know your name i know who you are and i remember when we met that doesnt answer my question what are you doing here if the answer isnt caesar sent me and this is an emergency then all three of you can get out well you two fellows anyway he looked at diana again and narrowed his eyes i am here on behalf of caesar i said speaking a sort of truth what can that man possibly want now arcesilaus threw down his hammer and chisel i flinched in anticipation of the impact but the statue was surrounded by canvas drop cloths the instruments landed with a soft thud arcesilaus launched into a rant he says to finish the statue by the end of the year very well i say thats possible then he tells me it must be done by september impossible i tell him it cant be done ah but it must be done he says make it possible and when i protest he begins to recite his miracles on the battlefield how he built a snare made of ships to catch pompey at brundisium and tunneled under the walls at massilia and so on and so forth always making the impossible possible by sheer exercise of will this is art not war i told him this is a statue not a slaughter im creating a goddess not sacking gaul he jumped from the platform and with a loud grunt bent down to pick up his tools when he stood straight he glared at me for a moment then was distracted again by diana the fire in his eyes burned even hotter his lips curled into a leer when he was younger men called arcesilaus a lover nowadays they called him a letch i snapped my fingers to regain his attention his face went blank for a moment then registered glum resignation well what does caesar want now out with it when i hesitated stumped for an answer he threw down his tools again and dont tell me it has anything to do with that abomination he pointed past us toward one of the corners of the sanctuary nearest the entrance partially wrapped in ropes and canvas lying on its side was the gilded statue of cleopatra that had been displayed in the egyptian triumph what is that doing here i said my question exactly arcesilaus stormed over and stopped in front of the statue of the egyptian queen for a moment i thought he might kick it instead he glowered at the thing stamped his feet and came storming back what indeed is thatthat atrocitydoing in this temple dont ask me ask caesar are you telling me caesar intends to install it here in the temple of venus as close to the statue of the goddess as possiblehis exact words without of course detracting from the integrity of your own workalso his exact words without detractingas if such a thing were possible the temple has been built to house the statue the statue has been designed to fulfill the sacred purpose of the temple the two things are one and indivisible to introduce another element especially a piece of garbage such as that thing the spectators at the triumph liked it well enough said diana people appeared to be quite impressed by it he scowled at her i preferred you with your mouth shut thats uncalled for i said do you agree with your daughter then do you think a drunken mob is capable of exercising artistic judgment is that what weve come to between chanting obscene ditties they were momentarily awed by a gaudy statue so now the thing deserves to be installed in a sacred temple next to the work of the greatest sculptor in the world thank the gods lucullus is no longer alive to see this he was close to tears he grabbed my arm rupa darted forward but arcesilaus meant me no harm he pulled me toward the statue of venus look at her he commanded she isnt even finished yeta few places need polishing and no color has yet been added but look at her and tell me what you see i appraised the statue for a long moment i see the goddess venus she stands with one arm bent back to touch her shoulder and her other arm slightly extended the pose is exquisite is it not i nodded yes one of her breasts is bare her naked breast captures the exact weight and texture of actual flesh does it not you can almost feel the supple warm skin beneath your fingertips you can almost see her bosom rise and fall as if she breathes yes i whispered and her face serene wise beautiful i thought of arsinoes face when rupa kissed her toe and the molding of her gown the way the folds bend and drape i shook my head in amazement they look as if the slightest breeze might stir them exactly what you see is made of stone and yet the longer you look at her the more she appears to be alive breathing watchingas if she might step down from her pedestal at any moment the effect was indeed uncanny i truly felt as if the statue of venus gazed back at me unnerved i lowered my eyes at the base of the statue i noticed the finishing detail which arcesilaus had been adding when we entered it was the artists famous hallmark an image of a rampant satyr now come over here he gripped my arm and led me to the statue of cleopatra what do you see i frowned it seems a bit unfair to make a comparison the statue is lying on its side after all and would it look any less stiff and lifeless if it stood upright its a different sort of statue i argued it depicts a living human being for one thing not a goddess and yet it seems less alive less present in the room than does the image of venus he was right the workmanship of cleopatras statue was decidedly inferior the gilded bronze which had been so dazzling under the hot sun was less impressive in the dim light of the sanctuary in fact it looked a bit tawdry the statue was not without beauty but compared to the venus it was only a lifeless piece of metal it hurts my eyes even to look at it declared arcesilaus yet caesar insists that it be placed here in the temple where it will upset the whole balance perhaps it will only point out the superior nature of your venus i said thats not how it works he snapped bad art diminishes good art the closer the proximity the greater the damage have you pointed this out to caesar youve been working on the venus for a long time he told me i realize youre exhausted and here i am posing you yet another challenge but youll rise to it arcesilaus youll find the ideal spot for the queens image you can do it as if this were just another part of my commission an opportunity to create something harmonious and beautiful for which i should be gratefulinstead of an insult to everything ive achieved in a lifetime of making art i drew a sharp breath how harmless was arcesilauss rant had he ever before expressed such rancor against caesar and had hieronymus been there to hear it i couldnt remember encountering any mention of the sculptors animosity against caesar in hieronymuss reports why do you think caesar wants this statue in the temple i asked can there be a religious purpose cleopatra is linked to the egyptian goddess isis so she is said arcesilaus but isis is a manifestation of the greek goddess artemis our goddess diananot venus no the image of cleopatra cannot possibly be construed as another image of venus isnt it obvious why caesar wants that statue in a temple that honors his ancestress he means to honor the mother of his own child i think youre wrong there i said remembering my recent conversation with caesar and the absence of caesarion in the egyptian triumph and yet a man like caesar liked to keep all his options open he also liked to keep people guessing perhaps you know caesars mind better than i do granted arcesilaus why did he send you here today anyway it wasnt about this other thing was it he indicated another corner of the sanctuary where a large placard made of cloth on a wooden frame was propped against a wall i drew closer and examined it it was an image of a calendar painted in the traditional style with the abbreviated names of months across the top and columns of numerals beneath marking the days with the kalends ides nones and various holidays indicated it was very artistically rendered in many colors with exquisitely wrought letters a calendar i said the calendar said arcesilaus hardly a subject worthy of my talents but since caesar means to announce his new calendar at the same time that he dedicates the temple he wanted an image to unveil so i made this thing myself what do you think its a object of beauty very elegant i dont suppose youve come to check the accuracy someone is supposed to do that before tomorrow no he frowned why did caesar send you here send me thats what you said that caesar sent you no i said i came on his behalf whats the difference arcesilaus scowled i wanted to check that the route from the forum to the temple was safe for caesar to traverse is that your job i considered how to answer well as a matter of fact its the sort of thing my son meto does on caesars behalf but meto is away from rome and as long as i was here i thought id have a look inside the temple not one word of this was a lie arcesilaus was indignant do you mean ive been wasting my time standing here and talking to you and for no good reason get out all three of you at once i took diana by the arm and turned toward the exit arcesilauss demeanor was so threatening that rupa lagged behind as if to make sure the artist didnt follow us but when i looked back he had returned to the statue of cleopatra and was glaring down at it while i watched he gave it a hard kick then shouted a curse to venus while the dull hollow ring of the metal resounded through the chamber arcesilaus hopped about and clutched his injured toe xix for the rest of the day diana and i sorted and read through hieronymuss notes she questioned me about the material i had already read and i did the same with her we divided the material that remained unexamined determined to read every word before the day was done whether against my will or not diana had insinuated herself into my work so it seemed pointless not to bring her fully into the process to take advantage of her interest and of her sometimes surprisingly keen insight she spotted certain meanings within hieronymuss puns that had eluded me and being more abreast of current gossip caught certain allusions to personal relationships and such that i had overlooked but none of her insights added materially to our knowledge of who had killed hieronymus or whether that person posed a threat to caesar or when or how the killer might strike again despite all our combined efforts and a great deal of discussion and speculation i went to bed that night believing i was no closer to knowing the truth than before the next day along with everyone else in rome my family set out to witness the african triumph since we would later be attending the dedication of the temple of venus genetrix a sacred ritual i wore my best toga for a great many people i suspect attending caesars fourth and final triumph was done more from perseverance than pleasure it is a roman traitto see a thing through to its end the same dogged determination that has made us the possessors of a vast empire applies to every other aspect of life just as our generals do not raise sieges or surrender on the battlefield no matter how great the casualties so romans do not walk out in the middle of plays no matter how boring the performance and those who can read do not begin a book without finishing it and by jupiter no matter how repetitious all the pomp and spectacle the people of rome did not attend caesars three consecutive triumphs without attending the fourth and final one as well senators paraded with brutus and cicero looking more bored and aloof than ever trumpets sounded and the oxen lumbered by along with the priests and the camilli the boys and girls who would take part in the sacrifices captured treasures and trophies were presented caesar did not presume to show off the roman arms he had captured in battleeven his most loyal partisans would not have approved of thatbut there were a number of placards illustrating the ends met by his roman opponents in africa we beheld a succession of suicides each more wretched than the last metellus scipio pompeys successor as commander in chief after being defeated by caesar at the battle of thapsus stabbed himself and leaped into the sea the placard showed him in midjump above stormy waves with blood trailing from his wound another leader of the opposition marcus petreius fled after the battle of thapsus and holed up for a while with king juba when the two realized they had no further hope they held a sumptuous banquet and engaged in a ritual combat so that at least one could have an honorable death juba won the contest the placard showed petreius lying dead of his wounds and the king in the act of falling on his own bloody sword catos suicide had been the messiest he might have received a pardon from caesar but he did not desire it after a quiet evening with friends he withdrew to his chambers and attempted to disembowel himself his effort was only partly successful perhaps due to a wounded hand and when he knocked over a table his servants came running to find their masters belly bleeding and cut open but with his bowels intact a physician was called to stuff his entrails back inside and to sew him up an indignity to which cato in a dazed state submitted but when he regained consciousness and saw what had happened he tore open the wound pulled out his bowels with his bare hands and suffered an agonizing death the placard depicting the death of cato was obscenely graphic the crowd was already uneasy after viewing the previous illustrations when the image of cato passed before them they grumbled sullenly and many began to boo the restiveness of the crowd was relieved somewhat by the animal show which introduced an african beast never before seen in rome with their long necks the creatures towered above the throng the tallest of them loped by on eye level with those of us in the top of the stands a crier explained that this was the camelopard socalled because in some respects it resembled the camel having long spindly legs and a camellike face while its spotted skin resembled that of a leopard but its extremely long neck made the creature unique children laughed and grown men gawked the spectacle provided by the camelopards did much to restore the crowds good mood there were no romans among the paraded captives only africans numidians and other foreign allies of the opposition but here too caesar provided an unexpected novelty as arsinoe had been the first princess to be paraded in a triumph and ganymedes and his fellow eunuchs were the first of their kind so this triumph also featured a first a baby the last and most prized of the captives did not walk with the rest he might have been able to toddle but could not possibly have kept up instead he reclined upon a small litter carried by other captives there were gasps and cries of astonishment as people realized what they were seeing the infant son of the late king juba i scanned the faces of the dignitaries in the box opposite our seats curious to see their reaction among the staid ambassadors and diplomats i saw a beautiful woman fulvia the woman who intended to marry marc antony was still chiefly regarded as the widow of curio caesars lieutenant whose head had been taken by king juba as a trophy early in the war caesar had given fulvia a place of honor to view this triumph which celebrated jubas downfall as she gazed at jubas tiny namesake among the captives there was a look of grim satisfaction on her face but most of the women in the crowdand most of the men for that matterhad a different reaction people frowned muttered and shook their heads some looked aghast did caesar intend to have the child strangled at the conclusion of his triumph did he imagine that such a killing would be pleasing to jupiter we were not kept in suspense for long a crier announced that caesar intended to show clemency to the infant son of juba the child would be spared just as arsinoe had been spared a sigh of relief spread through the crowd caesar is merciful people shouted and good for caesar i looked at fulvia whose face registered a different reaction she lowered her eyes and clenched her jaw when had caesar decided to spare young juba he apparently had planned to execute arsinoe and changed his mind only at the last moment in response of the crowds reaction had he likewise planned to kill jubas child until the affair with arsinoe made him realize that the mob would not stand for it caesar was not above slaughtering infants how many babies had been among the forty thousand victims at avaricum in gaul caesar had taken no steps to spare those children even to make them slaves at length caesar appeared in his gold chariot even he seemed to be a bit tired of so much triumphing waging war and wrangling with political rivals wears on a man but so does pomp and ceremony the smile on his face looked forced and brittle following caesar at the head of the veterans of the african campaign rode young gaius octavius he was outfitted as a decorated officer even though he had taken no part in the african campaign or in any other military operation at the sight of him people cheered he made a dashing figure and sometimes appearances are all that matter the smile on his lips was ambiguous was he embarrassed to be receiving accolades he had not earned was he scornful of the masses who cheered him for no reason or was he simply a young man happy to be riding in the company of his distinguished older relative pleased with himself and with his special place in the world the triumph concluded without incident the prisoners except young juba were duly executed and a sacrifice was offered in gratitude to jupiter atop the capitoline then without a pause attended by a vast retinue of officer senators and priests caesar began to make his way down the capitoline heading for the new temple of venus after the triumph my family and i remained in the stands for a while waiting for the crowd to thin as we began to descend i saw a nowfamiliar figure mounting the steps heading toward us it was calpurnias messenger the look on his face was grim he was too out of breath to speak without a word he extended a tablet toward me i took it from him undid the ties and opened it the letters had been so crudely scratched in the waxas if in haste or great agitationthat for a moment i could make no sense of them then all at once the words jumped out at me porsenna is dead come to me at once the messenger will bring you i lowered the tablet bethesda was staring at me from her she said yes i must go with this fellow take rupa with you of course and you and the family we shall attend the dedication of the temple as we planned in the standing area i presume while caesar had arranged for us to have seats in the stands for his triumphs he had not followed up with any such arrangement for the dedication i had tried to explain to bethesda that the seating for the ceremony was strictly limited but she was not happy if you hurry i said perhaps you can still find a good spot not too far back diana drew close to me what does calpurnia say is there some sort of trouble the haruspex is dead murdered i presume i should come with you papa i think not the woman is quite particular about whom shell allow into her presence but rupa is going with you rupa is my bodyguard if i were your son instead of your daughter youd take me along without question whether this was true or not i was no mood to argue and the messenger was growing impatient he deftly took the tablet from my hand rubbed out the letters and pulled at my toga we should hurry please he said davus look after diana i said fearful that she would try to follow against my orders rupa come with me we followed the man down the steps and into the crowd i had assumed that the messenger would lead me to the house of calpurnia but he turned in the opposite direction where are you taking us i said suddenly suspicious to the mistress of course he gripped my toga again i knocked his hand away this isnt the way to the palatine the palatine where she lives shes not at home she at the temple of venus please hurry of course i thought the dictators wife would have to attend the dedication no matter what had happened to her haruspex i followed quickly realizing diana and the family could have come at least partway with me after all but it was too late for them to rejoin me we were separated by the crowd the open square before the temple was already thronged with people and more were arriving from all directions the standing area looked uncomfortably crowdedi had to wonder where diana and the family would find spacebut the benches nearer the temple were not yet filled dignitaries are often the last to arrive some sat while others milled about and conversed with their neighbors the atmosphere was much like that at the theater before the crier announces that the play will begin in front of the seating area at the foot of the temple steps a large space was being kept clear by a row of lictors here a marble altar had been erected for the ritual sacrifice close by the altar a long ceremonial tent had been set up within the tent those participating in the dedication could gather and prepare unseen by the crowd the messenger led me toward the tent the lictor at the entrance refused to let rupa come inside it seemed pointless to argue the area within that tent was probably the safest most secure place in all rome i stepped from harsh sunlight into the diffused warm glow of the tent i smelled incense and flowers as my eyes adjusted the first thing i saw was the ox intended for sacrifice it was a magnificent white beast its horns garlanded with flowers and laurel leaves it was circled by the young camilli holding shallow libation bowls to receive the spilled blood and the severed organs that would be offered to the goddess some of the boys and girls were washing the flanks of the ox with woolen cloths that had been dipped in warm jasminescented water while others were daubing the animals hooves with cinnabar to stain them red the ox stood quite still its heavylidded eyes gazing straight ahead seeming to bask in their attentions as my eyes continued to adjust i saw others in the tent most were priests and lictors but there were a few senators and other men in togas as well arcesilaus was also there wearing a tunic covered with dust and spotted with paint the large placard displaying the new calendar had been placed on a stand where it could be worked on and he appeared to be making lastminute alterations with a set of paints while another mannot a roman to judge by his egyptian jewelry and pleated linen gownlooked on the artist glanced over his shoulder saw me and scowled you he said his perfunctory salutation canceled any need for pleasantries let me guess i said the calendar contains an error and this fellow is one of cleopatras astronomers from alexandria advising you on the necessary correction and with plenty of time to spare said arcesilaus sarcastically the fellow never showed up yesterday only now am i being told that the extra day in februarius during a leap year is added six days before the kalends of martius not eight ridiculous so now after all my painstaking effort this little presentation will look as slapdash as if id turned it out on the spur of the moment caesar isnt paying me enough to endure this torment his voice rose to a yell he began to quake vibrating like a plucked string and raised his fists in the air the veins in his biceps bulging like the vein in his forehead the alexandrian started back in fear but arcesilauss attention was wholly on the placard he looked as if he intended to beat it with his fists and it was easy to imagine the delicate thing being totally demolished in a matter of heartbeats he was restrained by a hand on one shoulder dont do it artist said calpurnia dont even think of it there was a shrill edge to her voice that made me shiver even the hotblooded arcesilaus was chilled by it the vein pulsing across his forehead vanished like a snake disappearing into the earth muttering he turned back to the placard and resumed his work before i could speak calpurnia gripped my arm and led me to a spot away from the others my slave gave you the message yes porsenna is dead murdered stabbed just like hieronymus when and how my messenger found porsennas body in his house on the aventine less than an hour ago porsenna was to join me before the end of the triumph so that we could come to the temple together you planned to appear with porsenna in public where caesar might see the two of you together i thought it was your wish that caesar should never know you were consulting a haruspex i dont care any longer what caesar knows or doesnt know the danger is too greatand this proves it yesterday porsenna was more certain than ever of the menace to caesar he told me that today would be the day of greatest danger and the place of greatest danger would be here at the dedication of the temple and now porsenna is dead it was your messenger who found his body yes call him over let me speak to him she summoned the slave your mistress sent you to the house of porsenna on the aventine had you been there before yes said the man many times he had regained his breath but his eyes had a haunted look clearly he was recovering from a shock did porsenna live alone yes except for a single slave and what did you find when you went there today the door was unbarred that was very strange when i stepped inside i found porsennas slave lying in the vestibule his throat was cut it took all my courage not to run the messenger ventured a glance at his mistress wanting her to take note of his bravery but calpurnia was not impressed go on she snapped i called for porsenna but there was no answer i made my way to the garden porsenna was lying on his back in a pool of blood he had been stabbed through the heart the heart i said are you sure the wound was here the slave pointed to his left breast was the blood wet or dry he thought mostly dry but in places still wet had there been a struggle i saw no signs of one i considered if the slave allowed the visitor into the vestibule it may be that the killer was already known in the house and porsenna must not have feared the visitor if he let the man join him in the garden and then stood facing him so that he could be stabbed in the chest conjecture said calpurnia do you prefer conjuring tricks like those porsenna gave you if his powers of prophecy were so great how did he come to such an unexpected end calpurnia fell silent desperation mounted in her eyes gordianus what can we do she whispered surely caesar has taken all precautions i see lictors everywhere its not enough porsenna told me yesterday shields cannot protect him blades cannot protect him amulets and talismans cannot protect him no circle of men can stop the one who seeks to harm him only i can help you porsenna cant help you now what do you think i can possibly do she seized my arm and pulled me to a narrow opening in the tent she peered out at the milling crowd with nervous birdlike movements of her head which of them is it which of them intends to kill caesar gordianus i dont know go out among them listen to what theyre saying look them in the eyes i shook my head calpurnia ive done my best not just for you but for hieronymus i wish they call you finder dont they or they used to because you find the truth i sighed sometimes others see but are blind but when you see the truth you know it thats your gift the truth is there to be found the guilt is already written on someones face go observe listen i took a deep breath ill take a walk through the crowd i said partly because i was now desperate to escape calpurnia but also because there was indeed a chance however slight that i might see or overhear something of significance go she said but return here before the ceremony begins if something goes amiss i want you beside me i turned to leave calpurnia hurried across the tent to uncle gnaeus who had just entered he put his arms around her and she hid her face against his shoulder uncle gnaeus held her tightly and gave me a curt nod as if to dismiss me and send me on my way xx i left rupa standing outside the entrance of the tent telling him to await my return then went to mingle among the dignitaries wearing my best toga i did not feel entirely out of place among my betters the front row of benches had been reserved for the priests camilli and others taking part in the sacrifice and dedication ceremony and for the dictators immediate family most of these seats were empty since their intended occupants were at present inside the tent which made young gaius octavius and his family look all the more conspicuous dressed in spotless armor which had never seen the wear of a single battle octavius sat with his mother atia on one side of him and his sister octavia on the other aulus hirtius stood over him fussing with the straps of octaviuss breastplate something about their adjustment was apparently not quite up to regulation octavius abruptly lost patience and waved hirtius back i almost laughed at the petulant look on his face but when he glanced at me there was nothing at all boyish in his malevolent gaze i hurried on the foremost section of benches were reserved for the highest dignitaries including senators i noticed that cicero had a choice spot on the aisle with brutus sitting next to him or perhaps the spot was not so choice after all for beyond brutus the entire row was filled with gallic senators the boisterous newcomers were talking loudly among themselves in a dialect that mixed their native tongue with latin it seemed to me that cicero and brutus were pointedly trying to ignore their new colleagues even when the man next to brutus repeatedly jostled him cicero saw me and flashed a perfunctory smile then trained his gaze on a figure behind me i turned to see the playwright laberius looking for a seat laberius said cicero the playwright shrugged not in this row senator it will be something further back for the humble likes of me i fear why i should have been glad to have you join our ranks were we not already so pressed for room cicero raised his voice and glared sidelong at the rowdy oversized gauls none of whom took any notice of his sarcasm laberius smiled im surprised that you of all people should be pressed for room senator youre so good at straddling the aisle brutus barked out a laugh before covering his mouth ciceros face grew long this was a barb aimed at his unseemly efforts to please both sides in the civil war laberius looked pleased with himself then caught sight of someone in the section reserved for the wealthy you must all excuse me while i go pay my respects to publilius syrus look at him over there consorting with the millionaires as if he plans to join their ranks quite soon do you suppose the dictator has already promised him the grand prize before weve even performed the plays well pigs paunch shouldnt count his million sesterces yet laberius stalked off i was about to say something to the two senators then realized they were paying me no attention what in hades are they babbling about muttered brutus speaking to cicero and referring to the gauls hard as it is to follow their uncouth dialect said cicero under his breath i think i actually heard one of them say something like he spared the egyptian princess and he spared little king jubayoud think he might have spared vercingetorix as well but i couldnt tell whether the man was joking or not he groaned hercules give me strength the sooner this is over the sooner i can return to the arms of my dear publilia having had enough of ciceros oblivious selfconcern i moved on in a special section reserved for her retinue i saw the queen of egypt resplendent in a multicolored robe and wearing a nemes headdress with a golden uraeus crown in the form of rearing cobra for this occasion of state she sat in a formal pose holding the emblems of her royal status the flail and the crook crossed over her breasts she was surrounded by many consorts that the queen should be present and in such an ostentatious fashion was perhaps not surprising caesar was installing her statue in the temple and it was scholars from the queens library at alexandria who had devised the new calendar which was to be formally presented that day with some surprise i saw the boy caesarion seated next to his mother dressed like a roman child in a simple white tunic with long sleeves caesar must have approved the childs appearance at the event it seemed to me that the contest of wills between caesar and the queen regarding the boys status might yet go one way or the other where was the queens sister arsinoe was still in rome presumably and still a prisoner having brushed so close to death and having survived what role would she play from this point onward gordianus i heard my name called from nearby and turned to see fulvia waving to me caesar had granted her a special seat at the triumph and also at the dedication it seemed she appeared to be in unusually high spirits seated next to her i saw the reason marc antony looking quite handsome and surprisingly sober in his senatorial toga i greeted the two of them fulvia smiled you neednt look so surprised finder antony and i are old friends arent we antony and cytheris does occasionally let him off his leash you were missed at the triumphs i said to antony simply to make conversation the people expected to see you thats exactly what i told him said fulvia it was foolish missing the opportunity to show himself off especially since he earned a place of distinction in every one of those triumphs antony smirked technically i didnt serve at all in the egyptian campaign or in and gaius octavius never served in africa said fulvia yet caesar saw fit to shower the boy with honors and show him off as if octavius himself put an end to king juba you may not have been by caesars side at every moment and in every battle but you were always in his service it was you who made it possible for him to wage war all over the world because it was you who kept his name and his authority alive here in rome antony clutched his head please must i hear all this again is it not enough that im here as you wanted caesar sent you a special invitation to attend this ceremony you could hardly have refused without insulting him dont you see this is his way of initiating a reconciliation with you you couldnt turn your back on such an opportunity nor could you bring her with you for all rome to gawk at apparently cytheris had been left behind at the house of the beaksto brood to pout to plot her own next move it looked as if fulvia might be gaining the upper hand in her campaign to become antonys wife where would her ambitions take them both i looked to see antonys reaction but he was distracted by someone nearby i followed his gaze and saw that he was staring at cleopatra his expression was one of curiosity more than anything else i recalled that he had met her years ago in egypt when she was hardly more than a child having been estranged from caesar he had not gone to visit the queen at caesars villa this was his first look at cleopatra in many years fulvia followed his gaze the queen of troublemakers i call that one she muttered she leaves for egypt soon and without having achieved either one of her goals here her sister still breathes her son is still a bastard but ill wager we havent seen the last of that one i hope not whispered antony fulvia looked at him askance i left these two and continued to stroll among the crowd searching every face i passed the sun was still high the heat of the day sapped my strength my instinct and reason were equally at a loss lurking behind every pair of eyes was a different consciousness with an unknown agenda every face might be utterly innocent every face might be that of a murderer i looked at the rich and powerful who milled among the benches but also at the common people in the crowd beyond they had suffered from the war and its reversals of fortune no less than their betters how many of these men and women had lost a loved one fighting for caesar or against him how many of them harbored feelings of hatred and resentment against the dictator how many among that vast crowd if they could have killed caesar with a thought would have done so a priest on the temple steps blew a shrill fanfare on a pipe signaling that the ceremony was about to begin people took their seats the standing crowd pressed closer i looked among them for bethesda and diana and the rest of my family but saw them nowhere calpurnia had instructed me to return to her and so i did she had moved from the tent and had taken a seat in the front row not far from gaius octavius and his family but i saw no empty seats around her a hush was falling on the crowd so i spoke in a low voice calpurnia if you wish me to stay near you i suppose i could stand over there beyond the tent that is if the lictors will allow it i frowned where has rupa gone i left him at the entrance to the tent i dismissed him she said he couldnt stay there now hush and sit here beside me i pointed out the obvious your uncle gnaeus is sitting there not for long hes performing the sacrifice so hell spend most of the ceremony at the altar the sacrifice the slaughter of the ox why not uncle gnaeus is as qualified as any other priest and it seemed fitting that someone from my side of the family should play a role in the ceremony this day shouldnt be entirely about caesar and the julii and their divine ancestress andand that queen whose statue he insists on putting in the temple next to venus with a haughty flourish uncle gnaeus stood and offered me his seat i sat between calpurnia and a man i had never seen before presumably another of her relatives uncle gnaeus strode toward the altar pulling the mantle of the robe over his head beside me calpurnia continually fidgeted grunted and pulled at her fingers the crowd fell silent the ceremony commenced the camilli led the ox from the tent like the beast the children were strewn with garlands of flowers and laurel leaves while the ox lumbered forward some of the camilli laughed and sang and danced in a circle around it others carried trays of smoking incense they cajoled the creature into ascending a ramp where the priests used hooks to pull it onto its side on the altar and quickly tied its limbs the ox began to bleat in alarm some of the boys and girls assembled on the temple steps and sang a hymn to venus while priests played upon pipes uncle gnaeus stepped forward holding aloft the ceremonial knife the heat of the day the smoking incense and the chanting of the children acted on me like a drug weariness descended on me i bowed my head i closed my eyes i gave a start i opened my eyes i looked around me dazed and saw a most remarkable thing the stranger sitting next to me had vanished in his place sat my friend hieronymus xxi the chanting continued but seemed strangely distant and muted the smoky haze of the incense was thicker and more intoxicating than ever i blinked and rubbed my eyes but there was no doubt hieronymus was sitting next to me he was wearing his favorite pale blue tunic with a black border in a greek key pattern he looked quite strong and fit and younger than i remembered him all gray was gone from his hair and his face had no wrinkles he fixed me with a sardonic gaze what are you doing here i whispered no one else seemed to have noticed his presence not even calpurnia thats hardly a suitable way to greet a man whos back from the dead but this is unbelievable whats unbelievable is the manner in which youve conducted this socalled investigation into my death really gordianus i had no idea you were capable of such incompetence youre too old for this sort of thing time to pass the baton to that eager daughter of yours dont speak of diana shes a beautiful girl isnt she and smart not like that husband of hers poor davus has a brick between his ears but hes strong enough theyll make a good team he can go along and protect her when she sticks her nose into other peoples business the way young rupas been protecting you he craned his long neck and peered around where has rupa got to anyway and where is diana for that matter stop this talk i whispered i glanced at calpurnia who was wringing her hands and muttering to herself the poor womans at her wits end hieronymus clucked his tongue married to the most powerful man in the world and not able to enjoy a moment of it listening to soothsayers crying on her uncles shoulder and hiring the likes of me to uncover the truth for her mind you i did uncover the truth and all on my ownwhich is more than i can say for you gordianus if you found the truth then why isnt it anywhere in your writings didnt you read that passage in my journal but i could be wrong consequences of a false accusationunthinkable must be certain until then not a word in any of my official reports to the lady and her soothsayer well as it turned out my suspicion was correct he sighed which is why this happened i looked at him again and saw a huge bloodstain on his breast above his heart his flesh had turned as pale as ivory but his expression was as sardonic as ever he saw my consternation and laughed but who did this to you hieronymus that is what you were supposed to find out gordianus he rolled his eyes i was stung by his sarcasm help me i pleaded ive already given you all the information you need nonsense the material you left behind was worthless worse than worthless because there was so much of it report after report all written in that thorny cryptic prosenothing but words and more words and nothing of substance for me to grasp calm yourself gordianus emotion will lead you nowhere think youre not hieronymus youre a daemon an evil spirit come to taunt me no gordianus i am hieronymusor at least im the sum of all you ever knew about hieronymus all we can know of another human being is the image before our eyes and the voice in our ears what you see and hear now beside you is as much as you ever knew of hieronymus as real as the man himself here i am crazy greek you confuse me with philosophy simpleminded roman always so literal so mired in facts and figures tell me who killed you say it plainly he sighed first of all accept the proposition that calpurnia is right someone is plotting to kill her husband i figured out who that person was and i discerned the motive as well and because of what i deduced i was killed i was distracted by the lowing of the ox uncle gnaeus was about to cut the creatures throat facing the crowd he raised the knife for all to see the blade glittered in the sunlight looking huge and very sharp he struck the blow metal sliced into flesh the ox thrashed its bound limbs scarlet poured from the wound camilli rushed forward with their libation bowls to catch the spouting blood have you considered the suspicious behavior of agapios the door slave at the building where i lived said hieronymus watching the slaughter without emotion he had never been squeamish what do you mean really gordianus when a fellow that young flirts with a fellow your age it can only be because he has an ulterior motive not necessarily the vagaries of human nature are reducible to the narrow parameters of selfinterest young agapios is a spy in addition to his regular duties he also kept an eye on me he was always stopping me on the stairs to chat especially when id come home a little drunk after a party who knows what information he got out of me i suspect he also looked through my journal occasionally despite my efforts to hide it a spy for his mistress you mean i looked sidelong at calpurnia who was watching her uncle perform the sacrifice what sort of madwoman set a spy to watch her own spy hieronymus shook his head agapios is the property of calpurnia but he didnt report to her he reported to uncle gnaeus thats why the old priest was so angry when he found that agapios had given you the key to my rooms without his knowledge the sacrifice was proceeding wielding the huge knife his hands smeared with blood gnaeus calpurnius was carving the ox removing one organ after another the camilli gathered around him with their libation bowls to receive the kidneys the heart the liver and the rest one at a time with prayers and chants these were offered to venus then placed upon a pyre the organs popped and sizzled transformed by the flames into divine sustenance for the goddess i found your journal hieronymus by now i must have read every word of it and so has diana we discovered nothing untrue you found the key dont you remember to any seeker who finds these words and would unlock the truth i shall leave a key yes yes i remember look all around the truth is not found in the words but the words may be found in the truth but where was this key i never found it the words themselves were the key where did you find them in your journal of course i snapped exasperated but where did you find the journal what was all around it the pages were inside a scroll and what was that scroll i tried to remember i shook my head think gordianus i was with you even then i spoke inside your head what did i say i remembered now i had found the journal because i saw my copy of manius calpurniuss life of king numa among the books on hieronymuss shelf i was peeved that he had taken it without my permission so i reached for it and inside it i found the pages of his private journal i had sensed that hieronymus was watching i had imagined his voice in my head how predictable you are gordianus you saw your precious copy of numa and felt compelled to check at once that i hadnt damaged ityou did exactly as i intended you found my private notes intended for my eyes only while i lived but now that im dead i wanted you to find my journal gordianus tucked inside your precious numa the sight of the numa had lured me to find the journal but the numa itself was the keythe truth within which the words were found its author was a calpurnius one of numas descendants like caesars wife and her uncle no one cared more about the legacy of numa than uncle gnaeus and numa had left no greater legacy than his calendar which was meant to fix for all time the sacred days and the manner of reckoning them and what about my notations regarding celestial movements said hieronymus didnt you connect those to my interest in the calendar yes but where did you learn all that from uncle gnaeus of course it was when i saw how he ranted against caesars intention to change the calendar that i first became suspicious of him after that my continuing curiosity about the calendar made him suspicious of me but i asked uncle gnaeus whether he instructed you about astronomy and he denied it he said he wouldnt waste his effort on his nieces foreignborn minion hieronymus snorted and you believed him that man would gladly lecture anyone who asked about the calendarslave freedman foreigner or even femalefor hours on end he shook his head ruefully you used to appreciate a puzzle gordianusthe more baffling the better whats become of your powers of deduction gone to hades along with your powers of observation i suppose what is that supposed to mean what a fuss calpurnia made over you earlier how did she put it others see but are blind but when you see the truth you know it yet earlier today at the triumph it was what you did not see that mattered but at the time you took no notice and now its completely slipped your mind what are you talking about who was not in the procession who should have been i shrugged marc antony please you can do better than that i thought cicero and brutus had been among the senators gaius octavius had ridden with the troops as intended and amid the priests by hercules uncle gnaeus didnt march with the other priests today i saw the priests and he wasnt among them youre right i took no notice of that i saw but i did not observe its only now thinking back that i realize he wasnt there and where might he have been at the house of porsenna murdering the haruspex up at the altar uncle gnaeus having completed his dismemberment of the ox was wiping the blade with a piece of wool staining the cloth bright red and making the knife ready for its next victim his clothing daubed with blood and viscera uncle gnaeus left the altar and stepped into the tent where the camilli would wash his hands and dress him in new spotless vestments hieronymus nodded thats the very knife he used to kill porsenna earlier todaythe same knife he used to kill me when i went to report to calpurnia that night in fact i still wasnt quite ready to share my suspicions of uncle gnaeus with her but he saw the signs and knew i was drawing close he was lying in wait for me in the darkness the old man is stronger than he looks he knows how to use that blade and he knows exactly where a mans heart is located i averted my eyes from hieronymus your murder i understand but why porsenna we can conjecture that the two of them were in league from the start each working upon calpurnia to gain her trust and to garner her intimate knowledge of caesars intentions uncle gnaeus believed that the etruscan soothsayer was on his side a fellow proponent of oldfashioned religion and a defender of the old calendar porsennas job was to fill calpurnias head with false suspicions to deflect her attention from the real threat her own uncle but porsenna was playing his own game what if at the very last momenttodaythe haruspex revealed what uncle gnaeus was up to and saved caesars life thus proving his powers of divination and his devotion to the dictator calpurnia would fall even more deeply under his spell he might win even caesars trust what soothsayer doesnt lust after that kind of power and influence i nodded but uncle gnaeus grew suspicious of his partner yes porsenna was the one person remaining who could ruin his plans so uncle gnaeus decided to put an end to him during the triumph he slipped away from the procession and murdered the haruspex in his home then hurried here in time for the ceremony i frowned the one person who could ruin his plans what about me uncle gnaeus considered killing you he very nearly did when two days ago in the public latrine during the asian triumph did you think it was a coincidence that he happened to join you he was marching by in the procession and spotted you in the crowd when he saw you slip into the latrine he followed you you thought he was fiddling with his robes attempting to relieve himselfwhen in fact he was reaching for his knife deciding whether or not to kill you why didnt he you were very close to death gordianusas close as youve ever been you felt it brush against you you shivered but gnaeus calpurnius decided you were harmless you knew nothing or rather you knew all you needed to know yet you still did not suspect him he chose to let you live hieronymus looked at me sadly and shook his head the accident that occurred during the first triumph when the axle of caesars chariot brokewas gnaeus calpurnius responsible for that what do you think gordianus caesar himself suspected sabotage as a priest uncle gnaeus would have had access to the sacred chariot but i cant imagine him crawling under the carriage and sawing through the axle perhaps not but he could have suborned some mischievous young camillus to do so but what was the point caesar was unharmed such an accident could hardly be counted on to kill him uncle gnaeuss intent was not to harm caesar but to turn the people against him uncle gnaeus is a very religious man he expected the crowd to be awed and shaken by such an ill omen how frustrating it must have been for him that the incident actually lightened the mood of the spectators he became more determined than ever to take matters into his own hands hieronymus turned his gaze to the tent and smiled but look he said theres caesar now stepping out of the tent and mounting the steps listen to the people cheer caesar still wore the goldembroidered toga and the laurel crown of a triumphing general he walked to the top of the temple steps where he could be seen by the crowd the cheering was thunderous caesar raised his hands the tumult subsided he delivered a brief speech i couldnt follow the words they seemed muffled and garbled as if my head were underwater i heard only snatchessomething about venus my ancestress and the promise i made at pharsalus and the dawn of a new world a new age even a new way of reckoning the days that are sacred to the gods from the tent the placard inscribed with the new calendar was carried by priests to a place on the steps just below caesar the people of rome beheld their dictator and his new calendar the image conveyed an awesome truth caesar the descendant of a goddess was master not just of space but also of time on the steps of the temple he had made in front of the calendar he had decreed his divine power was made manifest but even demigods are not immortal and now for the crime of sacrilege for presuming to replace the agesold calendar of numa caesar would die and the agent of the gods wrath would be gnaeus calpurnius the old priest attired in spotless vestments stepped out of the tent and quickly mounted the steps no one tried to stop him he had been the priest in charge of the sacrifice after all even caesar seeing his inlaw approach thought nothing of it uncle gnaeus pulled the sacred blade from his vestments and thrust with all his might caesar never even flinched it requires only a single blow to the heart to kill a man caesar could be made to die just as easily as all the men and women and children whom he himself had killed in a long life of killingall the gauls and massilians and egyptians and romans and peoples of asia all the kings and princes and pharaohs all the consuls and senators officers and foot soldiers struggling commoners and starving beggars every man dies and caesar thanks to uncle gnaeus was shown to be no exception caesar might be forgiven for all the death and suffering he had inflicted on others warfare is the way of the world after all but for what he had done to numas sacrosanct calendarcorrupting it with egyptian sorcery and false religionhe could not be allowed to live caesar staggered lurched and fell forward against the placard the weight of his dying body broke the wooden frame and ripped the fabric down the middle caesar tumbled down the temple steps triumphant uncle gnaeus raised the knife and slashed the bloody blade against the remains of the calendar destroying the hated object in a religious frenzy all the while crying out the name of his ancestor king numa the spectators gasped wailed cheered screamed calpurnia shrieked ran to caesars lifeless body and tore at her hair like a madwoman hieronymus imperturbable fixed me with his sardonic gaze gordianus gordianus how is it that you failed to anticipate this event and prevent it even your daughter turning the facts over and over in her mind has come to realize the truth i told you she was smart not knowing where you are failing to find you in the crowd she thinks to warn caesar herself look there she is at the entrance to the tent sure enough i saw diana pleading and arguing with a lictor to let her enter above the tumult i was able to hear her voice and catch a few phrases but you must to warn him caesar will know who i amtell him its the sister of meto gordianus hieronymus laid his hand on mine i could not feel his touch i was never here old friend he said yet i am always with you i was blinded by tears i closed my eyes i gave a start when i opened my eyes hieronymus was gone i blinked and looked around dazed the sacrifice was over the priests and the camilli had vanished the temple steps were vacant where is uncle gnaeus i whispered next to me calpurnia raised an eyebrow why hes in the tent of course changing his vestments he did a splendid job with the sacrifice havent you been watching i must have closed my eyes for a moment and caesar hes in the tent too he should be stepping out to speak any moment now calpurnia frowned but isnt that your daughter over there arguing with the lictor sure enough diana was at the entrance of the tent it must have been the sound of her voice that woke me to warn him i heard her say dont you understand if only my father were here caesar would the grimfaced lictor was unmoved diana finally relented she slumped her shoulders defeated and stepped back the lictor let down his guard diana bolted past him and disappeared into the tent caesar was in the tent so was uncle gnaeus with his knife i rose from the bench and ran toward the tent the lictor following diana had abandoned his post and i was able to slip inside unopposed my eyes were slow to adjust to the filtered light i saw a confusion of people and objectspriests camilli garlands sacred vessels at the far end of the tent i saw the calendar arcesilaus was still working to complete his lastminute corrections caesar his back to me was hovering over the artist his arms crossed tapping the ground impatiently with one foot papa diana had been apprehended by the lictor who was roughly escorting her back toward the entrance but uncle gnaeus still dressed in his bloodstained vestments seized her arm as she passed by leave the girl with me lictor his voice was low but insistent are you sure pontifex yes go back to guarding the entrance what about this fellow the lictor indicated me hell be leaving very soon very quietly isnt that right gordianus uncle gnaeus spoke through clenched teeth his grip on dianas arm was very tight in his other hand he held the knife my heart pounded in my chest the moment felt unrealfar more unreal than my dreamconversation with hieronymus i spoke in a whisper gnaeus calpurnius you cant succeed i wont let you i have only to shout a warning to caesar but you wont do that not while im holding your daughter now go quietly i shook my head if you hurt diana if i shoutdont you see it cant happen now not the way you intended not in the middle of caesars presentation for all rome to witness your grand gesture has been spoiled he considered for a moment then nodded youre right it cant happen as i planned ill do it here in the tent then what matters is that the thing is done not how or where or who sees it as long as you and the girl keep your mouths shut i neednt harm either of you it will take only a moment for me to cross the tent and do what i have to do stay silent gordianus and you do the same girl while we walk together toward caesar i stood frozen to the spot what did i owe to caesar nothing was he worth my daughters life certainly not how many crimes had caesar committed how many deaths had he caused how much suffering had he inflicted on others was there any reason at all that i should try to save his life i heard dianas answer in my head people are beginning to live againto hope to plan to think about the future if caesar were to be murdered the killing would start all over again amid the preoccupied priests and camilli who chattered among themselves preparing for the next part of the ceremony gnaeus calpurnius was making his way across the tent taking diana with him caesar stood with his back to us he and arcesilaus were exchanging heated words about the calendarwhy was it not ready and who was responsible for the mistake how strange that the conqueror of the world should be spending his last moments on earth wrangling over such an insignificant detail i stood dumbfounded it was going to happennot as i had dreamed it but as circumstance and the will of gnaeus calpurnius decreed in a matter of heartbeats caesar would be dead and the fate of the world would diverge from whatever course caesar had intended gordianus uncle gnaeus whats going on sweeping past the lictor calpurnia followed me into the tent she spoke in a loud gruff whisper caesar didnt hear but uncle gnaeus did distracted he turned and looked at his niece there was only an instant in which the thing could be done i acted without thinking when men do such things we say that the will of a god animates them but i felt nothing experienced nothing thought nothing as i seized a libation bowl from a camillus standing nearby flipped it upside down and flung it at the man who held my daughter the shallow bowl hurtled spinning through the air and struck uncle gnaeus squarely on the forehead he lost his grip on diana she slipped away from him in the blink of an eye with a stupefied expression he staggered backward then forward he lurched toward caesar out of control he still held the knife for a dreadful moment i thought he would yet sink the blade into caesars chestfor caesar had turned and now stood facing him looking confused but uncle gnaeus careened past caesar past arcesilaus and hurtled headlong into the calendar the placard was ripped asunderthat part of my dream at least came true uncle gnaeus tumbled head over heels the knife flew from his grasp he came to a halt and lay groaning and dazed on the ground amid the ruined remains of the calendar red faced and sputtering arcesilaus looked ready to explode calpurnia let out a little scream and swooned the lictor caught her diana ran into my arms she trembled like a doe the priests and camilli cried out in confusion and caesar caesar alone of everyone in that tent appreciated the absolute absurdity of the moment resplendent in his goldembroidered toga wearing his crown of laurel leaves the descendant of venus and master of the world put his hands on his hips threw back his head and laughed xxii i sat in my garden by the calendarcaesars new calendarexactly a year had passed since the dedication of the temple of venus genetrix in fact the days that had transpired numbered substantially more than a year before the new calendar could begin some sixty or so days were simply added to the old calendar of numa which then expired forever the correction had successfully realigned the days with the seasons and so on the twentysixth day of september six days before the kalends of october in the year one of caesars calendar i sat in my garden enjoying the mild weather of early fall noting wistfully how short the days were growing it seemed strange in a way that september should again be an autumnal month and not the middle of summer but a part of me deep within felt gratified beyond words mans calendar and the calendar of the cosmos had been reconciled a flaw in the manmade world had been set right and we had caesar to thank for that sitting in my garden i thought back to the events of a year ago immediately following gnaeus calpurniuss unwitting destruction of the placard confusion reigned caesar laughed arcesilaus raged lictors sought to remove diana and me from the tent but i managed to make my way to calpurnia in a hurried whisper i told her all i had realized about uncle gnaeus she was in such a state that i couldnt be certain she understood me the lictors swept me away the ceremony proceeded on the temple steps showing not a trace of discomposure caesar announced the introduction of his new calendar but without the placard and without uncle gnaeus who was nowhere to be seen calpurnia too had vanished days passed i attempted to visit calpurnia i was not admitted nor did i hear from her i did not hear from caesar either he might at least have thanked me for saving his life i brooded in silence until finally i wrote a message to calpurnia i pointed out that my purpose in assisting her had been first and foremost to discover the killer of hieronymus and to obtain justice for my murdered friend did she understand what i had told her in the tent did caesar understand what had occurred what did the two of them intend to do about it rashly perhaps i demanded that the killer of hieronymus must be punished i told her i had no intention of seeing the matter swept under the carpet the next day i received her reply i regret to inform you that uncle gnaeus is no longer with us the night of the dedication he succumbed to a sudden illnessa fever followed by delirium copious sweating and a seizure which stopped his heart he died like a proud roman praising the achievements of our ancestors to his final breath numa was the last word he spoke you may remember his unfortunate fall in the tent earlier that day there are some who claim they saw a person throw an object at uncle gnaeus caesar himself did not witness the onset of my uncles staggering fall but i did and i have explained to caesar that it appeared to be caused by a sudden fit or spasm caesar apologized profusely for laughing at uncle gnaeuss clumsiness he thinks this strange spasm must have been the first symptom of my uncles illness caesar is surely right as i am certain you will agree should caesar ever discuss the matter with you the funeral was conducted in a very private manner as my uncle would have wished i made no public announcement as i did not want sad news to spoil the peoples enjoyment of caesars generous entertainments as for the matter you raised in your last message to me we shall never speak of it again along with the note the messenger delivered a small but very heavy box i considered sending it backi had told calpurnia i would accept no paymentbut bethesda had seen the box and demanded to know what was inside i let her sort the coins and tally their value the task gave her great pleasure justice of a sort had prevailed a year had passed and in all that time i had received no more visits from hieronymus in my dreams or otherwise did that mean his lemur was at peace i hoped so the triumphs of caesar marked the end of the old world and the beginning of the new but the dedication of the temple of venus genetrix was only the midpoint in the festivities the days that followed were full of yet more feasting and celebration as the people of rome were presented with a dazzling array of diversions including plays which were staged all over the city syrus took first place among the playwrights and the prize of a million sesterces laberiuswho presented his satire uncut including the thinly veiled references to caesarcame in second and received half a million sesterces caesars fawning admirer and his sardonic critic both became wealthy men thanks to the largesse of the dictator there were chariot races athletic competitions and equestrian exhibitions in the newly expanded circus maximus there were contests in which gladiators were pitted against wild beasts spectacular reenactments of famous battles were staged in a special enclosure on the field of mars in which hundreds of captives and condemned men fought to the death a naval battle was waged on a manmade lake created especially for the purpose using a thousand men on each side many died fighting or were drowned when their ships were set afire and sank the citizens of rome grew sated with spectacle the gory gladiator contests and staged battles created carnage on such a huge scale that some spectators began to question whether caesar had not already caused enough bloodshed others were outraged at the profligacy of caesars expenditures it was said that the dictator had robbed the whole world of its wealth and was now squandering his illgotten gains like a drunken brigand most dissenters did no more than grumble but at one point a group of disgruntled soldiers staged a small riot in the forum caesar chancing to come upon the disturbance with his lictors apprehended one of the ringleaders with his own hands the priest of mars declared that three of the rioters must be put to death the executions were carried out as a religious riteyet another occasion for celebration the men were sacrificed on the field of mars their heads were placed on stakes in the forum did their grisly punishment remind people of the atrocities of sulla such thoughts were spoken only in whispers eventually the celebrations came to an end life went on to deal with the last remnants of the pompeian opposition caesar left rome for spain gaius octavius had fallen ill and could not travel with him in the month of martius by the new calendar a decisive battle took place on the plains of munda caesar lost a thousand men the enemy lost thirty thousand the opposition was crushed young octavius arrived too late to take part in the slaughter back in rome marc antony put aside cytheris and married fulvia she encouraged him to travel to the spanish frontier where he placed himself at caesars disposal and the two men were reconciled brutus completed his term as governor of cisalpine gaul then was appointed by caesar to serve as a praetor in rome just when he appeared to be solidly in caesars camp and rising in the dictators favor he married porcia the daughter of catoa union that must surely have displeased caesar beyond his glib facade there was an independent and unpredictable streak in brutuss character cicero was suffering a terrible year first his beloved daughter died in childbirth when publilia made some tactless comment about the tragedy cicero summarily divorced her alone and miserable with his personal life in shambles and his political ambitions at an end he had withdrawn to one of his country estates to seek the consolations of philosophy cleopatra was back in egypt by all accounts she was a competent ruler and a steadfast ally of rome she was said to be planning another visit to rome in the coming year her son remained unacknowledged by caesar arsinoe was residing in exile in ephesus at rupas insistence i sent her a letter asking after her health she never replied perhaps the letter was seized by her keepers despite caesars apparent invincibility his wifes morbid dread of the future was as acute as ever following the death of porsenna calpurnia found a new haruspex his name was spurinna and he appeared to exercise an equally powerful hold over her now caesar was on his way back to rome where preparations were underway for his spanish triumph the event was to be stupendous eclipsing even last years triumphs i would have dreaded the forthcoming pomp and ceremony but for one reason to take part in the planning arriving ahead of caesar my son meto was finally returning to rome i expected him at any moment diana had promised to show him immediately to the garden upon his arrival so that i might see him alone for a little while before the rest of the family greeted him and claimed his attention shadows were lengthening the september air grew chill i wrapped my cloak around me i was beginning to despair of his arrival when diana appeared i read the smile on her face meto stepped from behind her diana withdrew i rose to embrace him for a long moment neither of us spoke when at last i stepped back i did what i always did upon seeing him after a long absence i surveyed his body for any new scars and checked his limbs for any signs of lameness but the gods continued to protect him despite the terrible risks he took in battle he was as sound and whole as when i last saw him how remarkably handsome he had become i can say this without vanity since he was not of my making mopsus brought wine and water meto asked about the family all are well i said theyll join us soon even your brother is here if you can believe it i almost never see eco these days he got back just yesterday from a job that took him all the way to athens meto laughed eco the finder he must stay very busy seeking truth and justice for the people of rome while you sit here in your garden papa basking in your retirement i merely nodded meto inquired about events in rome i told him the latest news then asked about his life on the battlefield actually now that the fighting is over ive put aside my sword and picked up my stylus he said i spend most of my time working on the latest volume of caesars memoirs it must be a great challenge to distill such extraordinary experiences into a few words indeed but the research is the biggest challenge research its a memoir not a work of history you lived every moment of it or rather caesar did yes but caesar is very keen to verify every factual statement and all the various claims he makes for example did you know that hes fought a total of fifty pitched battles fifty thats a record as far as i can determinemore than any other commander in the history of rome the closest competitor i can find is marcus marcellus the conqueror of syracuse who lived a hundred and fifty years ago and he fought only thirtynine battles how remarkable i said fifty battles how many men had died in those battles how many had been maimed for life how many women and children had been enslaved fifty was a large round number it would look very impressive in caesars memoirs and heres another remarkable figure said meto he spoke in a hush he was excited to share his work with me and i was touched of course it isnt exact because making such a calculation presents all sorts of difficulties and possibilities for errorovercounting undercounting and so forthbut i did the best i could and i think i did a pretty good job a good job with what caesar asked me to calculate the number of those who died as a result of all his campaignswell those who were actually killed in battle not counting citizens who died from hardship and disease and such although we have some idea of that figure from the census he commissioned last year that shows the population of the city is only half what it was before the civil war only half i whispered half the population of rome wiped from the face of the earth anyway after i gathered all the information i could and sorted through all the various estimates the number i came up with was one million one hundred and ninetytwo thousand i wrinkled my brow what exactly does that number represent the number of people killed by caesar in his fifty battles how extraordinary i said though in fact the number meant nothing to me how could anyone grasp such a number i tried to imagine seeing the faces of all those who had died one at a time it was inconceivable no mortal could hold such a number in his head a great many people had died that was all one could say really apparently caesar agreed meto shook his head ruefully and after all that work all my careful calculations caesar has decided he doesnt want the number to appear in his memoirs can you imagine that actually i can i said quietly ah well that numbers likely to be superseded in the near future anyway said meto now that hes conquered the whole of the mediterranean its almost inevitable that caesar will look east and invade parthia that means mounting a huge expedition probably by way of egypt perhaps as soon as next year more battles to spoil that perfect round number of fifty i said yes many more battles and more deaths a great many deaths undoubtedly said meto exactly a year ago i had made a choice that saved caesars life thinking back to that moment i felt a twinge of something like regret how many more men would die before caesar breathed his last but in the next instant the feeling vanished for suddenly bethesda appeared with a broad smile on her face at the sight of meto she trembled with joy husband we can wait no longer its our turn now to welcome meto home a moment later they all came running into the gardendiana and davus and their squealing children eco and menenia and the goldenhaired twins silent rupa and the laughing slave boys those i loved were still alive and we were all together authors note our information about the triumphs of caesar in bc comes from various sources these are the principle citations appian roman history cassius dio roman history pliny natural history plutarch caesar suetonius augustus suetonius caesar regarding the exact dates of the triumphs the best supposition i have found is by chris bennett at his web site dealing with egyptian royal genealogy wwwgeocitiescomchristopherjbennett his notes on cleopatras sister arsinoe iv make the most clearly argued case i have read for determining the dates of the four triumphs our knowledge of the playwrights laberius and syrus and some fragments of their works can be found in the saturnalia of macrobius the satyricon of petronius suetonius caesar and some letters by cicero ad familia and ad atticus pliny tells us that syruss nickname was pigs paunch the king of the hill ditty in chapter xvi is adapted from horaces epistles arcesilaus the artist previously appeared in my short story the cherries of lucullus in the collection a gladiator dies only once plutarch caesar and appian tell us that the census commissioned by caesar found that the population of rome had been reduced by half as a result of the civil war pliny cites caesars fifty battles and provides the number of the dead mentioned by meto in chapter xxii while working on the triumph of caesar my favorite books by modern historians were arthur weigalls the life and times of marc antony g p putnams sons and jack lindsays marc antony his world and his contemporaries routledge these two authors never fail to stimulate and entertain for visual inspiration we can turn to one of the great masterpieces of the italian renaissance the triumphs of caesar a series of nine monumental paintings by andrea mantegna ca inspired both by literary accounts and by the collection of antiquities owned by his patrons the gonzaga family of mantua mantegna created one of the first major attempts to visualize the ancient roman world the paintings are on permanent display at hampton court palace in london erich gruen has speculated that the statue of cleopatra in the temple of venus genetrix was placed there not by julius caesar as appian explicitly states but later by augustus as a trophy after the queens defeat and death this is an eminently sensible idea nevertheless i prefer to take appian at his word caesars installation of the statue presents us with a puzzle to be sure but so do many actions taken by our own leaders because an act by say a president of the united states did not make sense to a reasonable person does not mean that the act did not take place i would suggest that the type of man who thinks he can rule the world is not by definition a reasonable man and the actions of such men inevitably leave us with vexed questions that defy sensible explanation by sensible historians gruens essay cleopatra in rome facts and fantasies can be found in myth history and culture in republican rome studies in honour of t p wiseman edited by david braund and christopher gill university of exeter press for reading and commenting on the first draft my thanks to penni kimmel and rick solomon for all his hard work high spirits and unfailing sangfroid my thanks to alan nevins my agent and my heartfelt thanks to my longtime editor keith kahla to whom this book is dedicated since the days of roman blood keith gordianus and the finders creator have gone through many trials and triumphs together caesar and his legacy present a complexity that mirrors that of our own times like gordianus i find myself endlessly fascinated by the man and endlessly perplexed the life of caesar provides generous inspiration to both the historian who deals in facts and the novelist who deals in the ironies and ambiguities of human existence and the tenuous nature of all knowledge
